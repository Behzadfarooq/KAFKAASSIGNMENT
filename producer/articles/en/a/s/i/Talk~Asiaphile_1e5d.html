<p>Let me give this a try. There are three Wikipedia entries to examine: <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asiaphilia.html" title="Asiaphilia">Asiaphilia</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanophile.html" title="Japanophile">Japanophile</a>, and <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_fetish.html" title="Asian fetish">Asian fetish</a>, plus <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asiaphile.html" title="Asiaphile">Asiaphile</a> (redirect page); and decide which to delete, leave alone, or merge. Can we agree that there are two fundamental differences here? On one side there is the socio-cultural issue of a non-Asian person with an interest in aspects of Asian culture such as music, food, people, movies. To my way of thinking this pertains to both the Asiaphilia and Japanophile articles. Now there is also <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_sexuality.html" title="Human sexuality">sexuality</a> side of it, <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_fetish.html" title="Asian fetish">Asian fetish</a>. One does not necessitate the other. Regardless of oneâ€™s own personal beliefs, the fact does exist that there are individuals who these terms do apply to. Looking at the history of the pages it seems obvious that these subjects incite some strong feelings by some users here. My conclusions are below, and I welcome any more eloquent member to amplify with their own thoughts.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asiaphilia.html" title="Asiaphilia">Asiaphilia</a></li>
<li><b>Merge</b> <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanophile.html" title="Japanophile">Japanophile</a> into <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asiaphilia.html" title="Asiaphilia">Asiaphilia</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_fetish.html" title="Asian fetish">Asian fetish</a></li>
<li><b>Change</b> <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asiaphile.html" title="Asiaphile">Asiaphile</a> (redirect page) to point to <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asiaphilia.html" title="Asiaphilia">Asiaphilia</a></li>
<li>Use the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup-verify_e98c.html" title="Template:Cleanup-verify">Template:Cleanup-verify</a> {{{cleanup-verify}}}</li>

<p>"An Asiaphile is a person with a sexual perversion" Nobody else have a problem with this? I think that perhaps using the word 'preference' in place of 'perversion' would be more appropriate, I feel it jepordises the neutrality of the article. "The term has a negative connotation" &lt;-- Because people use words like 'perversion' to describe it.</p>
<p><br />
user:Tkguy, I appreciate that you want to make the point that this word is sometimes used to imply an obsessive sexual desire for Asian people however, this is the secondary meaning of the word. This discussion is also better dealt with at the <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_fetish.html" title="Asian fetish">Asian fetish</a> page which actually covers this point. I have therefore toned down the language used and put it as a short secondary meaning. Finally please note that there have been a number of wikipedia arguments against using urban dictionary as a source because it lacks any authority <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickCwik_683c.html" title="User:NickCwik">NickCwik</a> 10:52, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>First off, I'm not sure, but the word might be a neologism, not even worthy of inclusion. Second, do we really need interjections of "Asiaphiles are dorks (and possibly perverts) who have no idea about hte culture they're obsessing with" after every single sentence? Isn't there a way to make this more neutral? I'm tempted to scrap the whole article, rewrite it in two or three sentences and stub it.<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomorrowTime_1e84.html" title="User:TomorrowTime">TomorrowTime</a> 17:24, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, here's how it goes. I trimmed the article down to bare essentials. I removed all the sexual and racial insinuations. Go vent your frustrations over mixed race couples or fat geeky perverts to <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_fetish.html" title="Asian fetish">Asian fetish</a>. I will remove all such additions to this article. Reasonable additions are more than welcome.</dd>
<dd>Also, I removed the Asian American category and stub. Asiaphile can refer to *any* non-Asian, not only American ones. Remember, Anglo-American focus is POV.</dd>
<dd>Frankly, I don't think this article should exist in the first place. But as long as it does, let's keep it straight, people. This is an encyclopedia, not a bashing ground. If you hate otaku or perverted old men buying mail-order brides, go find an appropriate internet forum and pour your hearts out there. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomorrowTime_1e84.html" title="User:TomorrowTime">TomorrowTime</a> 02:28, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Asiaphiles deal with the type of person who stereotype men and women of Asian culture. This is very, very different from those who study, know and involve themselves in Asian culture. Those people are something called cultural anthropologists and humans who want to learn truly to understand others. It's like saying racism doesn't exist nor acknowledging that racism can go into the other extreme. Or are you afraid to address an issue where people have filias towards certain culture? Where they become so enamored of the culture they fail to actually see the people involved in it. I have no issue with otaku. I do have an issue with men who think that all Asain women should be submissive and they want to marry one. However, I do think it's fair to say asiaphiles has a negative connotation, not a positive one. Cultural filias is just another form of stereotyping. Or are you not acknowledging that sort of thing? I've also heard the words that Asians are only good for Anime... so where do you want to place that one? If there can be Anglophiles, why not Asiaphiles? If this article called all white men Asiaphiles then it's POV, if it just says Asiaphiles tend to be cultural philias meaning they objectify and stereotype people of Asian decent, isn't that true? That's what the root of the words are saying. --<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHitsuji_Kinno_8c45.html" title="User:Hitsuji Kinno">Hitsuji Kinno</a> 06:41, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think we're not on the same wavelength here. I'm not trying to diminish stereotypes about Asians or deny the existance of Asian fetish. I have strong feelings about those, but my personal opinion counts for little on the article page. But what you and many others fail to see is the difference between "-philes" and philias. The way I see it, a "country-phile" is genuinely interested in a country and its culture, while a "country-philia" is a sexual inclination. There should be a clear-cut distinction between a Japanophile and a Japanophiliac.</dd>

<dd>The problem with the word "Asiaphile" is that it is NOT an umbrella term, encompassing the notions of "Sinophile", "Japanophile" "Koreaphile" or "Indophile", as one of the previous versions of the article suggested. Each of the other "-philes" is on a quest for better and deeper knowledge about the culture of their choice. A "country-phile" hopefully also respects the culture of the country in question. "Asiaphile" is, on the other hand, something of a contradiction in terms when seen through that optic. How can you hope to achieve better knowledge or respect for a culture, if you lump an entire continent together? How can you do those things, if you apparently make no distinction between China, Japan or Korea, between India, Indonesia or the Phillipines? So somebody who likes Asia because it's Asian can really not have much of an indepth knowledge about Asia. The word Asiaphile can only describe a person with a stereotyped notion of Asia, be it positive or negative, respectful or racist, sexist or not. Such a person can hardly be described as a "-phile". Such a person either has romantic (or other) stereotypes, or is an Asiaphiliac. Or both. That is why I think this term is a neologism. I think it doesn't belong. But nevertheless, as long as it is here, it might as well be a decent article, not the heap of rubish that it was before. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomorrowTime_1e84.html" title="User:TomorrowTime">TomorrowTime</a> 07:26, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree that this article was a horrible mess prior to the shortening. I have previously argued that to use the term Asiaphile to imply an Asia fetish is unhelpful (because it doesn't meant that) and is more appropriatly dealt with on that article's page [which is also a mess but at least it's a mess in the right place!].</p>
<p>Anyway, TomorrowTime, I had wanted disagree with your assertion that an Asiaphile is not an umbrella term encompassing someone who could properly be categorised as two or more of the other -philes. I do not believe that such a grouping is a stereotyping in the way you suggest and I will explain why...</p>
<p>First of all you might want to consider that if a person is drawn to particular aspects of, say, Chinese culture (i.e. A Sinophile) then that person is unsurprisingly going to be drawn to other countries that exhibit this particular traits. It is self-evident that a country does not exist in isolation and that any understanding of one country requires a broader regional view as countries bi-laterally interact and tend to share common features within a given geographical example. We might use the counter-example of a European country for example France &amp; Germany. While it is clear that these countries have many differences they also have a great deal in common. If we then look at Japan and China we can see that the first couplet are 'similar' when compared with the second 'couplet'. It is not an unfair stereotyping for a person to be drawn to similarities in these countries and it is also possibly to be interested in more than one country in a region at any one time.</p>
<p>Your distinction between the other -philes and Asiaphile is also artificial. We might equally say that the term Sinophile is a stereotyping in the same way as you argue Asiaphile is; in that Sinophile implies the similarity in all regions of China which are clearly not entirely accurate (i.e. a stereotyping of shared features from an external perspective in the same way as the couplets I discussed above). This does not devalue the term in the same way that the term Asiaphile still carries objective worth in the same way as, say, the term Anglophile.</p>
<p>Even from a totally pragmatic, non-theoretical viewpoint, you might notice that eminent Sinologists not infrequently develop expertise in in Japan as well; or that many people with an interest in Vietnam will also develop an interest in wider Indochina (Laos, Cambodia and even Thailand); often those with this kind of academic inhterest will have an interest in the entire Asia region even if they do not pursue this directly. Asiaphiles would be an acceptable description of these people whereas a country-specific term might be less useful. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickCwik_683c.html" title="User:NickCwik">NickCwik</a> 10:55, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
