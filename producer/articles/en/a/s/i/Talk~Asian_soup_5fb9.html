<p>If this article focuses on East Asian soups, the profusion of Korean soups should also be added. The problem is that some of them are fairly thick, approximating stews. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 07:05, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/i/Talk%7EAsian_soup_5fb9.html" title="Edit section: This article sucks">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">This article sucks</span></h2>
<p>I'm sorry, it really does, and here's why:</p>
<ol>
<li>As many already pointed out, for an article purported to be on "Asian soup", it seems to think the continent only consists of two countries. Korea, the Philippines, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietname, Thailand etc. are underrepresented.
<dl>
<dd><br /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>It is woefully incomplete and, gives a very misleading picture. For example, for "Chinese" it gives the impression that there are just three types of soup stock (pork, chicken, and a third which is mysteriously referred to as "Shandong", even though in many regions it may also be more commonly known as "superior stock"). But the fact is soup is more varied then the article suggests. Check out the article on <a href="../../../p/e/k/Peking_duck.html" title="Peking duck">Peking duck</a> and you'll probably find a mentioning of the duck bones being used to make soup for example. Fish and seafood too can be used to make soup. And don't forget the dessert soups like <a href="../../../a/z/u/Azuki_bean.html#Uses" title="Azuki bean">red bean soup</a> which obviously uses different ingredients from the typical savory soup, and indeed does not share the characterization of "umami" mentioned here due to its use for dessert. (Though to be fair, some of these "soups" aren't actually called soups in Chinese.)<br />
<br />
Also, in some types of Chinese cuisines, including <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cantonese_cuisine.html" title="Cantonese cuisine">Cantonese</a> but likely a few others, soups may be made from scratch without the use of stocks. The idea being that you pick a combination of ingredients and simmer it for a few hours; essentially the stock <i>is</i> the soup. It's quite possible in these slow-cook soups for chicken and pork to both be used for example, whereas this article gives the impression that it's either chicken or pork.
<dl>
<dd><br /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>The "Types" section is not about types of soups, it's more a bunch of soups thrown together, probably the ones the author happens to know or have seen/tasted. "Egg drop soup" isn't really a "type" of soup any more than "cream of mushroom" is. And again, the section is rather incomplete if it were to give a picture of the wide variety of soups in Asia (or even just specific countries of Asia). Perhaps "Examples" might be a better name for that section.
<dl>
<dd><br /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>I'm also not entirely sure how useful it is to have one article on Asian soup. No doubt the articles on the respective cuisines of the individual countries and regions will cover the soup from their respective cuisines. So this article is mainly useful perhaps for pointing out the few commonalities amongst Asian soups. So I think it's best to not include too much details. Things like the "Chinese" and "Japanese" section of soup bases are probably better off put into the Chinese and Japanese cuisine articles, though it might be possible to list a few examples of soup stock ingredients here and mention which cuisine uses each ingredient. It is a good idea to also emphasize the diversity within the same basic type of soup; for example the diversity in broth, noodles and ingredients for Asian soup noodles of different countries.</li>
</ol>
<p>Maybe I'll take a stab at rewriting this article when I have time. 24.19.185.92 03:56, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ha ha! I should add a SOFIXIT tag but I'll be lenient (this time). Seriously, though, none of us is perfect and we all can help improve articles others start. There's a limit to all of our knowledge. The article can probably be broken up among the various geographical regions of Asia as described above, and whatever you feel should be added, go ahead. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 04:00, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Good points made throughout, and yes the article does need a lot of work. The listings and descriptions are woefully incomplete and some of the section names are misleading, but that's how articles start. When I started this article the only thing I had in mind were savory soups, I've recently put up a sweet soup article at <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tong_sui.html" title="Tong sui">Tong sui</a>, so perhaps a link there would be good idea. I also wanted to scratch out a list of "mother stocks" where most "<i>Asian</i>" soups can be classified as subtypes, sorta in line to what Antonin CarÃªme did with <a href="../../../s/a/u/Sauce.html#Sauces_in_French_cuisine" title="Sauce">Sauces</a>. One thing I do disagree with your comments is what you say about cooks not using a basic "broth" or "stock". Although some cooks choose to use plain water for the base of their soups, I would say that most professionals would not dare to begin a savory soup without at least some sort of base, be it fish stock, duck stock, or whatnot unless the ingredients themselves are very strong in their umami taste. <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 07:25, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I did not say that they don't use a basic broth or stock, but rather than some types of soups don't need them. Refer to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cantonese_cuisine.html#Soup" title="Cantonese cuisine">Cantonese_cuisine#Soup</a>. Slow-cook soups don't have to start off with a stock because you are essentially creating the stock in the process of making the soup (which takes several hours in order to extract as much flavor as possible from the ingredients, much like how you'd make a stock from scratch). Of course, you can cheat a little and use a stock in place of water in most recipes, adjusting cooking time and seasonings accordingly if needed. And I don't doubt that restaurants will likely use at least a little stock in most of their soups, but then again many also use <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monosodium_glutamate.html" title="Monosodium glutamate">MSG</a> in their cooking. Refer for example to soup recipes given in <a href="http://www.wingtat.ca/recipe_index.php" class="external free" title="http://www.wingtat.ca/recipe_index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.wingtat.ca/recipe_index.php</a> (available in traditional Chinese and English); some starts off with water and others start off with stock. 24.19.185.92 12:17, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see what you are saying, I suppose the main difference is whether the stock is made prior to the soup or while the soup is being made. If you wish you can add that information into the intro. It's also sad but true that many restaurants choose to use MSG as actual soup base instead of as a <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flavour_enhancer.html" title="Flavour enhancer">flavour enhancer</a>, still it depends on the establishment and (IMO) no self-respecting restaurant will use only MSG in their stock since it is relatively easy to tell a primarily MSG soup when you taste it. <a href="../../../s/j/s/User%7ESjschen_9f6d.html" title="User:Sjschen">Sjschen</a> 22:09, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
