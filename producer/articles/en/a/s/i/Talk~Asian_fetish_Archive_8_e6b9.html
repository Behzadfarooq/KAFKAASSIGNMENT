<p>I have tried to reorganize the article into three distinct sections, one for each of the major meanings. While I have shortened some sections, I have <i>not</i> tried to change any important content or alter any arguments (even when I think they should be altered). If the passionate interests on either side disapprove, feel free to revert. However, I think this clarifies the 3-way disjunction a little. I do not think this means the article is done. Human Fetish's position has, IMHO, not yet been represented adequately, but this may provide a better place for that to happen. -- <a href="../../../g/n/e/User%7EGnetwerker_8fae.html" title="User:Gnetwerker">Gnetwerker</a> 17:21, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Gnetwerker -- who has formulated this "The term Asian fetish is a neologism that may appear in three distinct contexts"? <i>You should not draw conclusions yourself</i>. Please provide <i>any</i> respectable sources that explicitly states "'Asian fetish' is a neologism that may appear in three distinct contexts". Otherwise, I'd guess the writer just made that story up. / <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_chessplayer_5059.html" title="User:Fred chessplayer">Fred</a>-<a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFred_chessplayer_69d7.html" title="User talk:Fred chessplayer">Chess</a> 21:15, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't remember when <i>"neologism"</i> came into the article. It was <i>"slang term"</i>, then <i>"colloquialism"</i>, but people objected to those, then it became simply <i>"phrase"</i>, then someone recommended looking at another article (can't remember which one) that uses that turn of phrase, and it appeared here. Regarding <i>"three distinct contexts"</i>, I am probably the one who wrote that, or some version of it. It is an observation from the three competing points of view here -- each of which is cited in the subsequent article: the porno one, the Asian activist one, and the academic one. It is hard to see how you can object to that, it's a summary, after all. If you are concerned about the word <i>"distinct"</i>, then I could see a good argument there (they aren't completely distinct), so have at an edit. -- <a href="../../../g/n/e/User%7EGnetwerker_8fae.html" title="User:Gnetwerker">Gnetwerker</a> 21:23, 13 March 2006 (UTC) -- <b>Addendum</b>: <i>Neologism</i> came from the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">Creationism</a> article.

<dd>The term neologism is most apt, IMO. As to the statement that <i>Asian fetish</i> may appear in three distinct contexts, that seems to me to be a fairly straight-forward description. How else can one write an encyclopedia article than by describing the phenomenon at hand? <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunray_969d.html" title="User:Sunray">Sunray</a> 16:25, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see how that reorganization makes the article clearer; actually, it seems to do the opposite by obscuring the connection between overlapping domains of terminology. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 21:56, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your straight forwardness on answering my concerns.</dd>
<dd>My main concern is that I don't trust this three-way distinction. Why not make four distinctions? And who has made this disctinction in the first place? Unless some credible sources are quoted on this, this will just be constant NPOV dispute.</dd>

<dd>Yes, I agree with these comments. I think that the "three-way distinction" is just a way to try to bring order out of chaos. If someone can think of a forth distinction, perhaps it should be added. Or perhaps the three sections approach should be abandoned. I think that the key is to try to build on what others are doing. A lot of work has gone into trying to make this article better. It still has a ways to go, though. <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunray_969d.html" title="User:Sunray">Sunray</a> 17:37, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The consensus seems to be to leave the page in its current form. I personally think the page sucks, and that the majority of the problems of POV that arise are a result of confusion and overlap between the various definitions. However, if I am in the minority, so be it. The page has been largely stagnant -- in a state that outsiders consider not only POV but virtually unreadable -- for over 2 weeks (despite dozens of edits and vandalism reverts), so that was my impetus to be <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">bold</a>.</p>

<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>The organization of information does not normally have a citation, unless you believe that the organization itself presents a point of view. Other than straight anti-<a href="../../../r/e/d/Reductionism.html" title="Reductionism">reductionist</a> arguments (which is essentially what <a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> makes), the point of an article's organization is to make it clear to the reader, independent of the content; and</li>
<li>WRT to POV, this page has been in a constant state (more or less) of edit-warring ever since March 2005 -- over a year. Participants come and go, and wars are won and lost on the subjects of (e.g.) including purported information about the testosterone levels of Asian men, including putative anthropological evidence, and including lists of sex crimes allegedly committed as a result of Asian fetishes.</li>
<li>As it stands, the page predominantly takes the POV of Asian-American social activists, while giving some lip service to other points of view, and this is why breaking the page into three sections makes sense (to me, at least) -- it provides a structure around which to seek some balance between (e.g.) User:Human Fetishist's view and that of (e.g.) <a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a>.</li>

<p>However, above all, Wikipedia is consensus-driven, so (regrettably) I acknowledge the continued lack thereof, and (without regret and with respect) invite you to edit the page to improve it. -- <a href="../../../g/n/e/User%7EGnetwerker_8fae.html" title="User:Gnetwerker">Gnetwerker</a> 19:55, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Stereotypes of Asian womanhood-- Harry Potter: Wizard or Post-Colonial Asian Fetishist?</span></h2>
<p>The author of the Harry Potter series could have made things so much easier for Asian-American belly-achers by simply excluding Asians from her stories. Then they could have accused her of discriminating against Asians, case closed. And then when she <i>does</i> include an Asian character-- Cho Chang-- she doesn't even have the decency to give her any obviously stereotypical Asian traits! So what's a nit-picker to complain about??? Here we go:</p>
<p>"J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series features an Asian romantic interest named Cho Chang, a seemingly nonsensical combination of a Korean and a Chinese name[10]." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_fetish#Stereotypes_of_Asian_womanhood" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_fetish#Stereotypes_of_Asian_womanhood" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_fetish#Stereotypes_of_Asian_womanhood</a></p>
<p>This statement is scrupulously backed up by an opinion article which starts with the bold, and boldly nonsensical statement that, "Asian fans and readers of the book are looking critically at how Asian Americans fit into the Hogwarts world..."</p>
<p>Uh... Asians are concerned about how Asian AMERICANS fit in? Am I mistaken, or isn't Hogwarts in Britain? But let's let this slide. The standards for the "Asian fetish" article, obviously, are far too lofty for such nit-picking. Let's get right to the heart of the matter: "a seemingly nonsensical combination of a Korean and a Chinese name."</p>
<p>The writer of this opinion piece apparently doesn't know many Koreans, and the editors of the "Asian fetish" article apparently don't care enough about reality to check their sources. The simplest, most obvious thing would be to check a list of Korean names, wouldn't it? (Supposing, that is, you don't already know from personal experience that Cho (or Jo) and Chang (Jang) are both relatively common Korean names.)</p>
<p>Go here:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Korean_family_names#.E3.85.88" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Korean_family_names#.E3.85.88" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Korean_family_names#.E3.85.88</a></p>
<p>and look down the McCune-Reischauer column and you will find: Chang... and Cho. Very strange, huh?</p>
<p>But since we're in a rare fact-checking mode, let's take this one step further, and look at a list of Chinese names too. If you go here:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_Chinese_surnames" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_Chinese_surnames" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_Chinese_surnames</a></p>
<p>and look in the W-G (Wade-Giles) column, you will find: Chang... and Chou. (No, not an exact match, I'll grant you that.)</p>
<p>Now the writer of this opinion piece doesn't say this is a nonsensical combination of two Korean (or possibly Chinese) surnames. No, that wouldn't make Rowling sound like an ignorant, arrogant white colonialist, would it? Better to stretch the truth and say it's a nonsensical Korean/Chinese combination. After all, this isn't a serious piece of writing someone would actually use as a source for reference, is it? Who's going to notice?</p>
<p>Oops. Once again reality doesn't agree with groundless opinion. So which do we choose? For editors of the "Asian fetish" article, the choice is obvious: Groundless opinion.</p>
<p>And obviously, Rowling is <i>very</i> careful about not giving <i>other</i> characters nonsensical names, isn't she? She would never get away with giving her her <i>white</i> characters ethnically stereotypical names like, oh, "Igor Karkaroff" or "Seamus Finnigan." Instead she always gives them completely normal names like "Albus Dumbledore," "Professor Quirrell," "Percy Weasely," "Severus Snape," "Sirius Black," "Peter Pettigrew," "Cornelius Fudge," "Bellatrix Lestrange," "Neville Longbottom," "Draco Malfoy," and "Lord Voldemort," doesn't she?</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_%28character%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_%28character%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_%28character%29</a></p>
<p>Oooo! Doesn't the injustice just make your blood boil?&#160;;)</p>
<p>Ah... What's the point? This article is hopelessly POV and some of the editors are obviously intent on keeping it that way.</p>
<p>Gnetwerker, you seem interested in trying to do a genuinely NPOV rewrite of this article, so I'll accept your invitation to move over there and see if I can help you fix this mess, if it's even possible... which a survey of the literature has led me to doubt...

<p>Simple -- there is no reputable secondary source on this topic. Your quote poses a question, it does not propose substantially verifiable research. Adding that information in is no different than allowing the Asian fetish vandal's unsubtantiated information here. In any case, this is not primarily an article on stereotypes against Asians (IMHO it has far too much on that subject): it is about certain reactions to those stereotypes. The anti-Asian mail stereotypes are well-described. Adding the "penis size" canard to this paragraph does nothing but promote racism.

<p>I understand the point you are making, I just believe it to be incorrect. As of now, the article does not take a position on who started using the term in what way. It is clear, as I pointed out, that the term "fetish" as applied to pornography dates back at least to the 1960s (I am afraid I am not near a library at the moment and my reference sources are somewhat thin on the subject of porn, but in the fullness of time a source can be found). I think that a focus on Asians in porn dates back at least as far, and took a notable uptick during the Vietnam war (ibid). However, as none of this is sourced, it is not in the article, just as your contrary position is not. However, you youself supplied this quote:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Kim has argued that the stereotype of Asian women as submissive sex objects has ... fostered increased demand in ... ethnic-fetish pornography."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>So it would appear that the connection between "ethnic-fetish pornography" and Asian American social commentators is a sourced one. -- <a href="../../../g/n/e/User%7EGnetwerker_8fae.html" title="User:Gnetwerker">Gnetwerker</a> 06:25, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, if you didn't supply it, but have the reference to quote the page numbers, perhaps you can provide a direct quote. You removed the previously-used phrase "ethnic-fetish pornography".

<p>There is no reason to change "Academic terminology" to "Postcolonial terminology". First, the particular branch of academic theory is identified not only in the intro, but in the first sentence of the section. Second, most readers will not know what "Postcolonial" terminology is -- we need to label the section something much more straightforward. If there are candidates other than "Academic", please propose them, but putting in the name of an obscure sub-discipline of an itself obscure field is silly. As you, Wzhou, seem to consider yourself an expert on the subject, feel free to add properly sourced material to the section as you have done, but I think the clarity of the overall article will suffer it the academic discussion creeps out into the article as a whole.

<p>show that he never dealt with physical anthropology at all and it is questionable if he has enough knowledge about it as he maybe never had any contact with physical anthropology during his studies due to the Boasian elimination of the whole science in America.Infinity0 is a 16 year old Chinese boy who did not like the penis size statistics about Mongolids obviously. But wikipedia shall not serve any particular interests but the public. And gnetwerker , despite of his helpless own contradictory re-editing (!) and removing statements about racial paedomorphosis (s. article history, Wzhao533 informed us about it), seems to be a leftist not able to fully appreciate the anthropology section obviously due to reasons named by me before. Durova, the American soldier virago (according to her own statements), is of course against physical anthropology as the 21.century shall not be hindered to become the century of the dispossession of the male Whites.80.138.191.230 10:19, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Physical anthropology: 9 keep votes - however, Wzhao and I have both since changed our views to the section to DELETE; two users were from forums, and have not edited since; their votes to not count. That leaves 5 keep votes against 13 delete votes - 28% of votes. Gnetwerker did obviously not change as he re-edited the crucial statement about racial paedomorphosis recently but denying this later (see above).Wzhao533 informed us about it about 2 weeks ago stating again "that he never had anything against the inclusion of the material".</p>
<p>The role of testosterone: 6 keep votes - three of which are IPs, probably both you, one of the "forum users" from above, against 14 delete votes, one of which was the other "forum user" from above, giving 3 keep votes against 13 delete votes - 19% of votes.</p>
<p>So, it is not actually 40%, but 28% and 19% respectively, and all of the "keep" votes apart from you have since abandoned the discussion. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">infinity</span></a><b><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0"><span style="color:red;">0</span></a></b> 18:21, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Defending my views</span></h2>
<p>Wzhao533's (and he still hasn't anything against its inclusion)and my anthropology section are the only serious scientific part based on the highest authorities in the field. That infinityO evaluates and even denies the existence of Knußmann by counting google matches is ridiculous. Knußmann by the way is a strong leftist (believe or not) who strongly promoted animal rights, criticized nuclear power and was the president of the German Scientific Society (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) , the country's top (!) scientific association known worldwide where right-wingers never would be allowed.Furthermore , he was an important anthropological expert in the J.F.K. murder case who proved that two Watergate subverters (!) were possibly connected to the J.F.K. murder case.</p>
<ol>
<li>Mr. Rubenstein denies that I have read his writing about the Shuar, but he has no proofs. Of course, because I have read it.</li>
<li>Boasian anthropology is a kind of distorted sociology/history/politics. Physical anthropology has been dicredited by the mainly Jewish top Boasians which has been a great loss to science. Knußmann even was terrorized by leftists who were able to block his work misunderstanding him as he was a liberal like them.That someone categorizes races does not mean that he is a Neo-Nazi.</li>
<li>The wiki article "Mongoloid" written by wiki leftists is just doing this very same thing&#160;: giving racial types thus avoiding the correct names. It was not acknowledged when I improved this slightly. Once again: the leftist themselves are categorizing races but were angry when I wanted to improve this terminological hotch-potch a bit.This is contradictory.</li>
<li>Gnetwerker first rejected racial paedomorphosis , then re-edited it, then denied this again.This is self-contradictory and shows he is incredulous</li>
<li>Many comments were made by others about the undeniable facts of the Mongolids racial paedomrophosis ("go to a China town"), but everything was ignored by the leftists.</li>
<li>As America is to weak to maintain the European bridgehead , European science will become free again when China becomes the only superpower in the world in 35 years. A natural Eurasian alliance of the EU, Russia and China will end Anglo-Zionists dominance forever. As Han nationalism (Sinocentrism) is highly xenophobic ("Western foreign devils", thanks to the opium wars e.g.)which cannot be altered in the foreseeable future (even Aridou Debito's subversion has only superficial impact on Japan), the Chinese will not cooperate with Americans and Jews in the long run. The American subversion of China (Falun Gong is a CIA-controlled organization with its headquarters in New York (!),promoting a second Taiping revolt) will fail.Anglo-Zionists will perish themselves due to the sicknesses they generated for the "denazification" of the world. In the moment, everybody in China is free to write freely about anthropological Western viragos like Prasso (who is envious of Asian womanhood and femininity ), about the Boasian-Jewish manipulation of science as it is done e.g. on "bbs.chinadaily.com.cn" and the malign influence of Jews especially on the city of Shanghai. No country in the world is freer than China.That a state of 1.3 billion peoples must be ruled with an iron fist is a general necessity. Even the false Einsteinian relativity theory can be criticized in China which is nearly impossible in the West (space is no matter, but merely a category of perception as Kant stated correctly destroying the Einsteinian nonsense). And it can be written freely that China as one of the 5 autochthonous civilizations (Shang culture at the Huang Ho)) has a great racial potential.So I am no White suprematist, I am a Chinese (!)suprematist.</li>
<li>Truth cannot be found by democratic means. And it cannot be abolished or destroyed.Jewish power will decline in the long run. Mixing with gentiles, outcompeted by Asians (Harvard is a recent example) , population decline (3.5 millions in the US in 2050), rising Anti-Semitism in the West due to the leftist-induced impoverishing of the Whites and the Muslim atomic threat to Israel (Mossad experts admit remorsefully that they cannot control e.g. Iran in the long run) will further weaken them.Now the time has come for the glorious race of the Han. Jewish hate propaganda like "Sky captain and the world of tomorrow" cannot change this.</li>
<li>These geostrategist thinking is inspiring me to take the manichaistic notion of the eternal dualism into account again, the old Zarathustrian belief of the evil forces fighting with light.</li>

<p>Adorno was part of the "false life" despite repeating the interesting Zarathustrian dualism. Ximin, you felt not comfortable with some of the anthro stuff, but I also present the Nordic virago stuff which no normal White suprematists would do or acknowledge (on Skadinet by the way the biggest anthropological page on the net they hated it when someone introduce the virago stuff; of course in this case it wasn't me as the White suprematists' reaction were foreseeable).Additionally, I believe that especially the war losses of intellegence in Europe were considerable higher than in China where there were also of course huge losses of humans in the 20th century porducing a White-Chinese IQ ratio 100-106 (in contrast maybe to the racial basic dispositions). We should not sacrifice truth to consensus as it is the underlying not-mentioned basic principle of wikipedia.There can be also consensus on bull. You wrote , Ximin, that you want to study at a famous university. If you go e.g. to Harward you will recognize that Jewish professors and students are favouring each other irrespective of scientific qualities. As Jewish students have a mean IQ of 130 a basic quality is guaranteed of course. If you want to get to the top you should start just right now with me to alter the media and network with other Chinese who are maybe not prepared well-enough for the Jewish intellectual "invasion" of China. If ever Jewish Multi-Culturalism is established among the Han, China will perish.If you want your people and you to get high positions and outcompete the Jews who will do the same thing with China what they have done to the West then join us. There is no end in history as the Anglo-Zionists want to conquer space, too. It is not totally silly if an Iranian intellectual recently stated that the Jews want to conquer all the galaxies in the iniverse. Let us do real science. Einstein, Adorno,Derrida, Boas and Yahwe/God are subverters and diverters.Please don't adhere to them , Ximin. It will result in an ethic, financial and power catastrophe for you and your people&#160;!80.138.168.59 12:59, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Assistance Prof. Rubenstein (Athens, Ohio)is smear campaigning now (definitely&#160;!, see previous edit)-Don't feed the trolls&#160;!</b></p>
<p>(UTC)Ximin, Rubenstein is only a Jewish manipulator of science who will drive science out of China, too, by introducing thought control of the anthropological virago and race introducing the Boasian multi-culturalism, too (like David Aldwinckle in Japan), to start the Han's decline. While I have read his work about the Shuar online (pdf), he never made any attempt to read the Martin-Saller-Knußmann manual or Baker and denied the existence of the virago concept up to now in contrast to old Boasians like the Jew Ashley Montagu who propagated Mongolid racial paedomorphosis. Like me,Wzhao533 has nothing against the inclusion of the anthro sec he has written as it only presents " one line of reasoning ".Rubenstein is now smear campaigning showing his real face.And that he calls you a friend is grotesque. It is as grotesque as to call the Jewish people friends of the Americans or the Chinese as the Jews ghettoized themselves in America up to now after Irish, English, Germans and Russians have been assimililated for centuries , destroying Irak now(Ximin, and please acknowledge that Jewish Neocons are leading this war like the "denazification" of the whole world). They now want to eat Eurasia finally, the "earth island". Replace the word "America" by "the Jews and their American helpers" in the books of Brzezinsky , then you have it.As the Jews feel that they are under pressure from China they make anti-Asian and anti-German propaganda just like in "Sky captain and the world of tomorrow".Nothing has changed, Ximin. While you know that I have a deep insight into Asian matters , Rubenstein even has no insight into easy matters of physical anthropology. While Rubenstein presents the Shuar in a positive light who lack any Western universal ethos to show indirectly the white man how superfluous his culture is, other Jews present Chinese and Germans as monsters in "Sky captain and the world of tomorrow"" by this Dr. Totenkopf &amp; Chinese robot puppet bull.Ximin, if you want you and your people to be happy, rich and powerful, then think about my words again, please. 80.138.185.124 10:39, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
