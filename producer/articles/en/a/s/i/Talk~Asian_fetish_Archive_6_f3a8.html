<p>The entire previous talk page has been archived. Since this talk page was getting both long and ridiculous, it is obviously in the benefit of all parties involved to start from scratch. What I wanted to do now was to do a AfD style voting system for both the <b>Physical anthropology</b> section and the <b>Testosterone</b> section. If you don't know how this works, please see the archive for the AfD for <b>Asian fetish</b> located here: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Asian_fetish_1d24.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Asian fetish">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Asian_fetish</a>. Since the article will likely not be unlocked until this dispute is settled, I think the only way to handle this situation is democratically.</p>
<p><i>Also, everyone should remember to be civil and stay on topic. Please stick to voting, and do not let the discussion go out of control. I also hope that those of us who know how this works can help out those who do not.</i> --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 05:08, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>As I said, there is to be no more arguing over the sections, and definitely no more personal attacks. All the relevant points for all sides have already been made in the fifth archive. Please restrict your comments to straightforward voting.</b> --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 04:49, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: The groundrules for this vote are set out in <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7EConsensus_8a50.html" title="WP:Consensus">WP:Consensus</a> and <a href="../../../c/s/_/WP%7ECS_79c7.html" title="WP:CS">Current surveys</a>. I've registered this as a poll on the latter page. Not all the rules for AfD apply to this sort of poll. For example, it doesn't have to be closed by an administrator but can be closed by the initiator (<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a>). I propose that the closing date be one week from when this poll was started. Since it was initiated February 3 at 21:08, that would mean closing on February 10 at 21:08 {UTC). <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunray_969d.html" title="User:Sunray">Sunray</a> 18:39, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Several notes. First, it is unnecessary and counterproductive to point out what a voter's contributions have been or to conjecture what that voter may or may not be; anybody could arrive at such a conclusion anyway. Second, this is not an AfD for the article itself; if you believe that the article should be deleted, please read through the original AfD beforehand. Third, we'll continue to remove anything that either has been said before in an archive or does not directly relate to the material that is being discussed; simple comments about someone's vote are okay, but lengthy arguments over how a user voted is not okay. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 00:24, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> The anthropology section is inherently racist. If you accept the logic of this section, ie, that Asian men are naturally passive and feminine, then that means that you believe that Blacks are inherently violent and aggressive as well. Isn't that the logical extension of this argument? If some races are just "naturally that way", then what happens when you apply that standard to other races? So let's just trot down this path and say that Asians are passive, Latino's are lazy, Jews are cheap, and Blacks are aggressive brutes. Why not?

<li><b>comment</b>: assistance professor Steve Rubenstein is a Jewish-American professor from Ohio who opposed my contributions (unique on the web) on "virago", too. But just as the anthropological contents of "Asian fetish", "virago" has been a major concept since 3700 years at least, analyzed scientifically in detail since the end of the 19th century in the beginning of anthropology as a distinct science (e.g.the world-famous Hartmann laws, Otto Weininger (M-F-line), Martin-Saller-Knußmann manual setting the world-standard since 1914, Meyer's Konversationslexikon ).The concept of tendentiously Lesbian masculine viragos dates back to the Babylonian "salzikrum" concept in the Codex Hammurapi 1700 B.C..

<li><b>KEEP</b> The section on testosterone is really the only one worth keeping. Hormones and hormonal levels are at the basis of all human behavioral patterns. Testosterone is the very reason for the sexual nature of male - female interaction (and essentially all human interaction). Masculine and mentally-functional men seek feminine women, and feminine and mentally-functional women seek masc<b>Bold text</b>uline men. Both male and female East Asians are relatively sexually immature compared to Caucasians and Blacks. This need not be supported by studies. Go to any Chinatown in the world and you will see 20 year old men and women who look like 15 year olds by Caucasian or Black standards. Greater femininity in Asian women due to lower levels of androgen makes them appealing to non-Asians. Asian (Mongoloid) men are frequently not selected by Asian (Mongoloid) women when given a choice that includes the typically more masculine non-Asian men. Merely because East Asians (Mongoloid) visitors here feel offended by the truth about the lower testosterone levels in Asian men and lower androgen levels in Asian women is not a valid reason to censor a Wikipedia page. Wikipedia should not allow censorship as though this is Google in authoritarian China. -- <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 69.22.236.25 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.22.236.25_b869.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.22.236.25">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

If you are objective and disregard any personal feelings you may have about the subject matter, you must admit that the section is much more rational and encyclopedic than the previous parts of the article dealing with anecdotal accounts of individual possible asiaphiles and reviews of movies. The critics here seem to put their personal feelings above article quality and want this to just be a hit piece that fits their own identity politics agenda.

That Mr Phil and I have an "entente cordiale" concerning our Weltanschauung does not change this fact.Your only hypothesis is that there cannot be two anti-Boasians in one German region.Any good detective would assume in contrast that the wikipedia in general is one hotspot of serious critics on numerous subjects.First, we are not in the same region, and second there are thousands of "stealth scientists" in Germany sharing our views while not publicly announcing them due to the suppression of free thought.My campaign will never stop, all of my scientific contributions are first class independent from your acknowledging them. The brazen ignorance of my vote or the brazen deletion of the section on "Asian fetish"will further escalate the conflict.Numerous others also without my group support me due to the quality and usefulness of my contributions (e.g. my introducing the biggest critical work ever on Einsteinian relativity to the web within a global player like Wikipedia).It will be a very hard task for you to suppress free speech from now on.Either this article will be without bias, or it will be deleted and blocked completely as "virago" after my introducing serious anthropology.And this will go on endlessly this way.80.138.190.9 20:47, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>To me, the main problem with this article is that it lacks a proper foundation. The question should not, at bottom, be whether something is good or bad, or whether one writer likes it and another writer does not. An objective article should endeavor to explain what is really going on.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Money_ac35.html" title="John Money">John Money</a> has an interesting and useful concept that applies here. It is a concept based on research into sexual preferences. One view of sexual preferences is that all men are attracted to all women. Some men assert that they are, indeed, sexually attracted to all women. Even in those cases, I think that most people who make that claim would also claim to have a discriminating sense of the relative desirability of various possible sexual objects. Money explores the kinds of discriminations that humans make in their choice of sexual objects, from the ordinary and expected range of likely choices to the extreme range of odd choices that are called paraphilias. He maintains that the formation of an individual's <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love_map.html" title="Love map">love map</a> is a highly contingent process. In the unproblematical cases an individual learns to evaluate potential mates on the basis of factors that can be objectively tied to future reproductive success and accompanying social success. As they mature, humans learn to determine who among their cohorts behave in ways that promote both their own success and the success of other, and also determine who among their cohorts are likely to get themselves and/or others into trouble. They then presumably ought to tend to pick mates with whom they will be compatible and with whom the rest of the community will be compatible. But sometimes the normal course of development is wrenched violently from its normal course by some (usually singular) event, and the individual learns to be highly attracted by certain unsual sexual objects. One of Money's most interesting examples is the case of a man he describes as suffering from "formicophilia." To make a long story short, a young man was violently interrupted by his father's hickory stick while having his first intercourse in a situation in which insects happened to be crawling over his body. He had been oblivious to the insects while involved with the young lady, but ever after he could only achieve sexual arousal if he allowed many insects to crawl over him.</p>
<p>Nothing so dramatic as a thrashing being administered during the time of initial orgasm to establish a life-long preference for a kind of lover that people whose lives had taken other turns might consider odd. The main thing that appears to be involved is <b>what something means</b> to the individual. What has one learned to expect when one meets a person exhibiting certain characteristics? If a white face means yet another member of a group that has systematically sought to trample one down, a member of the opposite sex belonging to that group may not be the obvious first choice as a potential sexual partner. If a member of a group that is "alien" and therefore not associated with prior abuse, or a member of a group that is friendly and openly accepting of one's sexual nature, comes on the scene at a time when one is sexually needy, that could conceivably be enough to establish an initial lowering of the mating threshold. Success in intercouse after a perhaps lifelong period of lack of any social success would surely be an enormous positive reinforcement, a clear path to learning that the "alien" sexual parter was a desirable one.</p>
<p>I am not suggesting that the article be written on the basis of my memories of Money's books (and one on love maps in particular), but that sources of information on what makes one person sexually/romantically/erotically attractive to another be researched and that they provide the foundation for the article. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_%C3%A9%E2%80%A1%E2%80%98_3161.html" title="User:Kim é‡‘">&amp;#37329; (Kim)</a> 06:31, 6 February 2006 (UTC) (金）</p>

<dd>The issue is not whether you or I like John Money. The objective should be to improve the article. One subject of research interest is how sexual attractions are formed. A subset of that research would involve the question of whether some people form preferences for Asians (or Africans, or whatever), and, if so, what process or processes lead to that preference.</dd>

<p>I made this admittedly arbitrary decision because we already decided (see Archive 4) that the article will only take a sociological (specifically postcolonialist) viewpoint, and would not discuss any psychological literature. The reason given was that the term "Asian fetish" is only used in sociological terms in published literature, and not in psychological terms, hence making any discussion of psychological literature inherently original research. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 19:45, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The content that needs to be discussed is neither "psychological literature" nor is it "colonialist." It is sociological in the sense that an individual's sexual preferences are not formed exclusively by genetics (else all XY individuals would presumably chase only XX individuals and vice-versa), and are not formed by mental processes that occur in a social vacuum. The instances of sexual preference formation that are easiest to trace are ones that trace back to some kind of intense social interaction and carry the imprint of that social interaction into later life. One characteristic of sexual preference formation that warns against simplistic explanations based on so-called "race" or class is that sexual preferences are not simple "on" or "off" reactions based on those broad categories. We are not prohibited from thinking about what goes into an article. In fact we need to think about what goes into an article because otherwise we could not achieve balance and would end up with an article that supports one POV.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The assertion that "'Asian fetish' is only used in sociological terms in published literature" is too vague a formulation to be a proper subject for discussion or debate. If the intent was to claim that "Asian fetish" is a term that is only used in sociological literature, then the burden of proof is too extreme to be sustained. There will always be the possibility that some professional who is not a sociologist, like Milton Diamond for instance, will use the term in a discussion on sexology.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Hopefully the level of discourse on this subject among professional sociologists is higher than what is present in the current article. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_%C3%A9%E2%80%A1%E2%80%98_3161.html" title="User:Kim é‡‘">金 (Kim)</a> 06:32, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, I'm going to assume that you're trying your best, but the problems start at the very beginning:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The term "Asian fetish" is a colloquialism used in the United States and Canada for an unusual or extreme sexual attraction of a non-Asian, typically a white man, to Asian women, primarily East Asians (such as Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Taiwanese).</dd>
</dl>
<p>I dispute this definition. If Asian fetish were an "unusual or extreme" sexual attraction, then it would be considered deviant behavior, which it is not. On the other hand, you might think that removing the phrase is sufficient, but then Asian fetish is not just any sexual attraction. At any rate, if it were that easy to define Asian fetish correctly, then we wouldn't be having lengthy debates on the rest of the article. My personal viewpoint is that it is pointless to write an article on a term that is not defined correctly at the very beginning. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 08:05, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, the original article used "intense". I am not sure why that is better. The definition of the word "fetish" implies "unusual" (actually "irrational or abnormal"<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fetish" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fetish" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>). It is clear from the page that part of the dispute is that some consider it abnormal, and some unfairly stereotype normal interracial relationships with this term. Hence both are in the intro. If there is a widely-accepted definition, I would think it would be there by now. Failing that, the page needs to start with all of the viewpoints. -- <a href="../../../g/n/e/User%7EGnetwerker_8fae.html" title="User:Gnetwerker">Gnetwerker</a> 08:13, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, I should point out that you are a partisan in this, having written the detailed, interesting, but <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original</a> Physical Anthropology section.

<p>My best and honest recommendation to you is that you read <a href="http://bad.eserver.org/issues/1998/41/wray.html" class="external text" title="http://bad.eserver.org/issues/1998/41/wray.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a> before thinking about Asian fetish per se any further. As the author explains, the term <i>fetish</i> can be used in three different contexts. This problem extends to <i>Asian fetish</i>, which is an odd conflation of all three contexts into one term that I personally have yet to fully understand. When I do understand the interplay between the three, then I will put it into the article, but until then I am hesitant to do so. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 08:22, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have read the article you cite and do not believe that it has any special bearing on this article. The cited article contains a cogent discussion of the three dictionary definitions of the word "fetish", only one of which applies here (unless one believes that people are literally objects in this discussion), with an opinion piece ("Enjoy Your Fetish") wishing for the de-stigmatism of some kinds of fetish and the creation of a notion of "commodity fetish" (i.e. over-consumption of resources, etc). With minor exceptions, the article is about <i>fetish objects</i>, for which a near-synonym might be "totem". My 3-year-old's treasured plush toy is, in this sense, a "fetish object". But, regardless of the merits of that author's position, that article is entirely silent on race in general (though the author is a PhD candidate in Ethnic Studies), and "Asian fetish" in particular.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think it can be reasonably claimed that the "Asian fetish" is either "an object believed to have supernatural power" or "a non-sexual object that abnormally excited erotic feelings". We are dealing exclusively with the definition involving "irrational" or "abnormal" attraction or devotion, and apparently also the conflation of such an abnormal attraction (if it in fact exists in high numbers) and unfair stereotyping of normal interracial relationships (by whichever "side" might have a reason to do so). So, honestly, I think the rewrite is an improvement, though being associated with this whole thing at all -- even in trying to moderate -- is becoming more distasteful by the minute. -- <a href="../../../g/n/e/User%7EGnetwerker_8fae.html" title="User:Gnetwerker">Gnetwerker</a> 08:52, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it is interesting to note that in all the talk pages, not one contributor has been an Asian woman -- the target of Asian fetishism.

Second, the existing published literature that I sourced could, at best, be called <i>tangential</i> to the apparent underlying <i>sexual</i> fetishism implied in this article.

<dd>Writing about postcolonial research is hard. There's no question about that. The problem here is that we really need to assume that the reader has mastered Said's <i>Orientalism</i> as a prerequisite to understanding racial fetishism, which is of course unreasonable. But on the other hand, one cannot discuss postcolonial literature at all without reference to Said.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Let me suggest to you Suren Lalvani's article entitled "Consuming the Exotic Other" which attempts to connect commodity fetishism to sexual desire for the "Other" that Bhabha explores. The basic idea there is that in the Romantic consumer culture of Western Europe, "la femme orientale" is objectified as a commodity, and then consumed as a sexual object. Hence the commodity fetishism. The sexual element is definitely present in many discussions of racial fetishism.</dd>

<p>If you'd like something a general reader can digest, try David Henry Hwang's introduction to his play, <i>M. Butterfly.</i> It's somewhat intertextual with Puccini.

<p>Let me suggest alternatively that Wikipedia cannot (and should not) "assume the reader has mastered (insert your text here)". WP is not a philosophical monograph, it is an encyclopedia. I consider myself to be a (better than average) educated individual/generalist, and these arguments are at the edge of my ability, and very far past my interest. WP should not be cutting-edge philosophical research, but basic and widespread knowledge. Thus I suggest we find a simpler paradigm to explain. This is not meant to diminish the value or validity of the underlying research and theory -- just to constrain the domain for the generalist. Perhaps we need a Wikipedia policy: Wikipedia is not a post-graduate seminar. -- <a href="../../../g/n/e/User%7EGnetwerker_8fae.html" title="User:Gnetwerker">Gnetwerker</a> 08:57, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Gnetwerker, in fact there is already plenty of post-graduate work on Wikipedia not constrained to the generalist. You can take a look at pages like <a href="../../../p/e/r/Permanent_is_sharp-P-complete_5537.html" title="Permanent is sharp-P-complete">Permanent is sharp-P-complete</a> or the <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immerman-Szelepcs%C3%A9nyi_theorem_4d15.html" title="Immerman-Szelepcsényi theorem">Immerman-Szelepcsényi theorem</a>, which obviously assume mastery of something like Papadimitriou's <i>Computational Complexity</i>; or the <a href="../../../e/r/d/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Ko%E2%80%93Rado_theorem_aeda.html" title="Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem">Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem</a> which assumes familiarity with something like Jukna's <i>Extremal Combinatorics</i>. (At least those are the texts from which I learned those results.) But I don't understand why philosophy and sociology should be held to a different standard. There's plenty of generalist mathematics available on WP as well as highly techincal and cutting-edge research; why can't the same be done for the humanities and social sciences? --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 00:22, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would think here was a distinction to be made between broadly-accepted and "provable" theorums in mathematics and computer science (which happen to be my fields of expertise), and controversial philosophical theories espoused by a small handfull of academics. Further, a page devoted solely to an academic discussion of such a theory might be acceptable, but the cross between discussion of a (putative) pop-culture phenomenon that is controversial and such an emerging field is, clearly, the cause of the wars surrounding this page. The discussion of Marxist "consumer fetishism" and its analog in race portrayal, in a truly academic context and couched in terms that show the fringe/emerging nature of the argument would, I suspect, elict more light and less heat. -- <a href="../../../g/n/e/User%7EGnetwerker_8fae.html" title="User:Gnetwerker">Gnetwerker</a> 01:48, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Respectfully, which controversial philosophical theories do you object to including? David Henry Hwang wrote a notable Broadway play about Western sexual/racial prejudices regarding China. The play was partly a critique of Puccini's opera. Edward Said's <i>Orientalism</i> has been widely influential in academia and, if included, could probably be summaried in a couple of sentences. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 02:15, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_fetish_rewrite_6e28.html" title="Asian fetish/rewrite">rewriting</a> the page, I was shocked at how much latent POV is in there. I don't mean facts -- I am not qualified to judge their <i>per se</i> accuracy. The article is laden with phrases like "huge disparity" (vs. simply "disparity"), "activists allege", U.S. media "constantly portrayed" (vs. "portrayed"), a danger to "innocent white women" (vs. guilty ones?), "critics contend", "the irony is" (in an encyclopedia article!), "today the biggest critics ... are generally Asians", while "others adopt a more egalitarian view". It is astonishing, and this is leaving out the giant sections identified above (anthropolicy, sex crimes, etc) which appear to be someone's POV, but certainly NOR.</p>
<p>A bigger problem is that virtually none of the bald-faced statements in the article have real citations. "The Joy Luck Club ... is strongly disliked by many Asian organizations" Is this actually true? If so, there should be a citation. "asian fetish is suggested as an explanation for the (census) disparity" -- by whom? You would think that, in the course of gathering 5 full archive pages of talk, there would have been some actual citations stuck in there.</p>
<p>I don't want to get in between the warring factions here (probably too late), but if the page must exist, it needs to be a short, succinct page of widely-agreed upon facts, with the incipient social research carried on somewhere else. -- <a href="../../../g/n/e/User%7EGnetwerker_8fae.html" title="User:Gnetwerker">Gnetwerker</a> 08:08, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If my comment is censored again , it will enhance the conflict furthermore. The article on "virago"will be re-established as soon as possible as it is necessary to inform people about the racially very masculine Western women compared to the Mongolids (e.g. Martin-Saller-Knußmann manual).80.138.193.152 22:04, 10 February 2006 (UTC) The universal history of the virago comes back to you.From the Babylonians to the Jewish trash comic industry and its virago icon "Wonderwoman", "the subconscious, elaborately disguised desire of (gayish&#160;;addition by author) males to be mastered by a woman who loves them". As 20th century's leftism and feminism have essentially Jewish key players (cf. Kevin MacDonald and www.jwa.org), of course the Osteuropid "Wonderwoman" fighting against the evil Nazis (Remake 2007 (!)) is effective,too, in weakenening male European society. As a curiosity , the Christian legend of the collaboration between the "Red Jews" and the "amazons" has foreseen this unholy collaboration of a hostile elite and Europid manlike viragos.God bless them.80.138.193.152 22:53, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I find it interesting that you make a point of mentioning people's Jewish ancestory at every opportunity. That's 3 times in the above paragraph alone. What does the "Jewish trash comic industry" have to do with Asian Fetish? And why do you think this article on Asian Fetishism is "weakening male European society"? You have a knack for obfuscation. Anybody can talk like an encyclopedia, but you are trying to expand the scope of this article in directions that are wildly inappropriate and inapplicable.</dd>

<dd>The only "conflict" I see here is your obsession with race-based behavior and the Jewish race. You never answered my question: Why do you think that "Jews are trying to control Wikipedia"? You've made this claim several times already and have yet to address it. And if human behavior can be determined by race (ie, "passive Asians"), then what happens when you start applying that logic to other races? ie, "violent blacks" or "lazy Latinos". How is this not fundamentally racist? OneViewHere 23:51, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you call someone who sees massive evidence in the literature for the inequality of the races on average , then I am a racist. How to deny Baker , MacDonald , Harpending , Rushton , Martin-Saller -Knußmann evidence&#160;? The world is deep to the core a world of materialistic phenomena. Man is an animal biologically. Why not apply science with the highests possible rigour to him? Was v. Eickstedt big optimism concerning psychometry overexaggerated&#160;? And why not criticize the asocial behaviour of a tiny minority within a minority&#160;? What I wrote was descriptive. And If-Then possibilities. If the West wants to survive , then it should do this and that according to scienctific evidence.It is hard for you to believe,but I am not anti-Semitic. I am not interested in Nordic racial preservation.The influx of feminine elements is the best thing what could happen. Neo-Nazi Kevin B. MacDonald's funny Nordic virago preservation is shit and 100% impossible. In 2100, the yellow race will dominate the world I am happy with that very much as you certainly can imagine by now. I praise the day when 60% of the American population is Asian , 30% Black and 10% White. Come in, Africans, come in ,Asians, and make the viragos die out . I wish for that no virago exists any more by the peaceful lack of reproduction of them which is 100% sure.And if gene technology creates them again, I will create real females in the laboratory, two keels for one. 80.138.142.102 03:27, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Closure of Voting</span></h2>
<p>Voting for the two disputed sections has closed. There seems to be an overwhelming majority of users who want the Testosterone section closed. So that passes. As for the physical anthropology section, it looks like (ignoring strength) 8 votes for keep and 11 for delete. However, two of those votes are by users who cannot be considered regular users. If we discount those two votes (User:Heaven's Knight and User:Lycheng) then it looks like we have a clear majority for delete.</p>
<p>Given that I wrote the physical anthropology section and given that I do know who the two voters are outside of Wikipedia, I will pass the final decision on the section to <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPathoschild_c32f.html" title="User:Pathoschild">User:Pathoschild</a>, since he is an impartial administrator, as that would be in the best interest of all parties. --<a href="../../../w/z/h/User%7EWzhao553_99ad.html" title="User:Wzhao553">Wzhao553</a> 04:55, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've been asked to look at this. First, remember that we don't straightforwardly vote in this sort of case, but try to achieve consensus. In so far as the poll has the effect of a vote (in that it justifies action), the reasons and arguments offered are as impoortant. For example, I tend to give little if any weight to someone who just writes "delete" or "keep" without a reason. Secondly, and relatedly, we're not just counting up votes to see if there's a simple majority (and when we <i>are</i> looking for majorities, something significant is needed; 11–6 is on the borderline — over a third of participants want to keep the section.</dd>
<dd>Looking at the discussion and "votes" together, though, I'd say that the two sections should clearly be deleted. The overt racism on the keep side is unpleasant, but not a key factor; what counts is that the reasons for deletion are well made, and appeal correctly to Wikipedia policies on original research and NPoV. There are also some suspicious new participants on the keep side, and the central rôle played by anons doesn't help.</dd>
<dd>I'll check to see what the situation is with regard to carrying out this sort of decision on a protected page, and come back when I've got the information. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 18:28, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Racist Garbage, This Whole Article Should Be Deleted</span></h2>
<p>The entire article is based on a string ignorant racist stereotypes presented without being logically examined. The article is the work of people working hard, but barely managing to conceal their own ignorance, jealousy and hatred. An article as baseless in fact, and as obviously purely opinion-based as this one has no place in a site pretending to be any sort of serious encyclopedia.</p>
<p>If Wikipedia allows this garbage to stand, neo-Nazis should be allowed to post articles on how Jews destroy societies, and how to identify them through skull-measurement; Japanese right-wingers should be allowed to post justification for the actions of their military during the '30s and '40s, flat-earthers should be allowed to present their view as a valid opinion. All of this idiocy can be "supported" by "evidence" written by quacks with as much authority in their fields as the ones cited in this article.</p>

Once again, if you support race-based behavior, (ie, Asians are "naturally feminine and passive", then how is that different from saying that "blacks are violent" or that "Jews are greedy"? It's the SAME reasoning and I still haven't heard you address this yet. Until you address this logical fallacy I will assume that you are avoiding the issue to avoid being seen as racist, -which should by now be obvious to even the most casual reader of this discussion.OneViewHere 18:29, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Please tell us again how "Jews are trying to control Wikipedia" and that "leftist feminists are ruining European man". You must be quite the cut-up at parties....

<p>Read in the archives of this page my views on Judaism and the Negrids, I will not repeat them again, but I know , you like it so much to hear it again live.- You don't respect the will of 40% of the voters ,this could be labeled a dictatorship as the wikipedia should be open to all views if they are scientifically well-grounded.And their is no higher authority than the Matin-Saller-Knußmann manual settin ght eworld standard since 1914 (4th rev. ed. 1996). Furthermore you spread anti-multicultural propaganda.If there would be no Prasso hate campaign, then one could say, okay, the leftists nonsense does not do any short-term harm , but here a major group of at least ten million people worldwide is attacked due to all too obvious reasons for nothing.On some web threads , you can read about young Eurasian women who are suffering obviously from this leftist-inspired discrimination against them as pervert Caucasians' bastards .Now you will answer of course , MacDonald attacks the Jews,too,but no ,he doesn't , he only states scientifically that some Jews had a major negative impact on the West which is obviously essential in its failure.The virago Prasso and hundreds of millions of other viragos have an envy and hatred of the Europid universal civilization and its achievements. However, viragos have not directly contributed essentially to civilization , but have been idealized in the Jewish controlled media (Wonderwoman remake 2007).And in addition to Kevin B. MacDonald's essentially right conclusions, Jewesses were essential in the success of the second and third wave feminists.And it is a scandal that Steve Rubenstein denies the existence of the anthropological concept of the virago and the existence of several hundred millions of viragines worldwide abusing his academic position. Simply put , one cannot understand womanhood without the notion of the anthropological virago and its racial implications, neither Goddess Kali, Mother Mary , queen Neithhotep nor Abu Graibh's torture Harman.At the moment , I'm calculating how many American and Vietnamese lives could have been saved if the will of the Vietnamese people had not been underestimated by Boasian war anthropologists.Furthermore,it is estimated that 20% of all sexual abuses are committed by viragines,e.g.But as the judges see them as "women", they often -enough get mild sentences.Or look at the porn industry: 95% virago actresses.Viragos often-enough act as aggressive she-wolves, yes "she-wolves " without any compassion for anything.Harman's and Lynndie England's pics show this reality of the Nordic virago which is the uncrowned "queen" of viragodom.Of course , of course , the Boasians will show that Lynndie England has been a product of Texas's special acceptance of violence being one of the five cultural sectors in the US according to Geoffrey Gorer's "Americans".Or, let's say, google the women delinquents' pics on the net in different US counties. All viragos.You leftists are a deadly threat to the West in my opinion which will be clearly seen one day in retrospect as t h e biggest destruction in human history.Then hundred millions of people will begin to think about the MacDonald stuff and how it could be possible that such a fantastic flourishing civilization of Beethoven , Mozart ,Goethe and Aristotle could be destroyed by a minority. 80.138.168.55 23:35, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So, you think the media is a "Jewish controlled media", in addition to believing that Wikipedia is "controlled by Jews".&#160;:Sometimes when you give someone enough rope..... OneViewHere 15:43, 18 February 2006 (UTC)&lt;/nowiki&gt;</dd>

<p>You really think that the billionaires, politicis, states ,armies, races are benign to one another &#160;? You don't think you are naive ("the 2003 textbooks say there are no races" etc. etc. )&#160;? As long as you not accept the truth , you can be compared to children thinking the elders will care for them , but they do not.The media are so free and not controlled by minorities! Hahaha. The world is ruled by pseudo-intelligent,feminine, choleric-sanguine,sick and egotistic people not fit for any deeper scientific and ethic reasoning totally brain-washed by their own propaganda. The leaders of the West e.g. will be made responsible for their weakness and stupidity not stopping the West's death struggle.There is no free speech in Europe, the old concepts as the virago concept and the Hartmann laws are ridiculed by androgynous leftists worldwide.But you can take for granted that maybe the patient "The West" dies, but some of its leftist malign "doctors" will perish, too.You are and stay herd people mainly maladapted to your natural interests , this is your providence according to the Laplace laws.For infinity0 , one could suggest that instead of tuning in the leftist song it would be better if he would enter Chinese politics and appreciate the strenght of sinocentrism instead of multiculturalism which does not serve his interests. For Mr. Rubenstein , one could suggest that the Boasian manipulations should be a bit more sophisticated not denying the existence of the virago concept itself.Whenever someone like me would establish in Harvard or Athens, it would be difficult for him to maintain these lies about biology. Rushton, MacDonald and Harpending are only the vanguard, others will follow, greater thinkers. Whenever an elite gets parasitic (and not all eltites were parasitic) , the suppressed and exploited majority and its leaders will overthrow the system surely. The coming 50 years of Zbigniew Brezinzky's "technotronic" suppression will not alter this fate, either.80.138.128.87 00:20, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
