	    <p>A. S. Cobb is a freelance journalist, publicist, marketing manager and more.</p>
<p>A. S. Cobb founded Brown Recluse Entertainment Ventures in 1997 before leaving the rural outskirts of Houston, TX for Sunny Los Angeles, CA. While in Los Angeles, he attended the Art Institute of Los Angeles in Santa Monica, where he learned video production. Simultaneously, Cobb, worked on his own public access cable show called Hip Hop Non Stop (Phaze I).</p>
<p>His cable shows featured mainly local Los Angeles talent found from various locations. The very first show was a premonition of big things to come. Word spread up to the Bay Area where Misbehavin', an up and coming rap duo, heard the news and after a short plane ride, landed in LA for the Pilot episode. Sharing the spotlight was local LA rapper Devious, a young lady who made opponents cower when battling freestyle. G-Style aka Gary, one of Cobb's Co-workers at the Crowne Plaza hotel, showed up to put his stank on the show.</p>
<p>Brown Recluse Entertainment Ventures also produced shows such as TKO (Talent Knock Out) in Inglewood, CA at Coley's Caribbean. The shows included the like of Miss Nina Renee Frances and up and coming actress and model, members of the Beverly Hills Trio, Omega 7 and Rob Lee and Greg Scott, who make up Beyond Quality Entertainment.</p>
<p>This event paved the way for Cobb to be summoned to other projects. The African Diaspora Foundation hired him to produce a string of fundraisers for their organization. It was at that time, old Art Institute classmate Alex Cortez came aboard to help with logistics and talent.</p>
<p>Cobb hosted the shows he produced most times. This garnered him attention from local producers who asked him to be a part of their comedy showcases. So, he took a break from being the boss and served an adoring public with laughter as her regaled them with truthful, yet humorous tales of his past at places such as the Comedy Union in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Not completely fulfilled, he stumbled upon Poet's Jazz House (PJH), a beatnik style poetry house with so much more. After a few months of observing and performing, Cobb was asked by the producer, the lovely Ms. Tuesday Conner, fashion designer to Chaka Khan and other celebs, to host the show. He did until he moved to the Bay Area.</p>
<p>Cobb has teamed up with LA Fashion Icons, Kimiko Whitted of Kimiko by Design and Niche (Nikki) Martin of Niche Designs for the 2005 hit Bubble Up for Spring '06 Fashion Show &amp; Bazaar. This event featured a talent show, live entertainment and vendor booths, which included the works of designer Kevin James, Charlene aka Cookies by Me, Dawn Knight, CEO of Knightlife Entertainment and publishing. Knight is also author of the critically acclaimed fiction novel Kismet...available on Amazon, and others.</p>
<p>Currently Cobb services the Bay Area of California as well as Los Angeles with his boutique marketing firm called ASC Me PR. ASC Me PR was born from the many previous undertakings that required a great deal of PR, logistics and eventually culminated in him being on stage. Having many friends involved in similar industries and activities, Cobb found himself swimming in assignments he cordially accepted to help someone out. Most of these "favors" required him doing what he does best...communicate, promote, and create. Cobb helped design and implement marketing strategies for friends and family in entertainment, food service and real estate.</p>
<p>Now in Hayward, California Cobb has found himself back in school pursuing a degree in Business Administration and Marketing. Meanwhile, with a proven track record for success, he keeps busy building websites, marketing research, publicity and other related tasks.</p>
<p>Among Cobb and ASC Me PR's clients are: Charles Drew Realty, Overdue Exposure Magazine, Artisan Tatin Catering, recording artists Candis, Scipio, LBS Design and planning, Ephesians COGIC, Kimiko by Design, Niche Designs, NOIZ Imaging, Blu Leaf Clothing and Blu Foundation (deadbeats), to name a few. <strong class="selflink">A.
