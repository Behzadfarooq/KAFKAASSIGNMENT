<p>As far as I know, the concept of ascension has existed in science fiction for FAR FAR far longer than since it was introduced to Stargate, and yet there is no discussion of this in the Wiki. Ascension is a common theme to MANY science fiction writers including Ian M. Banks and others. Anyone else know more/want to change this, or the disambiguation, article? 86.3.34.97 18:19, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>"This suggests that Buddhism was founded upon the studies into Ascension that the Ancients made." Does one of the characters make this suggestion? If so, can someone write in that it was suggested by so and so character? If there is no source for the suggestion it shouldn't be in here because it wouldn't be encyclopedic 06:28, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Daniel says so in less words, but the whole episode itself suggests it with more strength. There really is no doubt that the suggestion is intended. --<b><a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlfakim_ccb4.html" title="User:Alfakim"><font style="color:#4f87f9">Alfakim</font></a></b>-- <a href="../../../a/l/f/User_talk%7EAlfakim_b9e4.html" title="User talk:Alfakim"><font style="color:#4f87f9">talk</font></a> 16:37, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I may already know what ascension is, but I'll be damned if this article was even the least bit clear on what it is. People don't want (boring) episode summaries when they're trying to find out what a key concept of a television series' plot is.<a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApostrophe_4563.html" title="User:Apostrophe">Apostrophe</a> 05:34, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see what you are getting at but it still is good to have an explanation of how SG1 came to larn about ascennsion. Mabey there should be a brief summary of what it is then go into further detail about what episodes it was in. Also some info on how the ancients researched ascension in Stargate Atlantis would probably be good to--<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightamplification_ba92.html" title="User:Lightamplification">Lightamplification</a> 07:04, 22 May 2005 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>I think the plot summaries are good, but perhaps you are right that there needs to be a clearer, more specific description section <i>before</i> them. What exactly did you find was unclear though? I thought that the first paragraph was sufficient. --<a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlfakim_ccb4.html" title="User:Alfakim">alfakim</a> 19:06, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I agree with the first poster. This article is very poorly written, badly organized, and excludes many key details. It needs a major rework. I should tag this article for cleanup. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobyk777_9e17.html" title="User:Tobyk777">Tobyk777</a> 02:20, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is not safe to assume that the Ori ascended through evolutionary means, since Oma Desala aided Anubis in ascension, and he could not be described as being "good of heart". The only place where being "good of heart" is really mentioned is on what criteria that Oma herself will help someone to ascend. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDespair_b0fe.html" title="User:Despair">Despair</a> 08:00, 07 March 2006 (GMT)</dd>

<p>The Ori ARE ascended, but they are NOT enlightened. Not all ascended beings are enlightened, Anubis being a specific example, as Oma told him to "find his enlightenment". What 'enlightenment' means exactly, is certainly debatable at this point. --<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeastallion_7b9c.html" title="User:Seastallion">Seastallion</a> 10:17, 10 March 2006 (EST)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The Ascended nemesis of the Ancients, the Ori, are evil beings. It is unclear how the Ori Ascended, but based on their selfish nature, and how advanced their technology is, it is safe to assume that they Ascended through evolution, or with technology, but not spirituality, as that path is only open to the good of heart. Unless, perhaps, the spiritual concentration and focus of their worshipers pushes the Ori into an Ascended state, effectively allowing the Ori to steal the Ascension earned by others, Ascention by proxy.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Quoted from the main article)</p>
<p>I kind of have a problem with this ^^ Aside from the obvious spelling mistake at the end of it, it seems to be based on supposition that isnt supported by evidence in the show. According to Orlin the Ancients were the ones who devoted themselves to science (and we know for a fact that they used technology in some cases at least to artificially evolve themselves to ascension) whilst the Ori were more religious (and no evidence thus far that they used technology to further their evoloution). That suggests that the Ori WERE spiritual and, when added to the comment made by Merlin in 'The Quest Prt2', in which he states the Ori began with the best of intentions, it seems more likely from this that the Ori did in fact ascend through spiritual means rather than technological. Its still not clear cut, but it is definitely a possibility, strong enough to make the above section seem wrong to me. Also, it states that a person be good of heart in order to ascend spiritually, however according to Daniel that is only true if you want help from an Ancient to ascend you. If someone who was basically evil devoted their life to meditation the way Merlin and Morgan did, they could concievably ascend without the aid of technology - at least there is no evidence that an evil person could NOT ascend through spiritual enlightenment.</p>
<p>Oh, and as a side note, it also says that the Ori had advanced technology prior to their ascension ("<i>and how advanced their technology is</i>"). Again, there is no evidece of that. All Ori technology seen in the series was made by their followers after the Ori ascended and gained the knowledge of the universe. We know the Ancients, devoted to science, had advanced technology before they ascended, but the Ori who were more religious may have shunned technology before they ascended - we just dont know. And we certainly dont have the evidence to say that the Ori had advanced technology before they ascended, let alone that they had the technology and the desire to use science to achieve ascension by messing around with their DNA, something I find hard to believe a group of religious zealots would be eager to do. Genetic manipulation is largely considered unnatural by religious organisations, further adding strength to the possibility that the Ori ascended through spiritual meditation. --Anon - 11:04am, 08 March 2007--</p>

<p>Generally the page had too many photos. But in addition to this, the ascended Oma photo pushed the Ascended Orlin photo over into the article. I was originally going to make the Oma photo smaller, but I realized that we already have a picture of Oma, and the real purpose is to show what an ascended being looks like, no need for two photos for that, and no need for two photos of Oma. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Filmaker_d97f.html" title="User:The Filmaker">The Filmaker</a> 19:41, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not saying it should be put back, but i think it might eventually be put back, so i'm just making a quick save of it.</p>
<p>Although "divine order" was made as a passing comment, the show strongly suggests it in "Origin" and "Prototype". In each case, its a character's own idea (mitchell; jackson), but lends a lot of sense to the stargate cosmos. like a lot of other things in stargate (and our articles), i'm fairly sure the writers intended us to make the inference that they were giving us a small bit of explanation.</p>

<dd>It's possible, but it completely goes against various themes that have been introduced, and continued into Season 9, in Stargate, such as the idea that good and evil is not such a black and white thing as this "divine order" hypothesis suggests (examples include the Tokra who are not as evil as the Goa'uld, the Replicators, who became much more complex when human-form replicators began showing up, the Trust, who regularly did things that could have been debated as 'for the greater good', the Wraith, who are not so much evil as they are amoral and simply obey their instinct, and even the Ancients).</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Anyhow, good thinking saving it. Maybe the idea may be followed up upon in Season 10. SG-1 certainly could use a higher power on their side. --<a href="../../../k/u/h/User%7EKuhan_c07e.html" title="User:Kuhan">Kuhan</a> 04:30, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree. The above seems to me to be exactly where the show is going and has been ever since the beginning of Season 9 when Ascension really became central.

<dd>Unfortunatly, I don't have a copy of Prototype to check... but I do remember a line about half way through when Sam says something along the lines of "I always thought you had to be a good person to ascend." to which Daniel responds with something like "Certainly if you have an ascended ancient helping you. Naturally though it's just a matter of evolution", which represents a much more amoral process than what we had seen pre season 9. --<a href="../../../k/u/h/User%7EKuhan_c07e.html" title="User:Kuhan">Kuhan</a> 00:16, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeh, S9's made ascension very amoral (or much more scientific), but there are two types of ascended being never the less - the good ones and the bad ones. that was daniel's comment: "the battle between good and evil is meant to ascend to a higher plane and take part on a cosmic scale."

<p>Man, I really spend too much time on this article.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I was never particularly good at citing sources in school, but the amount of cites in this article seems a little excessive. Wikipedia advises to only cite when the fact stated is likely to or has been disputed. In that case, we should probably remove most of them except the snopes cite. If needed, we could make a list at the bottom of the page of episodes of note/interest, but at the moment, the amount of cites seems akin to someone citing every line of the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> article to a verse of the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>.

<dd><b>Disagree</b> Wikipedia encourages more refs and cites.

I think all the sources are crucial. Almost everything in the article, mabe even the entire stargate project is definite and pretty much undisputable if you watch the show.

<p>"The Ascended plane of existence appears to have several 'levels' and 'ranks', evident because some Ascended beings are greater in power than others. As seen in such episodes as "<a href="../../../t/h/r/Threads_%28Stargate_SG-1%29_e44f.html" title="Threads (Stargate SG-1)">Threads</a>", those who have been Ascended for longer, or who Ascended of their own wisdom, achieve a "higher" Ascension<sup id="_ref-Threads_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Threads" title="">[1]</a></sup>; <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Jackson_1278.html" title="Daniel Jackson">Daniel Jackson</a>, who is Ascended by <a href="../../../o/m/a/Oma_Desala_16b2.html" title="Oma Desala">Oma Desala</a>, is always of the least power."</p>
<p>I removed that because we've seen no evidence of any Ascended beings being "more powerful" than any others on an individual level. Daniel Jackson is always interfered with because the other Ascended beings act as a group, not because he's the youngest and weakest. Anubis was forced down to a lower plane of existence by the others acting together, Morgana was taken away by the others acting as a group, etc. If it turns out that there is such a correlation between age and power, we don't know about it yet because it hasn't been mentioned in any episode.</p>
<p>If there is such a connection, then why is Oma unable to defeat Anubis on the Ascended planes? He Ascended millenia after her, and with her help as a matter of fact, and isn't even fully Ascended anymore, but the two are completely perfectly matched that neither will ever be able to defeat the other (Mentioned quite specifically in "Threads").

<dd>You are completely right. I read that sentence and it didn't make sense to me either. However, some ascneded beings are more powerful than others. Their power depends on how many humnas they have worshiping them, not how old they are. That is why the Ori are more powerful than the Ancients. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobyk777_9e17.html" title="User:Tobyk777">Tobyk777</a> 22:41, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Close, but not quite. The Ori are <i>not</i> more powerful than the Ancients, if they were then they would have already conquered them. What they hope to do is <i>become</i> more powerful than the Ancients by having all of the Milky Way humans worship them. Form what I can gather from in-show dialogue, the two are rather evenly matched right now, with the Ancients numerically superior, but the Ori equalling them in power via the whole sucking life from humans thing.

But I think that a small reference to the Q continuum would be suitable as a reference to a similar concept, as well as the similarity of presenting the continuum and the higher plane as a mundane real world representation to less advanced beings brought into them. Perhaps a small section for similar beings/concepts in other fiction? Though none leap to mind off the top of my head, I'm sure there's a few that are similar enough to warrant mention in such a section.<a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumber36_58f0.html" title="User:Number36">Number36</a> 23:16, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would just like to point out that the Stargate Atlantis episode Tao of Rodney completely contradicts this whole article of ascension. Aparently, the evolutionary aspect of ascension and the spiritual side are not independent. They are both needed.

<dd>I disagree, I believe the whole spiritual side simply allows one's body to achieve the state required for ascension. The subconscious mind will not allow the mind to achieve the correct mental state if one is not at rest with oneself. 82.21.67.38 17:44, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, you have to want to ascend. As Daniel tells Jack "This is something you have to want," and Roddney did not want to Ascend, partly because his mind had finally come up with an alternative to simply dying or ascending (the soloution he gives to Carson). --Anon - 8:55am, 11 March 2007--</p>
