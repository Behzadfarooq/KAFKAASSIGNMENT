<p>The subject of Ascended Masters and Ascension has a history. These days, it's typically attached to Metaphysical circles of discussion. Even if you have no experience in this topic, or simply don't believe in it, that isn't a reason to delete the page. If so, you could delete just about every page about religion and metaphysics that you don't agree with. If you truly believe that no one will be interested in discovering anything about this topic, then delete it. Otherwise, contribute something from your own knowing. Mahamudra, 7/10/04</p>
<dl>
<dd>The history of belief in ascended masters is complicated enough that it might be helpful to know, from which of the several groups that teach about Ascended Masters did you get the information that was first posted here?

<p>Refer to "An Ascension Handbook" by Tony Stubbs, published by OUGHTEN House Foundation 62.90.164.39 13:58, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"One concept of an ascended master derives from the teachings of Theosophy." Just where in the "teachings of theosophy"? It is not in Blavatsky or even Leadbeater as far as I know. The Mahatmas or Elder Brothers were not referred to as "Ascended Masters".</p>

<p>The article says the Count of St Germain's final incarnation was as Sir Francis Bacon. But the Count lived in the 18th century, and Bacon lived in the 17th century - so that doesn't make sense.

<p>madame Blavatsky claimed her teachings were derived from Masters. The "ascended" part stems from the <i>I am</i> - <i>Elizabeth Prophet</i> strain of neotheosophy.--<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVindheim_2635.html" title="User:Vindheim">Vindheim</a> 12:25, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Does the term exist in Leadbeater or Bailey?- I don't think so. "It was however the Church Universal and Triumphant, led by Elizabeth Clare Prophet which first coined the term Ascended Masters."</p>
<p>Date? I think you'll find the term used by the Ballards antecedent to the Prophets.</p>

<p>I got an impression that the subject of the article is not well defined. The article is poorly sourced. Most of current external links could appear in Wikipedia only as examples of new age websites, they do not contain verifiable information about the topic of the article. The quote from <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> found above is appropriate in the situation. I also browsed some history. To remove the "citation needed" tag it is necessary to cite a reliable source, see <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Wikilinking a word in the disputed sentence is not enough. If this article should exist at all, it needs some serious work. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHele_7_b043.html" title="User:Hele 7">Hele 7</a> 19:35, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article is about a belief. As this belief is not a scientifically established fact, both supporting and critical viewpoints to this belief should be presented. Voice of those who think that this belief is holy truth is already too well represented in the article. But there are other people who see this belief as means of deception and their viewpoint should be represented too. Wikipedia does not prefer sympathy to antipathy (if it did, there would be sympathetic articles about things you do not like at all). Dedicated and disappointed viewpoints are both somewhat "emotionally disturbed", so neutral academic works of people with knowledge, but without personal involvement would be especially valuable for this area.</dd>
<dd>At present there are at least 6 articles (<a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_White_Brotherhood_9a9b.html" title="Great White Brotherhood">Great White Brotherhood</a>, <a href="../../../k/u/t/Kuthumi.html" title="Kuthumi">Kuthumi</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Temple_of_The_Presence_4458.html" title="The Temple of The Presence">The Temple of The Presence</a>, <a href="../../../i/_/a/I_Am_movement_e5b6.html" title="I Am movement">I Am movement</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bridge_to_Freedom_f512.html" title="The Bridge to Freedom">The Bridge to Freedom</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_Rays_58c5.html" title="Seven Rays">Seven Rays</a>) in addition to this one, which largely repeat each other while representing the same religious belief from almost exclusively "dedicated" POV. Even differences from commonly accepted Wikipedia style are the same (e.g. overcapitalization). It seems to be a campaign to promote the belief, not information designed to help the reader. To make the material useful for readers, the information from these articles should be merged under one most-used name for this belief system. A capitalized phrase used in this belief system usually does not deserve a separate article. Maybe also some organisations holding and promoting this belief system are notable enough for a separate article including both supporting and critical POV.</dd>

<p>As far as I know the concept comes from Blavatsky's theosophy and I think that as a consequence her writings can be used as a source for this article.

<dd>It is highly inappropriate to be adding links to personal attack sites - labeled as "Debunkers" - to Encyclopedia entries on religious beliefs held by large numbers of people throughout the world, with long established centers, churches, and temples. This is the Twenty-First Century, not the time of the Spanish Inquisition. It is appalling that some individuals think they have the right to judge the validity of other people's religious beliefs. NO ONE has the right to judge the validity of other people's religious beliefs. Just think how outrageous this would be if widely practiced on Wikipedia: Christian Bible Fundamentalists would post "Debunker" links on entries relating to Catholic saints about the false belief of praying to saints as being non-Biblical and idolatrous; Shiite Moslems would post "Debunker" links on Wikipedia entries about Sunni Moslems; Sunni Moslems would post "Debunker" links on Wikipedia entries about Shiite Moslems; Christian Bible Fundamentalists would post "Debunker" links on entries relating to religious beliefs about Hindu Gods as being false beliefs, non-Biblical, and idolatry; Jewish zealots would post "Debunker" links on Wikipedia entries about Christian beliefs as being false and violations of the First Commandment!</dd>

<p>An encyclopedia article about a particular subject should reflect opinions and attitudes of different people, not only of admirers of the subject. You warn about <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_173f.html" title="Jehovah's Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>, but Wikipedia article on Jehovah's Witnesses is much better balanced than your version of this article, it contains also critical and controversial material. Follow this example and you will get far better results than from repeated deletions of everything you do not like to see here. You note that it is not the time of the Spanish Inquisition now - so please do not follow their practice to silence all different opinions. On flyers your text and style would be OK, but an encyclopedia is not a place to promote a religion. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHele_7_b043.html" title="User:Hele 7">Hele 7</a> 15:49, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I want to clarify my previous comments on "Debunder" impositions on Wikipedia articles. I agree that it would be appropriate to include critical and controversial material in a article about an ORGANIZATION in order to present differing views. Joe Szimhart's article from 1998 that is part of his personal smear campaign and vendetta against Church Universal and Triumphant under the former leadership of Elizabeth Claire Prophet is about that organization. So in an article about Church Universal and Triumphant, it would be something that could be advocated by some as appropriate in such an article. But it is not appropriate in article about the RELIGIOUS BELIEFS in Ascended Masters. These beliefs about the Individualized Presence of God, the Ascension, and those who have entered Immortality and become "Ascended Masters" are held by many who neither have nor want any association with Elizabeth Claire Prophet's organization. <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAburesz_6c66.html" title="User:Aburesz">Allen Buresz</a> 19:55, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I find the link to debunkers ( or detractors ) to be inconsistent with what appears to be very neutral, academic and informative entry on the topic of ascended masters. When it comes to established faiths and religious beliefs, and write-ups about them in encyclopedia, it would appear to me the article and it's supporting references are all that is required. The concept of having oppositional links to a belief system being posted on the same page detracts from the encyclopedic ambiance of wikipedia. Along with freedom of the internet, most enlightened countries hold to freedom of faith or belief as well as freedom of speech. Rather than the debunkers standing in opposition to a faith on the same page, it would seem to make sense to me that they have their own page and topic and, there, under some banner or heading, present what they stand for. Otherwise any write up on religion or a faith runs the risk of becoming a bar brawl of contending beliefs or disbeliefs, resulting in wikipedia loosing it's standing for rational, measured and accurate presentation of many known facts and beliefs in the world about us.

<blockquote>
<p>The purpose of the Ascended Masters' "I AM" Activity is to bring help from Their Octave of Life. Mankind must have more than ordinary assistance to stand against the accumulation of mankind's disobedience to the Laws of Life. Physical actions alone cannot solve the world's problems nor remove the discordant energy which human beings release against each other, usually ignorant of its destructive force. The aim of the true seeker of the Light is to protect all that is constructive; to maintain God (Good) Ideals by dedicating one's Life to God in the highest and most powerful way possible; and to bring forth the Fulfillment of God's Divine Plan for all embodied in America and every nation and all who come in the future.</p>

<dd>The ascended master article is neutral, academic and informative. The link in question is a reference to a historic and current organization which holds to the ascended master belief. Finding a particular tenet or view of one of these organizations that one is not 'agreeable' with does not invalidate the clear and authoritative nature of the article. Hanging signs over and around the article about 'Neutrality' being in question, for someone with knowledge of the field, smacks of pandering to yearnings of censorship and control. When I came across the wikipedia article, some weeks back, I was impressed by it's throughly researched and authoritative description. What detracts from the experience however is the desperate attempt to include debunkers and their views. The wikipedia article is not 'selling' or 'promoting' anything but presenting an authoritative description of the field. It would appear the detractors are uncomfortable with such an exposition of the subject matter. Should that shroud the subject matter. I would hope not. Procleus 04:36, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ridiculing other people's religious beliefs has no place in an objective encyclopedia article entry, nor does condemning the religious belief in Immortal Ascended Masters - that is considered Sacred Truth by so many throughout the world - as being a belief in "Blavatsky's ghosts". This is as out of place in an an objective encyclopedia article entry on Ascended Masters as it would would be for non-Christians to ridicule articles on the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transfiguration_of_Jesus_30fe.html" title="Transfiguration of Jesus">Transfiguration</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resurrection_of_Jesus_9d9f.html" title="Resurrection of Jesus">Resurrection</a>, and <a href="../../../a/s/c/Ascension_of_Jesus_7bad.html" title="Ascension of Jesus">Ascension of Jesus</a>, or for Protestants to ridicule an article on the Catholic belief in the Physical Ascension (<a href="../../../a/s/s/Assumption_of_Mary_03d6.html" title="Assumption of Mary">Assumption</a>) of Mary, the Mother of Jesus. A subject or belief needs to be accurately described with definite citations, not trampled upon by those who disagree with the subject or belief!</p>
<p>This Wikipedia project should not degenerate into a judgmental new "Spanish Inquisition" or Muslim clerical "thought police" intervention where that which someone does not agree with is condemned and attacked.

<dd>Why I moved this? Because such words as "various organizations", "believed to be" and "it is believed" are not informative enough. Name 1-3 biggest organisations who hold the belief and confirm this with reliable references. Please do not use your own writings in Internet as sources, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</dd>
<dd>To continue the discussion: in an article about a religious belief, the belief should be characterized in balanced way by various groups, not only by believers. See for examples <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Legendary_creatures" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Legendary_creatures" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Human-derived_fictional_species" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Human-derived_fictional_species" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, there you will find many examples of articles where worshippers and enemies of different legendary beings have found good compromises with those who deny existence of these beings. Describing a belief from non-believer's POV is not "trampling upon" it, nor is the belief "condemned and attacked". A non-believer gives his or her description of the belief as does the believer, a reader gets information from both sides and is free to choose (or not) a standpoint. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHele_7_b043.html" title="User:Hele 7">Hele 7</a> 15:15, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Propaganda for a religious belief is no way "an objective, neutral and useful academic reference resource", it is spam. On your flyers or on your website you may remain silent about facts that most people do not share your belief and many of them are critical towards it, but you cannot do the same in Wikipedia. You have crossed the line using unacceptable editing methods (repeated reversions instead of discussion, repeated removal of NPOV tag when there is no consensus, marking your content-changing edits as minor, etc.), so all your production in Wikipedia is under attention now. If your belief does not allow you to tolerate different opinions and limit yourself to commonly accepted editing methods in articles about this belief, please consider contributing in other areas of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHele_7_b043.html" title="User:Hele 7">Hele 7</a> 15:51, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have read the discussion above and tend to side with the view by Allen Buresz. It makes sense to me that an article should put forth the relevant facts on the topic and not be clouded by links to various people's comments that just don't happen to like the concept. To permit this behavior is at best in poor taste... Bob8080 6 November 2006</p>
<p>I think posting external links to defamatory smear articles against a person or organization on a page about a particular religious term and belief is TOTALLY inappropriate. The article on Ascended Masters presents facts refering to the entire history of Ascended Masters' teachings as they have been given out over the last 75 years. Those critical external links point to articles posted by disgruntled individuals, written under high emotional disturbance and with a vindictive and destructive bent. It has nothing to do with the spirit of Wikipedia in my view. Paul Verity 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would also side with Allen Buresz. I don't believe it's right for links to the web sites of Bible fundamentalist groups - that are crusading against other religious groups that they don't agree with - to be placed on a page about the subject of "Ascended Masters". This is not a page about a religious group. I thought this was supposed to be a serious attempt at an encyclopedia? (?!?) I'm all for Freedom of Speech, which means I AM also all for the Freedom of Speech that I personally dissagree with. The article could include language such as "claim to be", "purport to be", etc., but those certain links have no place here. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoschela_7b66.html" title="User:Theoschela">Theoschela</a> 21:00, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, this article is about a belief. A belief should be described not only by admirers and followers of it but also by neutral observers and by those who have had bad experiences with it. The same applies to religious groups and all other subjects in Wikipedia. All groups have freedom of speech here, not only those you "happen to like". Wikipedia should give balanced descriptions. It is not a place for a religious group to promote their system of beliefs. Attempts to do so are bad PR for the group and it will remain in public space for a long time. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHele_7_b043.html" title="User:Hele 7">Hele 7</a> 21:29, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Having come to the 'discussion' section of this article, I wasn't expecting to find such recent activities and differences of thought. The current, as I write, reference no. 7 within the article - "Partridge, Christopher ed. New Religions: A Guide: New Religious Movements, Sects and Alternative Spiritualities Oxford University Press, USA 2004" is an update and not otherwise much changed from the original which was published in the late 1980s. I turned out to be the principal contributor to the section in this academic book for the section on the 'neo-Theosophical' movements commencing with the 'I AM' Activity of the Ballards. Contributors such as myself were consultants and did not do the final edit. In discussion with the original editor of the 1980s version (not Christopher Partridge, and she will I imagine have been advisor to him for the 2004 update), we discussed then what attitude or tone should be taken, and why. Perhaps I should explain that this volume is not just an academic work, but was specifically requested by elements of the British governemnt - as recall, by the Home Office - in order to provide accurate and unbiassed information on the 'New Religious Movements' precisely because most information not actually derived from the groups or movements themselves was of a negative nature (e.g. Christian evangelical tracts on each and every such movement). Since the intent of such sources of information was negative by nature, it was sometimes wildly inaccurate. These inaccuracies in turn were being picked up at the time (the 1980s) by the mainstream media in the UK. It was therefore officially requested that the London School of Economics, which had a department for such study, produce a neutral and factual work of the 'NRMs'.</p>
<p>I give this background since it was deemed quite inappropriate and unnecessary to go into much detail about critics of any NRMs. Today I'd comment on this that whereas a membership might number in the thousands, a critical perspective is often, it turns out, written by one or a few individuals, or by a competing religious viewpoint such as Christian. What WOULD be briefly referred to would be any truly factual, information, possessing evidence, of a negative nature about any movement's misdeeds. But the academic approach chosen was essentially one of giving each movement's history, philosophical background or sources, current beliefs, and where available the facts or estimates as to the current undertakings, membership numbers, etc. In summary, a 'neutral' article was not usually deemed to be one giving 'both sides', pro and contra, since the contra side is almost always there for any religious set of beliefs. Accuracy lay in giving the history and present state and set of beliefs more-or-less as the membership would have given them to us. Needless to say, this did not in any way take on an evangelical slant for any organisation, however: the aim was to be factual.</p>
<p>I should just stress again that I only discussed all this with the first - 1980s - editor informally, though at length, and then I helped shape the couple of pages on the twentieth-century 'Ascended Master' movements. My point here, seeing the discussion, is that with academic accuracy in mind, little heed was given to staunch critics, and the beliefs of the movements were presented largely as they would have worded them (or even had, in print), since the critics above all had an agenda and lacked accuracy - as it happened. That's the attitude I'd advocate today for Wikipedia on the ascended masters (lower or higher case).</p>
<p>It was difficult to know which discussion thread to put this into but I've chosen this current one. May I also add that - if it is not obvious - a fairly good knowledge of the movements, these specific movements, is required in order to usefully edit the article.</p>
<p>In reference to another discussion thread on the article: the subject of whether 'Ascended Masters' is or is not a term or concept held by Theosophy. The path to take here seemed pretty obvious for "New Religions: A Guide: New Religious Movements, Sects and Alternative Spiritualities", Oxford University Press. Theosophy had its own section in which Theosophy was discussed. Then the twentieth-century movements had their own sections, which can indeed be summarised as "ascended / Ascended master / Master Activities". Whether the beliefs and concepts of these movements really did reflect Theosophy was immaterial - the article or pages was on them and their beliefs. [We did not go into this technicality, but 'Ascended Masters' do exist within Theosophy, but simply under another term. Within Theosophy, Masters or Mahatmas who have undergone the Fifth Initiation (in Theosophical terms) appear to be identical to 'Ascended Masters'. From the Ballards on, the attempt was to de-mystify terminology and to make it more accessible to the layperson. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteranko_9600.html" title="User:Steranko">Steranko</a> 03:36, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for your informed contribution. What is "Theosophical teachings" may however be more complicated than you seem to realise. "Masters undergoing the fifth initiation" were introduced by Leadbeater, and cannot be found in Blavatsky's writings.I would therefore label such beliefs "second generation Theosophy" and the Ascended Master beliefs third- or even fourth-generation Theosophy. --<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVindheim_2635.html" title="User:Vindheim">Vindheim</a> 06:19, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes, on the numbered initiations you are quite right that this began with Leadbeater and Besant and also Alice Bailey were she to be considered part of the canon. It can in a sense be regarded as 'second generation Theosophy'. However that's a debate for any article about Theosophy; my real point there was that 'Ascended Masters' can be perceived as having a precursor-concept within Theosophy. I'd certainly say that this goes back to Blavatsky's era and the Mahatama Letters as well, since a detailed reading about, let us say, the Chohans, seems to indicate that while they can manifest in physical form, they were / are much more than physical beings; and certainly when discussion or writings of the late 1800s got into such beings as the Kumaras, here we are certainly not dealing with incarnated humans. Again, it is all moot as the approach I'd suggest is not to even attempt to 'prove' whether neo-Theosophy is 'correct'! All one can do with any religion, let alone those apart from the mainstream, is to faithfully report their beliefs. In doing so, we are not assesing truth-claims (such as the Mormons believing that God is a physical being on another planet, as I understand it - one simply reports on the beliefs held, with as much accuracy as possible). <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteranko_9600.html" title="User:Steranko">Steranko</a> 11:27, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I feel compelled to 'jump in.' ... I too would side with Buresz, and for reasons similar to Steranko's, I will add some relevant passages here at the end of this discussion chain. I have found a number of pertinent quotes from Helena Blavatsky, which, I believe, relate closely to Ascended Masters, and the fact that the Mahatmas, or her Masters, were not mere human beings, but represented (and demonstrated, if I may) much more to her. Indeed, the fourth quote may well address Vindheim's concern about the "Fifth Initiation", by presenting a related or comparible concept of Blavatsky's. ... While these passages cannot prove the reality of their claims (which I believe in, personally), they do clarify how Helena understood the Mahatmas to be, and where the term 'Ascended Master' can fit in to Theosophy. These latter two points are the purpose of this presentation of quotes.</dd>

<li>I here cite a number of passages from the book, "The Inner Group Teachings of H.P. Blavatsky" (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 09-913004-47</a>-2, Point Loma Publications, Inc. 1985), in chronological order.

<li>After an initiatory Pledge was taken by the Inner Group Members, including Dr. A. Besant, HPB said, "It is in the presence of the Master you have taken it" (Meeting: August 20, 1890). This would suggest that the Master was somehow present, though not physically, which is an ability not ascribed to usual people.</li>
<li>Along the lines of the Ascension, while explaining a diagram representing the human principles, HPB affirmed, "In all these systems remember the main principle, the descent and re-ascent of the Spirit, in man as in Kosmos" (Meeting: December 17, 1890).</li>
<li>On New Year's Eve, 1891, in a letter to Annie Besant and Isabel Cooper, HPB described herself as the "...devoted servant of the MASTER, beyond" (All-Caps in original). The word "beyond" is obviously referring to a transcendent 'location.'</li>
<li>Again, relating to the Ascension, HPB explained "To become a Rāja-Yogi, one has to ascend up to the seventh portal, the Satyaloka" (Meeting: January 11, 1891). I admit, I do not fully comprehend the terms used, but I suspect the gist is suffecient for the current purpose.</li>
<li>HPB stated, "The Masters' bodies are, so far as they are concerned, illusionary, and hence do not grow old, become wrinkled, etc" (Meeting: January 21, 1891). This would better fit the description of an immortal (...the idea being that the Mahatmas were not born as such but, through the practice of various disciplines, attained to it. Unascended adepts are able to stop the aging process, not out of self-gratification, but to extend the time with which to advance the disciplines...in preparation for the final Ascension).

<p>That's a useful and interesting list of reasons for considering HPB's Mahatmas, or some of them, to be synonymous with Ascended Masters. I'd point out, as above, however, that there's possibly - I'd suggest probably - no need at all to assess the truth claims of the twentieth-century movements. If people were to delve into assessing the truth claims of religion, then an entry on Christianity may as well begin with assessing whether God exists. The best approach would seem to be an accurate rendition of any movement's beliefs, nature, history and activities irrespective of content. Questioning the validity of religious beliefs isn't usually the role of an encyclopedia entry. (There could be exceptions to this in certain circumstances: for example, a very detailed article on Theosophy might well mention the controversy over the Mahatma letters, since this was an important historical debate.) <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteranko_9600.html" title="User:Steranko">Steranko</a> 11:45, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't agree that these quotations show that Blavatsky's concept of masters, even in her final year, was equal to the Ballard and later concept of "ascended masters". My point is not to dicuss the truth or otherwise of such concepts, only to make their historical development clear.--<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVindheim_2635.html" title="User:Vindheim">Vindheim</a> 11:52, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's true that the concepts aren't 'equal' in the sense of being identical, since little was really known or stated in Blavatsky's time about the details of what a Master was or how such a state was achieved. Later Theosophy itself, and then the neo-Theosophical organisations, purport to take the original concept but develop it - and purport to be doing this in communication with the Masters, or even in their own words. (Remember that we are simply dealing with belief here.) Blavatsky, for obvious reasons on the timeline, couldn't confirm that the later developments did indeed accurately reflect her Mahatmas; but what can be said is that Leadbeater and Besant, the Ballards, the Prophets, and so forth, certainly believed they were in possession of knowledge accurately developing the original (rather vague) Blavatskian concept of Masters. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteranko_9600.html" title="User:Steranko">Steranko</a> 16:56, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Benjamin Creme does not use the term "Ascended Masters" to describe beings in his belief system. The sentence you quoted was using "resurrected and ascended" as adjectives in the same way that a Christian might use those adjectives to describe Jesus. But outside of the organizations that believe in the "Ascended Master Teachings" you do not have Christians referring to Jesus as the Ascended Master Jesus.

<p>Purely on Blavatsky, and her period of the Theosophical Society, I don't find the article at the time of writing to be neutral. I read in it "While some of her critics believe the Masters are pure fantasy" and words about her "changing stories". On the one hand, to be comprehensive and inclusive, I do agree that it should be mentioned that Blavatsky had her skeptics then and does now. What religious belief doesn't? But the article in its approach to Blavatsky's claims about the Mahatmas is not at all neutral and academic on this important point: it gives the impression that all evidence and all accounts as to the Mahatmas' real existence stemmed from just her spoken and written words. Nothing could be further from the truth! During her time some dozens of people left accounts of their meetings with the same Mahatmas, or in some cases, Mahatmas co-working with the more famous names. For example, this article, which I doubt is exhaustive, lists twenty-five people's accounts of meetings with the Masters in the late 1800s:</p>
<p><a href="http://blavatskyarchives.com/mastersencounterswith.htm" class="external free" title="http://blavatskyarchives.com/mastersencounterswith.htm" rel="nofollow">http://blavatskyarchives.com/mastersencounterswith.htm</a></p>
<p>A few of the accounts there are 'astral' and a skeptic may therefore take them to be dreams, but the majority are quite physical. The article is therefore over-critical by not mentioning this or taking it into account, giving a quite false impression. In my opinion, therefore, the article shouldn't make it appear that the Mahatmas' reality at that time hinged only upon the accounts of one person, Blavatsky. This is not at all the case - from the historical record. I'd suggest the wording be altered to take this into account.</p>
<p>On a much more minor note, there has been discussion about capitalisation. I find it rather bizarre therefore that I find 'Mahatma' spelled in the article with lower-case 'm' when Blavatsky and the Mahatma letters each, as the original sources on Mahatmas, used upper case. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteranko_9600.html" title="User:Steranko">Steranko</a> 11:23, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

I would re-insert the link except that I'm not sure about copyright issues. 89.240.2.153 13:33, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
