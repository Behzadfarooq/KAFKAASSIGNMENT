<p>The adjective "ascetic" derives from the ancient Greek term <i>askēsis</i> (practice, training or exercise). Originally associated with any form of disciplined practice, the term <i>ascetic</i> has come to mean anyone who practices a renunciation of worldly pursuits to achieve higher intellectual and spiritual goals.</p>
<p>Many warriors and athletes, in Greek society, applied the discipline of <i>askēsis</i> to attain optimal bodily fitness and grace. The manner of life, the doctrine, or principles of someone who engages in <i>askēsis</i> is referred to as an ascetic.</p>

<p><a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Weber_eff0.html" title="Max Weber">Max Weber</a> made a distinction between <i>innerweltliche</i> and <i>ausserweltliche</i> asceticism, which means (roughly) "inside the world" and "outside the world". <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talcott_Parsons_9206.html" title="Talcott Parsons">Talcott Parsons</a> translated these as "worldly" and "otherworldly" (some translators use "inner-worldly", but that has a different connotation in English and is probably not what Weber had in mind).</p>
<p>"Otherworldly" asceticism is practiced by people who withdraw from the world in order to live an ascetic life (this includes <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monk.html" title="Monk">monks</a> who live communally in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monastery.html" title="Monastery">monasteries</a>, as well as <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermit.html" title="Hermit">hermits</a> who live alone). "Worldly" asceticism refers to people who live ascetic lives but don't withdraw from the world.</p>
<p>Weber claimed that this distinction originated in the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant_Reformation_5fc1.html" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>, but later became secularized, so the concept can be applied to both religious and secular ascetics.</p>
<p>(See Talcott Parsons' translation of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Protestant_Ethic_and_the_Spirit_of_Capitalism_437f.html" title="The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism">The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</a>, translator's note on Weber's footnote 9 in chapter 2)</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/a/v/David_McClelland_bc1d.html" title="David McClelland">David McClelland</a> suggested that worldly asceticism is specifically targeted against worldly pleasures that <i>distract</i> people from their calling, and may accept worldly pleasures that are not distracting. As an example, he pointed out that <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quakers.html" title="Quakers">Quakers</a> have historically objected to bright colored clothing, but that wealthy Quakers often made their drab clothing out of expensive materials. The color was considered distracting, but the materials were not. <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amish.html" title="Amish">Amish</a> groups use similar criteria to make decisions about which modern technologies to use and which to avoid.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/c/Asceticism.html" title="Edit section: Jainism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Jainism</span></h3>
<p>Asceticism, in its most intense form<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> can be found in <a href="../../../j/a/i/Jainism.html" title="Jainism">Jainism</a>, one of the oldest religions of the world. According to Frank William Iklé, Jainism espouses extreme asceticism prescribing fasting, yoga practices, meditation in certain difficult postures, and other austerities. (See History of Asia - By Frank William Iklé, Hilary Conroy, Woodbridge Bingham , Published 1964, Allyn and Bacon). According to Jains, the highest ideal or goal to be achieved by any soul is <a href="../../../m/o/k/Moksha.html" title="Moksha">Moksha</a> or the state of liberation. For this, a soul has to be completely passionless and without any attachments. This can be only be achieved by monks and nuns taking five great vows of – non-violence, truth, non-stealing, non-possession and celibacy.</p>
<p>Most of the austerities and ascetic practices can be traced back to Vardhaman <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahavira.html" title="Mahavira">Mahavira</a>, the twenty fourth <a href="../../../t/i/r/Tirthankara.html" title="Tirthankara">Tirthankara</a>. The Acaranga Sutra, or Book of Good Conduct, is one of the sacred books of Jainism which provides insight into the code of conuct of the Jain Ascetics. Other texts that provide insight into conduct of ascetics include Yogashastra by Acharya <a href="../../../h/e/m/Hemachandra.html" title="Hemachandra">Hemachandra</a> and Niyamasara by Acharya <a href="../../../k/u/n/Kundakunda.html" title="Kundakunda">Kundakunda</a>. Other illustrious Jain works on ascetic conduct are: Oghanijjutti, Pindanijjutti, Cheda Sutta, Nisiha Sutta, etc.</p>
<p>Some of the common ascetic practices of Jain Monks (and nuns) are –</p>
<ul>
<li>A person who is a monk or a nun has no relations. He enters monkhood by renouncing all relations and possessions.</li>
<li>Jain Monks follow complete non-violence. They do not hurt any living being be it an insect or a human. They carry a special broom to sweep any insects that may come in the way while walking. Some monks wear a cloth over their mouths to prevent killing of airborne germs and insects while talking.</li>
<li>They do not use electricity as it involves violence. They do not use any devices or machines. They always travel by foot, bare footed from city to city often crossing forests and deserts.</li>
<li>They sleep on the floor without blankets and sit on the wooden platforms.</li>
<li>A strict vegetarian diet without root vegetables is followed. <a href="../../../s/h/v/Shvetambara.html" title="Shvetambara">Shvetambara</a> monks do not cook food but solicit alms from householders. <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digambara.html" title="Digambara">Digambara</a> monks have only a single meal a day. They do not beg for food but make a resolution that if a householder, pure of mind and body, on his own volition offers them food in the prescribed manner, they partake a meal at his residence, remaining standing upright and eating only measured mouthfuls.</li>
<li>Fasting i.e complete abstinence from food (and sometimes water) is a routine feature of monks. They undertake fasts sometimes more than a day, going continuously without food for a month. Some monks either avoid or limit medicines or hospitalisation as they practice non-attachment to their bodies.</li>
<li>Other austerities include meditation in seated or standing posture near river banks where there is cold wind blowing or meditation atop hills and mountains, especially at noon when the Sun beats down at is fiercest. Such austerities are done as per the physical and mental capacities of each monks</li>
<li>They are completely possessionless. They only own unstitched white clothes and a few bowls for eating. Male Digambara monks do not wear any clothes and carry nothing with them except a soft broom made of shed peacock feathers (pinchi) and a bowl made of dried coconut shell (kamandalu)as they consider clothes as possessions. However, Swetambera (white clad) monks do not consider unstitched white clothes as possessions.</li>
<li>Jain monks and nuns practice complete celibacy. They do not touch or sit on a same platform with a person of opposite sex.</li>
<li>They do not stay in a single place for more than two months to prevent attachment to any place. However during four months of monsoon (rainy season) known as chaturmaas, they continue to stay at a single place to avoid killing of life forms that thrives during the rains.</li>
<li>Their whole day is spent either in study of scriptures or meditation or teaching to lay people. They do not indulge in worldly matters.</li>
<li>All Jain monks undertake the final vow of Santhara or Sallekhana i.e. peaceful and detached death where medicines, food and water are progressively forsaken. This is done at the time of imminent death or when a monk feels that he is unable to adhere to his vows on account of advanced age or terminal disease.</li>

<p>Quotes on ascetic practices from Akaranga Sutra, Sacred Books of the East, vol. 22: Gaina Sutras Part I, translated by <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermann_Jacobi_d925.html" title="Hermann Jacobi">Hermann Jacobi</a> [1884]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A monk or a nun wandering from village to village should look forward for four cubits, and seeing animals they should move on by walking on his toes or heels or the sides of his feet. If there be some bypath, they should choose it, and not go straight on; then they may circumspectly wander from village to village. Third Lecture(6)”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>'I shall become a Sramana who owns no house, no property, no sons, no cattle, who eats what others give him; I shall commit no sinful action; Master, I renounce to accept anything that has not been given.' Having taken such vows, (a mendicant) should not, on entering a village or scot-free town, &amp;c., take himself, or induce others to take, or allow others to take, what has not been given. Seventh Lecture (1)</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/c/Asceticism.html" title="Edit section: Theravadism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Theravadism</span></h3>
<p>The historical Shakyamuni Gautama adopted an extreme ascetic life after leaving his father's palace, where he once lived in extreme luxury. But later the Shakyamuni rejected extreme asceticism because it is an impediment to ultimate freedom(<a href="../../../n/i/r/Nirvana.html" title="Nirvana">nirvana</a>) from suffering (<a href="../../../s/a/m/Samsara.html" title="Samsara">samsara</a>), choosing instead a path that met the needs of the body without crossing over into luxury and indulgence. After abandoning extreme asceticism he was able to achieve enlightenment. This position became known as the <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madhyamaka.html" title="Madhyamaka">Madhyamaka</a> or Middle Way, and became one of the central organizing principles of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theravadin.html" title="Theravadin">Theravadin</a> philosophy.</p>
<p>The degree of moderation suggested by this middle path varies depending on the interpretation of Theravadism at hand. Some traditions emphasize ascetic life more than others.</p>
<p>The basic lifestyle of an ordained Theravadin practitioner (<a href="../../../b/h/i/Bhikkhu.html" title="Bhikkhu">bhikkhu</a>, monk; or <a href="../../../b/h/i/Bhikkhuni.html" title="Bhikkhuni">bhikkhuni</a>, nun) as described in the <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vinaya.html" title="Vinaya">Vinaya Pitaka</a> was intended to be neither excessively austere nor hedonistic. Monks and nuns were intended to have enough of life's basic requisites (particularly food, water, clothing, and shelter) to live safely and healthily, without being troubled by illness or weakness. While the life described in the Vinaya may appear difficult, it would be perhaps better described as <a href="../../../s/p/a/Sparta.html#Military_life" title="Sparta">Spartan</a> rather than truly ascetic. Deprivation for its own sake is not valued. Indeed, it may be seen as a sign of attachment to one's own renunciation. The aim of the monastic lifestyle was to prevent concern for the material circumstances of life from intruding on the monk or nun's ability to engage in religious practice. To this end, having inadequate possessions was regarded as being no more desirable than having too many.</p>
<p>Initially, the Tathagatta rejected a number of more specific ascetic practices that some monks requested to follow. These practices — such as sleeping in the open, dwelling in a cemetery or cremation ground, wearing only cast-off rags, etc. — were initially seen as too extreme, being liable to either upset the social values of the surrounding community, or as likely to create schisms among the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sangha.html" title="Sangha">Sangha</a> by encouraging monks to compete in austerity. Despite their early prohibition, recorded in the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Pali_Canon_9085.html" title="Pali Canon">Pali Canon</a>, these practices (known as the <a href="../../../d/h/u/Dhutanga.html" title="Dhutanga">Dhutanga</a> practices, or in <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thai_language.html" title="Thai language">Thai</a> as <i>thudong</i>) eventually became acceptable to the monastic community. They were recorded by <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhaghosa.html" title="Buddhaghosa">Buddhaghosa</a> in his <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visuddhimagga.html" title="Visuddhimagga">Visuddhimagga</a>, and later became significant in the practices of the <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thai_Forest_Tradition_fb9b.html" title="Thai Forest Tradition">Thai Forest Tradition</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahayana.html" title="Mahayana">Mahayana</a> traditions of Theravadism received a slightly different code of discipline than that used by the various <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theravada.html" title="Theravada">Theravada</a> sects. This fact, combined with significant regional and cultural variations, has resulted in differing attitudes towards asceticism in different areas of the Mahayana world. Particularly notable is the role that <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegetarianism.html" title="Vegetarianism">vegetarianism</a> plays in <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Asia_cb20.html" title="East Asia">East Asian</a> Theravadism, particularly in [[Zhonguo{China}]] and [[Nippon{Japan}]]. While Theravada monks are compelled to eat whatever is provided for them by their lay supporters, including meat, Mahayana monks in East of Asia are most often vegetarian. This is attributable to a number of factors, including Mahayana-specific teachings regarding vegetarianism, East Asian cultural tendencies that predate the introduction of Buddhism (some of which may have their roots in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confucianism.html" title="Confucianism">Confucianism</a>), and the different manner in which monks support themselves in East Asia. While Southeast of East Asian and Sri Lankan monks generally continue to make daily begging rounds to receive their daily meal, monks in East Asia more commonly receive bulk foodstuffs from lay supporters (or the funds to purchase them) and are fed from a kitchen located on the site of the temple or monastery, and staffed either by working monks or by lay supporters.</p>
<p>Similarly, divergent scriptural and cultural trends have brought a stronger emphasis on asceticism to some Mahayana practices. The <a href="../../../l/o/t/Lotus_Sutra_c6c1.html" title="Lotus Sutra">Lotus Sutra</a>, for instance, contains a story of a <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodhisattva.html" title="Bodhisattva">bodhisattva</a> who burns himself as an offering to the assembly of all <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhas.html" title="Buddhas">Buddhas</a> in the world. This has become a patterning story for self-sacrifice in the Mahayana world, probably providing the inspiration for the auto-cremation of the Miaoli{Vietnamese} monk <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thich_Quang_Duc_9643.html" title="Thich Quang Duc">Thich Quang Duc</a> during the 1960's, as well as several other incidents.</p>

<p>The history of <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> asceticism goes back thousands of years to the references of the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazirite.html" title="Nazirite">Nazirite</a> (Numbers 6) and the Wilderness Tradition that evolved out of the forty years in the desert. The prophets and their disciples were ascetic to the extreme including many examples of fasting and hermitic living conditions. After the Jews returned from the <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylonia.html" title="Babylonia">Babylonian</a> exile and the prophetic institution was done away with a different form of asceticism arose when <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antiochus_IV_7863.html" title="Antiochus IV">Antiochus IV</a> Epiphanes threatened the Jewish religion in 167 BCE. The Hassidean sect attracted observant Jews to its fold and they lived as holy warriors in the wilderness during the war against the <a href="../../../s/e/l/Seleucid.html" title="Seleucid">Seleucid</a> Empire. With the rise of the <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasmonean.html" title="Hasmonean">Hasmoneans</a> and finally Jonathan's claim to the High Priesthood in 152 BCE, the <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essene.html" title="Essene">Essene</a> sect separated under the Teacher of Righteousness and they took the banner of asceticism for the next two hundred years culminating in the Dead Sea Sect.</p>
<p>Asceticism is rejected by modern day Judaism; it is considered contrary to God's wishes for the world. God intended for the world to be enjoyed, in a permitted context of course <a href="http://www.aish.com/literacy/judaism123/Five_Levels_of_Pleasure.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aish.com/literacy/judaism123/Five_Levels_of_Pleasure.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The Talmud says that "if a person has the opportunity to taste a new fruit and refuses to do so, he will have to account for that in the next world".<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>There are different categories of pleasure. From simple, short lived things, like eating something tasty, to more complex pleasures, such as the satisfaction of succeeding in a difficult task. The closest Judaism comes to asceticism is when it tries to teach people to enjoy the more intellectual and spiritual pleasures, and not to chase after the simpler pleasures.</p>
<p>However, Judaism does not encourage people to seek pleasure for its own sake but rather to do so in a spiritual way. An example would be thanking God for creating something enjoyable, like a wonderful view, or tasty food. As another example, sex should be enjoyed while remembering that a person may be fulfilling the commandments of marriage and pru-urvu (procreation), but that it should also be enjoyed. Food can be enjoyed by remembering that it is necessary to eat, but by thanking God for making it an enjoyable processes, and by not overeating, or eating wastefully.</p>
<p>Jews believe that God could just as easily have made food nutritious but bland, or sex could be an uncontrollable drive, however that is not what God wanted. God wanted people to take pleasure in living in his world.</p>
<p>Modern normative Judaism (and the <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharisees.html" title="Pharisees">Pharisees</a> that developed it) is in opposition to the lifestyle of asceticism, and sometimes cast the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazirite.html" title="Nazirite">Nazirite</a> vow in a critical light. There did existed some ascetic Jewish sects in ancient times, most notably the <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essenes.html" title="Essenes">Essenes</a> and <a href="../../../e/b/i/Ebionites.html" title="Ebionites">Ebionites</a>. Some early <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabbalah.html" title="Kabbalah">Kabbalists</a> may have, arguably, also held a lifestyle that could be regarded as ascetic.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/c/Asceticism.html" title="Edit section: Christianity">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Christianity</span></h3>
<p>Asceticism within <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> tradition is the set of disciplines practiced to work out the believer's <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvation.html" title="Salvation">salvation</a> and further the believer's <a href="../../../r/e/p/Repentance.html" title="Repentance">repentance</a> as well as for the purpose of spiritual enlightenment. Although <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monk.html" title="Monk">monks</a> and <a href="../../../n/u/n/Nun.html" title="Nun">nuns</a> are known for especially strict acts of asceticism, ascetic practices are evident among other early Christians.</p>
<p>Christian authors of late antiquity such as <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origen.html" title="Origen">Origen</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerome.html" title="Jerome">Jerome</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Chrysostom_f259.html" title="John Chrysostom">John Chrysostom</a>, and <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustine_of_Hippo_c35d.html" title="Augustine of Hippo">Augustine</a> interpreted meanings of <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical.html" title="Biblical">Biblical</a> texts within a highly asceticized religious environment. Through their commentaries, they created a new “asceticized <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scripture.html" title="Scripture">Scripture</a>,” and in the process an asceticized version of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>. Scriptural examples of asceticism could be found in the lives of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_the_Baptist_0931.html" title="John the Baptist">John the Baptist</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>, the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostle.html" title="Apostle">twelve apostles</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_of_Tarsus_aa07.html" title="Paul of Tarsus">Saint Paul</a>, as well as in the primitive Christian community depicted by <a href="../../../l/u/k/Luke_the_Evangelist_2172.html" title="Luke the Evangelist">Luke</a> (<a href="../../../a/c/t/Acts_of_the_Apostles_c9b6.html" title="Acts of the Apostles">Acts</a> 4:32). The <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_Sea_Scrolls_dfda.html" title="Dead Sea Scrolls">Dead Sea Scrolls</a> revealed ascetic practices of the ancient Jewish sect of <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essenes.html" title="Essenes">Essenes</a> who took vows of abstinence to prepare for a holy war. Thus, the asceticism of practitioners like Jerome was hardly original (although some of his critics thought it was), and a desert ascetic like Antony the Great (251-356 CE) was in the tradition of ascetics in noted communities and sects of the previous centuries. Clearly, emphasis on an ascetic religious life was evident in both early Christian writings and practices. Other Christian followers of asceticism include the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathar.html" title="Cathar">Cathars</a> plus individuals such as <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_of_Assisi_f7c7.html" title="Francis of Assisi">Francis of Assisi</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_David_cfb4.html" title="Saint David">Saint David</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simeon_Stylites_10e6.html" title="Simeon Stylites">Simeon Stylites</a>. (See <i>The Catholic Encyclopedia</i> for a fuller discussion.)</p>
<p>To the uninformed modern reader, early monastic asceticism may seem to be only about <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celibacy.html" title="Celibacy">sexual renunciation</a>. However, sexual abstinence was merely one aspect of ascetic renunciation. The ancient monks and nuns had other, equally weighty concerns: pride, humility, compassion, discernment, patience, judging others, prayer, hospitality, and almsgiving. For some early Christians, gluttony represented a more primordial problem than sex, and as such the reduced intake of <a href="../../../f/o/o/Food.html" title="Food">food</a> is also a facet of asceticism. As an illustration, the systematic collection of the <i>Apophthegmata</i>, or Sayings of the desert fathers and mothers has more than twenty chapters divided by theme; only one chapter is devoted to <i>porneia</i> (“sexual lust"). (See Elizabeth A. Clark. <i>Reading Renunciation: Asceticism and Scripture in Early Christianity.</i> Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1999.)</p>

<p>The Arabic word for asceticism is <b>zuhd</b>.</p>
<p>The Prophet Muhammad is quoted to have said, "What have I to do with worldly things? My connection with the world is like that of a traveler resting for a while underneath the shade of a tree and then moving on." He advised the people to live simple lives and himself practiced great austerities. Even when he had become the virtual king of Arabia, he lived an austere life bordering on privation. His wife Aiysha says that there was hardly a day in his life when he had two square meals (Muslim, Sahih Muslim, Vol.2, pg 198). When he died there was nothing in his house except a few seeds of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barley.html" title="Barley">barley</a> left from a mound of the grain obtained from a Jew by pawning his armour (Bukhari, Sahih Bukhari, Chapter "Aljihad").</p>

<p>Muslim scholars, one being <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_Asad_9d52.html" title="Muhammad Asad">Muhammad Asad</a> wrote that he found the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%E2%80%99an.html" title="Qur’an">Qur’an</a> to say “Yes to action, No to passivity. Yes to life, No to asceticism.” Asad believed that Allah did not simply provide men and women with bodily needs, only to expect them to suppress such needs and concentrate on their spirit. Rather the Qur’an and <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">Hadith</a> offer much practical advice concerned with the earthly affairs of men and women. Thus scholars such as Asad point out that, the Qur’an and Hadith show us a path where the needs of our flesh and spirit are both harmoniously balanced.</p>

<p><a href="../../../s/u/f/Sufism.html" title="Sufism">Sufism</a> evolved not as a mystical but as an ascetic movement, as even the name suggests; <i>Sufi</i> refers to a rough woolen robe of the ascetic. A natural bridge from asceticism to mysticism has often been crossed by Muslim ascetics. Through meditation on the Qur'an and praying to Allah, the Muslim ascetic believes that he draws near to Allah, and by leading an ascetic life paves the way for absorption in Allah, the Sufi way to salvation.

<p>Some have argued that asceticism is a ubiquitous practice, the obstinacy of pleasures of sense lead one to the more mundane pleasures of mind, this sort of self-torturing gives one the right to torture others. Concerning this, <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russell_85bc.html" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a> writes in his <i>Ideas that have harmed human kind</i>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Gloomy saints who abstained from all pleasures of sense, who lived in solitude in the desert, denying themselves meat and wine and the society of women, were, nevertheless, not obliged to abstain from all pleasures. The pleasures of the mind were considered to be superior to those of the body, and a high place among the pleasures of the mind was assigned to the contemplation of the eternal tortures to which the pagans and heretics would hereafter be subjected. It is one of the drawbacks to asceticism that it sees no harm in pleasures other than those of sense, and yet, in fact, not only the best pleasures, but also the very worst, are purely mental...On the contrary when a man tortures himself he feels that it gives him a right to torture others, and inclines him to accept any system of dogma by which this right is fortified</i>. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>
