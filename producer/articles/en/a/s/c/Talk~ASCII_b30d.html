<p><i>ASCII is generally accounted the most successful software standard ever promulgated.</i></p>
<p>What does this really mean? If first computers were mostly build in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> in United States, this does not mean the code is the best. Right? The code is probably the best in the Western world. But this is far far away from the whole World in fact. Any other nice codes are appropriated. The code is today rather obsolete...&#160;:) Best regards. -- <a href="../../../x/j/a/User%7EXJamRastafire_2aa5.html" title="User:XJamRastafire">XJamRastafire</a> 14:39 Sep 9, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well actually ASCII is only a successful for English, for other languages there has been a prolifertation of competing codes due to the 8-Bit limitation. Probably a good code to go for now is <a href="../../../u/t/f/UTF-8_ae3b.html" title="UTF-8">UTF-8</a>. --HJH</dd>
</dl>
<p>Or, more to the point, <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unicode.html" title="Unicode">Unicode</a>, with UTF-8 as its character encoding. And 7-bit ASCII is a subset of Unicode, and also of UTF-8.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That was my line. I didn't say it was good, I said it was successful. I doubt there is a single serious text-handling application of any kind that doesn't recognize and process ASCII. I doubt there is any other software standard anywhere else, graphics, network, whatever, of which the equivalent statement is true. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrtolan88_d8ce.html" title="User:Ortolan88">Ortolan88</a>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I do believe that too. I was just asking, cause I am curious. There must be a certain key on which they have selected other non-alphabetical characters from the set of the Latin alphabet. Perhaps I exaggerated saying the code is obsolete today. Yes, it is perfect for a Latin based languages and specially for English. And in fact it is possible to (re)build such software standard elsewhere - but I guess this won't never happen. Thank you HJH and Ortolan88 for your answers. Long ago, when PC were not so common as these days, I visited one older friend who had made his own OS and his own ASCII-like code, but this is a history. -- <a href="../../../x/j/a/User%7EXJamRastafire_2aa5.html" title="User:XJamRastafire">XJamRastafire</a> 11:46 Sep 10, 2002 (UTC)</dd>

<p>ASCII is indeed a very successful standard. Today the plain ASCII files (with ASCII characters extended to 8 bits by adding one zero bit) are the only text encoding that will be interpreted correctly by all computers of the world. — <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonedula_2d17.html" title="User:Monedula">Monedula</a> 08:26, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You say: <i>...the first 127 code points of each code are the same as ASCII, and the first 256 code points of Unicode are the same as ISO 8859-1.</i> is this the truth? How does it match with UTF-8?

<dd>UTF-8 is an <i>encoding</i> of Unicode, which is a <i>character set</i>. The first 256 code points of Unicode do match with the 256 code points of ISO 8859-1, however UTF-8's encoding of a series of those code points into a byte stream is different from ISO 8859-1's for the 128-255 range, using two bytes instead of one. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 20:29 Feb 24, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You sure? I thought that other characters like Japanese ones are expressed in three bytes but not two. I am just unsure.

<dd>Yes, I'm quite sure.&#160;:) UTF-8 is an encoding, not a character set. The Unicode characters at code points 128-255 are, by definition, the same as the ISO 8859-1 characters at code points 128-255. UTF-8 encodes these characters in two bytes (and various other characters which are not in ISO 8859-1 in from 2 to 6 bytes). These two-byte values are, obviously, not bit-for-bit identical to one-byte ISO 8859-1 encodings of the same code points.

<p>It is incorrect to imply that ASCII has an "accent" character. It has an apostrophe (in the 1983 version, which is aligned with ISO 646). It has a "grave accent" character in that same version. It does not have an "acute accent". Many Unix users do not much care for the (IMHO mistaken) changes made in the post-1978 versions of ASCII for ISO 646 alignment, particularly the deletion of the alternate interpretations "open single quote" and "close single quote" for ` and ', respectively, which were valid in the 1967 and 1978 versions, and are emphatically quotation marks and not accents or apostrophes in Unix programming, <a href="../../../t/e/x/TeX_cfe6.html" title="TeX">TeX</a>, and the <code>StandardEncoding</code> vector in <a href="../../../p/o/s/PostScript_b6f9.html" title="PostScript">PostScript</a>. <a href="../../../1/8/2E/User%7E18.24.0.120.html" title="User:18.24.0.120">18.24.0.120</a> 20:36, 6 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>The table for control characters has the "Printable representation" column.&#160; There is a font prescription there, saying <i>style="font-family:'lucida sans unicode','arial unicode ms'"</i>.&#160; I understand the reason of this, but still it is incorrect.&#160; Font prescriptions may be used only if there indeed is some reason to use this typeface, and not that one.&#160; But here we only want a character to be displayed, and not to be displayed using a specific typeface.&#160; So it is the browser's responsibility to find an appropriate font for this, not Wikipedia's. — <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonedula_2d17.html" title="User:Monedula">Monedula</a> 01:01, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand your position, but your contention that it is entirely the browser's responsibility is not necessarily reflected in the HTML and CSS specifications. It's good practice, yes, but required, no. CSS in particular states <i>"If there is a matching font face, but it doesn't contain a glyph for the current character, and if there is a next alternative 'font-family' in the font sets, then repeat step 2 with the next alternative 'font-family'. [...] If there is no font within the family selected in 2, then use a UA-dependent default 'font-family' and repeat step 2, using the best match that can be obtained within the default font."</i>. A strict interpretation of this would prevent the browser from finding a match from all available fonts. Given that there are popular user agents that don't make an attempt to find a good font for characters not displayable in the current font, and given the nature of these particular glyphs (there's going to be very little distinction, visually or semantically, between how they render in any typeface), it seems that encouraging the renderer to use commonly deployed fonts that we know support those characters is a good and harmless practice. Ideally, the style info would only be forced upon those user agents that need it, but I doubt Wikipedia is going to implement browser-dependent stylesheets. - <a href="../../../m/j/b/User%7EMjb_eccd.html" title="User:Mjb">mjb</a> 18:23, 12 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm having difficulty understanding a certain aspect of ASCII. It is stated that ASCII is "strictly a 7-bit code", and we mention that historically, 8-bit bytes have been used to transmit ASCII, but that the high bit was either unused or was used for parity. Fair enough. But then we go on to show a chart in which ASCII codes are expressed in binary as 8-bit codes. Indeed, today it is quite common to label data stored and transmitted as 8-bit bytes as "ASCII".</p>
<p>I believe that ASCII was defined only in terms of 7-bit codes, but perhaps became, at some point, one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>an 8-bit code in which the purpose of the high bit is entirely undefined (thus, the burden is on the decoder to know that only the first 7 bits encode the character);</li>
<li>an 8-bit code in which the high bit is undefined and allowed for use for any purpose other than determining which character is encoded (thereby relieving the burden mentioned above); or</li>
<li>an 8-bit code in which the high bit is explicitly defined as being used for padding (which seems to reflect actual practice, but I don't know if it is formally defined this way anywhere)</li>
</ul>
<p>I thought that perhaps <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1345" class="external" title="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1345">RFC 1345</a> was what defined ASCII as 8-bit first, but a brief Google search turns up references to ANSI X3.4 that call it an 8-bit code, so I'd appreciate some clarification here. - <a href="../../../m/j/b/User%7EMjb_eccd.html" title="User:Mjb">mjb</a> 23:11, 18 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Extended ASCII *DOES NOT* reffer to any one character set.

<p>The term "ASCII" is sometimes misused to refer to a superset, or almost superset, of ASCII such as ISO-8859-1. I even once talked to someone who apparently thought "ASCII" was a general term for the whole concept of organising character glyphs in an ordered set. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"></a> — <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 6 July 2005 07:45 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As explained in the article, ASCII is a 7-bit code, so regardless of whether you're using 7-bit or 8-bit bytes, each character will only ever manifest as a value under 128 decimal. Historically, ASCII-encoded data was typically transmitted in 8-bit bytes, with the 8th bit used for either (1) nothing, (2) encoding characters beyond the range of ASCII, or (3) parity (something else unrelated to the encoded text itself). For situation #2 there emerged a number of standards like <a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8859_2729.html" title="ISO 8859">ISO 8859</a> and <a href="../../../c/0/_/C0_and_C1_control_codes_0de8.html" title="C0 and C1 control codes">C1 control codes</a>, but these are not part of ASCII; they are supplements to it. It would be wrong for you to add them to the tables. It might be useful to have a separate table for the IANA-approved "us-ascii" character map, which explicitly defines ASCII as an 8-bit encoding with values 128-255 unassigned/disallowed, but I'm guessing this isn't what you had in mind. — <a href="../../../m/j/b/User%7EMjb_eccd.html" title="User:Mjb">mjb</a> 20:17, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To be brutally honest i think MOST IF NOT ALL of the external links currently in this article deserve to go. we need one reasonally authoritive source for the code chart (unicode.org seems a good choice) in the references section and possiblly one converter tool for seeing the raw ascii values in the external links section. We are not a web directory we are an encyclopeidia and should be carrying references for our content and good links for people to read more on the subject but not a list of every trashy website thats perhipherally associated with a subject. <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlugwash_0129.html" title="User:Plugwash">Plugwash</a> 22:19, 25 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I already stated my reasons for removing it; no amount of "I thought it was still useful" makes up for the shortcomings I pointed out. Will is actually in a better position to make a case for improving the charts in the article on Wikipedia. However, I doubt he wants to do that. The IPs used by the person who added the asciilist.com link were 68.158.159.129 and 74.229.83.147, which are both fed by the same BellSouth router, 65.14.249.166, which is apparently in the state of Georgia. The asciilist.com domain is owned by Will Buckner (wcc@techmonkeys.org) of Cumming, Georgia. The person posting here (and on my talk page) as "Will" (and who is the only person who seems to find asciilist.com worthy of inclusion) just started using the Wikipedia userid wcc44 today. I rest my case. <code>&gt;:D</code>—<a href="../../../m/j/b/User%7EMjb_eccd.html" title="User:Mjb">mjb</a> 03:39, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I need to make myself clearer. I agree with Mjb's words and actions. I strongly oppose linking to a chart which is accompanied by ads. The point I was trying to make is that any case for linking to a chart which has ads would apply just as much to a printer-friendly version of that web page; therefore we should <b>never</b> link to the "unfriendly" version. (If there is no ad-free version of the chart, then I oppose <b>any</b> link to that site.) <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Chittleborough_4a64.html" title="User:Chris Chittleborough">Chris Chittleborough</a> 07:07, 15 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The printer friendly version is, of course, add free (wouldn't be too printer friendly otherwise&#160;:). The PDFs are also add free. Only the front page contains ads at all.
<dl>
<dd>I still think that the arguments in favor of this external link are actually a case for adding a concise chart to Wikipedia (which has a Printable Version link on every article). There could be separate charts for each version of ASCII, too (1963, 1967, etc.). That way the material will be peer-reviewed and better disseminated.—<a href="../../../m/j/b/User%7EMjb_eccd.html" title="User:Mjb">mjb</a> 18:55, 16 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Just because it's a "printable" version doesn't make it good enough. It needs to all fit on one printable page, yet make good use of space so that the fonts arent too small / etc. The version on asciilist.com was designed to fit entirely on one page and be a good quick reference (pin it up in your cubicle, etc.). Even if this could be accomplished on Wikipedia itself, would it really be worth the effort? It is providing something separate from the article. The article's purpose is to educate about ASCII itself (right?), whereas asciilist's printable page is meant as a "reference card" to the ASCII code. --Wcc 01:47, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What about just linking to the printable page / PDF without ads? My intention in building the site was to provide a resource; the ads are just to help pay the bills. What would you guys think of a link directly to <a href="http://www.asciilist.com/index.php?a=showPrintableBasic" class="external free" title="http://www.asciilist.com/index.php?a=showPrintableBasic" rel="nofollow">http://www.asciilist.com/index.php?a=showPrintableBasic</a>&#160;? This page contains no ads, and is a useful resource. It does add value to the article. The reason for which I created the page is that I, as a programmer, have been unable to find a good printable ASCII chart anywhere that isn't covered in ads and watermarks <i>on the printable page</i> and distracting from the content. While the article itself may provide all of the needed information on ASCII, it doesn't provide a quick, printable programmer's ASCII reference. Please consider allowing the add-free printable page to be added as an external link (I won't add it without approval). (And, yes, I am the owner of this site... I never denied that. That does not change the fact that it adds value to this article). Wcc 17:49, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure I understand the question. Danish and Norwegian have three additional letters (æøå and ÆØÅ) compared to English, and it was natural to steal the "next three" symbols from ASCII when making a national variant. These symbolas are not tradionallly common in Danish or Norwegian text. Swedish (and I believe Finnish) has different symbols for the letters denoting (ÄÖÅ and äöå) the same sounds as the Danish/Norwegian letters, but the sorting sequence is different (ÅÄÖ). They choose to use the same sequence as Danish/Norwegian for compatibility, rather than the "correct" sequence.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So it is a design feature of the Danish/Norwegian (and partly Swedish/Finnish) variants of ASCII that they are easily implementable from an ASCII base, but it is unlikley that the ASCII standard was designed with non-English variants in mind. --<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPer_Abrahamsen_cd80.html" title="User:Per Abrahamsen">Per Abrahamsen</a> 09:51, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The comment about <a href="../../../t/e/x/Text_Editor_and_Corrector_16a2.html" title="Text Editor and Corrector">TECO</a> using ESC to introduce commands was incorrect - ESC terminated textual arguments to commands (e.g. the text to be inserted or the name of a file) but the interpreter started out processing commands. I replaced it with a more correct comment and added a note about introducing terminal control sequences. I'd like to say something about using it in command-completion shells, but I don't use one so I'm not familiar with the semantics. <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJordan_Brown_fffa.html" title="User:Jordan Brown">Jordan Brown</a> 05:37, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The explanation for CR vs LF vs NL didn't agree with my understanding of the history - that UNIX and MacOS used single characters for simplicity - and so I "was bold" and fixed it, and added history further back tracing the use of CRLF in files to DEC OSes, which is where CP/M got it. <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJordan_Brown_fffa.html" title="User:Jordan Brown">Jordan Brown</a> 05:37, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In my opinion, the comment about nobody using ^N and ^O to switch character sets was incorrect, and so I removed it. Most if not all ANSI terminal implementations include this feature. One might wonder how often one *wants* to switch character sets, but it used to be quite common as I believe it was how you reached the line-drawing set on VT-100s. Granted, most of my use of this feature is to echo a ^O to recover from cat'ing a file that included a ^N. <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJordan_Brown_fffa.html" title="User:Jordan Brown">Jordan Brown</a> 05:37, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Unicode has a block of "control picture" characters: U+2400 = SYMBOL FOR NULL, U+2401 = SYMBOL FOR START OF HEADING, and so on. The article uses these. However, it turns out that Internet Explorer does <b>not</b> render these characters, even though Firefox does. (Heartfelt rant about software development models omitted for brevity.) My tests used IE V6.0.2900.2180.xpsp_sp2_gdr.050301-1519 on XP service pack 2, and Firefox V1.5.0.1 on the same OS.</p>
<p>I have just edited the article to say that the PR column in the table of control characters may not render properly on some browsers.</p>
<p>Could people with other browsers take a close look at this page and report whether it renders the control picture characters properly? For instance, U+2400 should show up as "NUL" in small letters, probably arranged horizontally (<small>NUL</small> or diagonally (<small><sup>N</sup>U<sub>L</sub></small>).</p>

<dd>IEs font selection sucks. I've put template:unicode in place, if they still don't show can you use character map to tell us which fonts you have that contain them? <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlugwash_0129.html" title="User:Plugwash">Plugwash</a> 12:50, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Good move. But the control picture characters still aren't rendering for me in IE. I suspect that Firefox is constructing the "glyphs" itself from downsized capital letters. (Because some unicode characters are combinations of simple characters — eg. roman numerals — they can be rendered even if not defined directly in fonts.) I would hope that Microsoft's unicode font facilities, whose name currently escapes my mind, does this sort of combining. But, if so, why doesn't IE use combining?

<dd>I don't think this is so much a failure in IE font handling as it is a gap in Windows' Unicode coverage. IE seems to do OK on a wide range of random Unicode characters. I presume that there simply isn't any font (that Windows searches) that includes these particular Unicode code points. I assume that there's a way to augment the fonts that Windows uses, but I haven't yet found anything that describes that process. (Yes, something could artificially construct these characters, but that would imply significant special-case work. It'd be simpler to supply an appropriate font.) <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJordan_Brown_fffa.html" title="User:Jordan Brown">Jordan Brown</a> 06:03, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, Jordan. My guess (based only on stuff I've seen Mozilla browsers do) is that their cross-platform font-handling code has a facility to synthesize missing glyphs from other characters. I'd argue that Microsoft's unicode font system, whose name still escapes my mind, should do the same thing. So, yes, it's a possible defect in that system, not in IE, that causes the problem ... but can we please keep slagging IE anyhow?</dd>
<dd>(Maybe IE7 will fix things? Let's hope it comes with a better font handling system or better fonts.)

<dd>AHA! Imagine my surprise when I happened to look at this page on a different computer, also with IE6, and these characters looked OK! Judiciously trimming down the page yielded the answer: one computer had <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arial_Unicode_MS_afd6.html" title="Arial Unicode MS">Arial Unicode MS</a> and the other didn't. It looks like this font comes with MS Office, and it probably didn't get removed when I uninstalled the trial version of MS Office from this computer. (It's also available for purchase; see the article above.) Other fonts that MediaWiki:Common.css's .Unicode style looks for are: Code2000, TITUS Cyberbit Basic, Doulos SIL, Chrysanthi Unicode, Bitstream Cyberbit, Bitstream CyberBase, Thryomanes, Gentium, GentiumAlt, Visual Geez Unicode, Lucida Grande, Microsoft Sans Serif, and Lucida Sans Unicode.

<dd>Err, I think you mean Ctrl-D, the default end-of-file input character, not Ctrl-C, the interrupt character. Like Ctrl-Z on a DEC OS, Ctrl-D was typed on a terminal to tell the keyboard driver to report end of file, but was not stored <i>in</i> files. Unix and most DEC OSes stored the length of a file in bytes, so there was no need for an in-band end-of-file indicator.</dd>
<dd>(In ASCII, Ctrl-D is "<a href="../../../e/n/d/End-of-transmission_character.html" title="End-of-transmission character">End-of-transmission character</a>" and Ctrl-Z is "<a href="../../../s/u/b/Substitute_character.html" title="Substitute character">Substitute character</a>".

<dd>There was one low-end DEC OS, <a href="../../../r/t/-/RT-11_7870.html" title="RT-11">RT-11</a>, that stored the length of a file only as a number of blocks; RT-11 programs which read text files simply ignored any contiguous sequence of zero bytes at the end of the last block. <a href="../../../c/p/2F/CP_M_29aa.html" title="CP/M">CP/M</a> was reputedly influenced by RT-11 (or at least that's what I heard from fellow RT-11 programmers when CP/M appeared) and stored file lengths as a number of 128-byte "sectors", so they might well have used Ctrl-Z as an in-band indicator for text files. Certainly, MS-DOS used Ctrl-Z as an in-file marker (see <a href="../../../p/n/g/PNG_5550.html#File_header" title="PNG">PNG#File_header</a> for a clever trick based on this), and I believe this, like most of MS-DOS V1, came from CP/M.</dd>

<dd>Sorry, I didn't explain myself well enough. Despite its meaning in ASCII, Ctrl-C is not used as end-of-file in either Unix or DEC OSes; instead it's the stop-what-you're-doing character in both (though Unix allows you to change which character does what). Ctrl-D as the default end-of-file character for Unix is "in the spirit of" ASCII. Ctrl-Z as EOF for all(?) the PDP-11 DEC OSes and VMS is totally unrelated to the ASCII meaning. (I always assumed they chose it because it's easy to remember that end-of-alphabet means end-of-file.) I think you're right that (1) CP/M used Ctrl-Z for end-of-file, and (2) they they got it from DEC (along with <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peripheral_Interchange_Program_ecd3.html" title="Peripheral Interchange Program">PIP</a>).</dd>
<dd>The relevance of this is that most of the ASCII control characters are used in ways that have nothing to do with their ASCII definitions. Basically, they are hangovers from the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Teletype.html" title="Teletype">teletype</a> era.

<p>Originally UNIX (6th and 7th editions) used # as erase and @ as line kill (with ^D as EOF, DEL/RUBOUT as Interrupt and ^\ as Quit) - see unix/tty.h on sheet 79 in chapter 5 of "Lions' Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition with Source Code" <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1-57398-013-7</a>. This was because of the use of hard copy teletype terminals (I assume). Later on when glass ttys became popular the erase character was changed to ^H. Still later @ became a regular character (allowing it to be used for email addresses). BSD UNIX changed things to match the characters used by DEC on its VAX VMS operating system - DEL was reassigned to be erase (instead of ^H) and ^C replaced it for interrupt.

<dd>Many years ago, when I first used Unix, I was <i>very</i> startled to find #=erase. I seem to recall that the way to input "#" was to press "\" and "#". (In other words, backslash was the terminal-driver-escape character. In modern Unix terms, LNEXT defaulted to \ instead of ^V.) Does anyone know for sure?</dd>
<dd>DEC had a fairly standard set of Control-key actions, but they were hard-coded. Eg., ^U=erase, ^C=interrupt(like Unix SIGINT). On TOPS-10 and TOPS-20, ^T (T for Tell?) produced a status report (CPU time used, etc). VMS had ^T and added ^Y (= Unix SIGQUIT). BSD (4.3 onwards) has a STATUS key, defaulting to ^T, which generates a SIGINFO.</dd>

<p>The article <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newline.html" title="Newline">Newline</a> states&#160;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The C programming language provides the escape sequences '\n' (newline) and '\r' (carriage return). However, contrary to popular belief, these are in fact not required to be equivalent to the ASCII LF and CR control characters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But reading the table on the ASCII page it gives the suggestion that \n is always mapped to ASCII LF according to some (C) standard which isn't true for all C compilers. Not sure if its worth mentioning though...</p>

<p>This article has a table with notes inside the table. The notes are currently implemented with {{<a href="../../../r/e/f/Template%7ERef_0622.html" title="Template:Ref">ref</a>}}/{{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENote_9446.html" title="Template:Note">note</a>}}, but they has been converted to cite.php a few times with an automatic tool. This conversion moves the notes away from the table. I think these notes should stay with the table. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 12:45, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your excellent work on this article, Gimmetrow.</dd>
<dd>I agree that the notes should stay with the table.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps we should (shudder) "<tt>subst:</tt>" the {{<a href="../../../r/e/f/Template%7ERef_0622.html" title="Template:Ref">ref</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENote_9446.html" title="Template:Note">note</a>}} tags? That would stop the well-intentioned automated conversion, but it would make subsequent editing <i>much</i> harder. Just a thought.</dd>

<dd>Whatever they might mean, they are not ASCII character codes. ASCII is a 7-bit character code standard. There are no ASCII characters for codes other than 00 to 7F. — <a href="../../../l/o/a/User%7ELoadmaster_9161.html" title="User:Loadmaster">Loadmaster</a> 20:44, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
