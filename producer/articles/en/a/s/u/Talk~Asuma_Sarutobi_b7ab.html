<dd>Can Asuma use Earth Jutsu like Sarutobi could? Then he would have to have an affinity for Earth also right, like his father for instance? <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonball1986_ab56.html" title="User:Dragonball1986">User:Dragonball1986</a>
<dl>
<dd>He's a wind jutsu user, and that's all we know. Element affinities can't be purely hereditary, or else how did they develop in the first place?
<dl>
<dd>Elemental affinities aren't always hereditary, it seems to me, but it also looks like parentage probably has an effect on one's elemental affinity. For example, all the Uchihas had an affinity for fire jutsus, and from what I've seen, Haku's family had affinity for ice jutsus(combining wind and water). Or it could be that Sarutobi was so well versed in jutsus and has such great chakra control that he could draw from any element, but had a pronounced affinity for Fire jutsu and Earth jutsu... Another theory is that the elemental affinity itself is hereditary(meaning having affinity for the elements, rather than a specific element), and the element one is able to use varies from person to person, with a high probability of elements matching that of their parents(IE Sasuke's fire affinity).--<a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVercalos_9f82.html" title="User:Vercalos">Vercalos</a> 07:44, 23 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What I don't like about them throwing in elements is that now, everyone is overthinking this. The writers left it vague as to what elements actually do when used, other than their effects on paper, and scattered tidbits with no currently logical link between them (eg: slicing wind attacks and electricity in the Chidori).</dd>
<dd>Basically, Haku's Ice was a combination of Water and Wind due to his bloodline trait, Hyoton. It was his kekkei genkai that ran in the family; the chakra affinity was not genetic on its own. As for the Uchiha, note that Sasuke's signature ability is of electric element, which nobody else in his family (to our knowledge) used. Or perhaps by "Uchiha Madara's chakra," Yoko was referring to electrical chakra. I really don't know...</dd>
<dd>Personally, I think that the writers weren't thinking this far ahead when they started the series and had no plans for an elemental system, then threw this in as an excuse to power up the Rasengan. So, don't overthink it. If it says that Asuma uses wind-elemental chakra, then by all means, ignore the Sandaime and picture Asuma with wind-elemental chakra.</dd>

<dd>I agree, the elemental chakra thing was added just to power up the overused Rasengan. However, we must remember that at the beginning of the series, the elements were mentioned as to be part of the Jutsu creation. What I think is that anyone may use any element Jutsu (Kakashi has used the five, if I'm not mistaken) but the new concept of elemental chakra helps so that the jutsus of certain element are more powerful. In other words, it's not that important.... Cancerbero 8 02:03, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>I just read a spoiler pg in ch. 328, Asuma dies and shikamaru lights up a cigarette in asuma's pouch and smokes it while crying.

<p>Asuma dies in 328 (if the spoiler is true -- usually is if there is a whole translation and pics). He dies after his last puff of cig.</p>
<p>I've seen the spoilers. However, until the RAW is published this section should not be updated. I think spoilers have been wrong in the past. I think he's probably dead, but we should wait until we're sure.</p>

<p>They wouldn't. If Sandaime were Konohamaru's maternal grandfather then Sandaime would have a daughter who would be Asuma's sister and Konohamaru's mother. Ergo, Asuma would be Konohamaru's uncle. I don't know where the cousin idea comes from. Maybe there's something I've missed?</p>

<p>Should he still be in the main character section. He is dead. Naruto is going to have more main characters appears and others die. I'm pretty sure most of the adults are going to die as the kids take over. This question cam to me when I was visiting other pages. Some have a deceased person page so maybe we should have one for all the important dead characters. What do you guys think--------Noman953</p>
<dl>
<dd>Firstly, he's listed under "Supporting", not "Main". With that said, I see no reason to relocate him since he's doing no harm being listed with the rest of his former team. Besides, he's still a driving force behind the current plot (Team 10 wouldn't be having a rematch with Akatsuki if Asuma had lived). If Team 10 ever gets a new sensei, then we can think about moving Asuma. <i><b>~Snapper<a href="../../../s/n/a/User_talk%7ESnapper2_c216.html" title="User talk:Snapper2">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Snapper2_6870.html" title="Special:Contributions/Snapper2">o</a></b></i> 21:35, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
