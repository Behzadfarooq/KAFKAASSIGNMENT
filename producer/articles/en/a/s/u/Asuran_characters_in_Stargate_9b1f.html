<p><b>Cetus</b> was an <a href="../../../a/s/u/Asuran.html" title="Asuran">Asuran</a> and enemy of Dr. <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Weir_%28Stargate%29_cf99.html" title="Elizabeth Weir (Stargate)">Elizabeth Weir</a> and her team.</p>
<p>Cetus was the second-in-command of the attack team sent to capture <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis_%28Stargate%29_4531.html" title="Atlantis (Stargate)">Atlantis</a> in retribution for the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_%28Stargate%29_eeed.html" title="Ancient (Stargate)">Ancients</a>' betrayal millennia ago. As the handful of Ancients who had recently retaken control over their city were still under the impression that the Asurans were unable to harm their creators, due to a directive that had been deleted from their base programming some time ago, they were unprepared for the invading Asurans. After Cetus and his team had taken control over the city, they killed the surviving Ancients after having probed their minds.</p>
<p>Although the <a href="../../../s/g/c/SGC_8568.html" title="SGC">SGC</a> had decided to destroy Atlantis after the city had fallen to the invaders, Dr. Weir disobeyed orders and travelled back to the <a href="../../../p/e/g/Pegasus_Galaxy_%28Stargate%29_dcaf.html" title="Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)">Pegasus Galaxy</a> accompanied by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Sheppard_%28Stargate%29_0b63.html" title="John Sheppard (Stargate)">John Sheppard</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carson_Beckett_c3d7.html" title="Carson Beckett">Carson Beckett</a> in a <a href="../../../p/u/d/Puddle_Jumper_%28Stargate%29_d2f6.html" title="Puddle Jumper (Stargate)">Puddle Jumper</a>. After having enlisted the help of <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronon_Dex_78d6.html" title="Ronon Dex">Ronon Dex</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/y/Teyla_Emmagan_fb1d.html" title="Teyla Emmagan">Teyla Emmagan</a>, the Jumper travelled through the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stargate_%28device%29.html" title="Stargate (device)">Stargate</a> to the fallen city.</p>
<p>Unable to raise the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Iris_%28Stargate%29_b12e.html#Atlantis_Iris_shield" title="Iris (Stargate)">Iris shield</a>, Cetus was present in the Gate Room when the invading Jumper emerged. Although the ship was heavily fired upon, the Jumper escaped by breaching the Gate Room's outer wall, and dropped explosives before departing, heavily damaging the Control Tower. Cetus however was able to escape before the bomb detonated.</p>
<p>As Talus realized that the Jumper had briefly communicated with survivors still hiding in the city, Cetus was sent to search the city for the ones Sheppard came to rescue. After the search parties discovered General <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_O%27Neill_726e.html" title="Jack O'Neill">Jack O'Neill</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Woolsey_4bf4.html" title="Richard Woolsey">Richard Woolsey</a>, the two were captured, and Cetus probed Woolsey's mind for information. He discovered what appeared to be information about Sheppard's plan involving destroying the city's <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_technology_in_Stargate_76e6.html#Shields" title="Ancient technology in Stargate">shield</a> emitters.</p>
<p>However, as <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodney_McKay_ea26.html" title="Rodney McKay">Rodney McKay</a> had fed Woolsey and O'Neill false information regarding their intentions, the Asurans were unaware that the shield had instead been modified to emit a massive energy burst similar to the wave emitted by an <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tau%27ri_technology_in_Stargate_f51d.html#Anti-Replicator_Gun_.28ARG.29" title="Tau'ri technology in Stargate">ARG</a>. As Talus ordered Cetus to activate the shield upon the arrival of the <a href="../../../d/a/e/Daedalus_class_battlecruiser.html#Daedalus" title="Daedalus class battlecruiser">Daedalus</a>, he secured his own doom. His body was subsequently disintegrated when the wave reached his position, severing the kiron pathways between his individual cells. <sup id="_ref-The_Return_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Return" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Though he is presumed to be dead, its entirely possible that the subspace link among the Asurans would allow them to replicate him as Oberoth himself was replicated after his destruction around Lantea.</p>

<p><b>Niam</b> was an untraditional Asuran and hesitant ally of <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Weir_%28Stargate%29_cf99.html" title="Elizabeth Weir (Stargate)">Elizabeth Weir</a> and her team.</p>
<p>Niam was known for believing that his people had become stagnant in their evolutionary path. He believed it was his people's destiny to eventually <a href="../../../a/s/c/Ascension_%28Stargate%29_3a10.html" title="Ascension (Stargate)">ascend</a>, and finally be able to completely emulate their creators, the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_%28Stargate%29_eeed.html" title="Ancient (Stargate)">Ancients</a>. However, he was convinced that the <a href="../../../a/g/g/Aggression.html" title="Aggression">aggression</a> in the Asuran's programming prevented them from ascending. He therefore had a philosophical disagreement with High Councilor Oberoth, who preferred the status quo. Niam nevertheless remained an adviser to Oberoth and his Council.</p>
<p>Niam was fascinated with the members of the Atlantis expedition who visited <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_City_Ship_e63a.html#Asuras" title="Ancient City Ship">Asuras</a> in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. When he realized their guests had knowledge about ascension, he expressed interest in learning more from them. However, Oberoth imprisoned the visitors, and after learning of <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis_%28Stargate%29_4531.html" title="Atlantis (Stargate)">Atlantis'</a> survival decided to destroy it themselves. Niam pleaded for the survival of the captured Weir and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Sheppard_%28Stargate%29_0b63.html" title="John Sheppard (Stargate)">Shepperd</a>'s team.</p>
<p>However, Niam, along with the few who also believed ascension was the Asurans' future, secretly struck a deal with the the captured members of the Atlantis expedition: in exchange for Dr. <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodney_McKay_ea26.html" title="Rodney McKay">Rodney McKay</a> removing the base aggression from his people's programming, which they could not do themselves, Niam and his allies would do everything in their power to make Oberoth reconsider destroying Atlantis and help in Earth's fight with the Wraith. He was also the Asuran who informed Weir's team about his people's true nature and history.</p>
<p>Dr. Weir initially agreed, but eventually decided to betray Niam's trust and try to destroy Asuras themselves, ensuring Atlantis' safety. McKay had discovered a way to freeze the Asurans in a feedback loop for a small period of time, but because Niam's programming had been altered, he did not get stuck in this loop as his fellow Asurans were. Dr. Weir convinced him to escape along with her team, and made him even enter the access codes that permitted McKay to overload the three <a href="../../../z/p/m/ZPM_3517.html" title="ZPM">ZPM</a>'s powering the city, destroying Asuras just as it entered orbit around Atlantis.</p>
<p>Niam escaped aboard a <a href="../../../p/u/d/Puddle_jumper_%28Stargate%29_f2c0.html" title="Puddle jumper (Stargate)">Puddle Jumper</a> with the Atlantis team, but when the rest of his people became aware of what he had done, his programming was reset, reverting back to his aggressive nature. Niam subsequently tried to strangle Dr. Weir, forcing Sheppard and the others to open the rear hatch of the Jumper, blowing him into space. <sup id="_ref-Progeny_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Progeny" title="">[2]</a></sup> The few nanites introduced into Weir's bloodstream however became a threat to her life, before they were eventually destroyed by her own <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immune_system.html" title="Immune system">immune system</a> and Dr. <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carson_Beckett_c3d7.html" title="Carson Beckett">Carson Beckett</a>'s medical care. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>After Atlantis was overrun by the Asurans, Niam was retrieved by Sheppard and his team in an attempt to use him to transmit a program that would immobilize the Asurans and allow them to be easily destroyed. However, the ruse was discovered and Niam revived, forcing McKay to destroy him with an Anti-Replicator Gun. <sup id="_ref-The_Return_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Return" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Though he is presumed to be dead, its entirely possible that the subspace link among the Asurans would allow them to replicate him as Oberoth himself was replicated after his destruction around Lantea.</p>

<p><b>Oberoth</b> was the High Councilor of Asuras and leader of the Asuran people.</p>
<p>Oberoth apparently was the first of the <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nanite.html" title="Nanite">nanite</a>-based machines that took on the form of their creators, the Ancients. Like all Asurans, Oberoth was governed by the same base aggression in their programming. This aggression was built into them as the Ancients were hoping to use the nanites as a devastating weapon against the <a href="../../../w/r/a/Wraith_%28Stargate%29_240c.html" title="Wraith (Stargate)">Wraith</a>. Oberoth was a fierce proponent of maintaining the status quo, and was not interested in ascension. This made him an opponent of Niam, although Oberoth frequently relied on Niam's advice, and occasionally approved some of his requests. Oberoth also accuses the Ancients of being arrogant, what in his view led to their defeat by the Wraith. However, Dr. Weir accused him of being at least as arrogant as his Lantean cousins. He was also one of the few Asurans who were not amused by visitors.</p>
<p>When several member of the Atlantis expedition visited Asuras in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, Oberoth clearly indicated they were not welcome. When Dr. Weir subsequently asked Oberoth for a number of spare ZPM's, he refused her request. However, he tried to appease her by informing Weir that the eradication of the Wraith was among his people's long-term goals, although it's doubtful he was being honest.</p>
<p>The aggression in his programming eventually led him to take Dr. Weir's team prisoner, and after personally invading the mind of John Sheppard and learning about Atlantis' survival, he decided to destroy the former capital of his creators himself. However, he agreed to keep his prisoners alive, as requested by his aid Niam. This eventually proved to be a mistake, when the Atlantean visitors were able to escape, and, with the help of Niam, freeze the remaining Asurans (including Oberoth) in a feedback loop.</p>
<p>Oberoth eventually retook control of his own programming, and tried to prevent Weir's team from reaching the Puddle Jumper bay. However, Dr. McKay, again with Niam's assistance, had managed to overload Asuras' ZPM's, and the city was subsequently destroyed in orbit around Atlantis. <sup id="_ref-Progeny_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Progeny" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Oberoth was later revealed to have survived, as his consciousness was perserved in the collective of the Asurans subspace network. After the <a href="../../../d/a/e/Daedalus_class_battlecruiser.html#Apollo" title="Daedalus class battlecruiser"><i>Apollo</i></a> launched a massive nuclear attack on Asuras, Oberoth had a sattelite carrying a Stargate sent to Lantea, where it launched a beam at Atlantis. Dr. Weir attempted to negotiate with Oberoth, but he simply tried to upload a virus into the Atlantean computers. <sup id="_ref-First_Strike_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-First_Strike" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

After having enlisted the help of <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronon_Dex_78d6.html" title="Ronon Dex">Ronon Dex</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/y/Teyla_Emmagan_fb1d.html" title="Teyla Emmagan">Teyla Emmagan</a>, the Jumper travelled through the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stargate_%28device%29.html" title="Stargate (device)">Stargate</a> to the fallen city.</p>
<p>Unable to raise the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Iris_%28Stargate%29_b12e.html#Atlantis_Iris_shield" title="Iris (Stargate)">Iris shield</a>, Talus was present in the Gate Room when the invading Jumper emerged. Although the ship was heavily fired upon, the Jumper escaped by breaching the Gate Room's outer wall, and dropped explosives before departing, heavily damaging the Control Tower. Talus however was able to escape before the bomb detonated.</p>
<p>Realizing the Jumper briefly communicated with survivors still hiding in the city, Talus sent search parties to find the ones Sheppard came to rescue. When the Jumper later reappeared, he ordered his subordinates to shoot it down, although Sheppard was able to avoid the <a href="../../../d/r/o/Drone_weapon.html" title="Drone weapon">Drone weapons</a> fired at him. After the search parties discovered General <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_O%27Neill_726e.html" title="Jack O'Neill">Jack O'Neill</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Woolsey_4bf4.html" title="Richard Woolsey">Richard Woolsey</a>, the two were captured, and Talus probed O'Neill's mind for information.</p>
<p>As <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodney_McKay_ea26.html" title="Rodney McKay">Rodney McKay</a> had fed Woolsey misinformation in an attempt to deceive the Asurans, Talus was unaware that Sheppard's team had been able to modify the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_technology_in_Stargate_76e6.html#Shields" title="Ancient technology in Stargate">City Shield</a> to emit a massive energy wave, similar to the wave emitted by an <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tau%27ri_technology_in_Stargate_f51d.html#Anti-Replicator_Gun_.28ARG.29" title="Tau'ri technology in Stargate">ARG</a>. Talus was subsequently killed when the wave reached his position, as the kiron pathways between his individual cells were severed, desintigrating his body in the process. <sup id="_ref-The_Return_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Return" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Though he is presumed to be dead, its entirely possible that the subspace link among the Asurans would allow them to replicate him as Oberoth himself was replicated after his destruction around Lantea.</p>
