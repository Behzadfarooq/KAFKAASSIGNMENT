<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/u/Asuran.html" title="Edit section: Origin">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Origin</span></h3>
<p>The first hints of the Asurans were seen in a lab on Atlantis where the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis_Expedition_88a2.html" title="Atlantis Expedition">Atlantis Expedition</a> encountered a sinister nanite weapon that infected the humans at the labs vicinity. The nanites would kill those infected by it who would begin to see terrifying images of a death-like figure approaching them before they died. The nanites were vulnerable to an EM pulse though they did not affect those with the Ancient gene. (see 'Hot Zone')</p>
<p><a name="Plot" id="Plot"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/u/Asuran.html" title="Edit section: Plot">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Plot</span></h3>
<p>Desperate for more effective means of defeating the <a href="../../../w/r/a/Wraith_%28Stargate%29_240c.html" title="Wraith (Stargate)">Wraith</a>, the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_%28Stargate%29_eeed.html" title="Ancient (Stargate)">Ancients</a> created the predecessors to the Asurans as part of an experiment to create an artificial bioweapon in the form of <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nanotechnology.html" title="Nanotechnology">nanites</a> that would infiltrate and destroy the Wraith from within. To that end, these self-replicating nanites were programmed with an aggression surpassing that of the Wraith. As they grew in numbers, the nanites began to assume the form of their creators. Unable to remove the aggression that had been programmed into them, giving them a rage they could not contain or understand, the Asurans, as they came to call themselves, requested the Ancients do so; a request which was denied since their creators sought to use them as weapons and since the Asurans' programming prevented them from doing harm to their creators.</p>
<p>Upon concluding their research into the feasibility of nanites as weapons, the Ancients destroyed their creations and deleted all traces of them from their database, save for the planet's gate address. A few Asurans, however, survived. Through their replicative abilities, they brought about a "second birth" - this time, not only taking the form of their creators, but also recreating their city on a far grander scale.</p>
<p>Several thousand years later, they were discovered by the Atlantis expedition. Their population had grown to number in the millions and some, such as Niam, had even began to contemplate ascension. Already they have a plan to destroy the Wraith, though it is a slow, long term plan that does not have the humans' best interests in mind. Believing that the aggressive tendencies the Ancients had programmed into them was what was preventing them from ascending, Niam enlisted <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodney_McKay_ea26.html" title="Rodney McKay">McKay</a>'s help to remove these tendencies. Although McKay's attempts were successful, they were discovered before the rewritten command codes could be distributed to the others.</p>
<p>Concurrently, at the direction of Oberoth - their leader - the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_City_Ship_e63a.html" title="Ancient City Ship">Asuran city-ship</a> jumped into hyperspace in an attempt to destroy Atlantis. This attempt was thwarted by McKay, with the assistance of Niam, who used the city-ship's <a href="../../../z/e/r/Zero_Point_Module_a8b0.html" title="Zero Point Module">ZPMs</a> to destroy it.<sup id="_ref-progeny_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-progeny" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Later, it was revealed that the Asurans had, perhaps due to McKay's early efforts, managed to rewrite the part of their initial programming that prevented them from attacking the Ancients. This allowed the Asurans to capture Atlantis, by surprise, and kill the Ancients who defended it.<sup id="_ref-return_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-return" title="">[2]</a></sup> The Asurans secured the city but faced a delay when a puddle jumper that carried a strike force from the Atlantis expedition who, after defying their leaders orders, left a bomb in the control tower before leaving. The control room faced heavy damage, however, the Asurans began immediate repairing procedures which took up to an hour. They were also probing the minds of <a href="../../../g/e/n/General.html" title="General">General</a> <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_O%27Neill_726e.html" title="Jack O'Neill">Jack O'Neill</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Woolsey_4bf4.html" title="Richard Woolsey">Richard Woolsey</a> for vital information. The damage dealt to them required the Asuran strike team to dismantle their own starship and use it to repair the damaged parts of the city. Using their own ZPM power modules, the Asurans planned to leave the Lantian system and destroy the Daedalus, which was attempting to destroy the city in order to prevent it from falling into Asuran hands. This Asuran strike force was destroyed when replicator disruptor technology was tied into the shield emitters and thus destroyed all of the Asurans in the city before they had a chance to adapt.</p>
<p>The Asurans would decide upon a different way on defeating the threat the humans posed to them. They would begin constructing starships on their homeworld with the express purpose of fighting the Humans in their home galaxy where <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> is located. This preparation would be destroyed when the starship Apollo launched a surprise surgical strike against the Asuran homeworld. With the devastation they faced, the Asurans began a new strike against Atlantis itself using a powerful energy weapon directed from an orbital satellite <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stargate.html" title="Stargate">Stargate</a> with the sole aim of destroying Atlantis.<sup id="_ref-First_Strike_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-First_Strike" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is revealed that the Asurans hate Humans, the Humans of Earth in particular. This could be because Ancients favoured Humans and selected the Tau'ri as their inheritors and descendants, as well as returning to Earth after the war with the Wraith and living out their days there.</p>
<p><a name="Characteristics" id="Characteristics"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/u/Asuran.html" title="Edit section: Characteristics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Characteristics</span></h2>
<p>The Asurans possess much of the knowledge of the Ancients, as evidenced by their manufacturing of ZPMs and by their creation of a near identical city-ship to Atlantis. They also possess the ability to directly interface with the human subconscious - just as human-form Replicators do and the ability to walk-through walls. It is also known that their strength is far superior to that of a normal human, as Oberoth was shown to lift Mckay with one arm and swat Ronon aside with little effort, again just like the human-form Replicators.</p>
<p>Their interdependent organ constituents consist of over three billion chemical base sequences. EMP weapons are a threat to the nanites' base forms. However, they are somehow able to integrate organic technology into themselves to make them somewhat immune to this vector of attack ("The Real World").</p>
<p><a name="Nanites" id="Nanites"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/u/Asuran.html" title="Edit section: Nanites">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Nanites</span></h3>
<p>The Asurans are actually made entirely of nanites that were created with the express purpose of fighting the Wraith. Eventually, it evolved into their current human shaped form and their appearance is only a mask which hides the true nature, as well as abilites, of the Asurans. The nanites themselves are self replicating machines that can survive as long as a miniscule amount functions. This makes them very resilient as a small amount of nanites managed to survive orbital strikes from Lantean starships and were enough to continue their species. The nanites are capable of using any material for this task, be it mechanical or biological in origin.</p>
<p>The nanites provide them with several advantages the first of which is that they can penetrate solid objects. This allows them to pass through doors via the smallest openings. Another ability is one they share with the Human Form Replicators which is moving their hands within the skull of human. The nanites allows the Asurans to experience the memories and knowledge of the person thy are subjecting the 'interrogation' to though the pain suffered varies on whether the Asuran does the task in a brutal or kinder fashion. Whether they share the Human Form Replicators ability to fashion bladed weapons from their body parts is unknown currently.</p>
<p>A more sinister nature of the nanites is that, once in contact with a human body, they can be left in trace amounts which can be directed by the Asuran mind. The presence of such nanites within a human body can leave the human in a coma-like state while the Asurans mask themselves as being part of the immune system. The nanites work to circumvent the human mind while they use the human biology to incorporated organic components into their selves. This can possibly potentially result in the birth of a new Asuran in quite a brutal fashion for those infected by the host. The infected body remains in a comma-like state, however, their minds are active and put through an imaginery world in order to lull the body into a compliant state in order to allow the nanites to continue their work.</p>
<p>An interesting observation is that the nanites themselves in their smaller state are vulnerable to EM pulses however once they incorporate organic components within the system this weakness is quickly erased. In addition to this, the presence of Wraith tissue can result in the nanites to go immediately to the 'infected' part and exterminate the Wraith DNA. Though they appear to be intelligent enough to leave parts of themselves in certain locations in order to ensure that they survive. ("The Real World").</p>
<p>Mention is made when the Asurans manage to gain a foothold on Atlantis of disassembling their ship for additional parts to repair the cityship. Whether this was done through their nanite means or other is unknown. However, it was done in a short span of time which suggests that they accomplish this feat at an extremely fast and efficient rate.</p>
<p><a name="Subspace_Link" id="Subspace_Link"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/u/Asuran.html" title="Edit section: Subspace Link">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Subspace Link</span></h3>
<p>Like their Replicator cousins, the Asurans are all tied to one another through a sophisticated subspace network that connects each and every member of the race. Despite this though, they seem to be somewhat more individualistic compared to the swarm mentality of the Replicators with each Asuran being an entirely independant entity. This is, ironically, very similar to the <a href="../../../w/r/a/Wraith_%28Stargate%29_240c.html" title="Wraith (Stargate)">Wraith</a>, the race the Lanteans created the Asurans to combat. The benefits of the subspace link allows the Asurans to keep up to date with anything another Asuran experiences. This allowed the race to realise the betrayal by Niam against their kind and allowed them to 'reset' him to his original state. As such, the link serves as a form of control mechanism for their kind and he was subsequently 'reset' which suggests that his more peaceful attitude was not always there but something learnt during his existence and he was thus returned to his more aggressive root behaviour.<sup id="_ref-progeny_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-progeny" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, the collective mind of the Asurans is capable of storing the essence of the different kinds of Asurans. This essentially allows a deceased Asuran to be replicated again, as was the case with <a href="../../../a/s/u/Asuran_characters_in_Stargate_9b1f.html#Oberoth" title="Asuran characters in Stargate">Oberoth</a>.<sup id="_ref-First_Strike_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-First_Strike" title="">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Its quite possible that this same subspace link allows the Asurans to eventually develop an immunity to Anti-Replicator weapons, however, this has not been demonstrated yet on the show.</p>
<p><a name="Base_Code" id="Base_Code"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/u/Asuran.html" title="Edit section: Base Code">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Base Code</span></h3>
<p>The Asuran base code is the underlining program that governs the race and was created by the Lantean species when they first made the original nanite virus.</p>
<p>One of the important aspects of the base code prevents the Asurans from striking against their creators. They were also prevented from altering their own base code which severely limited their behaviour in regards as changing as a species.</p>
<p>The programming, however, could be altered by other species as members of the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis_Expedition_88a2.html" title="Atlantis Expedition">Atlantis Expedition</a> demonstrated. Unfortunately, this had the effect of allowing the Asurans access to their own base code and allowing them to alter it to suit their needs. Such as altering the programming that prevented them from attacking their creators.<sup id="_ref-return_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-return" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Terminating_an_Asuran" id="Terminating_an_Asuran"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/u/Asuran.html" title="Edit section: Terminating an Asuran">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Terminating an Asuran</span></h3>
<p>The Asurans nature of being a cloud of nanites makes them very resilient to physical harm and even weapons, whether they are projectile or energy, seem to have no way of harming them. Conventional guns appear to have minimal effect on them. <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miscellaneous_technology_in_Stargate_61d1.html#Ronon.27s_Gun" title="Miscellaneous technology in Stargate">Ronon's Gun</a>, however, can temporarily stun them (as opposed to the original Replicators and Human Form Replicators, which were immune to any energy weapon used against them). Human-built 'knockoffs' of the Ancient/Asgard <a href="../../../r/e/p/Replicator_%28Stargate%29_9d8b.html" title="Replicator (Stargate)">Replicator</a> disrupter weapon have been designed to destroy them (the weapons were not seen when the original Replicators were active, leading to the conclusion that Stargate command recently designed them to deal with the Asurans, or that they took several seasons to develop).</p>
<p>A single pulse from the weapon would reduce an Asuran into its component blocks, by severing the connection that holds each block together, and thus was shown to be effective, however, there was worry that the Asurans could adapt to the frequency of the weapon and thus develop an immunity to its effects. In the concluding part of the Return, it was also shown that the Asurans require some input of energy and, after being denied a power source for long periods, makes them vulnerable and incapacitated. However, it only takes them a short amount of time to adjust and become a deadly threat once again.</p>
<p>However, as seen in the case of Oberoth, the Asurans are capable of replicating a destroyed member of their kind thanks in part to their subspace link. This can effectively make members of this race immortal for as long as the part of the race survives.</p>
<p><a name="Society" id="Society"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/u/Asuran.html" title="Edit section: Society">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Society</span></h2>
<p>Little is known of Asuran society and culture except that they have somewhat mimicked the Lanteans in appearance at least. Most of the race seemingly have a cold hatred towards their creators due to the attempted extermination of their race. The entire race seems centered around their homeworld of Asuras which has dotted by vast cities. They seem isolationist and regard humans as lesser beings. They also demonstrated no fear of the Wraith and claimed that they have a plan that will nullify the Wraith threat but the details of this plan were never explained.</p>
<p>Despite this, there does appear to be a small enclave among their kind that still admires and respects the Ancients. This group would go as far as imitate their makers to the fullest extent by <a href="../../../a/s/c/Ascension_%28Stargate%29_3a10.html" title="Ascension (Stargate)">Ascending</a>. However, the group has had little success in achieving this goal with the possible explanation being their aggressive natural programming which may be the only thing preventing them from achieving their goal. This does not appear to be a natural state as Niam was reset by the Asurans and he reverted to a far more aggressive state compared to his calm demeanour when he was first encountered. The fate of this group after the destruction of the Asuran cityship is unknown.</p>
<p>The vast majority, however, seem to wish to continue their isolation until they encountered the Atlantis Expedition. After this encounter, the Asurans seem to be bent on destroying the 'favored' children of the Ancients as a last act of revenge.</p>
<p><a name="Tactics" id="Tactics"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/u/Asuran.html" title="Edit section: Tactics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Tactics</span></h2>
<p>Little is known of Asuran tactics but they seem to favour conventional manner of defeating opponents through the use of force and their advanced technology. It is known that when this is not available, the Asurans resort to other means of achieving their goals such as the deployment of a satellite weapon to destroy Atlantis.</p>
<p><a name="Technology" id="Technology"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/u/Asuran.html" title="Edit section: Technology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Technology</span></h2>
<p>The Asurans are perhaps one of the most advanced races within the Stargate universe and have owed much of this to their replication and imitation of the technology of their creators, the Ancients. While the Asurans are quite capable of building advanced Starships, quite probably duplicates of Lantean warships, they are vulnerable insomuch as the Starships are purely conventional technology. Unlike Replicator ships which are often partially or wholely made up of Replicator cells making them all but immune to energy weapons, Asuran ships are just as vulnerable to conventional anti ship weapons as Ancient ships...which given their sophistication, is not that much comfort given their Replicator-like industrial capabilities.</p>
<p>The race use energy 'pistol' weaponry that seems to be entirely of their own design and also produced cityships. They also have the ability to produce <a href="../../../z/p/m/ZPM_3517.html" title="ZPM">ZPMs</a> readily which provides them an almost endless supply of power. Furthermore, they have demonstrated the ability to use drone technology.</p>
<p>A unique piece of Asuran technology is the production of a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stargate.html" title="Stargate">Stargate</a> satellite weapon that possessed components for a hyperdrive to reach its destination after which it would activate and a powerful sustained energy beam would shoot from the wormhole. The beam had the added benefit of powering the shield to protect the satellite and was said to have been powered by ZPMs. What's confusing though is that the stargate had only 8 chevrons, which could simply have been a mistake with the <a href="../../../c/g/i/CGI_7d73.html" title="CGI">CGI</a> in making the satellite, or it could have been that they themselves were capeable of producing stargates, and that this one was only intended to connect with the Asuran homeworld. The eighth chevron would allow it to connect from a different galaxy.</p>
<p>Very little has been seen of the Asuran space fleet which may only be recently being produced to combat humans. However, their nanite nature allows them to produce such works at a remarkable pace as the Asurans were quickly able to produce a fleet of starships with the purpose of attacking <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a>. This perhaps suggests that, like the Ancients, the Asurans have developed intergalactic hyperdrives to journey from one galaxy to another.</p>

<p>The fact that they are vulnerable to EMP and to a limited extent, stunned by energy weapons, and have to resort to building ships instead of becoming ships suggests the Asurans are less sophisticated than the human form Replicators seen in Stargate-SG1. This is not an unreasonable conclusion as while the original Replicators had a technology base comprised of Asgard, Ancient and other races, the Asurans have limited themselves to perfectly duplicating late Lantian era technology only. However, with the destruction of the original Replicators, even duplication of late era Ancient technology would put them among the most advanced races in the universe.</p>
