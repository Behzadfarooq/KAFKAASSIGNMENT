<p>Personal view: I agree that Asuka is a proud, strong individual. Her goal is to succeed. As the story goes she graduated from college/university at an early age and was excited to join the EVA project. She has tried to mature very fast, although at the age of 14 this is surely a huge strain. Her brave efforts to succeed are constantly grounded by <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shinji.html" title="Shinji">Shinji</a>, who unwittingly has a 'natural talent' for piloting EVA 01. However hard Asuka tries, Shinji always seems to be better then her. Eventually this drives Asuka into making a foolish attack on the fifteenth Angel <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arael.html" title="Arael">Arael</a> which in turn <i>mentally rapes</i> her, leaving Asuka almost comatosed. Prior to this Asuka is a strong, sociable, likeable character and as with many characters in the story, you find your self saddened by the terrible events that unfold around such promising ability. --Markavian 10:33, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure where that "later rejection of contact with Misato" bit comes from. If whoever wrote that was talking about the kiss in EoE, (1) the most common interpretation seems to be that Misato didn't actually mean it because she knew she was going to die--she just wanted to galvanize Shinji into doing something instead of withdrawing into himself and just sitting there while the world ended--especially since it's Kaji's name she mentions as she's bleeding on the floor (if I remember correctly), and (2), in the elevator right afterwards, Shinji touches his lips, realizes that she bled on him, and starts to cry, none of which indicates rejection (of a promise that he probably realized to be false too) in my book. --Anon 02:45, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The rejection of contact with Misato is when she comes into his room and touches his hand and he draws back violently; it is also exhibited when she is crying over Kaji's death and in obvious need of human contact, in response to which he merely plugs in his earphone and tries to ignore her by putting his pillow over his head. He's dead scared of her and the womanhood she represents. --Aquilla</p>
<dl>
<dd>His reaction to Misato crying wasn't one of rejection. He was simply too withdrawn to comfort her and felt guity hearing her cry, so he covered his head to block sound. He isn't scared, but too confused to deal comfort for Misato. Ikari90 05:23, 22 December 2006 (UTC)Patrick.

<p>I believe that I must agree that Asuka is indeed a very proud individual by nature; for she has to be since, because of lack of loving parents, she needs someone to be proud of her as a parent would, so she is proud of HERSELF. Also, I believe this personality was meant to conflict with Shinji's, since he lost his mother at a young age while Asuka (in mentality) acts like a mother. Note her always saying things like "dont be stupid" or other somewhat motherly things (I will say dont be stupid isn't exactly motherly, but it does relate to 'dont do anything you'll regret later', which is often told to small children.) She is also quite cruel to Rei, since Rei never had a mother (in theory) and therefore rejects that idea. Asuka is cruel to Rei because if Asuka "Is a mother-figure" and Rei rejects a non-existent mother, then Rei is like a defiant child and so Asuka must be quick to repremand, therefore the cruelty. You may take my theories a number of ways, but I believe there are limits to the ways you can take them...</p>

<p>It seems that this article contains quite a bit of original research. "If Misato Katsuragi represents grown womanhood and all its difficulties and Rei Ayanami represents his relationship with his long-dead mother" Well, do they? It never seemed to me that the characters were that cookie-cutter.

<p>Under the miscellaneous items, the section referring to the possibility of a repressed attraction between Shinji and Asuka could be bolstered by a note about the Director's Cut of episode 22, specifically the line "You won't even hold me!" (subtitle of the Japanese) when Asuka sees images of Shinji, particularly their kiss, during Arael's probing of her mind. It's still highly open to interpretation, but I think it bears mention. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillbyr_8684.html" title="User:Willbyr">Willbyr</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWillbyr_6b53.html" title="User talk:Willbyr">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Willbyr_1daf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Willbyr">contribs</a>) 04:26, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Rather than bouncing back and forth between the two translations of Asuka's last words in EoE, IMO it would be better to state the line in Japanese and make a parenthetical note about the difference between the dubbed line and the subtitled translation.

<p>The new pic of Asuka is better than the old one, but I don't know so much about the "ID card." Also, these pics stand to be deleted by bots unless they're properly tagged.

<dd>The infobox one is definitely taken from episode 08, Asuka Strikes!. The ID card one I don't know about. The towel on her head looks like the one she uses in later episodes, but I can't recall a specific scene, and it looks to be of pretty good resolution if it really was displayed, screencapped and then cropped, so I suspect its origin is independent of the TV series.
