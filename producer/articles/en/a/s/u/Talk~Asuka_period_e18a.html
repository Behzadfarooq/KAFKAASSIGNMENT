<p>The " cradle" of Japanese civilization came from Korea. If Korea didn't exist. Japan would not exist either. Even though some lower rank Japanese deny the historical reality but they need to accept the historical reality. China really in my honest opinion never transmitted " Continent Culture" to Japanese Island. It was Koreans. Korean genes, Korean swords, Korean tomb, Korean agriculture, Korean King ( Current Emperor of Japan is Korean descent), Korean Temples in Nara, Asuka Culture etc. Korean blood runs deep in Japan. Thats true history. Because Japanese write Chinese character it doesn't mean that China transmitted those culture to Japan. It was Koreans. Just accept the reality.</p>
<p>[1]</p>
<p>Korean missionaries actively developed the Buddhist tradition in Japan for 150 years after its introduction. Baekje monks trained and proseletyized Japanese converts and provided the distinctive Baekje version of the Norther Wei style Buddhist art. Monks from the Three Kingdoms of Korea were welcome guests in Japan, and some were called to tutor the crown princes of royal families. Japanese converts also began to travel to Baekje and China for further Buddhist studies.</p>
<p>Korean missionaries actively developed the Buddhist tradition in Japan for 150 years after its introduction.</p>
<p>：What is the reason why missionary's name is not being written?　Simply, It is because there is no record of the active South Korean missionary. The meaning of 150 years is also indefinite.</p>

<p>Hi:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can you explain how the things that you label "Korean" theories are solely Korean? If you would look at the sources provided than you can see that most of the authors are westeners.</li>
<li>Thanks for citing your sources but your subjective interpretation of ancient sources isn't enough. You have to provide a source that analyzes the ancient source, preferably in English.</li>
<li>Please stop deleting, wholesale, everything that doesn't fit in your point of view. Your edits have been going on for a couple of weeks and while I appreciate your effort to improve the article, your obvious attempts to negate views that don't fit your point of view is not appreciated.</li>
<li>Finally, the views you espouse seem to be in the absolute minority. I can understand your desire to incorporate them into the article but your desire to expunge all references not fitting your point of view is not acceptable because those views actually have serious, academic support.</li>
</ol>

<dd>Many of clans and local chieftains consisting Yamato polity claimed its taproot to imperial family or other tribal Gods(Kami). The archeological evidence of such clans is found in inscription of the ancient iron sword discovered in Inariyama Kofun of Saitama, on which the bearer recorded the names of his ancestors to claim its origin to Ōbiko(大彦) who was recorded in Nihongi as a son of Emperor Kōgen. On the other hand, there are also considerable number of clans having origins in Korea or China. According to Nihongi, the oldest record of Korean imigrant is Amenohiboko(天日槍), a legendary prince of Silla who settled to Japan at the era of Emperor Suinin, perhaps around 3rd or 4th century. Ironically, Amenohiboko is described in Nihongi as a maternal ancestor of Empress Jingū whose controversial legend says that she conquered Silla.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Among many Korean imigrants settled continuously from 4th century, some oldcomers seem to set their origins to imperial family or some major clans. Soga no Machi(蘇我満智), the ancestor of Soga clan, is believed by some scholars to be equivalent of Baekje noble Moku Manchi(木満致). Korean imigrants even include their royal family. King_Muryeong_of_Baekje was born in Japan in 462, and left a son settled there. The naturalized prince established Wa clan(和氏). This clan's women Takano Niigasa became the second wife of Emperor Kōnin and gave birth to Emperor Kammu in 737.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>At 5th century, Kazuraki clan(葛城氏), descending from the legendary grandson of Emperor Kogen, was the most prominent power in the court and intermarried with imperial family. After Kazuraki faded in late 5th century, Otomo clan(大伴氏) temporarily took its place. When Emperor Buretsu died with no apparent heir, it was Otomo no Kanamura who recommended Emperor Keitai, a very distant imperial relative resided in Koshi district(current Fukui Prefecture), to be a new monarch. However, Kanamura was fired due to failures on diplomatic pilicies, and the court was eventually controlled by Mononobe clan (物部氏) and Soga clan(蘇我氏) at the beginning of Asuka Period.</dd>

<dd>Many important figures in Emperor Ojin's reign were immigrants from the mainland. These immigrants received noble titles from the rulers of the Yamato, and were valued as experts, especially on iron-working, horseriding and writing.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>According to the record of Shinsen-shōjiroku (新撰姓氏録), an aristocratic list of names that Yamato Imperial Court officially compiled in 815, one-third of the noble families on the list had their origins in China or Korea: 163 of the 1182 listed were from China, 154 from different parts of Korea (104 form Baekje, 41 from Goguryeo, 9 from Silla).

<dd>An example of a typical descendant clan is the Yamatonoaya clan (東漢氏), which is descended from Emperor Ling of Han. This clan's leader was Achi-no-Omi (阿智使主). He introduced Chinese culture to Japan. According to the Nihongi, during Emperor Kimmei's reign the Hata clan (秦氏), descendants of Qin Shi Huang, introduced sericulture. The Kawachino-Fumi clan (西文氏), descendants of Gaozu of Han, introduced Chinese writing to the Yamato court. (Source By Shinsen-shōjiroku) [citation needed].</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In Emperor Kimmei's reign, according to the Nihongi, a Korean was in charge of taxes levied on shipments. The introduction of Chinese writing to Yamato was one Baekje's most important gifts to the court. [4]</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Korean influence on Japanese laws is also attributed to the fact that Korean immigrants were on committees that drew up law codes. There were Chinese immigrants who were also in integral part in crafting Japan's first laws. Eight of the 19 members of the committee drafting the Taiho Code were from Korean immigrant families while none were from China proper. Furthermore, idea of local administrative districts and the tribute tax are based on Korean models.</dd>

<dd>My proposal</dd>
<dd>1　"Rulling Class(Korean Version)" is deleted from Asuka period, Yamato period, and Kofun period.</dd>
<dd>2　"Rulling Class(Old Version)" is revived to Yamato period and Kofun period.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Reason</dd>
<dd>Old Version is based on the record of the history of Japan. And, an important episode has been concisely brought together.</dd>
<dd>To insist on "Influence of South Korea on Japan", the Korea version contains a lot of descriptions that contradict the history record. And, information on true Rulling Class has been deleted by the episode of decorated Korea.</dd>

<dd>Kamosuke, I understand that you have issues with these various articles as they currently stand. However, resorting to ad hominem name-calling is not productive. Appleby's request that you include proper references is not <i>childish nationalism</i>, nor is it nationalism of any other sort -- providing proper citations is an integral part of any academic debate, regardless of subject matter. With that in mind, it is your insistence instead that looks more unreasonable. If you would only provide appropriate refecences, and at that I mean not just translations of ancient texts but also sources that comment on those texts (in English), I am sure that the rest of us would be satisfied. -- <a href="../../../e/i/r/User%7EEirikr_d43d.html" title="User:Eirikr">Eiríkr Útlendi</a> | <small style="position: relative; top: -3px;"><i><a href="../../../e/i/r/User_talk%7EEirikr_bc03.html" title="User talk:Eirikr">Tala við mig</a></i></small> 19:27, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b><span style="font-size: large;">S</span>o,</b> to rephrase (at least some of) Kamosuke's concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some statements in the article have been sourced to the Nihonshoki / Nihongi. However, it appears as if these statements might not actually be backed up by the content of the Nihonshoki text. These statements would therefore need re-sourcing, reworking, or deleting.</li>
<li>In greater detail here on the Talk page, as part of sorting out the issues, Kamosuke was hoping someone (Appleby is named, but I think anyone with the info could reply) would provide specific names listed in ancient sources to back up these statements.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this helps clarify the issues. If I've missed something, Kamosuke, do let me know.

<dl>
<dd>Eiríkr, thanks for your infinite patience and superhuman magnanimity. however, i'm still not sure i understand kamosuke's points. if i'm reading his comments correctly, the sentence he says is incorrectly attributed to nihongi is not actually attributed to nihongi, but to the linked citation. from a cursory glance, it seems that the specific sentence in this article fairly, even conservatively, reflects what the cited sources say. maybe you can help him clarify his question a bit more? i'm certainly not one to personally study and analyze ancient japanese texts, but is he questioning the credibility of the authors of the cited sources? are the existing sentences contradicted by other equally or more reliable sources? thanks.

<dd>Eirikr, like you said earlier, sometimes one cannot read the source simply at face value because that standard would lead to ridiculous results. You have to look at the issue from the whole context, surrounding historical evidence, textual analysis, DNA studies, language studies, and other ancient sources. Here is some more sources for the assertions made in this article.</dd>
<dd>1) <b>Cambridge History of Japan</b>:
<dl>
<dd>A) Archaeological evidence from the Fujinoki tomb suggests that the person burried there, "like the Soga, was made up largely of immigrants with close cultural ties to Korea." Any horse related materials were imports from Korea because the native Japanese of the day would not know what the "meaning" of the artifacts "nor how to make such fittings." <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521223520&amp;id=x5mwgfPXK1kC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;printsec=8&amp;vq=korean+immigrants&amp;dq=korean+immigrants+in+japan&amp;sig=KeG8fwocrHaC9u2K7XMbHDmOzqc" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521223520&amp;id=x5mwgfPXK1kC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;printsec=8&amp;vq=korean+immigrants&amp;dq=korean+immigrants+in+japan&amp;sig=KeG8fwocrHaC9u2K7XMbHDmOzqc" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</dd>
<dd>B) The establishment of an urban civilization that was "definitely Korean in character" based on this evidence:
<dl>
<dd>a) Imported grave goods</dd>
<dd>b) The "Korean style" of the three great temples of the Asuka period</dd>
<dd>c) The "continental" origins of Asuka period treasures at the Horyu-ji Temple collection.</dd>
<dd>d) The prominence of "Korean priests" of 1384 clerics (815 priests, 569 nuns) serving in the 46 temple compounds by 624 CE</dd>
<dd>e) And the dominance of the Soga clan and its strong Korean connection (also sourced in <b>Japan's Name Culture</b> <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1873410425&amp;id=fNQjDQ-mWYgC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;q=korea&amp;vq=korea&amp;dq=paekche+nihon+shoki&amp;sig=NMiN7WmcFVT8serOXEvmXSj5dIY" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1873410425&amp;id=fNQjDQ-mWYgC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;q=korea&amp;vq=korea&amp;dq=paekche+nihon+shoki&amp;sig=NMiN7WmcFVT8serOXEvmXSj5dIY" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.</dd>

<p>I found the later half of this chapter dealing with imperial embassies(Kenzuishi) a bit confusing, so let me have some modification as follows.</p>
<dl>
<dd>--From Here--</dd>
<dd>Numerous official missions of envoys, priests, and students were sent to China in the seventh century. Some remained twenty years or more; many of those who returned became prominent reformers. Sending such scholars for learning Chinese political systems was a significal differences with envoys in Kofun period (<a href="../../../f/i/v/Five_kings_of_Wa_a848.html" title="Five kings of Wa">Five kings of Wa</a>), which kings sent envoys for titles approving their domains.</dd>
<dd>Another difference with Five kings of 5th century was the title Yamato state of Asuka period claimed to China. In a move greatly resented by the Chinese, Shotoku sought equality with the Chinese emperor by sending official correspondence addressed "From the Son of Heaven in the Land of the Rising Sun to the Son of Heaven of the Land of the Setting Sun." Some would argue that Shotoku's bold step set a precedent: Japan never again accepted a subordinate status in its relations with China. However, the historical record contains other relevant facts which dispute the claim (see <i><a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinocentrism.html" title="Sinocentrism">Sinocentrism</a></i>). As a result, Japan at this period was a state which received no title from Chinese dynaties while they did send tributes (有貢無封). It means from Chinese point of view that the class of Japan was demoted from previous centuries in which the kings received titles. On the other hand, Japan loosened political relationships with China and consequently established extraordinaly relationships similar to teacher-to-pupil.<a href="http://japanfocus.org/article.asp?id=514" class="external autonumber" title="http://japanfocus.org/article.asp?id=514" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></dd>

<p>(1) Just because a source isn't available to the general public, that does not mean that it is any less valid a source. In fact, since most academic journals are hard to come by, I would argue that some of the most valid sources are the hardest to come by. (2) While GoogleBooks (or whichever other online services) may not have the full text of certain books, it does not mean that the actual physical book itself, in the public library or wherever, is not "accessible to the public."</p>

<p>I personally have no knowledge or sources on this matter, of how many monks and priests came over from Korea, or what their names were. But I find it extremely unlikely that these four named in the article were the only ones, or the only important ones. That is why I phrased it the way I did, "Some of the more well-known...". To write "Priests who came from Korean peninsula were..." implies that these are the only ones who came. This is completely about style and grammar, not about my asserting certain facts.

Please, do with this what you will, in order to cleanup that section of the article and to resolve (hopefully) to some extent the questions of the origins of that statement - "Artistically, the term Tori style is often used to describe arts of the Asuka period..." <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordAmeth_30dd.html" title="User:LordAmeth">LordAmeth</a> 11:59, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I believe quite a number of the last edits have been changing "the Korean peninsula" to 'Korea' and back again, and again, etc. Could someone give me an idea which motives are which edits? Out of the last 24 edits by 12 editors, only one wasn't about this, so there seems to be a real problem here. Is this a case of viewing ancient history through the glasses of only modern controversies? <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShenme_67cd.html" title="User:Shenme">Shenme</a> 09:12, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is just a ridiculous controversy that erupts every now and then, because Korea was technically several separate kingdoms at the time, and not a unified polity. However, although the use of "Korea" is technically an anachronism, it is quite common to use modern terms to refer to ancient territories out of convenience. The history of Japan, for example, doesn't become the history of something else just because you are discussing a time before the term "Japan" (or more properly, the Japanese term from which the English word "Japan" is derived) was coined, or before it consisted of exactly the same geographic territory it does today (which wasn't until the nineteenth century). People really need to find something better to do with their time. Referring to "Korea", "Japan", "China", etc. throughout all periods of history is quite acceptable...-<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefu_84bf.html" title="User:Jefu">Jefu</a> 14:11, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It might be funny, if it weren't also embarrassing. Of the 31 edits since my last observation, 29 were simply reverting back and forth some more. At least the fix for [[es:Era Asuka]] seems to be in both versions now.

<p>From the art point of view, this period is generally further divided into two periods, the Asuka culture period (upto 645 or 646 Taika Reform) and Hakuho culture period. The tori style is of course one of the important elements of the Asuka culture period, but it is relative only to sculpture.</p>
<p>The lead-in at top and Art sections will be modified to elaborate on these two cultural periods, with citations found in due course.</p>
<p>To kick-start, here are some references to support the two cultural period divisions:</p>

<p>I will start clean up some of the body text too, starting from the lead intro; it appears to be redundant by mentioning twice the duration of the period, and the location. --<a href="../../../o/h/m/User%7EOhMyDeer_b71b.html" title="User:OhMyDeer">OhMyDeer</a> 09:40, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
