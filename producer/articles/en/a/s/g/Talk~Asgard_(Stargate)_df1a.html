<p>I have a belief that the Asgard posses a much higher degree of technology than the television series seems to imply. Because the Asgard, Alterans, Nox and Furling were all part of an alliance of Great Races, I strongly believe that the Asgard possess the same level of technology as the Alterans did before they ascended. The Nox have also proved their high level of technology is also comparable to the Alterans when they revealed their floating city. I'm not sure if I'm simply being biased, or if my claim has true value. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.223.116.103 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.223.116.103_c6a0.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.223.116.103">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Unless you can come up with references for this it looks like original research. Wikipedia's got a policy against that sort of thing, so we can't include it in the article; see <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>. Furthermore, if the Asgard have the same level of technology as the Ancients, why did they need O'Neill to access the knowledge of the Ancients and build an anti-Replicator weapon for them? Thor mentioned in that episode that the Asgard have tried to download the repository of the Ancients themselves but their computers can't handle the amount of raw data, let alone process it. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 04:17, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is most definately a case of original research which is why i have refrained from editing the main article. However, even with the evidence you presented about the Repository of the Ancients, i can't help but believe that they weren't the least advanced race in the Alliance of the Great Four Races. Again, probably biased. 64.223.116.103 13:08, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The war with the replicators also seems to be similar to the war the Ancients had with the Wraith, who were less advanced but seemed to "copy" Ancient technology and overwhelm the ancients with superior numbers. 64.223.116.103 13:13, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If I might add something, it may be that the Asgard are a Civilization in decline, perhaps once in the distant past they (and the other 2 races) possessed Technology as advanced as that of the "Ancients", but they may have lost this knowledge over time. Also they can no longer reproduce, this is defiantly indicative of a decline, and perhaps Technological decline is part of this.--<a href="../../../h/i/b/User%7EHibernian_671b.html" title="User:Hibernian">Hibernian</a> 18:15, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I totally agree that the Asgard do seem not to get the same respect as the Ancients do in terms of their intellects and technology, and I too think that they were more comparable than it seems. The knowledge in the Ancient repositories could have been post-Ascension, meaning it's not fair to compare it to the Asgard's. And the Asgard were able to erase the knowledge from O'Neill's brain. We know that they speak countless languages. I think a lot of their prowess is implied. It does appear that the Asgard are sometimes baffled by Alteran knowledge, but really I think it's because the knowledge is different, a different understanding of the Universe. Just as the Nox have a harmonious, natural, 'let knowledge flow through you' thing; we know that the Asgard say that they could never come up with a technology like guns; probably the Furlings, about whom we know nothing, had machinery and scientific ideas absolutely nothing like anything else, as shown in the episode where Mayborne and JAck were transported to a moon. maybe the Ancients' tech was based on totally different principles than the Asgard's, and that it just happened to be more effective against the Replicators. Who's to say the Asgard couldn't have handled the Wraith better? We also learn in Stargate Atlantis that the Asgard have strict ideas about how to use their knowledge and technology. Maybe this prevents them from expanding into certain areas of research. All in all, I think it is unfair to judge the Asgard inferior to the Alterrans/Ancients. (Original research, I know. I don't expect it to be included in an article. It's just my opinion) &gt;&gt; DJB</p>
<p>Anyway. this article needs major reorganizing. It's all over the place. The order of the sections doesn't make sense. It was probably put together piece-meal. It needs some editing, expanding, lengthening and elaboration, too. Any volunteers?&#160;;) &gt;&gt;DJB</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>There is no evidence that the Asgard were clearly at a level less advanced then, or more advanced then, the Ancients / Ori. There are some areas they may well be inferior in technology to like the Replicator Disruptor (though I point out as soon as O'Neill fired it Thor was able to INSTANTLY reverse the design to make a MASSIVE version of it in minutes with clear understanding of the technology) yet there are other areas where their technology is clearly superior like their Hyperdrives, transporters, sensors...whatever. The Asgard have clearly assimilated a great deal from the Ancient database, Replicarter mentions as much in 'Gemini', but clearly the Ancients didn't provide any kind of indexing system like the AI that got downloaded into O'Neills head...twice. That the Ancient database was staggering in size isn't exactly surprising, the Ancients were around for MILLIONS of years, in that amount of time the shear amount of data they would have collected would probably be only describable mathematically. The Asgard are much younger and probably haven't researched anything like as much in *breadth*, but in all the *important* areas (AKA areas the fans care about like how powerful, fast and sexy their ships are&#160;:P) they match or even exceed the Ancients. --C O'Farrell 17/3/07</p>

<p>I deleted this poorly worded text from <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greys.html" title="Greys">Greys</a>, intending to reword it and put it into this Asgard article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Asgard were responsible for the abduction of humans from Earth to further their genetic experimentation, the Asgard in the show suffer from a lack of reproduction abilities, basically sexless the Asgard used human DNA to further their experiments and ultimately save their race.</dd>

<p>However, not being very familiar with the Stargate TV series, I'm unable to verify that the statement about abductions is true. If anyone can verify that this is part of Stargate canon, feel free to add something about abductions to the Asgard article. <a href="../../../w/d/f/User%7EWdfarmer_648f.html" title="User:Wdfarmer">Wdfarmer</a> 05:29, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Within the show, a rogue Asgard scientist named Loki began unsanctioned experiments upon members of humanity in an attempt to discover a solution to the genetic degradation that was plaging his species. However, he did not actually perform experiments upon humanity (Unless you count examination as experimenting) and the tests did not provide any help to the Asgard. In addition, the Asgard High Council put a stop to Loki's actions as soon as they were aware of them, the Asgard do not believe in abusing less-advanced species. 67.85.165.48 15:31, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is the Asgard beaming technology more advanced than that of the Ancients? The ancients seemed to have used the ring transporters, but those required platforms and a direct path to the location, but the Asgard aren't limited in that way.</p>

I'm trying to find screen captures of more recent bits of their writing that I can have a crack at (the Ancient script used in that episode is not much like the current one, so I'm not making any assumptions about the Asgard one). --Grey Knight 01:11, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Goa'uld: System Lords, Tok'ra, Kull Warrior</p>
<p>The Tok'ra shouldn't be listed under goa'uld, they repetedly state they they are in no way related to Goa'uld. In the episode where they find tretonin, they also find the Tok'ra queen. This proves that their genomes have divulged over the past two mellenia. The tok'ra stand by themselves, and should have thier own place. 65.9.215.152 21:25, 5 January 2007 (UTC</p>

<dd>The Tok'ra claim to no longer be Goa'uld, but they are quite clearly <i>related</i> to them (and really, we shouldn't just take the word of the Tok'ra as gospel - they're highly POV about themselves, after all&#160;:). Kull Warriors aren't exactly Goa'uld either but are at least as closely related. I think it's not unreasonable to group them here. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 03:05, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Tok'ra and Goa'uld are biologically identical, they are the same species. However, they have numerous philosophical and ethical differences, and are basically different countries. I'm an American and another guy might be Irish, and we might be quite adamant in pointing that out, but we're still the same species. The Tok'ra might constantly (And angrily) say "We are <i>not</i> Goa'uld," but they're the same species and will be labelled as such until the species itself is renamed. JBK405 03:23, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed. The Tok'ra queen is stated to be a 'traitor' by the Goa'uld, i.e. she was a Goa'uld who had morals. Since all Tok'ra are descended from her (to the point where the Tok'ra state that they are a dying race, because their queen is dead and they cannot sexually reproduce), there is no question of them being different to the Goa'uld; the Tok'ra queen (and hence, Tok'ra symbiotes) <i>are</i> Goa'uld. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalkingpie_dcaa.html" title="User:Talkingpie">Talkingpie</a> 17:37, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to see a spoiler warning added. For those of us in the U.S. we have not seen any of the second half of season ten yet. It is rather shocking to suddenly see that the Asgard are extinct without any warning. Thank you for ruining an entire episode for us. HotOne121 02:24, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
