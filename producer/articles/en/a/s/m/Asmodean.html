He is one of the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forsaken_%28Wheel_of_Time%29_9288.html" title="Forsaken (Wheel of Time)">Forsaken</a> and likely named after the demon <a href="../../../a/s/m/Asmodai.html" title="Asmodai">Asmodeus</a>.</p>

<p>A Forsaken of no great significance, his real name is <b>Joar Addam Nesossin</b>. A <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musician.html" title="Musician">musician</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Composer.html" title="Composer">composer</a> during the <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Legends_ae02.html" title="Age of Legends">Age of Legends</a>, he swore fealty to the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_One_44e6.html" title="Dark One">Dark One</a> so that he could spend eternity perfecting his craft, and he used his dark powers to destroy his rivals. As a sign of his loyalty to the Dark One, Asmodean destroyed a museum of art and all the people within it when he became a <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darkfriend.html" title="Darkfriend">Darkfriend</a>. Asmodean was also remembered, with some bitter hatred, for the execution of his mother, who also was <a href="../../../a/e/s/Aes_Sedai_902c.html" title="Aes Sedai">Aes Sedai</a>. This is a rare occurrence that even in the Modern World of the Wheel was remarked when <a href="../../../e/m/o/Emond%27s_Field_c194.html" title="Emond's Field">Emond's Field</a> was visited and three generations of women were found to be linked by the ability to channel <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saidar.html" title="Saidar">Saidar</a>. It is known that he first severed his mother from the One Power before giving orders to <a href="../../../m/y/r/Myrddraal.html" title="Myrddraal">Myrddraal</a> to execute her. In <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fires_of_Heaven_4775.html" title="The Fires of Heaven">The Fires of Heaven</a> there is mention of her screams.</p>
<p>Asmodean battled <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rand_al%27Thor_a829.html" title="Rand al'Thor">Rand</a> in <a href="../../../r/h/u/Rhuidean.html" title="Rhuidean">Rhuidean</a>, and lost when Rand severed his link to the Dark One. leaving him exposed to the taint on <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saidin.html" title="Saidin">Saidin</a>. <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lanfear.html" title="Lanfear">Lanfear</a> then shielded Asmodean so that he could only channel "a trickle", and instructed him to train Rand in the Power (ironically, Asmodean's attempt on Rand's life at Rhuidean eventually kept Rand from being killed by ignorance of the Power). Asmodean was known among the Forsaken for his habit of oft-traitorously throwing his lot in with whomever he thought would win, which perhaps explains why the Forsaken did not attempt to rescue him. Disguised as a <a href="../../../g/l/e/Gleeman.html" title="Gleeman">gleeman</a> named <b>Jasin Natael</b>, he trained Rand diligently and without signs of treachery, and as time passed it seemed as if he might genuinely want to join the side of the Light.</p>
<p>While crossing over the <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spine_of_the_World_5207.html" title="Spine of the World">Spine of the World</a> near Kinslayer's dagger, Asmodean lamented about his home city of Shorelle as they passed a decaying ship in the high passes of the mountain pass. Because he was sealed in the Bore before the <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breaking_of_the_World_3fd6.html" title="Breaking of the World">Breaking of the World</a>, it is believed that Asmodean has no known knowledge of precisely where Shorelle would have been located.</p>
<p>He was assassinated suddenly in <a href="../../../c/a/e/Caemlyn.html" title="Caemlyn">Caemlyn</a> after he came with Rand to help defeat <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahvin.html" title="Rahvin">Rahvin</a>. He was also 'killed' earlier during the attack on Caemlyn along with <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mat_Cauthon_ba42.html" title="Mat Cauthon">Mat</a> and <a href="../../../a/v/i/Aviendha.html" title="Aviendha">Aviendha</a> but this death was undone when Rand killed Rahvin with <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balefire.html" title="Balefire">balefire</a>. Although some Forsaken are reincarnated with different names, it is unlikely that Asmodean will ever return, since the Dark One told <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demandred.html" title="Demandred">Demandred</a> that Asmodean, along with Rahvin, "died the final death." It appears to be a constant in the series that if an individual is killed with balefire, the Dark One cannot reincarnate them as their thread has been burned out of the Pattern.</p>

<p>The identity of Asmodean's killer has puzzled readers since the fifth book was published; few were able to assign it conclusively to one of the characters. Lanfear, the only character suspected to have both means and motive, has the airtight <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alibi.html" title="Alibi">alibi</a> of having been dead at the time (Lanfear has since returned from the grave as the individual known as Cyndane, but neither version was alive at the time of Asmodean's death). Other theories involved fellow Forsaken <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graendal.html" title="Graendal">Graendal</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sammael.html" title="Sammael">Sammael</a>, who have no known motive but similar means. Finally, some believe that <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Wheel_of_Time_characters_8775.html#Slayer" title="Minor Wheel of Time characters">Slayer</a>, acting as the assassin of the Forsaken, killed him.</p>
<p>In interviews, author Robert Jordan insisted the identity of the killer should be "intuitively obvious," and has steadfastly refused to make any definitive statements on the matter, especially since at least one reader (he says) has come up with the correct answer. However, he has stated that if he will include the information in the series' final novel, <i><a href="../../../a/_/m/A_Memory_of_Light_e24c.html" title="A Memory of Light">A Memory of Light</a></i> if he can find a way to do so, and if not, he will announce the killer's identity after the novel is released in paperback.</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_12.html" title="December 12">12 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> <a href="http://www.cnn.com/chat/transcripts/2000/12/12/jordan/" class="external text" title="http://www.cnn.com/chat/transcripts/2000/12/12/jordan/" rel="nofollow">interview</a> at <a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN.com_709e.html" title="CNN.com">CNN.com</a> is frequently pointed to as proof that Graendal killed Asmodean, though Jordan (once again) refuses to confirm or deny the allegation.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/m/Asmodean.html" title="Edit section: Trivia">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Trivia</span></h3>
<p>The name Asmodean, like most names in the Wheel of Time, seems influenced by mythology. Most obviously, it can refer to the Biblical demon <a href="../../../a/s/m/Asmodai.html" title="Asmodai">Asmodeus</a>. Unlike many, Asmodean does not directly tie to his namesake, acting as neither tempter, nor inducing any gambling. One might draw connections to the myth of Asmodeus marrying <a href="../../../l/i/l/Lillith.html" title="Lillith">Lillith</a> as analogous to Asmodean entering a pact with <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lanfear.html" title="Lanfear">Lanfear</a>, but that is sketchy at best. A clearer parallel might however be proposed between the story of Asmodai being trapped into aiding and teaching Solomon, and Asmodean being trapped into aiding and teaching Rand.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that Asmodean, while being completely useless to the Shadow, was almost single-handedly responsible for the survival of Rand, the Champion of the Light. After turning to the Shadow and being remembered for an Age as one of the worst human beings ever known, Asmodean indirectly saved the world.</p>
