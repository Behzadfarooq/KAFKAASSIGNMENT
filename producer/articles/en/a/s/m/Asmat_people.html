<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/m/Asmat_people.html" title="Edit section: Culture and subsistence">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Culture and subsistence</span></h2>
<p>The natural environment has been a major factor affecting the Asmat, as their culture and way of life are heavily dependent on the rich natural resources found in their forests, rivers, and seas. The Asmat mainly subsist on starch from the <a href="../../../s/a/g/Sago.html" title="Sago">sago palm</a> (<i>Metroxylon sagu</i>), fish, forest game, and other items gathered from their forests and waters. Materials for canoes, dwellings, and woodcarvings are also all gathered locally, and thus their culture and <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biodiversity.html" title="Biodiversity">biodiversity</a> are intertwined. Due to the daily flooding which occurs in many parts of their land, Asmat dwellings have typically been built two or more metres above the ground, raised on wooden posts. In some inland regions, the Asmat have lived in <a href="../../../t/r/e/Tree_house.html" title="Tree house">tree houses</a>, sometimes as high as 25 metres from the ground. The Asmat have traditionally placed great emphasis on the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancestor_worship.html" title="Ancestor worship">veneration of ancestors</a>, particularly those who were accomplished warriors. Asmat art, most noticeably elaborate, stylized <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wood_carving.html" title="Wood carving">wood carving</a>, is designed to honour ancestors. Many Asmat artifacts have been collected by the world's museums, among the most notable of which are those found in the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_C._Rockefeller_e25b.html" title="Michael C. Rockefeller">Michael C. Rockefeller</a> Collection at the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_e36a.html" title="Metropolitan Museum of Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> in New York City.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/m/Asmat_people.html" title="Edit section: Language and ethnic sub-groups">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Language and ethnic sub-groups</span></h2>
<p>Linguistic classification of the native language(s) of the Asmat people is somewhat problematic, but is generally characterized as being a group of closely related languages or dialects (most mutually intelligible to some degree), known as the Asmat family, which is a sub-family of the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trans-New_Guinea_languages_5850.html" title="Trans-New Guinea languages">Trans New Guinea language</a> phylum. However, some ethnic groups who speak languages in the Asmat linguistic family, such as the Kamoro and Sempan peoples who live adjacent to the Asmat, are ethnically distinct from Asmat.</p>
<p>Asmat may be thought of as an umbrella term for twelve different ethnic sub-groups with shared linguistic and cultural affinities and sense of shared identity. These twelve Asmat groups include Joirat, Emari Ducur, Bismam, Becembub, Simai, Kenekap, Unir Siran, Unir Epmak, Safan, Aramatak, Bras, and Yupmakcain. Further complicating the issue, these groups speak approximately five dialects (Casuarina Coast Asmat, Yaosakor Asmat, Central Asmat, North Asmat, Citak). However, at some important level these groups share a sense of identity and would likely refer to themselves as "Asmat".</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/m/Asmat_people.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Until the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a>, their remote and harsh location isolated the Asmat from other peoples. It was not until the mid-<a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a> that they came into regular contact with outsiders. Initially, the Asmat had a reputation as <a href="../../../h/e/a/Headhunting.html" title="Headhunting">headhunters</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannibalism.html" title="Cannibalism">cannibals</a>, and were left undisturbed.</p>
<p>The first apparent sighting of the Asmat people by explorers was from the deck of a ship led by a Dutch trader, Jan Carstenz in the year 1623. <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Cook_83d3.html" title="James Cook">Captain James Cook</a> and his crew were the first to actually land in Asmat on September 3, 1770 (near what is now the village of Pirimapun). According to the journals of Captain Cook, a small party from the <a href="../../../h/m/_/HM_Bark_Endeavour_5c9b.html" title="HM Bark Endeavour">HM Bark Endeavour</a> encountered a group of Asmat warriors; sensing a threat, the explorers quickly retreated. In 1826, another Dutch explorer, Kolff, anchored in approximately the same area as that visited by Cook. When the Asmat warriors again frightened the visitors with loud noises and bursts of white powder, Kolff's crew also rapidly withdrew. The <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a>, who gained sovereignty over the western half of the island in <a href="../../../1/7/9/1793.html" title="1793">1793</a>, did not begin exploring the region until the early <a href="../../../1/9/0/1900s.html" title="1900s">1900s</a>, when they established a government post in Merauke in the southeast corner of the territory. From there, several exploratory excursions with the goal of reaching the central mountain range passed through the Asmat area and gathered small numbers of zoological specimens and artifacts. These artifacts were taken to Europe where they generated much interest, and probably influenced modernist and <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrealism.html" title="Surrealism">surrealist</a> Western artists such as <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henri_Matisse_e2a5.html" title="Henri Matisse">Henri Matisse</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marc_Chagall_14be.html" title="Marc Chagall">Marc Chagall</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/b/Pablo_Picasso_5952.html" title="Pablo Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a>.</p>
<p>The first colonial post was established in the Asmat area in Agats in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>. This small outpost was closed in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a> due to the onset of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. After the war, Father G. Zegwaard, a Dutch Missionary, began patrols into Asmat from the Mimika area to the west. In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a> Zegwaard re-established the post in Agats, which was to become the government headquarters and the base for Roman Catholic missionaries. It was not until <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholicism_4982.html" title="Roman Catholicism">Catholic</a> <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missionary.html" title="Missionary">missionaries</a> established the post in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a> that significant interaction with the Asmat people began. Catholic missionaries, many with degrees in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthropology.html" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a>, were successful persuading the Asmat to stop cannibalism and headhunting, while encouraging the continuation of other important cultural cycles and festivals such as shield and bisj ceremonies, which were incorporated into an adapted Catholic liturgy. Asmat was the launching point for an arduous joint French-Dutch expedition from the south to north coast of New Guinea in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>, which was documented by the team and resulted in a book and documentary film, "The Sky Above, The Mud Below", which won an <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Awards_b109.html" title="Academy Awards">Academy Award</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>. In November 1961, the 22-year old <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_C._Rockefeller_e25b.html" title="Michael C. Rockefeller">Michael C. Rockefeller</a>, son of <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_A._Rockefeller_8a62.html" title="Nelson A. Rockefeller">Nelson A. Rockefeller</a> who was then the Governor of the State of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> and member of one of the wealthiest families in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, disappeared in Asmat when his boat overturned while on an art collecting expedition. His disappearance, followed by an intensive and ultimately unsuccessful search by the Dutch authorities, has been the source of much speculation as to Mr. Rockefeller's fate. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>, the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">Indonesian government</a> took over administration of western New Guinea.</p>
<p>After a short period under the new Indonesian administration from <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a> in which Asmat cultural ceremonies were officially discouraged, local Bishop Alphonse Sowada was instrumental in facilitating the revitalization of woodcarving and other festivals, which remain strong today. The church, along with <a href="../../../t/o/b/Tobias_Schneebaum_f985.html" title="Tobias Schneebaum">Tobias Schneebaum</a> and Ursula Konrad, established the Asmat Museum of Culture and Progress (AMCP) in the local town of Agats in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, to maintain local pride in Asmat cultural traditions. Each year in early October, the church sponsors a woodcarving competition and auction to recognize outstanding carvers.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/m/Asmat_people.html" title="Edit section: Current context">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Current context</span></h2>
<p>Even today, the Asmat are relatively isolated and their most important cultural traditions are still strong, though their interaction with the outside world has been increasing over the last decades. Many Asmat have received higher education in other parts of Indonesia and some in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>. The Asmat seek to find ways to incorporate new technology and beneficial services such as health, communications, and education, while preserving their cultural traditions. The biodiversity of their area has been under some pressure from outside logging and fishing, although this has faced significant and not unsuccessful resistance. In the year 2000 the Asmat formed <a href="../../../l/e/m/Lembaga_Musyawarah_Adat_Asmat_d34b.html" title="Lembaga Musyawarah Adat Asmat">Lembaga Musyawarah Adat Asmat</a> (LMAA), a civil society organization that represents and articulates their interests and aspirations. LMAA has been working with <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Pacific_Conservation_Alliance_21d2.html" title="Indo-Pacific Conservation Alliance">Indo-Pacific Conservation Alliance</a> since <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, and has established separate traditional sub-councils, or Forum Adat Rumpun (FAR) to implement joint activities. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, the Asmat region became a separate governmental administrative unit or <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regency_%28Indonesia%29_148a.html" title="Regency (Indonesia)">Kabupaten</a>, and elected Mr. Yufen Biakai, former director of the AMCP and current Chairman of LMAA, as its Bupati (head of local government).</p>
