<p>I am a Chaldean that does not believe we should be named Assyrians. It is such a shame that people have no dignity about their own culture and turn against their nationality. And also, you can call yourself Assyrian.. but think about it when have the Assyrians ever called themselves Chaldean. Its a shame people fall down into a trap so easily and turn against their culture. However, I am not one to judge I am just writing my opinion on this matter to hopefully make sense to people that do generally call themsleves Assyrian when really Chaldean. Asm ccc thanks for the great debate you put up it was really good and all Chaldeans i'm sure are very proud of you.</p>

<dd>Hermiz, akhoun, the fact that Assyrians never called themselves Chaldean says nothing about the true ethnicity of Chaldeans. That statement makes the whole identity crisis seem as if it's an issue of reciprocity, when really it's not. Assyrians never called themselves Chaldean because they were never Chaldean. Many Chaldeans of today are ethnically Assyrian, not all. But many things in history have occurred that have obscured that truth, such as Arabization (I mention Arabization because many Chaldeans and even some Assyrians wrongfully refer to themselves as Arab), and the schism within the Assyrian Church of the East some 500 years ago. Since then, over the dozens of generations, that truth has been lost. I respect your opinion, however. You have a right to call yourself whatever you want.<a href="../../../%C5%A1/a/r/User%7E%C5%A0arukinu_88ac.html" title="User:Šarukinu">Šarukinu</a> 22:16, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There were many instances where Assyrians were continuously documented in history after the fall of Nineveh. The Persian army had used Assyrian soldiers; the Roman empire, under Trajan, had a province of Assyria in Northern Mesopotamia (where Assyria was traditionally located). After the time of Christ, Assyrian missionaries were very active and reached as far as India and China. Assyrians never disappeared. Yes, it's true that the nationalistic movements of the 20th century were very sudden, but that was because of growing western interest in Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>I'm guessing that your main argument is that after the fall of the Assyrian empire, Assyrians were completely wiped out? That's the most primitive idea you can believe. Most Assyrians were peasant farmers living outside of the destroyed urban centers such as Nineveh, Dur Sharrukin, and Kalhu. Most of Assyria (or Northern Mesopotamia), unlike the rest of Mesopotamia, was located within the dry farming zone (meaning that there could be agriculture without irrigation). There is much archaeological evidence that suggests agriculture existed in Northern Mesopotamia since agriculture was first invented.</p>
<p>So what does that mean? Basically, the non-urban areas of Assyria were most likely continuously inhabited (by Assyrians) due to their agricultural significance. Never has it been documented in history that military campaigns (be it by the Persians, Romans, Arabs) took place in these large farming areas - it wouldn't make sense to waste manpower on peasants. If you were an emperor, you would be stupid to send your armies into the farmlands, because there are no administrative centers, no significant authorities, and no spoils of war. In stead, what you do is send your armies to the main urban cities, where you overtake the administrative centers, and control the bureaucracy. Being a professor who's interested in the Near East, you should have known that.&#160;;)</p>
<p>And also, it wasn't just an Assyrian dynasty - it was a full-fledged empire, the first true empire the world had seen. The ancient Assyrians controlled virtually all of the Near East, so to say it was just a dynasty is a huge understatement.<a href="../../../%C5%A1/a/r/User%7E%C5%A0arukinu_88ac.html" title="User:Šarukinu">Šarukinu</a> 00:05, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>My main argument is not that after the fall of the Assyrian empire, Assyrians were completely wiped out, this rateher sounds very similar to your friend chaldean's previous argument where he said, Chaldeans assumalated into arabs and persians. Before you put words in claiming that i have stated and make fun of them, you should look at your fellow assyrians arguments about chaldeans. Cause this doesnt make me look stupid, it just you who prove that your friend Chaldean isnt as clever as he believe he is. About these farming areas, if they were so large and so productive, dont you believe that that the foreign nations would have taken a lot of interest in these places and made sure that they put in heavy taxes or made sure they had total control and taken out the inhabitants of the area, and about my few spelling errors, let us have this debate in the language i have studied most, norwegian, and then we will see if i am a professor or not.</p>

That was your quote, well let me tell you something, The 11th dynasty of the Kings of Babylon (6th century BC) is conventionally known to historians as the Chaldean Dynasty <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaldea.html" title="Chaldea">Chaldea</a>, meaning that whoever talked about the Babylonians after the 11th dynasty of Babylon, they were talking about the Chaldeans, so 23 of these countries were Babiru (Babylon) which they were refering to the neo babylon meaning that the inhabitants were Chaldeans. So just as the Assyrians, Babylon was one of the 23 countries part of the Persian empire, and just as a reminder, Assyria was fallen long before the Persian empire, while Chaldea lost their independance after the Persian empire was established.</p>
<p>And you asked me indentify someone who called himself Chaldean before 1553, well Patriacrh Timeotheus 1 identified himself as Chaldean and ruler of the Chaldeans and that was in the 9th century AD, who was the first Assyrian Patriacrh and when was he around, and when i mean Assyrian Patriacrh i dont mean Nestorian</p>

<dd>Asm, the way you control the farming areas is to control the nearest site containing temple administration. I'm sure you know that in ancient times, all of society was based around these temple systems, whereby nearly all resources were processed. The surplus from these farming areas, in addition to other resources, would be given to the temple administration to be used to fund the state. Therefore, by controlling the local temple sites, you would control the adjacent farming areas. It would be very detrimental to your economy to deport the already extensive working class from such critical areas, only to have hundreds of thousands of other peasants imported from another region - it's a huge waste of time and resources. The problem with people like you is that you always think in terms of pure military might, but you ignore the most important concepts such as economy.</dd>

<dd>As for the Chaldean dynasty, there are no sources which dictate that all of Babylonia (or Southern Mesopotamia) was of Chaldean descent. The ruling class was Chaldean, but the majority of the population was not. It's similar to the Kassite dynasty in Babylonia in the late 2nd Millenium BC - the fact that they ruled southern Mesopotamia did not necessarily imply that all of its inhabitants were of Kassite descent.</dd>

<dd>Asm ccc, so now you are Babylonian? Where is the babylonian state in the <a href="../../../a/d/_/AD_e182.html" title="AD">AD</a> time? Who called themselves Babylonian? Where is the group? <i>while Chaldea lost their independance after the Persian empire was established.</i> - where is Chaldea? How come their was no geographical area called Chaldea at any time in history? Even during Chaldean dynasty, the place was called Babylonia. So tell me, how come Chaldeans in the middle east dont believe they are a separate ethnicity? (which means they have not thought so either since the formation of the church. <i>9th century AD, who was the first Assyrian Patriacrh and when was he around, and when i mean Assyrian Patriacrh i dont mean Nestorian</i> - and this sentence doesn't make sence at all. And yes Asm ccc, all nestorians in Mesopotamia were Assyrian, that is how it is proven that Chaldean converts were originally <a href="../../../a/c/o/ACOE_eecf.html" title="ACOE">ACOE</a> members.

<p>Here is some more evidence suggesting the continued existence of Assyrian people after the fall of the empire:</p>
<p><i>Assyria's heartland lost it's urban characteristics, and the remaining population lived in small settlements on top of massive mounds. In certain Syrian cities Assyrian administrative practices were continued, but the king of Babylon was acknowledged as the new master.</i> <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Thus, life in Assyria continued, which in the rural areas most likely would have continued as normal.</p>
<p>"What about the Persians..." you might ask. If you think they would have deported them in mass numbers or tried to assimilate them into Persian culture, think again:</p>
<p><i>The Persian empire was at the same time highly centralized and respectful of the multiplicity of the people it governed. It was the first empire that acknowledged the fact that its inhabitants had a variety of cultures, spoke different languages, and were politcally organized in various ways... On several other reliefs the throne of the king is carried by people identified by trilingual inscriptions as Persian, Mede, Babylonian, Assyrian, and so on.</i> <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>As you should know, the Persian empire was known for its tolerance of its conquered people's traditions and native governing styles. When Cambyses conquered Egypt, for example, he adopted an Egyptian thronename <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>, so as to appeal to Egyptian people. When Cyrus conquered Babylon, he also took part in Babylonian religious rituals<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>, fulfilling the traditional role of Babylonian king, again in an attempt to gain the favour of the people. So as you can see, the Persian rulers were very concerned with satisfying the people they conquered, so as to reduce the risk of rebellion.</p>
<p>With regards to the Assyrians, their treatment was not likely to have been any different.</p>

<p>Please stop wasting my time, I never said that assyrians didnt exist, i just asked a question and you throw all this useless information about Persia and Egypt. <i>As you should know, the Persian empire was known for its tolerance of its conquered people's traditions and native governing styles.</i> well who do you think conquered the neo babylonian empire, it was the persian empire, and the majority of the time it stayed under Persian control, your friend Chaldean stated that the ancient Chaldeans assumalated into Persians, well you just proved him wrong by supplying me with this excellent information.</p>

<dd>So now you're trying to change your position? Asm ccc, you're wasting your own time. You and I know very well that you were implying that Assyrians today are not the descendants of the ancient Assyrians.</dd>
<dd><i>You know that the Assyrian dynasty was destroyed and it's people were forced to flee, what happened to Assyrians and Assyria, when was the first time the term Assyria or assyrian was used after the fall of their dynasty.

<dd>Your main argument (above) was that all Assyrians were either destroyed or forced out of their lands - I discounted that argument with the evidence I provided. It's obviously not useless, because it proved you wrong, and you referred to it yourself as "<i>excellent information</i>".

<p><i>so now you are Babylonian? Where is the babylonian state in the AD time? Who called themselves Babylonian? Where is the group? while Chaldea lost their independance after the Persian empire was established. - where is Chaldea? How come their was no geographical area called Chaldea at any time in history?</i> "It does not explictly address the question of how these groups came into being, but apparently accepts the common view that both Aramaeans and Chaldeans were intrusive in Mesopotamia. Why not see them as indigenous?... There appears to be no good reason to believe that the Chaldeans did not emerge on southern Mesopotamian soil from the population already inhabiting that land. The proportion of West Semitic names attested for individuals identified as Chaldeans is too small to justify identifying the entire group as of West Semiticcorigin, while the observed degree to which Chaldeans were'Babylonianized' (Frame, p 37) probably indicates that they were as 'Babylonian' as anyone else to begin with" <a href="http://www.listhost.uchicago.edu/pipermail/ane/2002-August/002518.html.com" class="external text" title="http://www.listhost.uchicago.edu/pipermail/ane/2002-August/002518.html.com" rel="nofollow">link title</a> all the evidence you need is right there. I thought you should have known this, Chaldeans were Babylonians, they were one of the many tribes of Babylon, the reason why the term Chaldean is more commonly used than Babylonian is due to their success of regaining back the lost empire. I consider myself Babylonian as well as Chaldean, I never knew a person like you who tries to act intellegent, needed to be explained this too.</p>
<p>Let me ask you two questions, have you hears about the Han dynasty and about the silk road????? If you do, you should have know that there was a georgraphical area called called Chaldea, however the Chinese call it Tiaozhi <a href="http://www.iask123.info/en/Sino-Roman_relations.htm.com" class="external text" title="http://www.iask123.info/en/Sino-Roman_relations.htm.com" rel="nofollow">link title</a> Now you are probably thinking, what about Babylonia, well the Chinese considered us as Chaldeans, and that is one of the many factors why most of today's Babylonians call themeselve Chaldeans, however, the Persians, didnt call us, today's Chaldeans by the same name as the Chinese, they called today's Chaldeans Babylonians, mainly due to the extra credit they would receive of putting an end to the allmighty Babylonian empire and not only the strong neo Babylonian empire, and also due to the fact when Persia and Medes conquered Babylon, Babylon was known to have the greatest army in all of the middle east.</p>

<dd>The two paragraphs you just typed above aren't making a whole lot of sense, and the references you are providing don't work - please fix them. The idea that another nation refers to all of Southern Mesopotamians as Chaldean (which I will address shortly) does NOT render them all Chaldean. Chaldeans were a Babylonian tribe, as you said. They rose to political prominence in the 1st millennium BC, and as a result their Chaldean dynasty ruled Babylonia for a short period of time. Even the term <i>Babylonian</i> isn't generalizable. The term Babylonia was coined by Greek historians, based on the capital city Babylon (Babel). The Babylonian kings didn't even refer to themselves as Babylonian; in stead, they would refer to themselves as kings of "Sumer and Akkad", as the term Babylonia didn't exist for centuries after the Babylonian empire was taken over by Persians.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And if you do the appropriate research on Tiaozhi, you'll know that the definition is still contested. Most scholars will agree that it simply pertains to the land "West of Parthia", not specifically Chaldea. I would suggest looking up real scholarly information <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup><a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-0279%28199901%2F03%29119%3A1%3C71%3ATREAKT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-H" class="external autonumber" title="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-0279%28199901%2F03%29119%3A1%3C71%3ATREAKT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-H" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, such as journals and other peer-edited publications, because it seems as if though you're basing that argument on a single <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sino-Roman_relations_1409.html" title="Sino-Roman relations">Wikipedia article</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Which brings me to my next point: the sources on Wikipedia are NOT always reliable. If you're basing your arguments on Wikipedia articles, then your arguments are no more credible than they are comprehensive. As for Babylonia having the greatest army in all the Middle East, that's also a misconception. They were more known for their intellectual achievements rather than military achievements. After they destroyed Nineveh, they were still confined to Mesopotamia (both North and South), and would never extend their empire to the previous extent of the Assyrians.<a href="../../../%C5%A1/a/r/User%7E%C5%A0arukinu_88ac.html" title="User:Šarukinu">Šarukinu</a> 20:39, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>all nestorians in Mesopotamia were Assyrian, that is how it is proven that Chaldean converts were originally ACOE members.</i> that is the biggest lie i have ever heard. And the reason why you think Chaldeans are Assyrians is because of this false statement. I hope you know this that until the 12th century AD the majority of Iraq were Christians, I doubt that only existed of Assyrians do you know why?? Not all Assyrians lived in today's Iraq, they were spread all around the middle east after the fall of their empire. Many Assyrians fled to the Hakkari mountains (in today's turkey, and others also fled to other countries like Syria. I find it very hard to believe that even when not half of the Assyrian population lived in Iraq they still could make up the majority of the citizens of Iraq, are you being bribed or something cause you know yourself that a people cant just dissapear, and the Babylonians, never had the time to flee from their empire cause they never had the idea the Medes would backstabb them and allie themeselve with the Persians. Your username is named after your faith, well if you believe so much in your faith open the Bible to Daniel 5: 5-30 and it will prove to you that there was no major batlle between Persia and the Medes against the Babylonians cause they were caught by suprise. You probably thinking what does this have to do with nestorians, well it only proves that no massacres took place when Babylonia was conquered, and that the Babylonians still lived in their ancestors land. Babylon had its province under the Persian empire, Ssanien empire and the Seleucid empire, these were the only empires that took control over the land of the Babylonians until the Muslim invasion, which then the Nestorian Church was established and the Chaldeans were a part of it.</p>
<p>Answer me these question, under what empire was the Nestorian Church established?? I really hope its not to hard for you to answer with your bias.</p>

<p>First and formost none of the "Assyrian" or "Chaldean" Kings ever referred to themselves as such. They all referred to themselves as Kings of "Sumer and Akkad." Assyrian was coined by the Greeks to refer to those whom held Ashur as the supreme diety in the land of Sumer and Akkad for example as the Jews referred to southern Mesopotamia as "Shinar" which meant "land of the moon god." "Babylonia" was also coined by the Greeks to refer to southern Mesopotamia which had its "capital" in Bab-ilu aka Kadingirra aka "Babylon." Just as people in ancient Sumer and Akkad referred to themselves by the city-state they inhabbited so do the modern people, they refer to their ethno-religious group by village and/or national proximity. "Chaldean" was also coined by the Greeks to refer to the last indegenous conquerors of "Babylonia." In reality in the Syriac language we ALL refer to ourselves as Sourayeh or Souryoyeh which is simply translated as Syrian in English which itself is Greek-derived from the designation of the former colonial territories of Assyria for they referred to Sumer and Akkad as Assyria and its colonies (Aram and Canaan) as Syria. That is it in a nutshell. We are Sourayeh/Souryoyeh and ultimately we are Assyrian, Babylonian, and the Sons and Daughters of the fusion of Sumer and Akkad. We are Chaldean as well and we are Aramaean as well. However if you want to get into <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semantics.html" title="Semantics">semantics</a> some hold the God <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashur.html" title="Ashur">Ashur</a> as one with the Christian God <a href="../../../y/a/h/Yah.html" title="Yah">Yah</a>(weh) which himself started out as the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canaanite.html" title="Canaanite">Canaanite</a> equivelent of Ashur, the "sky axle" therefore in that sense we are the true "Assyrians" in an ethno-religious sense. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESargonious_9f62.html" title="User:Sargonious">The Tsar is Gone but I am King</a> 15:37, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Chaldean is Greek-derived from the <a href="../../../a/k/k/Akkadian_language.html" title="Akkadian language">Akkadian_language</a> form of "Kaldu" which in Hebrew is "Kasdu" which may even be a refference to the <a href="../../../k/a/s/Kassites.html" title="Kassites">Kassites</a> whom once ruled Babylon well before the "Chaldean Dynasty." It was also used interchangebly with "Astrologer" in which <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">Astrology</a> was key in the <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesopotamian_religion.html" title="Mesopotamian religion">Mesopotamian religion</a> so even in that sense we are true "Chaldeans" as well for Judaism is a monotheistic religion that originated in Mesopotamia and gradually evolved into Christianity and even Islam.<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESargonious_9f62.html" title="User:Sargonious">The Tsar is Gone but I am King</a> 17:09, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, Assyrian kings did in fact refer to themselves as "Šar Mât Aššur", or "King of Assyria" as part of their royal titulary, in addition to "king of Sumer and Akkad". So there was definitely the mindset of an Assyrian identity. I'm not sure if that's what you were arguing against, but I thought I'd raise that point.<a href="../../../%C5%A1/a/r/User%7E%C5%A0arukinu_88ac.html" title="User:Šarukinu">Šarukinu</a> 01:45, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>True but the Empire as a whole starting with Sargon was Sumer and Akkad which encompassed Ashur and later Nineveh. Assur was under the helm of Akkadian dominance prior to its own locals taking command of the empire generations later. As I've stated in the Assyrians page "Akkadians were the ruling class of the Assyrians, those whom followed Ashur and were from Ashur<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESargonious_9f62.html" title="User:Sargonious">The Tsar is Gone but I am King</a> 18:21, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My friend Sargonius, i think you need a wikibreak cause you cannot make up your mind, you waste your time writing your opinion just to realise that it was all wrong and then you rewrite it, do some research before you write anything ok, cause this only prove how unreliable it is to listen to your funny stories, but dont worry, they are great for entertainment.</p>

<p>the word chaldean, before 600 and later is known as astrologys, scientits. (keepers of the old knowledge).</p>
<p>The assyrian church changed its name in 1800centry.</p>
<p>both churches and the melkites(rom) and maronites + chaldeans and nestorians come from the same church.</p>
<p>In 1662 when the Patriarch in Diyarbakir, Mar Shimun XIII Denha, broke communion with Rome, resumed relations with the line at Alqosh, and moved his seat to the village of Qochanis in the Turkish mountains. The Vatican responded by appointing a new patriarch to Diyarbakir to govern the Assyrians who stayed loyal to the Holy See. This latter group became known as the Chaldean Catholic Church. In 1804 the hereditary line of Patriarchs in Alqosh died out, and that church's hierarchy decided to accept the authority of the Chaldean patriarchs. The line of patriarchs at Qochanis remained independent.</p>

hope this gives you some answers, if you have any else questions then please dont hesetate to ask. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESuryoyo_55dc.html" title="User:Suryoyo">Suryoyo</a> (<a href="../../../s/u/r/User_talk%7ESuryoyo_67b7.html" title="User talk:Suryoyo">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Suryoyo_05c4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Suryoyo">contribs</a>) 18:49, 15 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
<p>So you agree with me that the Nestorian Church was made up of Chaldeans, the melkites and not only the Assyrians were from the Nestorian Church.</p>

<p><b>Bold text</b>== let me ask you a question... ==</p>
<p>asm, if you really are a "proffessor at Sydney University", why do you make grammatical and spelling mistakes? I am a cleaner, and I have better English usage as opposed to you! However, I agree with you on the Chaldean issues, and it is a shame my Assyrian brothers can not do the same! Assyrian blood n veins 04:37, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Good question, everyone makes mistakes except for God. I know several languages, and two of my worst language are Arabic and English. I have not been here for a long time nor am i going to stay her for much longer, the only reason why I am in New Zealand and Austraila is because i was offered a well paid job. Another reason why i have some few spelling mistakes are because</p>
<p>1) I dont have much time, and usually when im on wikipedia its often at night and when i am really tired</p>
<p>2) Because there are people in wiki who really get me angry, they dont know anything but pretends to be Historians.</p>

However, asm, how on earth did you get a job as a "Proffessor", which, which to be blatantly presumed includes lecturing in <b>English</b>?? If you cannot spell or write how do you accurately teach according to basic Australian English standards, on and off the Australian University Cirriculum, and individual succintly written syllabusus? By the way, which Units do you teach??</p>

P.S- My son goes to Sydney University, and is currently undertaking an undergraduate course as a double degree in Major Medicine/ History......

<p>Who said i cannot spell nor write, maybe you can write and read, but you have great difficulity in understanding simple concepts, well after all you are a cleaner. As a proffesor, my work is much more important than correcting spelling mistakes, maybe you need to clean up tiny pieces of rubbish and correct the way the chairs are situated, but I don't have time for that and why are we discussing my occupation after all I am not the one earning $10 an hour, however thank you for admitting something many assyrians cannot admitt.</p>

<p>Well check again Bani, its funny cause the university of NSW doesnt really give out personal information about visitors who are trying to influence their students with European intellegence. About asm_cc, he is not a high school student but my cousin, the meaning of Asm is significant for our family so before you state something make sure it is correct.</p>

<p>First of all, Proffessors are not likely to be called "visitors" are they...Second all, how dare you accuse of lying when I have that staff catalogue right infront of me!!!! Yes you are right that the university will not give out "personal" information, but it does, however give out all the names of <b>all</b> proffessors, along with their <b>uni</b> email address... once again I have to break your poor little heart..Your name is not there!!! Third of all, if your "cousin" asm_cc, is not a high school student then why would he put a tag on his user page- <b>"this user is a high school student"...</b> Last of all, I wouldn't exactly call someone that cant properly understand my refutes of adeuatly possessing European intelligence..</p>
<p>P.S-wHO IS BANI??? OR THIS SOME KIND OF ANCIENT ARAMAIC WORD???? Assyrian blood n veins 07:35, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Asm, I wish to ask you something.. Are you Chaldean Catholic, becuase if you are have you heard of the Bishop of Illionios- Bishop George Akkassian Hermiz Jakob, and his brother, Bishop Peter Hermiz Jakob? These two Bishops are brothers and are Assyrian, however, the Bishop Geore converted from the Holy Assyrian Apostolic Church of The East to Chaldena Catholic.Here is one example of people being if Assyrian ethniticy, but Cahldean Catholic aSSYRIAN. i AM nOT, HOWEVER STATING THAT CHALDEANS AND ASSYRIANS ARE THE SAME THING...BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT!!!!!</p>

Hi guys, im persian 4 life! I completely agree with users Assyrian Blood n Veins and Asm-ccc.Our peoples are different, but similar, and it's a shame others cant accept it...

<p>I didn't "change" anything, I just clarified the texts so there wouldn't be anymore confusion. My point is that Assyria is the historical region in which Assyrians inhabit. The modern "Chaldeans" didn't come from southern Iraq at least not since the Common Era. My point is the modern people weather they call themselves Assyrians/Chaldeans/Syriacs/Aramaeans is irrelevant, they are all the same people to an extent. So you get YOUR facts straight.<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESargonious_9f62.html" title="User:Sargonious">The Tsar is Gone but I am King</a> 14:35, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
