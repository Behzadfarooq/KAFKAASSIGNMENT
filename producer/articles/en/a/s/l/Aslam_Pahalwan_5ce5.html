<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/l/Aslam_Pahalwan_5ce5.html" title="Edit section: Career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Career</span></h2>
<p>Aslam Pahalwan started his wrestling career as the pupil of <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamida_Pahalwan_a0db.html" title="Hamida Pahalwan">Hamida Pahalwan</a> and the Great Gama of India. Aslam is one of the unbeatable wrestlers that the art of traditional wrestling produced when it flourished in India during the past.</p>
<p>His exercise routine was similar to that of his elder brother <a href="../../../b/h/o/Bholu_Pahalwan_ffb8.html" title="Bholu Pahalwan">Bholu Pahalwan</a>. He trained twice a day, relying mostly on basic Pahalwani exercises, such as bodyweight exercises like the Indian Pushups called <i>dands</i> and squats known as <i>baithaks</i> in the regional language, Or other ancient workouts like the Indian weight training with stones called <i>nals</i> and heavy clubs exercise known as <i>Joris</i> to increase strength, stamina and flexibility. A high-calorie and nutritious diet was a must to sustain bodyweight after a strenuous workout. He usually consumed an entire goat during a single meal.</p>
<p>Aslam started wrestling during <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940s</a>. He commenced his career by participating in tournaments held mostly in the <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punjab_region.html" title="Punjab region">Punjab</a>, but he also competed in games held in other parts of India. His first wrestling match was in <a href="../../../a/m/r/Amritsar.html" title="Amritsar">Amritsar</a> against Bala Pahalwan of India. He defeated his opponent in only ninety seconds. In another important test of his career Aslam defeated Niranjan Singh in <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patiala.html" title="Patiala">Patiala</a> in less than two minutes. During the pre-partition days, the Maharaja of Patiala used to sponsor a wrestling championship in his princely state each year, during the Islamic month of Moharram. During one such tournament Aslam defeated a wrestler known as Puran Singh, in a final showdown. He was rewarded a sum of ten thousand rupees by the Maharaja Bhopindar Singh for his success. He later moved into the limelight by beating Kala Pahalwan and Aslam Mohni Wala in the city of <a href="../../../l/a/h/Lahore.html" title="Lahore">Lahore</a>.</p>
<p>After the Indian Partition, Aslam got stationed in Lahore, Pakistan. He mostly confronted the best wrestlers of Pakistani Punjab. In one of the most exciting matches of his career, Aslam defeated the highly-skilled Younus Gujranwalia after nine minutes of spectacular wrestling for the Punjab Championship in Lahore. He was officially declared <b><a href="../../../p/e/h/Pehlwan.html#Pehlwani_titles" title="Pehlwan">Rustam-i-Punjab</a></b> (<i>ie.</i> Champion of Punjab) in Minto Park, Lahore. After becoming the champion of Punjab, he wrestled and defeated a number of <i>bona</i> <i>fide</i> wrestlers, like the 1939 IWA World Champion, George Pencheff, who were operating throughout India during early 1950s. The exact record of Aslam Pahalwan’s wrestling bouts has not been arranged yet. However, in 1953, overshadowed by his elder brother Bholu, Aslam issued challenges to wrestlers all over the world to compete against him, and announced a reward of 100,000 rupees to any wrestler who could beat him. In a challenge match, Aslam defeated the famed Indian wrestler Tarlok Singh at the National Stadium in <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karachi.html" title="Karachi">Karachi</a> in the second round. In another challenge match, Aslam defeated the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_Heavyweight_Championship_100a.html" title="European Union Heavyweight Championship">European Heavyweight Champion</a>, and former World Champion, <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bert_Assirati_f782.html" title="Bert Assirati">Bert Assirati</a> in <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Bombay, India</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_3.html" title="June 3">June 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>, within six minutes by slamming him unconscious in front of the 40,000 in attendance. Assirati was the strongest man in wrestling at the time of this match. An Indian entrepreneur rewarded Aslam with a sum of ten thousand rupees on his victory.</p>
<p>During the 50s, Aslam faced all challengers with a great deal of success. In 1957, he travelled to the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far_East_982f.html" title="Far East">Far East</a>. In <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore.html" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>, Aslam announced a one hundred thousand dollar reward for any wrestler who could beat him. In response to his challenge, he confronted twenty to thirty different wrestlers from around the world, and defeated them all. Even a number of significant wrestlers, like King Kong and Shaikh Wadi Ayub, failed to beat him. Aslam later defeated Tiger Sucha Singh and Joginder Singh at the National Stadium in Karachi in a challenge match. In May 1962 he defeated King Kong Czaja (the largest attraction in the history of wrestling) and Lofty Binnie of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> in Karachi.</p>
<p>During the early 60s, he wrestled in India and Pakistan simultaneously, and defeated the native American Sitting Bull and Sheik Wadi Ayub (the All Asian Champion from <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanon.html" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>). In 1967 he toured European countries and visited the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> with his other Bholu Brothers. This was a historic wrestling event sponsored by British promoter Orig Williams. Aslam visited the leading arenas of the North, Midlands and <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, defeating all opponents. He becomes the Commonwealth Champion. On his return home he was awarded the <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashtrapati_Award_6e8f.html" title="Rashtrapati Award">President's Award of Pride of Performance</a>. <a href="http://216.109.125.130/search/cache?p=%22aslam+pahlwan%22&amp;prssweb=Search&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;dups=1&amp;fr=FP-tab-web-t&amp;vst=0&amp;vs=www.sports.gov.pk&amp;u=www.sports.gov.pk/html/pride_of_performance_wrestling.htm&amp;w=%22aslam+pahlwan%22&amp;d=GlafYEaqMjoM&amp;icp=1&amp;.intl=us" class="external autonumber" title="http://216.109.125.130/search/cache?p=%22aslam+pahlwan%22&amp;prssweb=Search&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;dups=1&amp;fr=FP-tab-web-t&amp;vst=0&amp;vs=www.sports.gov.pk&amp;u=www.sports.gov.pk/html/pride_of_performance_wrestling.htm&amp;w=%22aslam+pahlwan%22&amp;d=GlafYEaqMjoM&amp;icp=1&amp;.intl=us" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>Aslam gave up wrestling during the early <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>. His career spanned almost three decades. He was a man of faith and mostly faced challenges. Frequently commencing a match with a vicious yell and a vibrant charge towards the ring before clashing with his opponent, he generally used a combination of hand blows, Flying Kicks, head butts and submission maneuvers like the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Crab_4c4f.html" title="Boston Crab">Boston Crab</a> to subdue his opponents. Aslam is best remembered as the uncrowned World Champion. Aslam died on 7th January 1989 at the age of 62 years in Pakistan. His son Zubair Aslam alias Jhara was a champion wrestler.</p>
