<p>Astrokey, you rock! Thanks for the map of Queensland. It's great! I really like it. Just two small comments. The state in the south west corner is SA, not NSW. Also, if you felt like fiddling around with it a bit, you might want to add the major cities mentioned in the article (Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, Rockhampton, Bundaberg, Hervey Bay, Brisbane, Toowoomba, Mount Isa), but I can see that that might be problematic because the fonts would be too small to read from within the article. It looks really good. I like it! Thanks again! And thanks for biting the bullet and getting the article started. I've been meaning to do it for ages. I hope you don't mind all the additions I've made to it. Let me know if you have any suggestions to improve it. (see my comments on <a href="../../../a/w/n/WP%7EAWNB_94e7.html" title="WP:AWNB">WP:AWNB</a> under 'Regions of Queensland' article heading). -- <a href="../../../a/d/z/User%7EAdz_7b0c.html" title="User:Adz">Adz</a> 11:49, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks about the map and Arrgh! cant believe I messed up the states, it should be alright now. I really liked the way you expanded the article, I made a pretty crappy start - couldnt find any official info on the regions. It looks alot better now. I'll see what I can do about adding the cities -- <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrokey44_a15f.html" title="User:Astrokey44">Astrokey44</a><small>|<a href="../../../a/s/t/User_talk%7EAstrokey44_2cf4.html" title="User talk:Astrokey44">talk</a></small> 12:15, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks again. They both look great! Don't worry too much about the cities on the Qld one unless you really want to. Would be nice, but I'm sure you have better things to do. I also came across <a href="../../../a/u/s/Image%7EAustralia_Locator_Map.svg_2765.html" title="Image:Australia Locator Map.svg">these locator maps</a> which I thought might be useful to you. They are being used on National Park pages like <a href="../../../m/u/n/Mungkan_Kandju_National_Park_a3a2.html" title="Mungkan Kandju National Park">this one</a> but I'm not sure how you locate the dot where you want it to. You might be able to work it out. (I'm still having trouble importing images into Inkscape and playing with it, so I'm not getting very far!).</dd>

<p>I noticed some of the articles you're making on deviant art artists. I'm not very familiar with deviant art so a question for you is whether the artists should be listed by their real names (Brianna Garcia) or their nicknames (Bri-chan). Since I don't know the community I don't know whether their real names are recognizable, which is why I'm leaving the decision to you. WHichever you pick, a case can be made that there should be redirects. --<a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBachrach44_302c.html" title="User:Bachrach44">Bachrach44</a> 01:32, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Thanks a lot for the barnstar. I was pretty happy with the animated map I did for the bushfire page, I just wish I had a bit more of a knack for graphic design, as they never look quite as good as I hoped they would. I can try doing seperate district maps with the other dirsticts greyed out, if you think they would be better. Might get a chance to have a go at them tonight. Of course many images are failing to load on wikipedi for me at the moment, nothing unusual there. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartyman_a0b9.html" title="User:Martyman">Martyman</a>-<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartyman_49e7.html" title="User talk:Martyman">(talk)</a></small> 06:21, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I got the district maps done and uploaded.

Are they what you where thinking of? Anyway I am off to bed as it is my first day back at work tomorrow, feel free to add them to the articles if you are happy with them.

<p>G'day Astrokey,</p>
<p>properly-wikified dates always appear the way the user's settings would have them appear, regardless of how they're written in the code. I've got mine set to always appear "21 January 2006", for instance. As such, it doesn't matter how they're written in the code. I always revert changes to the date format or the spelling variant (e.g. colour -&gt; color) on principle, unless the person making the change has a good reason. A good reason for mispelling "colour" as "color" might be that the article's about an American person, or that the article's being rewritten and the author feels more comfortable with his own variant (a bad reason would be "I didn't know colour was a real word", and I <i>have</i> seen it). A good reason for changing the date from "21 January 2006" to "January 21 2006" might be that there's already six dates in there, all using a different format, or, as above, the whole rewrite thing (a bad reason, which I've also seen, is "I like it better this way").</p>
<p>As for why I use yyyy-mm-dd when I'm writing, there's two reasons. One is that when I use dd-M-yyyy it's often edited by silly Americans, and the other is that I have a tendency to transpose digits and make other silly errors, and by using an unfamiliar date format to write I'm less likely to make a silly mistake because I've got to take more care. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 09:04, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Would it be possible for you to make an adjustment? I think the map could be simplified a bit so that readers will better understand the dispute.

Your map has two colors for this area (light green and dark brown), which could be changed into one color. Likewise you have three colors for the United States (dark green, peach, and gray), which could be simplified into one color.</p>
<p>Also, have you checked out the map color suggestions at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Maps_fb9d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Maps">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Maps</a>?

<dd>I'm sort of a regional history specialist for the Pacific Northwest; please see my notes on the Oregon map on the Requested Maps list and also on Kevin Myer's Talk page. I see the washington-edu map linked above also has the same failings as the other maps/map features I'm critical of as being non-POV. There are a lot of assumptions about the history of the Oregon Dispute which Americans easily fall into; conversely because it is a British Columbian issue and therefore low on the priority of Canadian historians, it gets ignored from our side of the border as do most things to do with BC history; but there are some trenchant facts that have to be included, and without them the map and any articles it is used illustrate will not be non-POV.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 19:26, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. Saw your note on my page and am responding here; just briefly I hope but it's been a bit since I got it so here goes with some preliminaries. There's textual things that have to be written as well but I don't ahve the time right now due to other commitments and life being what it is and all that; and needing to find all those cites etc. is time consuming. Basic thing is that historically the term Oregon Country is entirely American, at least from within the viewpoint of the British Empire, and of the Hudson's Bay Company, for whom it was the Columbia District. North of that, with a boundary roughly somewhere at Kamloops, was New Caledonia (the coastal Fort Simpson was part of the New Caledonia fur district. The Fort Langley establishment and <i>its</i> satellites were subordinate to the Columbia District, via Fort Douglas which once established also administered the north coastal forts; a precise boundary between "Columbia" and New Caledonia was never established, although it appears to at least be the line of the Thompson River in the Interior. Kamloops was administered (I think) from Fort Vancouver (later from Fort Victoria).</p>
<p>So point is there should be <i>that</i> boundary shown - the two British administrative units (the HBC functioning as the British proxy-by-claim/monopoly in the region, even though it did not have outright ownership as it did east of the Rockies). Speaking of east of the Rockies, that's properly Rupert's Land, and "British North America" could be subtitled, as was the custom on old Canadian historical maps such as in were my textbooks in the '60s (most published in the '50s, no doubt). British North America was only a loose collective term for the collective of British colonies and the Company's half-continent trade monopoly, and the farflung Pacific Northwest collection of forts and small settlements; quite a disparate bunch and the term didn't become politically loaded until the movement towards Confederation later in the 1860s, such that "British North America Act" was the name of the Canadian constitution until 1982. Note that it was not the Canadas and Maritimes Act, or the Canada Act, but the British North America Act; the name was an inducement and a reminder to the Pacific colonies to join up, instead of resist union, despite the impossibilities of independence or continued colonial status. So anyway, your term "British North America" would also include "Disputed Territory" and the Orange Blob, which also is/was disputed territory from the British point of view.</p>
<p>I haven't dug up the cites for the sketch maps I had of the competing claims and their sequencing/evolution <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Oregon_boundary_dispute" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Oregon_boundary_dispute" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Oregon_boundary_dispute</a>, but I know them well; most of the offerings were British propositions, or ones entertained at least by American negotiators (at the cost of a few good dinners and not a few bottles of good wine); there's an actual sequence of dates somewhere I read, but not in table form; maybe in the Akriggs' <i>Chronicles</i>. If you know the country, the boundary propositions were all quite logical; the 49th Parallel only seemed to be the most rational, certainly the easiest to survey (or NOT, actually); "the summit of this range", "the line of that river" and so on. It wasn't necessary to survey such lines, nor in those days very possible at all. The Line-of-the-Cascades boundary was secondarily important, if in an arcane way, as the head British military official in the colonies wanted to invade and re-take Puget Sound during the American Civil War. Douglas favoured this, but London turned it down anyway; all part of that Crane affair or whatever it's called with the blockade etc. In a real escalation of British action against the Union during that war any British success would have gained at least the line of the Columbia, and sought more if in outright victory, including everything south of the Columbia, or even the Snake. If the British had followed up Cook's and Vancouver's recommendations that the area be used for a transplantation colony (derailed because of that Napoleon guy) and so "we" would have been composed of all those fun types who wound up in Australia; Lord knows what living under the rain full-time would turn them into, though. Point here is that long before the Whitman Party showed up the British, if they listened to their captains' research, would have populated the country and the US would have been potentially shut off the Pacific entirely. That's a subject for soc.history.what-if and not here, but worth remembering when looking at the different POVs on this. The British presence was very real, but is always under-rated in American-written texts, despite the favourable image of McLoughlin common in US-published books (and not so much in Canadian ones, by the way; Simpson on the other hand is eulogized, Douglas nearly sainted).</p>
<p>Back to the map. A series of shadings might work; typically in old atlases they used diagonal colour bars, with finer grades for smaller areas and so forth. I've got an old version of this somewhere - hmm, where did I get that basemap from? - has all the smaller rivers that yours doesn't; although some boundary propositions were montane spines rather than rivers; such as that of the Cascades (the last-ditch British position until the 49th was treatied). The British were at one point ready to sacrifice the Kootenays - the Big Bend of the Columbia from its source and to the south of that - in a bid to keep the right bank of the Columbia to the sea; or that was Douglas' hope anyway; London didn't understand what they were signing away; if there was any hesitation it was because there was growing awareness of the timber and coal resourcesoof the Puget Sound, Georgia Strait and Queen Charlotte Strait, which were of stragetic value to the Royal Navy.</p>
<p>Items that should be on the map: Fort Victoria and its port Esquimalt (subtitle Royal Navy Base or RN base), Forts Kamloops and Colville and I'll have to give some thought as to which others (there were many across the north). Forts Langley, Nisqually and Puyallup definitely have to be on the map, and I think Fort Rupert.</p>
<p>The most important trade route is the route of annual Express from Fort Vancouver for Port Churchhill on Hudson's Bay, which ran up the Okanagan and across the Cariboo to Fort Saint James before heading down the Peace River to the Prairies; there was no equivalent overland route from the Canadas, i.e. a settlement route; what hadn't come via the Express route (HBC employees and their local offspring) was marine by nature - for most of the rest of the 19th Century, in fact. Canadians also like to see the "routes of the explorers"; in our region it's one propaganda tool to prove that "we" were around the area before "you" were; Alexander, Fraser, Thompson and of course your infidel Lewis and Clark and that pirate Captain Grey and all those wild-eyed catskinner types that haunted the country before the days of the Williamette settlement. The fur-co explorers' routes coincide with the important fur trade routes anyway, though, so no need to obsess over them as well I guess. The main routes which were the vital links within the area at the time of the <i>introduction</i> of the Oregon Trail should be given context (as it was only the <i>newest</i> way to get to the area, not the first), and the presence of the British infrastructure and the old pre-Oregon Trail routes, that should be shown. The caption to the map should also be The Oregon Country a.k.a. The Columbia District.</p>
<p>Cute little Union Jacks and Old Glories and miniature forts and so on might be fun to spiff it up with, maybe.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'll draft up some other important trail/trade routes from our end of things and post them here when I've done that; and also find those other basemaps that I colourized a bit, though not quite in this context but you'll get the idea. Gotta zzzzzzz.</p>

<p>The small regions in Norway are traditional and not always very precisely defined (cf. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Quebec_Regions_b124.html#Traditional" title="List of Quebec Regions">traditional regions of Québec</a>. I think they probably correspond more or less to medieval pre-unification jurisdictions/spheres of power, known as "<a href="../../../p/e/t/Petty_kingdoms.html" title="Petty kingdoms">petty kingdoms</a>", "clandoms" or "chiefdoms". However, for practical reasons it makes good sense to simply lump together the clusters of contemporary administrative divisions (municipalities and counties) as indicated on the WP articles. Some districts do overlap while other areas do not fit neatly into any traditional district. Btw, the term "district" in this context was a compromise translation that wikipedians came up with for this specific purpose, since "region" had already been taken (with the meaning larger groups of counties). "Region" or "province" would still be a better rendering in my opinion, though. Oh well. =] Take care! <i>//<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Adamsky_7ebf.html" title="User:Big Adamsky">Big Adamsky</a> 08:21, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>Yes, they are very pleasant and clear in colours and layout! One suggestion, though: To remove the English translation of toponyms as they clutter up the narrow vertical surfaces on the image. Also, consider adding an extra striped layer to show the vastness of the largest national park in the world? <b>:</b>] <i>//<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Adamsky_7ebf.html" title="User:Big Adamsky">Big Adamsky</a> 14:53, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<p>Hi there, you've done some really great maps - just have a quick comment though... on your <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer_Olympic_Games_b216.html" title="Summer Olympic Games">Summer Olympic Games</a> map you've put 2010 down as the date for London when it should be 2012. If you still have your original from when you made the map then if you could change it that would be great. Also, you've put London as an orange dot (two games) but because you're including future ones too it seems slightly confusing. Maybe italicise future games? But I guess that just means it goes out of date more quickly so perhaps a different colour for cities that have hosted it three or more time? Sorry to be such a pain!

In the court case you mention, the small details were used as <i>evidence</i> that the rest of the map of the area had been copied. While it would make sense to say that geographic data can't be copyrighted, a reading that I take for the location of a crossroads will invariably be slightly different to a reading anyone else takes. <span style="font-family: Verdana;"><a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_g2s_b24e.html" title="User:Ed g2s">ed g2s</a> • <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_g2s_9b37.html" title="User talk:Ed g2s">talk</a></span> 12:58, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
