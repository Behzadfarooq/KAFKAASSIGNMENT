<p>Hello Asterion, I would appreciate advice with what has been done on WP with regard to this region. I believe Gryffindor has an agenda where he has systematically gone through and pushed a highly-Austrian POV. He changed the Trentino-Alto Adige page first to Trentino-South Tyrol in Oct. of 2005. Now we have the Province of Bolzano-Bozen called <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Tyrol_30d1.html" title="South Tyrol">South Tyrol</a>. The city of Bolzano-Bozen switched to Bozen-Bolzano. The town of Brennero-Brenner, simply as Brenner. I'm from this region, and I can say this is getting to the point of ridiculous... I don't know if to cry or laugh. I mean, because a user is very determined, he can just do this? Taalo 23:53, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Taalo, I am not prepared to assume bad faith towards anyone. As far as I see it, we had a long period of discussion with several options proposed and surveyed. As a sideline, I have spent most of my adult life in England and I can vouch for <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Tyrol_30d1.html" title="South Tyrol">South Tyrol</a> being the standard English denomination.

<dd>I have lived all my life in the US, and I never heard anyone say South Tyrol before. I have no problem whatsoever with the words South Tyrol. It is indeed a valid translation of the German Sudtirol. BUT, I do have a problem with the Province of Bolzano/Bozen being named as <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Tyrol_30d1.html" title="South Tyrol">South Tyrol</a>. I do have a problem with users of Austrian/German background going and renaming Bolzano-Bozen to Bozen-Bolzano, etc., etc. Also, Trentino-Alto Adige being changed to Trentino-South Tyrol is another big one, and was the start of all of this. Gryffindor made the change on his own, and THEN expected a discussion to be held. The whole time he plays innocent, as if he just wants to "use English in the English wikipedia". He definitely has a strong opinion to using this as the new name.. and he will enforce it even using admin privelidges. Sorry, I simply do not buying that he is doing what is in the best interest of WP. Taalo 00:23, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Asterion, I sincerely agree with you. Hopefully the debate or controversy is over. The official name of the region is "Trentino-Alto Adige" as per the Italian government and many creditable sources listed on talk pages. The alternate (german) name is "Sudtirol" (accent missing) - and is reflected in the listings correct as per wiki rules. Same with the province name - correct name is "Bolzano" with the alternate name of "Bozen" (german) listed correctly to reflect wiki rules. We need help enforcing this, really. The only issue now is with the city naming convention for that region and province. By the Italian government ruling, they use a dual-naming convention with the Italian name and then German name (i.e. Bolzano-Bozen). Sorry for all of this, I have learned and will do better in the future! <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 20:39, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Asterion, please lets not have this go back to the German POV version. For the past year Gryffindor has been pushing his agenda incrimentally. Now we even have the Province of Bolzano listed as "South Tyrol". I saw that you mentioned to Ryulong that this discussion has been ongoing. But how can we let people who are trying to push a German POV just do this? Bolzano-Bozen was switched to Bozen-Bolzano. I mean, you just have to look some at what they have been doing to see their motives. Gryffindor originally moved the page Trentino-Alto Adige himself on 25 Oct 2005 to Trentino-South Tyrol. This should raise a flag right away that he is not partial in this. You mention an agreement was reached before, but it was one that was reached by a majority of German/Austrian users. That, and... do we name Provinces now by consensus? I'm sorry, but I can not assume good intentions from the user Gryffindor. I feel he abuses the Wikipedia system, and actually goes about it as a snake. And sure, I'm going to get scolded for that last message, but, for goodness sake, aren't we required to stand up to this sort of stuff?? take care. Taalo 23:56, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, replied. As I'm learning the rules, I will definitely try my best to resolve this situation (which has been going on for a year). Any explanation you need with regard to this region, etc. I can try to provide. It is where my family is from afterall. I just feel this nonsense and POV has to end. A solution that has all parties satisfied should be what we look for, no? Take care. Taalo 18:17, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Asterion! Thank you very much for your message! It's great that you have such a wonderful reason to go back home - best wishes to you brother and the lucky lady and have great fun at the wedding! Just don't worry about the images or anything (though if you could get anything it would be great), I believe WP is lucky to have you on contributing in all the capacity you have!</p>
<p>As concerns the articles, I guess Barreiros can wait for some time, I did as much as I could to it not speaking Spanish or knowing much about the company anyway. I believe, however, that our dear <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chrysler_180.html" title="Chrysler 180">Chrysler 180</a> is starting to appear in a quite nice shape, at least content-wise - I need to sort out the Centura section yet, with references et al, but I think I would need your help with the Barreiros section and making sure all info is in the article. More importantly, you could perhaps get some photos from Spanish Chrysler enthusiasts/owners far easier than I ever could, so if you had any free time in the coming weeks, it would be great if you could think about that.</p>
<p>Again, have a great time in Spain and wish the young couple (or how do you call them in Spanish or English) all the best from a fellow WP user&#160;:D</p>

<p>Hi Asterion, I am glad you asked me this because I had the suspicion all along, but considering the barrage of personal attacks I have been under I wasn't going to say it out loud otherwise more abuse would have probably come. I have a number of suspects that I was going to give in for inspection, wasn't there some programme by some user who can check up on these things, including I.P. addresses? thanks for your help, I really appreciate it. <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGryffindor_3473.html" title="User:Gryffindor"><font color="red">Gryffindor</font></a> 21:19, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>HAH, I think this is the first time I have agreed with you <b>ever</b> Gryffindor. There is hope! I did also have suspicion that at least one user is a sockpuppet. I noticed one user just registered and cast a vote <b>supporting</b>. I sincerely hope that it is not a misguided attempt to influence the discussion, because for once we need to be <b>honest</b> about this and discuss it professionally -- and not taint things like this. Oh, did you read that last sentence of mine their buddy? ^_- I have been attacking what you have done Gryffindor, not you personally. I'm sorry, but the purpose also of <b>being firm</b> is to confront people when they do things which appear to be dubious. Sorry, but there is no blank check on here under the cover of the concepts of assuming the best. later. Taalo 00:11, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, given I assume this may be (hopefully not, but yeah, it is too suspicious) some misguided attempt to boost the voting, I'll try to see who it is and ask them to just come clean, and ditch the b.s. I for one must say I don't even believe in this yes/no voting. Not only does it open things up to sockpuppets, meatpuppets, etc. It just allows <b>user groups</b> to vote in their POV. I'll post a warning on the page. Asterion, one note. I hope you can get at least a bit of an impression that I want these pages to most fairly reflect these regions. Please feel free to message me also with such concerns. I know my "login" time is short, but I'm just trying my best. Apologies if I'm wary of Gryffindor.. but actions do speak louder than words. regards. Taalo 00:27, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My humble apologies Asterion. I didn't realize your policy, nevertheless, I'm sorry. Yeah, and if you know how to figure out what is going on, please do take care of it, as I don't even know how. I just posted a warning not to be silly like this. Regardless, I'm learning a whole lot of stuff about my own region through all this. I just hope everyone can also learn -- and try to remove any politics/nationalism, etc. Again, sorry, and also thanks for being involved in all this. Out of all of this, I miss visiting the area most of all. my best regards. Taalo 06:40, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is fine, Taalo. We need a general discussion place for this subject, instead so many individual "requested moves". I will ask for advice on this from other uninvolved parties. Maybe a subpage hanging from Talk:South Tyrol/Dual name controversy or something along the lines. As it stands, the discussions are spread all around and it is quite chaotic. I would also suggest some sort of mediation by uninvolved parties, if you all accept.

<dd>Amen, I'm about to go nuts. I wish we just were all sitting around a table. Anyway, I've tried to do the best work I can with this. I hope we just get to something acceptable. I think having some uninvolved parties help us would be great. I can only hope we come up with a fair and neutral situation where everyone can be happy (year right). Well, I can hope. Again, sorry for posting on your talk page if this is wrong again. regards. Taalo 07:10, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You mention you have been to Croatia. My guess is it would have been to Dalmatian Coast Croatia. Have you been to the island of Korcula?</p>
<p>I would like to hear what you think about the possible Croatian origin of Marco Polo.</p>
<p><br />
Eg British are often mistaken in the same way eg A Jones would be Welsh origin but some say English...hope you understand the confusion to an outsider. Eg Columbus was said to be Spanish, but some say he was Italian and some even say Portuguese.</p>
<p>Re Polo i would think he was Venetian but if he was born in Korcula he was of Croat stock not Italian. Venetians were not just Italian, they were Croats and Albanians too.</p>

<p>Yep, Split is nice so is most of Croatia. It's much like Turkey, Italy, Greece etc....all those places share a common architecture etc.... What do you think of Marco Polo being of Croat origin? I wanted to see what you thought. Brits have Roman influence too...Croats have Venetian .... Let me know what you think.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
<p>I just wanted to see if you we're aware of the idea that he might be of Croat origin. Great to see.</p>
<p>People label the Croat theory as Croat Pov ...yet proof is shown by non Croat people such as Hart, Yule etc....</p>
<p><br />
It's a bit like Columbus i guess..origin is&#160;????</p>

<p>Hi Asterion, we won't ever get a neutral solution this way with the region, province and town pages of this area. Can you help me get some mature and neutral admins involved? Someone that can help run the discussion maybe. I can see how there can be debate in using Trentino-Alto Adige or Trentino-South Tyrol. But for the province, it is definitely the Province of Bolzano. The area is South Tyrol, for sure, but we can't go renaming provinces and states to fit some users opinions. Everything is just being voted on by national lines almost. The funny thing is I have never seen an English map that has anything but Bolzano and Trento as the two provinces. We shouldn't use Wikipedia to try and rewrite things. I hope there are not many more cases of this on Wikipedia.. but somehow I'd guess there are a lot. Anyway, help us Asterion, please. Very few seem to want to look at both sides of the issue or even re-evaluate their <i>opinions</i>. take care. ciao. Taalo 17:04, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Taalo. Personally, I agree that the province should be referred as Province of Bolzano, but the most common name in English for the area/region is South Tyrol. Regarding getting some admins involved, Dijxtra raised the issue in the Administrators' Noticeboard. If nothing happens, you could agree with all the other participants in the talk page to <a href="../../../r/f/m/WP%7ERfM_d120.html" title="WP:RfM">request mediation</a>. I will be in Seville from this Saturday till Monday 16th, so I'm not really sure if I'll get a chance to check wikipedia at all.

<dd>Hi Asterion, yup, we've already had someone come and offer to help find a solution. Feel really happy to see this sort of effort. Actually, have no disagreement with you. The province is Bolzano, the city is Bolzano, the <i>area/region</i> is Alto Adige-Suedtirol (aka South Tyrol). Hopefully we can come up with a way to have a <i>province</i> page like we have for every other Italian province, and at the same time have an section or page to discuss "South Tyrol" (though I feel most of this can be, and has been done, on Trentino-Alto Adige/Trentino-South Tyrol. Anyway, this is boring with regards to a nice trip, so enjoy your vacation in Seville. my regards. ciao Taalo 22:41, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Perhaps we should state in the language section that French is widely used as a first language in business in Morocco (especially in large cooporations), and that in some areas Spanish is a common second language. Just my thoughts Scotbotuk 14:26, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it makes sense. Maybe we should just keep Arabic as official and add a footnote for the rest.

<dd>Officially, it is Arabic that is official. French is widely used in administrations and schools. We can't say Spanish is widely used w/o avoiding NPOV (i.e. including WS). Eventhough Spanish/Spain has many cultural influences it is not widely used or is a common language in Northern Morocco. Spanish terms are widely used (i.e. Nevera, caja, tabla, etc...), true but they are usually incorporated into <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moroccan_Arabic_fe40.html" title="Moroccan Arabic">Moroccan Arabic</a> phrases. -- <i><a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF">Szvest</a> 00:52, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</i> <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: orange"><sup><i>Wiki me up ®</i></sup></font></a></small>

<dd>Sorry, Fayssal. I did not think about that. In any case, if you think thye infobox looks messy, maybe it makes sense to keep Arabic only and add the footnote for both Berber and French, as important but not not official.

<p>With all due respect, Mets501. Your comment when closing the WP:RM was strictly unnecessary ("It really doesn't matter: it's just a squigly line"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AOscar_Nunez&amp;diff=80131073&amp;oldid=79319424" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AOscar_Nunez&amp;diff=80131073&amp;oldid=79319424" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). An administrator is not expected to take sides in that sense and/or using demeaning language towards one of the opinions expressed. I apology in advance if I misinterpreted your words. The proper use of diacritics in an encyclopedia such as Wikipedia is important indeed (<a href="../../../c/s/b/WP%7ECSB_93c9.html" title="WP:CSB">systemic bias</a> springs to mind). Aside a couple of border-line comments from Gene Nygaard addressed to the nominator <a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrBat_c7e7.html" title="User:DrBat">User:DrBat</a>, there were no incidences of uncivility either. If anything, editors should be commended for taking the steps to discuss the matter instead engaging on pointless edit wars (e.g. see <a href="../../../p/r/i/Pri%C5%A1tina.html" title="Priština">Priština</a>).

<dd>Hi Asterion. I'm sorry that you took my words that way. I, if anyone, am someone who is quite concerned about diacritics. That was the primary reason I set up <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetsBot_6c59.html" title="User:MetsBot">MetsBot</a>, in fact: to fix diacritics (like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Golden_Baseball_League&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70604350" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Golden_Baseball_League&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70604350" rel="nofollow">this</a>). I did not mean my comment to be demeaning towards either side, all I meant was that there is so much inconsistency with Nunez and Nuñez in the case of this actor that it was obvious that neither one was the wrong one, and way to much time had been spent arguing over it. If I were to have my personal opinion, it would definitely be to add the ñ, but being the closing administrator, I had to put my opinion aside and close the case. You are right, though, my words were a bit too harsh, considering there were no personal attacks or edit wars involved, so I've changed them. Thanks again. —<span style="font: small-caps 14px times; color: red;"><a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">Mets<small>501</small></a> (<a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMets501_fc50.html" title="User talk:Mets501">talk</a>)</span> 10:58, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hola Asterion, el artículo del pueblo andaluz esta bien, aunque se podría ampliar; de hecho casi todos los artículos de la wikipedia que he leido podrían mejorarse <b>sustancialmente</b>, pero es un comienzo mas que bueno.

<p>I would like to know: if User:Ew or User:Naconkantari is administrator, then why is administrator abusing <b>"m"</b> edit in wrong way repeatedly??
