<p>Hi, just looking through the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_of_Pakistan_91a0.html" title="Military of Pakistan">Military of Pakistan</a> article and it's daughter articles, I noticed there were two templates in use of which you created one in August 2005.

<p>Still trying to work out the best way to categorise acts like this. After a discussion with <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">User:Mais oui!</a> yesterday we thought that that UK acts that apply only to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland should go into the subcategories. I thought to begin with that an act like this could go in both Scottish and British categories, but he tells me articles should not go in a category and its subcategory. What do you think? <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurando_7134.html" title="User:Kurando">Kurando</a> | <a href="../../../k/u/r/User_talk%7EKurando_4c8b.html" title="User talk:Kurando">^_^</a> 09:26, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>One solution would be to create a new category, called something like Category:British laws (Scotland) or Category:British laws which apply only to Scotland, and make it a subcat of both <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category%7EBritish_laws_3a4e.html" title="Category:British laws">Category:British laws</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/o/Category%7EScottish_laws_4ecf.html" title="Category:Scottish laws">Category:Scottish laws</a>. Although the current system is OK, it would perhaps be better to differentiate between pre-Union Scottish laws, British laws for Scotland, and devolved Scottish laws (at the moment they are all just lumped in together, which will become more and more messy as more articles are started and entered in the cat).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Although I regret the catty nature of Astrotrain's comment left on your Talk page yesterday, he does have a reasonable point in wanting British laws to be correctly labelled as such, even when they are only applicable to Scotland.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>All of the above goes for Eng, Wales and NI too.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, I think that an article actually listing all the UK parliament legislation only applicable to Scotland would be an excellent tool, helping to give structure to the new subcat. Same obviously for Eng, Wales and NI.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, another "finally": you really, really ought to try very hard indeed not to enter an article in both a subcat and the parent cat (although occasional exceptions do exist, this isn't one of them). It is just standard good practice, widely observed throughout Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 18:22, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't think it is as simple as you say with regards to creating categories such as Category:British laws (Scotland) or Category:British laws which apply only to Scotland. Although British laws with (Scotland) in the title only have legal effect in Scotland, they do sometimes contain measures to amend laws that apply to the rest of the UK. For instance, the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunday_Working_%28Scotland%29_Act_2003_61b2.html" title="Sunday Working (Scotland) Act 2003">Sunday Working (Scotland) Act 2003</a> which you have changed to Scottish laws contains only amendments to certain sections of the Employment Rights Act 1996 that previously only applied in England and Wales.</p>
<p>Better to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>For UK Parliament since 1707- British laws</li>
<li>For Scottish Parliament since 1999- Scottish laws</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dd>Personally I wouldn't bother with what Mais_oui! thinks in regards to categories. He has a history of removing all the British categories from various articles, and changing British to English, Scottish etc. If a law is passed by the UK Parliament it is a British law- not a Scottish law. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 20:16, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps I am being a bit thick here, but I genuinely do not understand. You say:
<ul>
<li>"British laws with (Scotland) in the title only have legal effect in Scotland". That is in line with my understanding, and is crystal clear, and easily categorisable.</li>
<li>"contains only amendments to certain sections of the Employment Rights Act 1996 that previously only applied in England and Wales". Navigating through the tortuous phraseology, what I think you are saying is that that law extended what was previously only an E &amp; W law into Scotland? Is that right? Whatever, the fact is that the terms of that Act apply solely to Scotland: it is a Scottish law.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I really do think that we ought to take the most sensible, and above all <i>useful</i>, approach to this. It is utterly undeniable that every single Westminster statute with "(Scotland)" in the title has a special status in Scottish law: therefore all such articles really must be included in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Category%7EScottish_laws_4ecf.html" title="Category:Scottish laws">Category:Scottish laws</a>. Whether this is via direct entry, or as a subcat, is open to debate. As I said earlier, subcats are the most obvious solution.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, you missed out a third, crucial, category of Scottish law: <a href="../../../a/c/t/Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Scotland%2C_prior_to_the_Union_f5cb.html" title="Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, prior to the Union">Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, prior to the Union</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, I consider it singularly unhelpful that you have "archived" a discussion strand on your Talk page that was only started today.--<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 21:30, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Employment Rights Act 1996 was originally a law that applied throughout the UK, though a few sections only applied in E&amp;W. The 2003 Act amended these sections to apply also in Scotland. No new law was created, just an extension of existing law from E&amp;W to include Scotland. To say "Scottish law", implies that it is a unique law for Scotland- when in fact it is exactly the same law as England and Wales. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 21:55, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"No new law was created". This may be stating the blindingly ovious, but a new law most certainly was created! No less than <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statute_law.html" title="Statute law">statute law</a>. The new law even has a title, a date, a text, an archived debate and parliamentary vote (and a Wikipedia article): <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunday_Working_%28Scotland%29_Act_2003_61b2.html" title="Sunday Working (Scotland) Act 2003">Sunday Working (Scotland) Act 2003</a>.</dd>
<dd>The Act called the Sunday Working (Scotland) Act 2003 is a unique law for Scotland: it has absolutely no bearing whatsoever on England, Northern Ireland or Wales: it is a Scottish law. I think that you really are being a little obscurantist here. <a href="../../../s/c/o/Category%7EScottish_laws_4ecf.html" title="Category:Scottish laws">Category:Scottish laws</a> is exactly what it says on the tin.--<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 22:15, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do see your point. However laws passed by the UK parliament should be kept seperate from laws passed by the Scottish Parliament to avoid confusion. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 22:39, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was agreeing with you on that point: <a href="../../../s/c/o/Category%7EScottish_laws_4ecf.html" title="Category:Scottish laws">Category:Scottish laws</a> should have (at least) three subcats, with names something like:
<ul>
<li>Category:Acts of the Estates of Parliament</li>
<li>Category:Acts of the Westminster Parliament which apply only to Scotland</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/c/t/Category%7EActs_of_the_Scottish_Parliament_b6ff.html" title="Category:Acts of the Scottish Parliament">Category:Acts of the Scottish Parliament</a></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I'm not sure that that wording is best, not least because I'm not sure if Statutory Instruments are meant to be getting included too, but you get my drift.--<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 23:31, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Sunday Working (Scotland) Act 2003 is actually more complex than that. Although the purpose of the Act is to make a change that relates to Scotland, the Act itself does not have an "extent" provision (normally found in the last few sections) and therefore applies UK-wide. It does therefore amend English law. While many Acts with "(Scotland)" in the title do indeed extend only to Scotland, this is not always the case - for example some provisions of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 applied to England, Wales and Northern Ireland and the Act included a provision relating to the Channel Islands. The moral of this story is that the presence or absence of "(Scotland)" from the short title of an Act is not a foolproof guide. We had much debate when the Scottish Parliament was established about whether its Acts needed to have "(Scotland)" or some other indicator of their Scottishness in the title.--<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorge_Burgess_ecd1.html" title="User:George Burgess">George Burgess</a> 14:24, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your input, very interesting comments.

<p>I am in favour of new subcategories per mais oui!'s suggestion as most of the exisiting categories are rather overloaded anyway. If we kept British laws, Scottish laws and English laws, and then had</p>
<ol>
<li>'UK acts' which contained all acts passed by UK</li>
<li>'Scot acts' passed by Scot parl</li>
<li>Laws passed by UK which apply to Scot would go in UK acts AND Scot laws, but not Scot acts</li>
</ol>
<p>which would make a somewhat more complex categorisation scheme, but I think less ambiguos as it would not contain double entries. Anyway, i think I will try it out when I think of some suitable category names. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurando_7134.html" title="User:Kurando">Kurando</a> | <a href="../../../k/u/r/User_talk%7EKurando_4c8b.html" title="User talk:Kurando">^_^</a> 09:28, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>hi, you amalgamated this article with <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_New_Zealand_Air_Force_5675.html" title="Royal New Zealand Air Force">Royal New Zealand Air Force</a>, presumably on the understandable grounds the RNZAF article covered NZPAF history.

<p>havn't really looked at the RNZAF article for a while, but I see the history section has been vastly expanded and approved. If you are planning on adding more then it would make sense to have it in a seperate article. I was thinking that it would also maybe be a good idea to create a general History of the Royal New Zealand Air Force page, and move the history section here, and leave a summary in the main RNZAF page?

<p>Probably most of what is currently contained in that category needs to be moved into more precise subcategories i.e. Acts of the Scottish Parliament and Acts of the Parliament of Scotland.

<p>Hello Astrotrain. The Spanish translation of Falkland Islands is <i>Islas Malvinas</i>. The only country in the whole Spanish-speaking world that calls them <i>Islas Falkland</i> is Chile.

<dd>Chile is a Spanish speaking nation, therefore if they call them Islas Falkland, then that is the Spanish transalation! Islas Malvinas is a Spanish translation of the original French name for the Islands. Offically the islands are administered by the UK, therefore they are called the Falkland Islands. We mention in the intro that the Argentines call the Islands the Islas Malvinas anyway, so I don't see what the fuss is about. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 18:35, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What sort of social rank would one have to bear in their family, in order to be a descendent of either?</p>
<p>How far up the totem pole, would you say?</p>
<p>This is intended to have broad answers and based on gradients of time and population, not going into specifics about exact descendents. About how common is their descent in the English or British genepool today?</p>
<p>I've noticed that American Presidents don't descend from either king, but the most common recent royal ancestor shared by many of us is Edward III. How common is it for anybody in the English or British genepool, to have a Protestant royal ancestor?</p>
<p>There is a general cutoff, isn't there?</p>
<p>Is it because of fratricide in the Wars of the Roses, the Tudors' "new men", or the Union of the Crowns, or the parliamentary union under Queen Anne (I can't think of any non-royal family descent from the Hanoverians within the UK)?</p>
<p>I'm thinking that there is a big difference between Plantagenet and Tudor descents, that the commons in all likelihood have the former and the latter is held by the lords. (just generally speaking) Then again, Tudor descent in the Welsh must be higher in general. I am further curious about pre-Royal Tudor blood in Anglo-British people today, since the status and/or concept of Welsh royalty/nobility is rather hazy in my mind. I found the Blevins aka Ap Bleddyn family of Powys in my ancestry, but have no real idea on what to make of it--or any other Welsh "native aristocracy". I might be able to find Stewart descent somewhere, from way back when. What percentage of Hanoverian background do you think that German colonists had in America?</p>
<p>On the British side, I have to go as far back as Welf himself...but any recent genetic relationship with the Hanoverians or the counts of Nassau are completely obscure. How does one research those other colonial people, such as the Hessians?</p>
<p>UK genealogy is relatively easy when focusing on English (and French) ancestries. What would a "national person" of Jerusalem (or Antioch, for example) in Crusader times be known as?</p>
<p>We say "American" for those Founders, but was there such a nationality-term for the Crusaders in their own domains?</p>
<p>I guess the term is supposed to be Levantine/Outremer, or "Crusader" as our national heritage says "Colonist"...</p>

<p>Hi Astronian, I hope that this method of communication works for us.</p>
<p>I thought that aggressive editing may happen but I was a bit surprised at the actions you have taken without replying to my email to clear it with me first; this would not have been a problem if I was in the wrong and we could agree an alternative. Maybe your actions are within the guidelines for the community. So perhaps I need to get this clear in writing with you to avoid future misunderstandings on either part.</p>
<p>Removal of links are understood, where perhaps they are worded inappropriately. My book Trafalgar 200 Through the Lens is a serious document and the pictures within are of historic value (whether you believe this or not) and I feel that the pictures have a right to be seen in the appropriate wikipedia articles. This is supported by the academic interest the book is achieving and its excellent reviews from UK maritime institutions.</p>
<p>Can you advise what you feel would be an acceptable way to present the images, whilst making it clear that I am accredited as the author of the work, not least for copyright purposes? Not showing the work would be akin the censoring it.</p>
<p>I notice that pictures you have presented on the site have links to external sites. Referencing books could always be considered to be spam and this would be a problem if there were thousands of photographic books on Traflagar 200, but mine is the only one in the world.</p>
<p>I am a mature if not elderly person, willing to be flexible and work within the wikipedia guidelines, if you will let me. So your friendly advice will be appreciated.</p>

<p>Am about to undertake another attempt with the Princess Royal page. This time following the process that all other images on this site seem to adopt and no reference to any book.</p>
<p>DP Kilfeather</p>
<p><br />
Hello Astrotrain. See Desk1 discussion for a proposal on a way forward re Elizabeth II. Thanks, Des Kilfeather Desk1 13:17, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Astrotrain, placed here also to ensure you get it:</p>
<p>Astrotrain, you have not had any input to USS Saipan before now therefore it is not appropriate for you to make deletions to other peoples work on that article. Please revert back my contribution. If you have a problem with using my images on the grounds you state I suggest you make a formal complaint to Wikipedia. Of course I will be happy to comply with whatever they suggest. In the meantime I will consider any more of your "non constructive" edits to my work to be vandalism; constructive edits of course are welcomed. The images are not commercial.

<p>Astrotrain, I see you are disputing the fact that Princess Augusta was a Patron of L.Bertolotto's flea circus on Regent Street.</p>
<p>Can I refer you to the photograph at the NYPL library, in very small print on the right hand side flyer is a reference to Princess Augusta. I've see a copy of this at the V&amp;A archive at Olympia.</p>

<p>I suppose I should have put my reference in the editing comment not the page but otherwise it's a valid comment.</p>

<p>P.S. I'd previously been posting anonymously from the office (212.125.73.242) but so my collegues also post on other topics and I don't necessarily want to be attribulted to them.</p>

<p>Augusta was born in 1822- whereas this image dates from 1820 according to the page, so she cannot be patron two years before her birth! Perhaps it is Princess Augusta Sophia of the United Kingdom, daughter of King George III, that the flyer refers to? Astrotrain 14:14, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I too had speculated for some time over which Princess was the likely patron.</p>
<p>The photo library's dating information for the flyer is under question. According to a chap at Crown Estates, Regent Street was not created till after 1823 and other dating evidence seems to support (newspapers, the business address of the printers and other references) that the shows were run around 1830 to 1850. I was also thinking that it's more likely that a young princess would visit a side show than an old lady?</p>

<p>However, my speciality is Flea Circuses not Royals so I am willing to bow to your greater knowlege in this area if you know for sure. --<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFleaCircusDirector_5386.html" title="User:FleaCircusDirector">FleaCircusDirector</a> 14:36, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thus far in our Wikipedia careers we have had an utterly appalling relationship. I have no idea how the situation will improve in the future (it is hard to imagine it could get any worse), but it will only do so if we both make a conscious effort. As a first step in that direction, I just want to copy you in on a notice I am distributing today. I sincerely hope that you will at least consider joining up to both the notice board and the new Project, and that we can start to behave a bit more civilly towards each other. These things depend on teamwork, and if two key Scotland-interested editors are always at each others' throats then it detracts from the overall aim: to improve the coverage and quality of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Notice follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Following a successful period of consultation <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Scotland_5e73.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Scotland">WikiProject Scotland</a> has now been launched. As a participant in the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Wikipedia%7EScottish_Wikipedians%27_notice_board_17de.html" title="Wikipedia:Scottish Wikipedians' notice board">Scottish Wikipedians' notice board</a> I wonder if you may be interested in this new endeavour too? If so, please sign-up <b><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Scotland_Members_042a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Scotland/Members">here</a></b>. The WikiProject will be replacing some of the functions of the notice board, especially those in the lower half. While I am here, please also have a look at the new <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Deletion_sorting_Scotland_63d1.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting/Scotland">Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting/Scotland</a> and give it a "Watch". It was started up by <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisviva_a3c2.html" title="User:Visviva">User:Visviva</a> a few days ago, after long being mooted at the notice board, and effectively replaces all the AfD listings at the notice board. Being a transclusion of all the on-going discussions it is a much more useful tool. Even if you do not want to spend too much time on the WikiProject, please give it a "Watch" and feel free to contribute to Talk page discussions: the more contributors the merrier.</p>

<p>Hi Astrotrain™, you are back to reverting stuff. Without justification. All links have been removed from my images pending a firm ruling by Wikipedia mediator to ensure there can be no question of promo. You are Vandalising. Last time you reverted User:ALR changes, perhaps you checked with that user first?</p>
<p>I am a little surprised that you are still using the Astrotrain™ trade mark and have not yet Transformed your Wikipedia existence to a new user name. I hope you have checked the legal status of the trade name and that Wikipedia is not exposed in any way.</p>
<p>I have respected your concerns and voluntarily removed links pending a licencing decision from Wikipedia. You now must justify your actions and motivation and how your actions benefit Wikipedia. Desk1 10:07, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You removed the entire section on Trafalgar 200 citing it as promotional spam. Please see <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> for the correct definitions.

It woudl be more approproate to have any subsequent dialogue there where it is associated with the article than on either of our own talk pages. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 10:14, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
