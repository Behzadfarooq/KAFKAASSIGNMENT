<p>Originally a <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diaclone.html" title="Diaclone">Diaclone</a> mold; in Transformers, Astrotrain appeared in three different color schemes. The <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasbro.html" title="Hasbro">Hasbro</a> version was colored light grey, purple, and black. The <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takara.html" title="Takara">Takara</a> version being white and black which was later reissued in Japan during 2004. Also during 2004, eHobby offered a dark grey and purple "<a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html" title="Anime">anime</a>-accurate" color scheme as shown in the cartoon and box artwork.

Astrotrain</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Astrotrain first appeared in season 2 and was a part of <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatron.html" title="Megatron">Megatron</a>'s forces on Earth. Although typically a secondary character, Astrotrain was a main player in two episodes. In the episode <i>Triple Takeover</i>, he and Blitzwing froze Megatron and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starscream.html" title="Starscream">Starscream</a> and took leadership of the Decepticons for themselves. Leading an army of drone-like locomotives, he was defeated and forced to return command to Megatron - at gunpoint (<a href="../../../t/r/i/Triple_Take-Over_68fb.html" title="Triple Take-Over">Triple Take-Over</a>).</p>
<p>One of Astrotrain's most prominent actions came in the episode <i>God Gambit</i>. The <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobot.html" title="Autobot">Autobot</a> <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmos_%28Transformers%29_3cd8.html" title="Cosmos (Transformers)">Cosmos</a> discovered an energy source on Titan (a moon of Saturn), but was shot down by Astrotrain and disabled. Upon discovering a large deposit of energy crystals, Astrotrain (accompanied by Starscream and <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrust_%28Transformers%29_7750.html" title="Thrust (Transformers)">Thrust</a>) persuaded Titan's inhabitants, the Talarians, to worship him as a god, subsequently using them as slaves to mine the crystals. The disabled Cosmos, being held prisoner, managed to contact the Autobots, thanks to a Talarian rebel who reactivates his communicator. <a href="../../../o/m/e/Omega_Supreme_6360.html" title="Omega Supreme">Omega Supreme</a>, with <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perceptor.html" title="Perceptor">Perceptor</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz_%28Transformers%29_de41.html" title="Jazz (Transformers)">Jazz</a> aboard, arrive and eventually drive off the Decepticons but not before Astrotrain destroyed the crystals, proclaiming if he can't have them, nobody can.</p>
<p>In the episode <i>Prime Target</i> the big game hunter Lord Chumley captured a secret <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet.html" title="Soviet">Soviet</a> jet, leading to panic of possibly war. Chumley then set his sights on the ultimate trophey, the head of <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optimus_Prime_ba88.html" title="Optimus Prime">Optimus Prime</a>. In order to lure Optimus in Chumley captured the Autobots <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tracks_%28Transformers%29_9705.html" title="Tracks (Transformers)">Tracks</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/m/Bumblebee_%28Transformers%29_cee6.html" title="Bumblebee (Transformers)">Bumblebee</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz_%28Transformers%29_de41.html" title="Jazz (Transformers)">Jazz</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beachcomber_%28Transformers%29_ae92.html" title="Beachcomber (Transformers)">Beachcomber</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blaster_%28Transformers%29_ad81.html" title="Blaster (Transformers)">Blaster</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/f/Inferno_%28Transformers%29_fe31.html" title="Inferno (Transformers)">Inferno</a>. <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windcharger.html" title="Windcharger">Windcharger</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/f/Huffer_%28Transformers%29_6390.html" title="Huffer (Transformers)">Huffer</a> were able to avoid being trapped. When <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmos_%28Transformers%29_3cd8.html" title="Cosmos (Transformers)">Cosmos</a> learned of the location Chumley was keeping the captured Autobots Optimus Prime accepted Chumley's challenge to meet him alone. Although interrupted by the Decepticons Astrotrain and <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blitzwing.html" title="Blitzwing">Blitzwing</a>'s attempt to ally the Decepticons with Chumley, Optimus defeated the big game hunter and freed the Autobots. Chumley and the stolen jet were given over the the Soviets by the Autobots as punishment for his actions.</p>
<p>He was present at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Autobot_City_ff1d.html" title="Battle of Autobot City">Battle of Autobot City</a> but was not wounded. He transported the defeated Decepticons back to Cybertron. Of note, he changed size greatly at that time, as all of the participating Decepticons, including <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constructicons.html" title="Constructicons">Devastator</a>, were able to stand inside of his shuttle form.</p>
<p>He would continue to make sporadic appearances throughout season 3.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrotrain.html" title="Edit section: Marvel Comics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Marvel Comics</span></h3>
<p>Astrotrain would first appear in the Transformers comics in the <i>Target 2006</i> arc of the UK comics, where, along with the three <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insecticons.html" title="Insecticons">Insecticons</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirge_%28Transformers%29_4d50.html" title="Dirge (Transformers)">Dirge</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrust_%28Transformers%29_7750.html" title="Thrust (Transformers)">Thrust</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramjet_%28Transformers%29_de73.html" title="Ramjet (Transformers)">Ramjet</a> and the other Triple Changers, they are the Decepticons' most feared killers and have to be taken out before a major Autobot uprising can take place. Megatron inadvertently scuppered the plan by summoning the Insecticons to Earth.</p>
<p>Astrotrain would first appear in the US Transformers comics in US Issue 29. Sent to Earth along with Blitzwing and <a href="../../../o/c/t/Octane_%28Transformers%29_60e5.html" title="Octane (Transformers)">Octane</a> to retrieve a crashed shuttle which was carrying fuel for one of Ratbat's operations. However the shuttle was infected with <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scraplets.html" title="Scraplets">Scraplets</a>, a plague of sentient micro-robots that ate metal and the dying pilot then accidentally infected them. After battling with <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blaster_%28Transformers%29_ad81.html" title="Blaster (Transformers)">Blaster</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/m/Bumblebee_%28Transformers%29_cee6.html" title="Bumblebee (Transformers)">Goldbug</a> they became infected as well. Goldbug eventually found the cure - water, but Blaster refused to let Goldbug spray them, reluctant to save the Decepticons. The Scaplets took matters out of his hands, however, and formed into one huge creature. Options spent, Goldbug cured all four Transformers and let the heavily-armed Decepticons deal with it. The three Triple-Changers then escaped with the cargo.</p>
<p>With the influx of new toys, like <a href="../../../h/e/a/Headmaster_%28Transformers%29_6861.html" title="Headmaster (Transformers)">Headmasterss</a>,<a href="../../../t/a/r/Targetmaster.html" title="Targetmaster">Targetmasters</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pretenders_%28Transformers%29_d412.html" title="Pretenders (Transformers)">Pretenders</a>, older Decepticons like Astrotrain appeared less.</p>
<p>He was part of Ratbat's forces, battling <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scorponok.html" title="Scorponok">Scorponok</a>'s Decepticons and then the Autobots. He was then deactivated by the Underbase-powered Starscream and did not appear again in the U.S. comics, apart from an alternate universe appearance as part of <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galvatron.html" title="Galvatron">Galvatron</a>'s forces in a nightmare alternate universe where Unicron had destroyed Cybertron, and Galvatron and the Decepticons ruled Earth, as well as a brief appearance in a crowd scene in the Generation 2 comics before the Decepticons fought <a href="../../../j/h/i/Jhiaxus.html" title="Jhiaxus">Jhiaxus</a>. As the battle was a rout, it is not clear if he survived.</p>
<p>He appeared in the Earthforce stories as part of the Decepticons of Megatron and <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shockwave_%28Transformers%29_2cc4.html" title="Shockwave (Transformers)">Shockwave</a>'s forces, in one notable instance leaving Octane to be blasted by the U.S army after it was revealed he had simply been chasing a car out of sheer spite - unaware that the car was actually <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz_%28Transformers%29_de41.html" title="Jazz (Transformers)">Jazz</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Dreamwave_Productions" id="Dreamwave_Productions"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrotrain.html" title="Edit section: Dreamwave Productions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dreamwave Productions</span></h3>
<p>The Triple Changers would appear again in Dreamwave's reinterpretation of the Generation 1 universe - this time with a greatly expanded origin. First appearing during Shockwave's attack on Iacon city along with <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blitzwing.html" title="Blitzwing">Blitzwing</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/u/Bludgeon_%28Transformers%29_24df.html" title="Bludgeon (Transformers)">Bludgeon</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combaticons.html" title="Combaticons">Brawl</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insecticons.html" title="Insecticons">Chopshop</a>, Dirge, <a href="../../../o/c/t/Octane_%28Transformers%29_60e5.html" title="Octane (Transformers)">Octane</a> , <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combaticons.html" title="Combaticons">Onslaught</a>, Ramjet, <a href="../../../p/r/e/Predacons.html" title="Predacons">Tantrum</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insecticons.html" title="Insecticons">Venom</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combaticons.html" title="Combaticons">Vortex</a>.</p>
<p>Astrotrain would later appear as part of Starscream's <a href="../../../p/r/e/Predacon.html" title="Predacon">Predacon</a> faction. Later, during the Civil War on Cybertron Shockwave envisioned a Transformer with multiple alternate modes, studying Astrotrain and Blitzwing. However, the Great Shutdown meant his plans could go no further - until <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unicron.html" title="Unicron">Unicron</a>'s servant <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scourge_%28Transformers%29_a62e.html" title="Scourge (Transformers)">Scourge</a> located Cybertron and reactivated him for study, but when Shockwave was attacked by <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharkticons.html" title="Sharkticons">Sharkticons</a> Scourge saved him, only to be shot in the back by Shockwave. Shockwave then proceeded to examine and study him, using the secrets gleaned to create first the <a href="../../../d/u/o/Duocons.html" title="Duocons">Duocons</a> and then the Triple Changers - Astrotrain, Blitzwing, Octane, <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandstorm_%28Transformers%29_bf50.html" title="Sandstorm (Transformers)">Sandstorm</a> and Broadside (interestingly, in the Micromasters mini-series by Dreamwave, Blitzwing and Astrotrain are suffering from severe physical changes. As this is before the Great Shutdown this might imply that the change was a natural one rather than a result of experiments).</p>
<p>The Triple Changers then served as Shockwave's bodyguard, accompanying him to Earth to capture <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optimus_Prime_ba88.html" title="Optimus Prime">Optimus Prime</a> and Megatron's troops, with Blitzwing taking down Megatron, leaving him vulnerable for a follow-up attack by Shockwave. They were unable to prevent him from being stopped by Optimus Prime and <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultra_Magnus_ca80.html" title="Ultra Magnus">Ultra Magnus</a> back on Cybertron, but Astrotrain and Blitzwing accompanied Shockwave on his exile in the wastes of Cybertron, where his experiments resulted in <a href="../../../s/i/x/Sixshot.html" title="Sixshot">Sixshot</a>. However, the arrival of Megatron and the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Predacons.html" title="Predacons">Predacons</a> resulted in Shockwave having his arm severed by Megatron. The rest of Shockwave's troops surrendered, including Astrotrain, although Blitzwing was killed by <a href="../../../r/a/z/Razorclaw.html" title="Razorclaw">Razorclaw</a>.</p>

<p>In the third crossover between G.I. Joe and the Transformers from Devil's Due Publishing, Astrotrain appeared as part of the Decepticon air attack on the Autobot Capital City, led by Sixshot, but was driven off by <a href="../../../o/m/e/Omega_Supreme_6360.html" title="Omega Supreme">Omega Supreme</a>. After Omega's defeat he attacked Autobot civilians , but was beaten into the ground by Optimus Prime himself.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrotrain.html" title="Edit section: IDW Publishing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">IDW Publishing</span></h3>
<p>Astrotrain appears in the <a href="../../../i/d/w/IDW_Publishing_39c9.html" title="IDW Publishing">IDW Publishing</a> G1 relaunch miniseries <a href="../../../i/n/f/The_Transformers%7E_Infiltration_d443.html" title="The Transformers: Infiltration">The Transformers: Infiltration</a> as one of the Decepticons stationed on Earth under the command of Starscream. He, along with <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runamuck_%28Transformers%29_6381.html" title="Runamuck (Transformers)">Runamuck</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runabout_%28Transformers%29_18bb.html" title="Runabout (Transformers)">Runabout</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thundercracker.html" title="Thundercracker">Thundercracker</a> stands down and surrenders when Megatron finally arrives to deal with the rebellious Starscream personally. He reappeared in the subsequent series <a href="../../../e/s/c/The_Transformers%7E_Escalation_1e42.html" title="The Transformers: Escalation">The Transformers: Escalation</a>, explaining the properties of ore-13 to the Decepticon leader and accepting that no further insubordination would be tolerated. He was summoned by Megatron alongside <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skywarp.html" title="Skywarp">Skywarp</a> to deal with <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optimus_Prime_ba88.html" title="Optimus Prime">Optimus Prime</a>'s Autobot unit, using Skywarp's teleporting power to transport themselves straight into battle and run interference for their human facsimile. However, as Astrotrain lined up a killing shot on <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prowl_%28Transformers%29_34e7.html" title="Prowl (Transformers)">Prowl</a>, he was badly damaged by <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardhead_%28Transformers%29_b6aa.html" title="Hardhead (Transformers)">Hardhead</a>, and was unable to come to Skywarp's assistance. The story is ongoing.</p>
<p>Astrotrain also appeared in the mini-series Evolution: Hearts of Steel. In this Industrial Revolution themed series Astrotrain was not actually a Transformer, but a creation of the Decepticons. He was created to pull the Decepticon train convoy to New York, but was presumably destroyed when <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Henry_98cc.html" title="John Henry">John Henry</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/m/Bumblebee_%28Transformers%29_cee6.html" title="Bumblebee (Transformers)">Bumblebee</a> sabotaged the railway line and sent the Decepticons plummeting into a chasm. <a href="http://idwpublishing.com/titles/transformers/hos.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://idwpublishing.com/titles/transformers/hos.shtml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>Astrotrain is one of the toys in the first series of the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transformers_Classics_0641.html" title="Transformers Classics">Transformers Classics</a> line, which debuted in the last quarter of 2006. As before, he is a triple changer, turning into a space shuttle and a train. The shuttle has "kibble" - visible remnants of the other modes - above the wings, and his train mode now resembles a bullet train. The color scheme is mostly white, with some purple and red apps.</p>
<p>Astrotrain was initially sold individually, but later sold in a value pack with Classics <a href="../../../b/u/m/Bumblebee_%28Transformers%29_cee6.html" title="Bumblebee (Transformers)">Bumblebee</a>.</p>

<p>A proposed homage to Astrotrain, called Spacewarp, was created in prototype, but never released. Spacewarp was a repaint of Armada Jetfire as a Decepticon. It was to ship with the Mini-Con Commetor and 3 other Mini-Cons, repaints of the Mini-Con Space Team.</p>

<p>This Astrotrain is similar to the cancelled <a href="../../../u/n/i/Transformers%7E_Universe_d810.html" title="Transformers: Universe">Transformers: Universe</a> toy Spacewarp. Astrotrain had a different paint job from Spacewarp and a new head sculpt, but is still a homage to Astrotrain. The new head is based on a design by artist Dan Khanna and resembles the head of the original Generation 1 Astrotrain. The character is not related to the original Astrotrain and appears in the <a href="../../../c/y/b/Transformers%7E_Cybertron_8061.html" title="Transformers: Cybertron">Transformers: Cybertron</a> series. Astrotrain's <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mini-Con_9d2d.html" title="Mini-Con">Mini-Con</a> is a repaint of the Mini-Con Comettor; the identity is as yet unknown and should be unveiled shortly.</p>
<p>In November 2006 it was revealed that they were changing Astrotrain to be a member of the Transformers: Timelines toy line, and it would come with 4 Mini-Cons. The original Mini-con partner is repainted as Starcatcher, and the new Giant Planet Mini-con team repaints are named Astro-Hook, Astro-Line, and Astro-Sinker.</p>
<p>Astrotrain's bio indicates that, unlike the original Astrotrain, he has his own agenda in joining the Decepticons. A fearsome bounty hunter, he and his partner Mini-Cons transport the Decepticons in their quest for the <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyber_Planet_Key_45c9.html" title="Cyber Planet Key">Cyber Planet Keys</a>.</p>
<p>Astrotrain is also slated to appear in the storyline, The Black Sea of Sandokan, which will tie into the Botcon 2007 storyline.</p>
