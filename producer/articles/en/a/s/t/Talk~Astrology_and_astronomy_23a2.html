<p>"The two completely separate disciplines as we define them today cannot, in fact, be distinguished, until only the past few hundred years (they split up completely about 1750-1800)."</p>
<p>The premise of this article is not correct, and can be disproven merely with a few examples of how astronomy and astrology were distinguished in ancient thought beginning with Plato, who was aware of Babylonian use of planets and stars for prediction, but who was interested in astronomy as a method of comtemplating cosmic harmony (which is not the same thing as making predictions about persons from a horoscope).</p>
<p>By starting with a broad sweep of history and generalizations rather than clear definitions of astrology and astronomy, the article is misleading and inaccurate. This does not mean that astronomy wasn't used primarily in the service of astrology (which it was) or that an astronomer could not also be an astrology (many were, but many were not). Non-astrologer astronomers included: Eudoxus, Eratosthenes, Hipparchus, Heraclides, Aristarchus, Geminus, Scylax (friend of Posidonius). The skeptics and opponents of astrology (such as the Cappadocians) were quick to point out the difference between astrology and astronomy.</p>
<p>I recommend that this article be flagged for rewrite.</p>

<dd>The facts were not simply presented but used in an argumentative manner, which is not justified when you are writing a largely historical article about bodies of knowledge. The article is not about the validity of astronomy vs astrology. That can be argued on the Objective validity of astrology page.</dd>
<dd>As a matter of fact, astrology is an academic department in some universities, so that's not a distinguishing feature. Why mention it? The wording of the third sentence (<i>Astrology... is regarded as a pseudoscience by some and a wrongly maligned discipline by others</i>) is highly POV and should be changed.</dd>
<dd>Again, you are trying to make an argument for astronomy and against astrology, where none is called for. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 13:09, 25 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is precisely where your assertions on the NPOV page are in error. You want to give the two sentences equal weight and "equal sympathy" where it is not warranted and no policy demands it. Astrology <i>is</i> regarded as a pseudoscience by some. That is a fact. Astronomy is not seriously challenged as an academic discipline. This contrast is central to the distinction between them. I can live with a tweak in diction ("wrongly maligned" sounds odd). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 13:19, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I hope you don't mind my adding few comments here. I agree with Marskell that the previous edit gives both the appearance of equal weight, and the new one adds useful information. However, I agree with Aquirata that adding that astronomy is studied in academic departments is not appropriate, but for a very different reason. Aren't all sciences studied in academic depts? But many things are studied in academic depts. which are as reputable as science, so it doesn't really add any weight to science's reputation, and therefore unnecessary. Aquirata, I think you need to back up what you mean by saying astrology is an academic dept in some universities. Kepler is an institution for training astrologers, not for bringing something as interesting as the history of astrology to a broader academic environment. Astrology is taught at California Institute of Integral Studies (Rick Tarnas), but this is not a dept. itself, and the institute itself is not considered mainstream academia, although it is strong for those who want a career in liberal political and social activism. I think there are a few profs. in psychology depts who teach about astrology, but not as its own dept.</dd>
<dd>In the UK, there was the Bath Spa cultural astronomy and astrology, which was a part of the School of Historical and Cultural Studies - not a separate dept. This program was recently pulled, but I can't say whether or not there was fair reason for it. The most solid program for academically examining astrology at this time appears to be University of Kent since they cross disciplines and are interested in astrology as a cultural phenomenon from the perspectives of anthropology, philosophy, history, and classical studies.</dd>
<dd>Let's keep in mind, there is a big difference between studying astrology as a cultural or historical phenomenon and studying astrology in order to practice it. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 13:52, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I personally think the whole article is poorly written. I would rewrite the opening as something like the following:</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
"In the modern Western world, astrology and astronomy are generally regarded as completely separate disciplines. Astronomy, the study of objects and phenomena beyond the Earth's atmosphere, is accepted as a science and is a widely studied academic discipline. Astrology, which uses the apparent positions of celestial objects as the basis for psychology, prediction of future events, and other esoteric knowledge, is regarded as a pseudoscience by some and a wrongly maligned discipline by others. (See Objective validity of astrology for more information.) Historically, many cultures have not made a clear distinction between the two disciplines, and many astronomical calculations and observations were conducting for the purposes of astrological divination and religious ritual. In ancient Babylonia, famed for its astrology, there were not separate roles for the astronomer as predictor of celestial phenomena, and the astrologer as interpreter; both functions were performed by the same person, the priest.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"This overlap does not mean that astrology and astronomy were always regarded as one and the same. In ancient Greece, preSocratic thinkers such as Anaximander, Xenophanes, Anaximenes, and Heraclides speculated about the nature and substance of the stars and planets. Astronomers such as Eudoxus (contemporary with Plato) observed planetary motions and cycles, and created a geocentric cosmological model that would be accepted by Aristotle and would last until Ptolemy, who added epicycles to explain certain motions. The Platonic school promoted the study of astronomy as a part of philosophy because the motions of the heavens demonstrated an orderly and harmonious cosmos. In the 3rd century B.C.E., Babylonian astrology began to make its presence felt in Greece. It was criticized by Hellenistic philosophers such as the Academic Skeptic Carneades and Middle Stoic Panaetius. However, the notions of the Great Year (when all the planets complete a full cycle and return to their relative positions) and eternal recurrence were Stoic doctrines that made divination and fatalism possible.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"While the Greek words <i>astrologia</i> and <i>astronomia</i> were often used interchangeably, they were conceptually not the same. Both words more often than not referred to astronomy. The words for astrology proper, were more typically <i>apotelesma</i> and <i>katarkhe^</i>.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Astrology was widely accepted in the Middle Ages as astrological texts from Hellenistic and Arabic astrologers were translated into Latin. In the late Middle Ages, its acceptance or rejection often depended on its reception in the royal courts of Europe. Not until the time of Francis Bacon was astrology rejected as a part of scholastic metaphysics rather than empirical observation.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"A definitive split between astrology and astronomy the West took place gradually in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when astrology was increasingly thought of as an occult science or superstition by the intellectual elite. Because many people mistakenly think that astrology is some kind of science, it sometimes happens that the two are confused with one another even today. Many contemporary astrologers, however, do not claim that astrology is a science, but think of it as a form of divination like the I-Ching, an art, or a part of a spiritual belief structure (influenced by trends such as Neoplatonism, Neopaganism, Theosophy, and Hinduism)."</p>
<dl>
<dd>It may be nice to reference some specific cultures (there are many) where astronomy was used in the service of both religious worship and electional astrology, but I'm not an expert in these areas.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While the whole objective validity of astrology debate is interesting, I doubt most astrologers think astrology is a science. Maybe I'm generalizing from the ones I know. Am I wrong? <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 14:17, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is a very good overview notwithstanding the NPOV issue with the third sentence (which is currently being discussed). The statements will obviously have to be properly sourced, so there is still some work to be done. One detail I would add is specific examples of astrologers through-out the ages to further highlight how the split took place (which I believe happened more in the 16th-17th centuries rather than the 17th-18th). A good reference for this is <a href="http://www.mountainastrologer.com/scofield.html" class="external free" title="http://www.mountainastrologer.com/scofield.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mountainastrologer.com/scofield.html</a>.</dd>
<dd>My impression agrees with yours regarding astrologers in general, but I do not have a reliable source to back this up. As can be deduced from research activity through-out the past century or so, interest in coming up with some kind of objective proof peaked during perhaps the 70s and 80s but since has died down. This may be due to the sheer number of negative findings, which may also be the reason for the recent re-emergence of astrology as divination (mostly championed by Cornelius, but there are many others). This of course may be viewed as a cop-out, but we will only know for sure in hindsight. Astrologers delving deep into the Mars effect and similar research claim that the proof for objective validity already exists; it is also apparent, however, that skeptic scientists interested in the subject disagree; and the vast majority of the rest of the scientific community rejects astrology <i>a priori</i> (without bothering to look into the evidence, i.e. on a 'pseudo-scientific' basis, to use their own terminology, which brings up some interesting philosophical questions).</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dd>Please fill me in on what specific the issue is with this sentence: "Astrology, which uses the apparent positions of celestial objects as the basis for psychology, prediction of future events, and other esoteric knowledge, is regarded as a pseudoscience by some and a wrongly maligned discipline by others." I don't have a problem with 'regarded a pseudoscience by some and a wrongly maligned discipline by others.' It is regarded as a pseudoscience, a term coined within phil. of science. Maybe it would be better to specify who 'some' and 'others' are, but if we fill in with 'scientists' and 'astrologers' we're taking a generalized guess that doesn't cover everyone else. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 17:47, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem I see is that the presentation is judgmental: one gets the feeling after reading the introductory sentences that astronomy is legitimate and astrology is illegitimate. This is not what the intro should be about; it should simply highlight the distinguishing features without getting into mudslinging.</dd>
<dd>This was my suggested reword: <i>Astronomy is the study of objects and phenomena beyond the Earth's atmosphere. Astrology, on the other hand, interprets the apparent positions of celestial objects as they relate to earthly events, using symbolic language.</i> I have no problem putting in <i>[astronomy] is a widely studied academic discipline</i> in the first sentence, but even <i>accepted as a science</i>, factual as it may be, is problematical because it is implying superiority. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 11:00, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>WTA is a style guide and does not function as policy (which doesn't mean its not useful). I can only assume you're joking when you tell me I should look for sources to prove astronomy is widely regarded as a science (will Brittanica do?). As for astrology and pseudoscience we have plenty of sources on the other pages as you well now. I can live with other wording ("is presented as a form of divination" say) but that it is not considered a science, to repeat, is crucial to the distinction between and should remain. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 11:17, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Changed this sentence to remove faulty and POV reasoning in accordance with <a href="../../../w/t/a/WP%7EWTA_2564.html" title="WP:WTA">WP:WTA</a>. The wordage <i>mistakenly think that astrology is some kind of science</i> implies that astrology is, in reality, a pseudoscience. This is simply a scientific point of view (POV). Moreover, the confusion doesn't arise because of that but because of their long-standing association (i.e. common history). I believe this change to be factual and supporting <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Look forward to your arguments rather than reverts. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 11:04, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just for the record, do you believe astrology is a science? And what do you think the defining characteristics of a science is? And BTW, if one compared two types consecutive kings in a history article, would you say that claiming one increased trade and the other slaughtered millions was POV'ing if heading a section as a comparison? (assuming that both facts are well-established). <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELundse_a2f1.html" title="User:Lundse">Lundse</a> 12:47, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, I do not believe that astrology, as we understand it today, is a science. That it was considered science for a long time, is a historical fact. As for your example, much depends on wording. Facts must be presented as neutrally as possible. So, in a highly POV manner, I could say that the greedy bastard King I increased trade on the back of his people, and that King II made sure that his people would have sufficient resources to support themselves and he was forced to defend his kingdom against millions of vicious people. Or I could say that the benevolent King I sacrificed his own well-being in order to increase trade so that his people can have a better life, while King II ruthlessly murdered millions of people and enjoyed doing it at the same time. Both are bad presentations. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 12:30, 29 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, you certainly could say all those things - but could you also state them both in an NPOV way? If you can, then certainly you can also so for astrology with it being POV in itself to mention the fact itself.</dd>
<dd>BTW, your said <i>The point here is to compare the two disciplines</i> in another section. If that is the case, why not mention that one is a science and the other is not?
<dl>
<dd>Like I said, I don't have a problem with saying that astronomy is a science and astrology is something else. The problem is when a comparison is made from a point of view. For example: "Astrology is considered useful by many people while nobody understands astronomy apart from the scientific elite." This may not be too far from the truth but is not a balanced statement. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 14:45, 29 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So you do not have a problem with saying that astrology is not a science? Then what the h... is the problem? Having them in the same sentence? Comparing them? Isn't that what the article is about? Of course they should be compared (also in their own articles) on this point as it is the major difference and one which has people confused.</dd>
<dd>And the problem with your example statement is that people do understand astronomy, since almost everyone knows that things are moving around in space according to certain, immutable laws - this is a huge step forward in knowledge and one which was not made when astrology was invented. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELundse_a2f1.html" title="User:Lundse">Lundse</a> 14:51, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I added some of my suggested changes to the introduction without touching the opening paragraph (I'll let you duke it out). Some of this material may be incorporated into the body, which currently has some inaccurate generalizations. A rewrite should include something about which branches of astrology were accepted in the early modern period (even by hardnose Hobbes!) and which were rejected (and maybe include reasons why). I mean judicial vs natural astrology. Natural astrology included phases of the moon and affects of cycles of the sun. Judicial was casting horoscopes and making predictions about nations and individuals. Horary was revived in the 17th century (particularly by William Lilly). Patrick Curry wrote an excellent book on this period of history (<i>Prophecy and Power: Astrology in Early Modern England</i>) and another good source is Ann Geneva's work <i>Astrology and the Seventeenth Century Mind</i> (St. Martin's Press, 1996 or 7?). She focused much on the political intrigues involving Lilly and his rivals.</p>
<p>As it stands the definitive split of 1750-1800 is not wrong, but too generalized and gives the impression that astrology and astronomy were considered one and the same up to this time. This is generally untrue if you study the details <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 16:00, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Right, but the split started much earlier than the 18th century. One could say that Copernicus was the forerunner of what transpired in later centuries. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 12:33, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the confusion is conceptual rather than a misspelling. As it stands, the historical divergence section is repetitious and poorly organized. If cleaned up, I agree that this article should stay, but as a brief, separate topic just to outline historically the interaction of astronomy and astrology, and some of the reasons for the confusion of the two historically and today. On the other hand, some of the material could be fit in the history of astrology, to perhaps replace the statement: "Isidore of Seville (d. 636) was one of the first to distinguish between astronomy and astrology." The distinction was made by many before this time as I have shown in the revised intro to astronomy/astrology. Making such a distinction doesn't mean later or contemporary people followed it. The history of astronomy article currently has the link in the first paragraph, but nothing about how the two are confused. On another astrology talk page, someone recently mentioned this article www.iep.utm.edu/a/astr-hel.htm which contains some mention of Greek astronomers who were not astrologers and were critical of it, as were a number of philosophers. The history is very nuanced. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 14:13, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
