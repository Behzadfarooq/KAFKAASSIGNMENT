<p>Currently I have used a PD image I found in the commons. That is the best I could find that of a loaf of bread and a wine glass, I thought this image most appropriate since the our Gauls love to eat and drink. If you have come across a better looking image or a non copyrighted image from a Asterix comic to point me towards it.</p>

<p>-- Could it be made more specific? Asterix contains lots of caricatures and stereotypes on the French as well as on other countries. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 09:49, 28 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Indeed, Asterix cannot be chauvinistic. But the main reason is not the authors origin – the intagration system, which was working well then, was theoretically open to all (“French universalism”). The main reason is that Asterix plays with nationalistic codes that where very known after 30 years of general de Gaulle’s presence in the country. Contemponary comic movies with Louis de Funès shows in the same way the gap beetween an idealistic exaltation of the nation, and the reality of the basic citizen life. The funny thing, in Asterix, is that the average villager (including the chief himself, but not Asterix or Panoramix) is a chauvinist who thinks that the best in the world is what he knows. But his illusion is so evidently selfish, and so little dangerous (himself being a good nice guy living in a hut) that it can’t be taken seriously. Asterix isn't, of course, French Bashing. But it is a good example of this mischievious spirit that Frenchies often develop over themselves, to counterbalance their penchant for nationalism.</p>

<p>I have removed a reference to Geriatrix's wife being called Myopia. To my knowledge, she has never been named in the books. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluap_751b.html" title="User:Bluap">Bluap</a> 4 July 2005 15:35 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Peter Kessler says - "There is much speculation whether this is the name of Mrs. Geriatrix. Impedimenta utters it while talking to Mrs. Geriatrix. People disagree whether it is actually the name of Mrs. Geriatrix or just some kind of an oath uttered by Impedimenta. And Uderzo has said that he wanted to retain some mystery around the character as he based her in part on his wide." It seems that Mrs. Geriatrix is not named in the French edition.</dd>

<dd>Do you want the exact quote? Impedimenta says "Oh Myopia!" while speaking. At the bottom left- hand corner of the box, it says: "<b>REFERENCE TO THE GAULISH GODDESS</b>".

<p>Once again, I've had to remove a name for Geriatrix's wife. (This time, is was Panacea - who is a completely different character.) If anyone can provide a reference (in the books) for her name, then please do so in this talk page.

<dd>Yes, I saw that too. What was funny was that the article already mentions who Panacea is - she's Tragicomix's wife, apparently younger than Mrs. Geriatrix, and doesn't live in the village. Obelix has a crush on Panacea, but not on Mrs. Geriatrix. (If I remember right, he <b>did</b> once display some sort of affection towards her, but only because someone else said she might like men with pigtails. The "crush" lasted all of one panel, AFAICR.) <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 14:30, 27 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>There's also a mini-strip in 'Asterix and the Class Act', with Obelix trying to catch Panacea under the mistletoe. I'll have to admit that Panacea looks 'slightly' like Mrs Geriatrix, but they're definitely different characters. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluap_751b.html" title="User:Bluap">Bluap</a> 01:23, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The confusion seems to come from the fact that in one book, Impedimenta mutters "Myopia" while speaking to Mrs. Geriatrix, but Uderzo has apparently said he wanted to retain mystery about the character as she is partly based on his wife... See the annotations as <a href="http://www.asterixcentral.com" class="external text" title="http://www.asterixcentral.com" rel="nofollow">Asterix Central</a> for details, though I'll add this as a note to the article. -- <a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuybrush_2438.html" title="User:Guybrush">Guybrush</a> 19:09, 31 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I will quote (in possibly more detail) for the second time. Impedimenta is speaking to Mrs. Geriatrix. She says "Oh Myopia*!" (Please note the asterisk* next to the word Myopia). In a box in the bottom left-hand corner it says <i>*Reference to the Gaulish Goddess, invoking short-sightedness</i>. If you want to know, I think this is in either Asterix and the Soothsayer or Asterix and the Roman Agent.

<p>Is that really so? I think it's merely an attempt (and a rather good one) by english translators to create a pun where there was none. The pun in the original french is merely coming up with so many words ending with '-ix' (and, by the way, having a different suffix for each nation/ethnic group, such as '-us' for the Romans, '-on' for the Spanish, etc...</p>

<p>This section gives a detailed &amp; accurate explanation of the original French joke, however it doesn't match the actual English translation... rather than the concoversation being the direct translation: "Is it expensive", "My taylor is rich", the actual translation is: "*Slurp!* *Slurp!* Does it cost a lot to make up?", "Rather!

<p>If Cesar keeps on saying to Brutus, in the French original, “Toi aussi mon fils” (you also my son), it is indeed because of some historian's allegations over Brutus identity, especially Suetonius who shows Cesar at his death surprised to see Brutus among his murderers and saying to him in greek&#160;: "Kai su teknon" (You also my son). True or not, the fact is famous in France because of Abbot Lhomond’s <i>De viris illustribus</i> (Rome’s great men), a popular beginners latin book written in the late 18th century. Lhomond says&#160;: “Quum Marcum Brutum, quem loco filii habebat, in se irruentem vidisset, dixit&#160;: Tu quoque fili mi” (You also my son).

<dd>Certainly it only means <i>very old</i> to the average reader in French - nonetheless, as "canonique" indicates, the expression did originate with the clergy... note that Goscinny was not an "average reader" but rather an accomplished and intelligent punster who knew precisely what he was implying; most Asterix characters' French names are hilariously spurious but in the case of <i>Agecanonix</i> that is not the case — it's not even funny beyond being descriptive — or is it? In the first volume in which his name is used he is also first shown as someone with an eye for the young ladies, and it is that in conjunction with the historical meaning that makes up the full original pun.--Invisifan</dd>

I don't get your point here. This is the English language version of Wikipedia, so we should have info on the original version, and on the translation.

<p>I noticed this book, whose full title I think is <i>How Obelix Fell Into the Cauldron of Magic Potion When He Was a Baby</i> or something equally long, isn't listed. It's not a comic album like the others but a story book, with prose and accompanying illustrations much like the book versions of <i>Asterix Versus Caesar</i> and <i>The Twelve Tasks of Asterix</i> (which, come to mention it, aren't listed either). I'm not sure it was even written by Uderzo, but does anyone have details of this book so we can add them? I'm not making it up, I saw it many times in bookshops around the time of its release here in Australia, which was sometime in the mid to late 1990s. -- <a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuybrush_2438.html" title="User:Guybrush">Guybrush</a> 18:58, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>How Obelix fell into the Magic Potion when he was a little boy</i>: from the preface:
<dl>
<dd>"This text was written by Rene Goscinny for Pilote number 291. It appeared the 20th of May 1965. Goscinny wrote a text describing how the little Obelix fell into the druid's cauldron of Magic Potion for which I [= Uderzo] made three small drawings. Asterix was in it's sixth year, and that is also approximately how old Obelix is in this story. Because so many readers never had the chance to read this earlier, we decided to republish the story in the form of an album with a few more illustrations."</dd>

<dd>FWIW, there are many more non-album releases.

<p>The new Asterix album is complete crap. It is absolutely horrible. It's the only album in the entire series that I don't like at all. I actually had trouble even reading it.</p>
<p>The reason for this is the ludicrous plot. <b>Outer space aliens</b>? In an <b>Asterix</b> album? Please! I originally felt disgusted at the "magic of Atlantis" thing in <i>Asterix and Obelix all at sea</i>, but got over it, as it was only a minor part of this plot. In this album, OTOH, the entire plot is based on things that don't have the faintest to do with ancient Gaulish times! The Gauls and Romans seem to be in background roles in their own album!</p>
<p>I have read this will probably be the last Asterix album ever. I sincerely hope it won't - the magnificent series can't end in garbage such as this. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 16:46, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Be careful what you wish for. Basically every solo Uderzo album has been worse than the former, and the artist's writing imagination seems to be on an ever-escalating downhill decline...

<p>"Needless to say, Caesar isn't very cooperative." I think this phrase is very misleading (you could probably say it's outright incorrect), since Ceaser appears minimally in the book (if I'm not mistaken, only a few panels right at the end) and, in any case, it mainly revolves the attempts of Asterix and Obelix to get access to Ceaser's house, becoming willful slaves.</p>
<p>Also, "With Asterix and Obelix, he travels to Rome to retrieve it." Vitalstatistix does not travel to Rome with Obelix and Asterix, he assigns the task to them and leaves it at that (probably returning to the village). So, unless someone can explain to me why, I'm going to change these phrases to something more adequate.--<a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVertigo200_7ba1.html" title="User:Vertigo200">Vertigo200</a> 17:37, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Please change the phrases. They're obviously false. Caesar doesn't even <b>know</b> of the Gauls' plan to switch his wreath, or notice he is wearing a wreath of parsley instead of laurel. The Gauls don't even <b>meet</b> Caesar, it is the Roman official's chief slave who does the actual "dirty work". How can Caesar be "cooperative" or "non-cooperative" in something he never knows of or notices in the first place? And Vitalstatistix doesn't travel to Rome, he travels back home to his village with his wife after the visit in Parisium. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 07:33, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>There is a claim in that section that it is 'generally not well liked by fans' however according to the french wikipedia, the book has sold 800,000 copies in three days. --<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthonymorris_c2c0.html" title="User:Anthonymorris">AMorris</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAnthonymorris_2773.html" title="User talk:Anthonymorris"><small>(talk)</small></a><small>●</small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Anthonymorris_0657.html" title="Special:Contributions/Anthonymorris"><small>(contribs)</small></a> 11:13, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Liking something and buying it don't necessarily have anything to do with each other. I personally bought a copy straight away, being a devoted Asterix fan, and when I actually read it I found it to be complete rubbish. Conversely, there might be Asterix fans who read Asterix books at a library or at a friend's house but never buy any of their own. As much as I'd like to enter into a rant about the difference between just any random bloke who buys Asterix books and a "true fan" of Asterix, I'll just say that the general reaction to this book was significantly worse than the reaction to most of the previous books, so it warrants a mention in the article. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 12:24, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This text is commented out: <i>the chief is called Abraracourcix, derived from the phrase</i> à bras racourci <i>meaning "with arm shortened, ready to punch." Another series of puns, at least in the original French include the names of the four camps (castra) which surround Asterix's village, e.g. one of them is called "Babaorum", a pun on</i> baba au rhum<i>, a popular kind of pastry.</i> .

<dd>I read an explanation of this joke. The villages surrounding Asterix' village are called Aquarium, Babaorum, Laudanum and Petibonum. Babaorum is named after "baba au rhum", a popular kind of pastry, Laudanum is a pharmacist's <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tincture.html" title="Tincture">tincture</a> and Petibonum should be read "petit bonhomme", meaning something like "petty bourgeois", and taken together should be interpreted as a joke on the conservative bourgeois population in France.

<dd>No matter what U&amp;G have said, "Abraracourcix" can still be alternately read as 'arbre raccourci,' meaning a cut-tree or tree stump. Whether called 'un arbre raccourci' or 'une souche' in French, a tree-stump is a metaphor for a nincompoop in the language. Given how the chief is protrayed as boorish, reactionary, and indeed "ready to punch," I think there is valid argument for this second meaning within the pun.

<p>"Some caricatures of the traits of certain French regions are also used: the people from Normandy smother their food in cream and cannot give a straight answer; the people from Marseille play boules and exaggerate matters, and Corsicans don't like to do any work, are easily angered and have long-standing vendettas that they settle violently."</p>
<p>I've just re-read <i>Asterix et les Normands</i> and I can't see anything about them not giving a straight answer. (I added the bit about cream, which seems to be the only characteristic of the Normans, apart from not knowing fear, the main theme of the plot.) Is there some confusion here? <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlapdragon_8659.html" title="User:Flapdragon">Flapdragon</a> 00:54, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I suspect the comment about Normandy refers to the portrayal in <i>Asterix and the Banquet</i>, not <i>Asterix and the Normans</i>. It's a long, long time since I read it in French, though, so I can't be certain. 81.151.206.68 03:47, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Asterix and the Normans</i> is about Normans, not Normandians. I.e. it's about Vikings. In Finnish it's called <i>Asterix ja normannien maihinnousu</i>, i.e. <i>Asterix and the Norman landing</i>, a pun on the military operation in WWII. The French regional stereotypes described by the original writer are in <i>Asterix and the Banquet</i>, but the people who don't know fear are the Normans (Vikings) in <i>Asterix and the Normans</i>, just like Flapdragon said. It's so confusing when two peoples have so similar names. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"></a> — <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 03:58, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's true, and perhaps it's surprising they didn't translate it as <i>Asterix and the Vikings</i>, but of course they aren't totally different peoples. The stereotype about cream wouldn't really work if we thought of them as Vikings (Norsemen, straight from Scandinavia) as opposed to Normans like William the Conqueror. Anyway thanks both for clearing up the mystery of the other Norman stereotype. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlapdragon_8659.html" title="User:Flapdragon">Flapdragon</a> 03:21, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>For the record, they are in fact references to the same people: the Normans (ie. Norsemen aka Vikings) were in later centuries ceded the region that became Normandy (hence the name) in exchange for peace and as a buffer against further raids - while the movie has been named "<a href="../../../a/s/t/Asterix_and_the_Vikings_cc8f.html" title="Asterix and the Vikings">Asterix and the Vikings</a>", Normans is in the title to make the connection with the cream joke.--Invisifan 15:34, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Looking through the pages of the listed recurring characters, I found them all to be stubs, and generally they are mostly stereotypes who don't really merrit a full article about them.. I was thinking of merging the pages into a <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recurring_characters_in_Asterix_60fc.html" title="Recurring characters in Asterix">Recurring characters in Asterix</a> list, similar in design to <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_characters_in_Tintin_6276.html" title="Minor characters in Tintin">Minor characters in Tintin</a> - what do you think?</p>
<ul>
<li>That seems like a good idea, but maybe the article should be titled Asterix characters, as per the article <a href="../../../d/i/l/Dilbert_characters.html" title="Dilbert characters">Dilbert characters</a> that I created to keep <a href="../../../d/i/l/Dilbert.html" title="Dilbert">Dilbert</a> under 30 kilobytes.

<li>"This is a list of characters from the comic strip Dilbert" indicates that any character from the cartoon is allowed to be put in, yes. A quick estimate would say 30 characters are in the Dilbert article, while there are 33 Asterix albums each featuring several new characters.

<dd>it's touched on briefly in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Asterix_volumes_3023.html" title="List of Asterix volumes">List of Asterix volumes</a> but going any further is rather PoV ... we can't really comment on the dialog since we (in English) don't get to read what he wrote. As for the scenarios - it's not so much quality as direction ... Uderzo's solo Asterix stories (including those from before Goscinny's death) are decidedly more fantasy-oriented, and while there has always been an element of that (eg. the magic potion, etc.) it was rarely noticeable in Goscinny's stories, but a dominant element of nearly all of Uderzo's.--Invisifan 11:08, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article states that Asterix is a "confirmed bachelor". Are the writers aware that this phrase is a code-word for a homosexual? I never noticed such a theme in the books when I read them as a child, but it would certainly put a curious spin on his relationship with Obelix. If the intent of the article writers is to convey that he is unmarried, I would suggest replacing "confirmed bachelor" with "unmarried".</p>

I have seen the last one (All at Sea) referenced as one of "the adventures of Asterix and Obelix" (e.g. on Amaazon), but even that one has at least on its cover only "Asterix" as the series title, and "Asterix and Obelix all at sea" as the issue title.

Maybe short remark somewhere in the article, or is it not worth it?<a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">Szopen</a> 13:09, 30 January 2007 (UTC) Note of explanation - there are striking resemblances between two series, enough to accuse Christa o plagiarism. However his first short stories which had medieval setting and two heroes, one short and smart and second large, strong and fat appeared in 1961, as a result of continous evolution which started in early 1950s. <a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">Szopen</a> 13:15, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
