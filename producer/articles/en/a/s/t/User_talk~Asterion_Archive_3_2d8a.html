<p>A kind remark, Asterion!!! Stop reverting the template of Kosovo with Serbia's flag. You wouldn't like if we edit in Serbian wiki pages, would you? so please leave sites that have to do with Kosovo and Albanians alone, and don't vandalize, before it is too late.

<dd>Hey, I'm really sorry about this. I've been *extremely* stressed this week with real-life stuff and I've been devoting all of my freetime (and much of my not-so-free time) to Wikipedia, so I've kind of been a little rash in my decisions lately. Unfortunately, there's some db bug with Wikipedia right now and I don't seem to be able to lift the restriction tag on you, but you're now on the list again, so it shouldn't matter whether the tags are in place or not. Again, I'm sorry, but maybe you could use this event (which I think could probably also be deemed trolling) to back you up in the AbCom? Anyway, please contact me if you have problems getting on and I'll try to sort them out... you should, however, now be on the approved list. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 07:30, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Calling people a <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Troll_a715.html" title="Internet Troll">Troll</a> because they happen to disagree with your POV is not the best way to make friends.

<p>Hello Asterion. This is a copy of the response I left on my talk page. Allegations of any kind or coming from any side need to be substantiated by a neutral source. Needless to say, SUC or BRP are everything but neutral as I already illustrated on the article's discussion page (and I am convinced there is ample evidence there to support my claim). I think it is clear that the problem with the argument you mention is not its significance or (lack of) popularity and media coverage but its veracity. The mere fact that its only purpose there is to justify the described events speaks volumes about it. <a href="../../../e/u/r/User%7EEurowikiJ_d4a2.html" title="User:EurowikiJ">EurowikiJ</a> 20:16, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Asterion, I dont know how old are you, but give your contribution in the articel in wich you know wat you are doing and then you cann tell me a bout your work and contribution. Im am seenig that you dont know nothing about the Yugoslavien, Serbien, Kosovo and UN - Law. With your edit war i the Kosovo articels you are saying the same thing like the Balkan peopel is saying about the serbs: that the serbian peopel know only to make troubel in Balkan and they are doin in Wikipedia too. If you do wat I am saying you are going to contrbute more to your countrie. In other keys you are given the argumet that the serbian Wikipedia memeber are maken the War, not only in Balkan but in Wikipedia too. And believ me, nobody in Wikipedia (or in Balkan) dont want War.

<p>I am sorry but I find hard to understand every second word of this comment. Every single of my edits is well referenced and sources mentioned and quoted. Maybe you feel you own the article simply because you were born there. Well, this is not the case. I have previously invited you to contribute your views to it but, I am afraid that neither your grasp of English is up to standard nor you seem to be open-minded enough to respect other people's views. Checking your history of contributions, over 90% of these are for reverts to obsolete, POV biased (and I noticed you mentioned before do not even know what <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> stands for) and full of grammar and spelling errors.

<dd>There is nothing to argue about. Kosovo is part of Serbia. It is a province of Serbia under United Nations administration, in the Resolution 1244 (1999), adopted by the United Nations Security Council on 10 June 1999 <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/da/kosovo/koso_sc1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/da/kosovo/koso_sc1.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, the UN reafirmed its commitment to the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Sovereignty.html" title="Sovereignty">sovereignty</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/r/Territorial_integrity.html" title="Territorial integrity">territorial integrity</a> of the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia_fb6f.html" title="Federal Republic of Yugoslavia">Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a> (and its sucessor state, the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia_and_Montenegro_aebc.html" title="Serbia and Montenegro">Union of Serbia and Montenegro</a>, after the country changed its name).

Therefore, the UN would not deal directly with Serbia or Montenegro, in the same way that it wouldn't do with Scotland separately if a problem were to arise in the UK. <b>There is nothing else to argue about.

<p>Hi. I want to ask you can we do something about this anonymous vandal here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=172.158.130.40" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=172.158.130.40" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=172.158.130.40</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Can we ban him or something. He vandalized many maps on Wikipedia. For example, here is one map drawn by me. I wrote there that I am author and released the map into public domain, but this anonymous user removed that and wrote that this map should be deleted. See that here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3ASerbia022.png&amp;diff=48875771&amp;oldid=34700784" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3ASerbia022.png&amp;diff=48875771&amp;oldid=34700784" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3ASerbia022.png&amp;diff=48875771&amp;oldid=34700784</a></li>
</ul>
<p>He done this with several more maps too. I suspect that it is a sockpupet of some of the Albanian users from Kosovo article. Since you are involved in revert wars with them there, can you report this anonymous user (or sockpupet) to the proper place (I do not know how to report him). <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="red"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 23:35, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for bringing the reverts to the talk page&#160;:) I'm pretty sure I read the indictment correctly, and I sourced relevant parts on <a href="../../../m/i/l/Talk%7EMilan_Milutinovi%C4%87_23ee.html" title="Talk:Milan Milutinović">Talk:Milan Milutinović</a>. It's also interesting to read a part about Slobodan Milošević, where they pretty much establish that the president of Serbia has authority over (what was called) Yugoslav Army. Also, presidents of both Serbia and Montenegro serve on the Supreme defense council, a council which controls the Army, and since the 1970's it was really mostly republics who made decisions about the military, not so much the federation (that said, even the federal government is highly subordinate to republic governments).

<p>I'd encourage you to take a closer look at the RfC. It is not intended to resolve issues, whether technical or usability ones, of ideal referencing formats. I think the m:Cite.php is a valuable technology (not perfect; it has both advantages and disadvantages), and I think the existence of refconverter is helpful for implementing that reference system where article editors desire it. The RfC concerns the user conduct by Cyde is essentially two areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Edit warring over reference formats against the existing consensus of article editors</li>
<li>Deleting caveats about the use of refconverter and/or aggressively misstating that non-Cite.php references are "deprecated" (including, but not only, in pages associated with refconverter); this gives some editors the impression that refconverter should be applied <i>automatically</i> to articles, without consulting other article editors.</li>
</ol>
<p>Well... I guess I also get a little annoyed at Cyde's persistent belligerence and personal attacks. But I have fairly thick skin, and the issue of <i>improper</i> use of refconverter is more pressing that a few nasty things said about me. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 19:06, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm usualy very calm, but this blatant vandalism is getting to be too much. It's as if all of a sudden there is at least 10 vandals all working in concert to vandalize Croatia-related articles, inserting biased statements, OR, unverifiable (and heavily biased) sources, etc, etc. and I'm at a loss on how to proceed. They don't want to discuss, don't want to compromise, infact they're perfectly satisfied to engage in endless revert wars thus disrupting those articles and driving away those who really do have something relevant to contribute... I'm really not that well versed in Wikipedia system of protection and arbitration, but every attempt by me to get those users checked out or blocked has been ignored by the powers that be... What gives? --<a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.Gonzo_7efd.html" title="User:Dr.Gonzo">Dr.Gonzo</a> 14:54, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think that comment was a personal attack, unless you consider calling him a vandal, which he has proven himself to be by reverting without any discussion although i pleaded him to do so, a personal attack. I don't think I'm in any danger of being banned, since anyone can take a look at my contributions and see I've always called for compromise and resolving disputes reasonably. Unfortunately, users like Purger don't act in good faith and are not bothered to behave according to rules of conduct, and are destroying this fine encyclopedia in progress. Imagine for a second if noone reacted to their malicious edits, every single Croatia-related article would now be festering with lies and Serb extremist POV. Wikipedia wasn't started yesterday, those articles have been fine for years, and I'm sure many Serbian users visited them in the mean time and found nothing too objectionable. But now, this horde of immature, probably teenage vandals comes here and starts terrorizing all of us, and we can't do anything about it? I'd even consider giving up on those articles, if it didn't hurt so much to see this kind of behaviour go on unsanctioned... It has prevented from contibuting to Wikipedia in meaningful ways since every time I log on I lose any enthusiasm I might have had because one of those same 5-6 users has vandalized some article on my watchlist again...

<dd>Inserting factual inaccuracies is considered a form of vandalism. He is also highly disrespective of other users and does not assume good faith. And belive me, I always enter an argument with nothing but good faith. These users however, are not trying to contribute meaningfully to Wikipedia, but are insted distorting facts, disrupting normal functioning, deleting parts of text that they deem "croatian POV" (although many of those parts were previously agreed upon by neutral observers to be NPOV), and resort to all the familiar patterns of waging a propaganda campaign. For example, look at <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedule_04ac.html" title="User:Medule">User:Medule</a>'s contributions, and you'll see that this person has been engaged in 3 months of revert warring and vandalization of articles (by inserting factual inaccuracies and then reverting again and again to those nonsense versions of an article)... Besides, the fact that Purger is responding to my posts on talk page doesn't mean anything because in those responses he only informs me that I'm a biased propaganda pusher, and then goes and reverts the article again&#160;;) As far as I understand it, if there are two versions of an article, and one is more inflammatory then the other, then the one that is less inflammatory should stay until a compromise is reached. But, this person flat out calls one of the more influential proponents of Croatian independence, an immesurably important figure in Croatian history, a man who is reffered to as "A father of a nation", a fascist, racist, antisemite, and an all around psycopath in an extremely insulting and obviously biased article and then acts surprised when every single Croatian wikipedian out there who stumbles upon it reverts it. And if that wasn't enough, he calls the more moderate version of the article (which, by the way does not exclude info on Starcevic's hatred towards the Serbs, as opposed to his version that excludes any information on Starcevic's political thought, life, and historical context) a "whitewashed, politically correct, ignorant scribbling"... I mean WTF, it's obvious he doesn't want to compromise, doesn't want to stop reverting, and probably uses sockpuppets to avoid violating the 3RR... --<a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.Gonzo_7efd.html" title="User:Dr.Gonzo">Dr.Gonzo</a> 17:04, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I just want to let you know that I've removed your pictures from the <a href="../../../n/o/v/Nova_Gorica_0802.html" title="Nova Gorica">Nova Gorica</a> article. The town in the first picture is not Nova Gorica and the second picture is not a monument to the volunteers in the Bosnian War (nor is it controversial), since the symbol on the memorial is of the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_of_Slovenia_b377.html" title="Military of Slovenia">Slovenian Armed Forces</a>, which did not take part in the war.</p>
<p>Just thought that since you are also the author of the pictures, maybe you could clear this up for me.. I'm a native of Nova Gorica and I have to admit I have never seen that monument before.</p>
<p>The picture you claim is of Nova Gorica does remind me of Šempeter though, and although it is a suburb of Nova Gorica, it's a municipality in its own right with its own <a href="../../../%C5%A1/e/m/%C5%A0empeter-Vrtojba_d184.html" title="Šempeter-Vrtojba">article</a>. <a href="../../../e/d/o/User%7EEdolen1_2131.html" title="User:Edolen1">edolen1</a> 16:55, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

It appears to be the church in Vrtojba, however I'm not sure of it, since the position of the houses, considering the picture was taken from Italy, is odd. Vrtojba doesn't really come <i>that</i> close to the border.

I walked into Slovenia, so after checling the map, I do not think I walked so much. I went to a local supermarket, which I think could have been a Lidl or even a Merkator, but not sure either.

It means the same as the German word "Alm" if that helps anything. Something like alpine grassland..

<dd>And thank you for assuming good faith on my part. I assure you that my reversions of your deletions of other people's comments were well-intentioned.

I suppose my edit summary makes it look like I, on the other hand, was not assuming good faith. My edit summary made it look like I thought you were trying to sneak in a deletion of other's comments without it getting noticed.

<p>Thank you. No offence taken. As you possibly know, the RfA comment area is meant to be related to the RfA only. Therefore, I left a message on the user's talk page and removed it from the RfA comments, as a) it was an Ad Hominem and b) it was unrelated to HRE. I had previously informed the bureaucrat too.

<dd>hehehhehe, you can be fun after all. I strongly believe you will change your attitude toward Kosovo related articles, as your strong-headedness will just lead you nowhere. Wish I knew what inspires you to hate Albanians so much?! Nevertheless, one day you will wake up saying "oh my God, 1244 resolution does not exist anymore, what else can I fight with to 'defend' Kosovo 'truth'?!?" The sooner you realize that is not worth wasting time on, the better. There is so much more important stuff you can help contribute with. You seem to know wikipedia rules, and know how to do research. We can better Kosovo related articles in a more constructive way together. Looking on the bright side, I have a feeling we can talk after a long time of misunderstanding?!Cheers, <a href="../../../i/l/i/User%7EIlir_pz_c0a5.html" title="User:Ilir pz">Ilir pz</a> 21:19, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ilir, as long as you behave in a civil way I have no problem talking to you or anyone. Well, just for the record, I do not hate Albanians or else. I have absolutely no idea why are you coming out with that now. I told you before, I have not expressed my opinion on Kosov@, as this is irrelevant indeed. The point is the current situation is that <i>de iure</i>, Kosovo is still part of Serbia &amp; Montenegro. We can talk later, I need to earn my living tomorrow and off to bed now.

<dd>You needn't say it explicitly that you hate someone in particular, but checking your edits, and your pushy way of trying to make a (pro-Serbian) point, as well as supporting the Socialist Party of Serbia, which led wars that exterminated not only Albanians, does not leave me many options. Glad to hear you say explicitly you do not hate Albanians. Neither do I hate Serbs. I hate ALL those who committed crimes over anyone in my country. Many (realistic) Serbian politicians gave up on insisting the <i>de jure</i> issue, what makes you be so bound to that 1244 resolution? I encourage you to read further, in the UNMIK updated documents and statements from CG (Contact Group&#160;:)), and not instead cite a single document, or suspicious non-neutral sites. That would make you more acceptable with the opposite side (in which I am currently).
