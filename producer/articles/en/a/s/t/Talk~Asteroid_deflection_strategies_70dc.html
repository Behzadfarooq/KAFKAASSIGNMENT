<p>Anyone who has read any science fiction (like me) knows about lots of other things that in theory could be done, that does not seem to be part of the near future science consideration. Would it make sense to have a "main artlce" on how this is solved in the world of <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_Fiction_1120.html" title="Science Fiction">Science Fiction</a>. There is a <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_travel.html" title="Time travel">Time travel</a> article which reads like science thinks that is plausible, with a main article <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_travel_in_fiction.html" title="Time travel in fiction">Time travel in fiction</a>.</p>
<p>Examples of what I mean by solutions in Science Fiction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stick eyes in the sky to see the menace long before it gets here, like a satelite on the dark side of the moon, in the equivalent of a 24 hour orbit over planet Earth where satelite in fixed point in sky. So these satelites are used to map what's coming at us from all directions, and where the risks might be, instead of risk not find out about the thing before it is right on top of us.</li>
<li>Spend serious money budget to send expeditions to some of those asteroids and comets that cross earth orbit, to learn as much as we can about their composition, what it would take to divert them. We need to know as much about them, if not more, than we know about all other bodies in the solar system other than the Earth and the Sun.</li>
<li>Send an expedition to the Asteroid belt, and tow some of them back here, to use as shields ... a big rock is hurtling towards us, so we take one of the shields and acelerate it up to rammming speed, at a collision angle that will take the debris away from Earth.</li>
<li>There are some SF movies that involve shooting nuclear missiles at these rocks. I would like to see some scientific analysis of the validity of the "science" in those movies. If we tried that in real life, I expect that instead of a huge rock on a collision course with Earth, there would be a huge radioactive rock on a collision course with Earth.</li>

<p>I think there may need to be</p>
<ol>
<li>Separate article on this topic in <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_Fiction_1120.html" title="Science Fiction">Science Fiction</a>.</li>
<li>Separate article on the public relations angle of
<ol>
<li>Each time one of these is discovered, the news media cries "wolf" making it sound like the scientists do not know what they talking about. Then as the scientists get more and more info, getting better and better estimates, and the news media reports this, it sounds like they did not get it right the first time.</li>
<li>By the time the human race is really threatened, the voting public will be so used to each news story being worse than the last story, then turning out to be nothing, that we humans will not take the real thing seriously.</li>
<li>There are also political issues. Suppose an effort by nation-A to deflect fails, and nation-B gets hit. Assuming nation-B survives, what kind of liability is nation-A facing?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>We have various strategies proposed. What we do not have are the major pros and cons of each strategy. For which of them does the technology exist? What kind of expense?</li>
<li>I saw that <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Sagan_68dc.html" title="Carl Sagan">Carl Sagan</a> had said that developing some of these strategies was potentially more dangerous than the threat they protecting against. Can we get the specific quote?</li>
<li>Are there other efforts in space which, if perfected in time, can also help with the flexibility of solving this one?
<ol>
<li>For example <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_elevator.html" title="Space elevator">space elevators</a> could make it more inexpensive to get the anti-asteroid weapons and fuel to escape earth orbit.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Time Line{s) ... there may already be relevant wiki articles ... if so need to link with this, if not perhaps need to add some
<ol>
<li>Significant historical impacts when, sequenced not chronologically but from greatest damage or potential threat, to less of a risk of harm. We can then see clearly how often planet Earth is placed at risk by impacts of various severity.
<ol>
<li>Indicate how much damage they would have inflicted had they arrived in a major city, rural area, ocean strike, other terrain.</li>
<li>Number of Near Earth Objects of comparable or larger size, and frequency with which they cross Earth orbit, so we can see the rate at which we are playing this cosmic <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_roulette.html" title="Russian roulette">Russian roulette</a>.</li>

<li>Human understanding has dramatically evolved in a relatively short time span. When I was in college in the 1960's there was a cover story in an <i><a href="../../../a/n/a/Analog_Science_Fiction_and_Fact_888e.html" title="Analog Science Fiction and Fact">Analog Science Fiction and Fact</a></i> magazine on <i><b>Giant Meteor Impact</b></i> which identified scars on surface of planet <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> from prior impacts and compared their energy signature with major volcanic eruptions, such as <a href="../../../k/r/a/Krakatoa.html" title="Krakatoa">Krakatoa</a>. An ocean strike was considered worse than a land strike because of risk of penetrating the magma on ocean floor and punching a hole in the planet's crsst, with a <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_volcano.html" title="Super volcano">super volcano</a> coming back out of it, triggering the mother of all <a href="../../../t/s/u/Tsunami.html" title="Tsunami">tsunamis</a>. In the 1960's the whole idea of extinction impact was <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> to most people, even though the race to the moon was on, and anyone who looks at the <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon.html" title="Moon">moon</a> can see that it has been plastered, the idea that the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> had also been plastered, was just not what a lot of people willing to believe.</li>
<li>Do we really know if the risk is about the same over time? As <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a> contributes to <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea_level_rise.html" title="Sea level rise">sea level rise</a>, human habitation becomes more at risk to risk of damage from giant <a href="../../../t/s/u/Tsunami.html" title="Tsunami">tsunamis</a>.</li>

<p>This could be an interesting article, full of pros and cons of existing or near-future technology plus speculative solutions. But unfortunately, a good portion of the article is already littered with sensationalistic "it could happen tomorrow!" kind of fear mongering. Perhaps, according to someone's math, it is more likely to be killed by a falling asteroid than die in a plane crash, but they both still have a very, very low probability. So comparing them is somewhat silly. (IMHO) I think we should reduce the "likelihood of an impact" and "effects of an impact" topics no more than one paragraph each and spend most of the article dealing with the stated topic. –<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoaler_5952.html" title="User:Shoaler">Shoaler</a> (<a href="../../../s/h/o/User_talk%7EShoaler_4dcd.html" title="User talk:Shoaler">talk</a>) 19:52, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

I feel that such content belongs someplace in Wikipedia, but perhaps in other articles.

<p>- NASA astronauts Edward Lu and Stanley Love have <a href="http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/051109_asteroid_tractor.html" class="external text" title="http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/051109_asteroid_tractor.html" rel="nofollow">proposed</a> using a large heavy unmanned spacecraft to pull an asteroid into a non-threatening orbit. <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/am/publish/podcast_gravity_tractor_beam.html?29122005" class="external text" title="http://www.universetoday.com/am/publish/podcast_gravity_tractor_beam.html?29122005" rel="nofollow">Here's</a> one article about their proposal. The craft was originally designed for another mission, uses electric thrusters, using electric power to heat a gas to extremely high temperatures and squirt jets to the sides of the asteroid, not directly at it, which would undermine the desired gravity tug boat effect, maintaining a constant close distance so gravity can do its work. By using gravity to pull the asteroid, this can save us from near earth objects that have the consistency of piles of rubble, which if detonated just changes distribution of the rubble still headed towards us, or high rotation that is difficult to mount a pusher on. The gravity tractor would have to spend approximately a year beside the asteroid to be effective.</p>
<p>I had originally started this writeup, then added to it, since I felt it was a notable effort by NASA scientists, reported in believable media, that was different from the write-ups that I found in the other solution strategies. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlMac_ad62.html" title="User:AlMac">User:AlMac</a>|<a href="../../../a/l/m/User_talk%7EAlMac_adb0.html" title="User talk:AlMac"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 00:26, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>- Proposed by NASA scientists Edward Lu and Stanley Love, this plan calls for a huge, ~20 ton spaceship to hover near the asteroid, years before it comes close to hitting Earth. With the heavy end of the spaceship facing the asteriod, this should be enough to "pull" the asteriod into a slightly different orbit, that years later will save earth.</p>

<p>Nice try, anonymous&#160;:) Please put it back in <b>iff you find a source...</b> <small>University of Queensland devised a plan utilising advanced polymer technology in 2005. The polymer-metal compound produced is engineered into several giant tensile springs, each approx 1km in length. They are then assembled to a trampoline megastructure designed to bounce the incoming comet back out to space upon impact. Some speacialists suggest having several people simultaneously jumping on the surface of the structure could help to "super-bounce" the comet with even greater force.</small> --<a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerHerrMigo_0311.html" title="User:DerHerrMigo">DerHerrMigo</a> 14:40, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I may be over-zealous this time, but I can't quite believe this would work: <i><small>Creating an artificial debris cloud in the object's path so that upon impact the object will be deflected.</small></i> You'd need one helluva lot of debris - where do you take that from? --<a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerHerrMigo_0311.html" title="User:DerHerrMigo">DerHerrMigo</a> 20:23, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The word <i>program</i> is used on more than one occasion in this article. To assist people whose first language might not be English I propose that <i>program</i> be used to descibe a <i>computer program</i>, and <i>programme</i> be used to describe a series of events. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcturus_dd0a.html" title="User:Arcturus">Arcturus</a> 12:11, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The word <i>program</i> existed long before computer programs came along, and with the rise of computers, continued to be used quite heavily in many contexts unrelated to computers, such as</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>government program</li>
<li>project program</li>
<li>convention or conference program</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps it would be more relevant to ask about spelling in different English speaking nations. I think <i>programme</i> is British while <i>program</i> is American, but how is it done in Australia, India, and elsewhere, particularly the nations that have active space programs (or is that space programmes?), and thus likely to have constructive contributions to this subject. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlMac_ad62.html" title="User:AlMac">User:AlMac</a>|<a href="../../../a/l/m/User_talk%7EAlMac_adb0.html" title="User talk:AlMac"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 10:34, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it might boil down to different versions of English. Here in England, the usage is as I described, with <i>program</i> always being used to refer to a computer program. Therefore it's quite easy to understand the context (it's easy anyway for native English speakers, of course). I think in America <i>programme</i> is not generally used in any context. However, maybe we should think about the alternative spellings as a way of differentiating the usages. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcturus_dd0a.html" title="User:Arcturus">Arcturus</a> 17:20, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>English is a second language for me. And I have never before saw(noticed?) use of <i>programme</i> word. <i>Program</i> is way more popular - Google give 5,050,000,000 results vs 560,000,000 for <i>programme</i> and more understandable. Lets keep it simple. But i live in Canada, so i got "<i>chequing</i> account" in my bank and I live not far from "Chinatown <i>centre</i>". So there is some differences. <b><a href="../../../t/e/s/User%7ETestPilot_548e.html" title="User:TestPilot"><font color="green">TestPilot</font></a></b> 05:23, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Referring to this paragraph from the article:</p>
<p>“The dangers posed by such collisions go beyond the physical destruction caused by the impacts themselves. A nation hit by less than extinction-destructive force may, depending on their military political situation, think they are being attacked by another nation and retaliate. If this had happened to a superpower during the Cold War, it may have thought it was under nuclear attack and "returned" fire.”</p>
<p>I think this paragraph/rambling should be deleted: it reads like someone thinking out loud, and makes little sense. A nation hit by a massive asteroid impact will not confuse it with a nuclear attack due to, among other things, the singularity of the impact (as opposed to several smaller warheads), the lack of radioactivity, the lack of any detectable delivery methods (no planes or missiles), the magnitude of the explosion, and the knowledge, even if gained only a few hours prior to the impact, that an asteroid impact is imminent. This adds no value to the article.</p>

<p>1. The 'social problems' aspect appeared quite biased as holding the whole endeavour as a waste of funds. Gramatically, it was quite rambling as well. I believe I remedied both. I would prefer to make more sweeping changes, but I do see the utility of the viewpoint.</p>
<p>2. I added a portion to mitigate against the view that our detection strategies are (or soon will be) 100% efficient. At the very least, asteroids can have an approach plane which keeps them blocked by the glare of the sun, and that leaves them currently undetectable.</p>

<p>I came up with the solar sail proposal in 2004, and sent it to NASA. I never received a reply email, but I've seen this scenario posted at a couple of different discussion groups. I'm not sure if I should be pleased, or pissed that I was never credited with the original idea. I guess my small claim to fame, if it helps everyone, should be just that. A small claim.
