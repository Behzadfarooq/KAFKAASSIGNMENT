<p>I have my doubts regarding the reference from David Cochrane, <a href="http://www.astrosoftware.com/Astrology.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.astrosoftware.com/Astrology.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Is that a published work, or only posted on an enthusiast's site?</p>
<p>Also, this sentence "<i>One outstanding issue is the lack of an accepted astrological mechanism that would account for the supposed effects of celestial bodies on terrestrial affairs, although a similar objection could be made to the most basic physical and astronomical theories as well</i>" is completely misleading.</p>
<p>It's not a similar objection, because <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravity</a>, unlike astrology, has been proven to influence objects. So it's not at all a <b>supposed</b> effect, but unlike astrology, it's an actual, observable effect. So, the statement <i>a similar objection could be made to the most basic physical and astronomical theories as well</i> is entirely misleading. I think we should rephrase the second sentence (or perhaps even remove it)<a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVorpal_blade_8a31.html" title="User:Vorpal blade"><font color="green">Vorpal Blade</font></a><a href="../../../v/o/r/User_talk%7EVorpal_blade_f4dc.html" title="User talk:Vorpal blade"><font color="blue"><sup>snicker-snack</sup></font></a> 05:27, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As a physicist, I point out that there are three theories of gravity. In Newton's and Einstein's theories, gravity is not a causal mechanism, but a describable, predictable phenomenon. Only quantum gravitational theory treats it as a causal mechanism, and as yet, quantum gravitation theory has not attained a satisfactory form. Not all science deals with mechanistic causes, a lot of it is about correlation and, where possible, experimental reproducibility of observable phenomena. As yet astronomy and cosmology do not permit a great deal of experimental reproducibility, and this has to be borne in mind when looking for the reasons why astrology shouldn't count as science. 01:21, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Regarding your doubts about the article by David Cochrane, here is a response from David Cochrane: This article is similar, but not identical, to the content in the books "Astrology for the 21st Century" and "AstroLocality Magic" that I authored and are published by Cosmic Patterns. The two lines of text that I added were promptly removed the next day. It is unfortunate that the information that I added has been removed because there are astrological researchers who have found that a very sophisticated approach to astrological research is showing hopeful signs, as described in more detail in these books, and the two pilot studies that I conducted are described in the books. BTW, I am more than an enthusiast, with a very long resume of professional activities in astrology.</p>

<p>I just added the following text to the Astrology, Science, and Causality section: "Some astrologers, on the other hand, do believe that astrology is amenable to the scientific method, given sufficiently sophisticated analytical methods, and they cite pilot studies supporting this view." with a reference to an article in the ISAR Journal. I hope this is in better taste and more agreeable to all. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Cochrane_9e46.html" title="User:David Cochrane">DavidCochrane</a> 02:04, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm glad that what I added was good but Vorpal Blade excised the entire paragrah. Also in the discussion of history, I see strong interest in gutting more of the science in favor of more history - a bad idea in my opinion, but here is a resolution to the problem: I think there needs to be a separate article on astrology, science, and causality so the paragraph that Vorpal Blade removed could be put in the separate article along with more information on astrology and science. Then if the consensus is to remove some science in favor of history, then at least the astrology and science information will be in the separate article. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Cochrane_9e46.html" title="User:David Cochrane">DavidCochrane</a> 16:10, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>David, Your suggestion is very plausible. In fact, we used to have an article called <i>Objective validity of astrology,</i> but the militant faction (who like to call themselves skeptics but are in fact extreme materialist cynics) had it removed because they couldn't handle seeing so much evidence in favour of astrology. The official explanation was that the article was a <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_fork_623c.html" title="POV fork">POV fork</a>. The article was suggested for deletion in the first place by our very own <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">User:Marskell</a> via a process called <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>. On the AfD page, editors from all walks of life (i.e. the vast majority of them without any clue about astrology, let alone scientific research into it) had their say about the page. Roughly 70% voted for deletion, 30% for keeping, the main argument being the already mentioned <i>POV fork</i> (mostly without explanation or supporting arguments). Apparently, 75% or above in favour of deletion will result in automatic deletion, 67% or below in automatic keeping. The administrator responsible for taking care of the AfD simply took these opinions at face value and, without looking at the article or having an opinion on it, decided for deletion.</dd>
<dd>You will notice as you edit WP that the same political games are being played here as everywhere else in life. When short on rational arguments and sources supporting their view, cynics (some call them pseudoskeptics) will resort to any means whatsoever to achieve their end. They will typically try to pull the rug from underneath the people they perceive to be in their way. This generally takes the form of <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">Request for Comments</a> or <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">Dispute Resolutions</a>. Marskell has initiated an RfC on me a while ago (without any notable success), and he and <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">User:Jefffire</a> are again talking about <i>DR</i> to elevate their fight against <i>big bad mystics</i> (see below). They are also very good at quoting <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPOL_b383.html" title="WP:POL">WP policies</a> and putting their own interpretation on them in support of their objectives. Many administrators are also from this camp, so they have "official" backing in doing this. The existence of the <i>Pseudoscience</i> category, directly contradicting <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, is ample evidence for the inherent bias of the WP community. A quick look at he <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOVFAQ_5eb1.html#Pseudoscience" title="WP:NPOVFAQ">Pseudoscience FAQ</a> will make it obvious which side of the argument WP "consensus" is on.</dd>
<dd>The <i>Objective validity of astrology</i> article has disappeared without a trace from WP, but you can have a look here: <a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/wiki.php?title=Objective_validity_of_astrology" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wikinfo.org/wiki.php?title=Objective_validity_of_astrology" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. I would certainly support the creation of a new article along the lines you suggest, but the cynics will no doubt vehemently oppose it. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 12:58, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a sentence which says, <i>astrology makes no claim of correlation to the personality tests</i>. Can that be verified or sourced? I think, common sense says, astrology should correlate to personality tests if astrology works. The only way to experimentally test if an astrological prediction using natal charts on personality works, is to see if the prediction matches with what the client thinks on his own personality.</p>
<p>Then, the statement <i>self-reported views of themselves in questionnaires may be flawed</i> is a very general blanket and misleading statement. Personality tests like the California Personality Inventory (used in the nature study) are widely believed to be a very accurate self-assessment. So, the statement <i>self-reported views of themselves in questionnaires may be flawed</i> should be reworded or changed to include the fact that there are accurate personality tests as well. <a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVorpal_blade_8a31.html" title="User:Vorpal blade"><font color="green">Vorpal Blade</font></a><a href="../../../v/o/r/User_talk%7EVorpal_blade_f4dc.html" title="User talk:Vorpal blade"><font color="blue"><sup>snicker-snack</sup></font></a> 06:17, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The sentence <i>According to Dennis Elwell, Dean's actual purpose in producing this book was "to undermine astrology’s fundamental tenets... behind the smoke screen of reviewing the literature."</i>. What's the purpose of including this line? To me, it appears irelevant to the previous statements, and a baseless accusation. Also, there is no continuity from the two lines before this.

<dd>What's making the page deteriorate is this burning need you and Piper have to qualify or invert every matter of fact statement that is critical of astrology. The comment on the "most basic physical and astronomical theories" is just stupid and a citation from a guy hawking astrology software doesn't make it less so. From our own page: "The insights of the theory of special relativity confirmed the assumption of causality, but they made the meaning of the word "precede" observer-dependent." A gravitational cause doesn't "precede" an effect because its range is infinite and because masses interact with each other rather than the larger body "controlling" the other, as ordinary descriptions often have it (it's more accurate to say "the Earth and Sun revolve around their common center of mass" than "the Earth revolves around the Sun"). Nothing in this indicates a "lack" of a mechanism. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 09:09, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Astrophysicist Victor Mansfield sums up the problem confronting science and what it means to astrology as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>Astonishingly, this quantum view is not merely an artifact of its current mathematical formulation. Analysis and experiments, independent of the present formulation of quantum mechanics, show that nature is so deeply acausal and nonlocal that any future replacement for quantum mechanics must have nonlocal connections that work without any exchange of energy or information between the parts of the correlated system-without any causal connection. This is an extraordinary fact that should play a central role in any approach to understanding nature in general and astrology in particular. This is a long way from the Cartesian/Newtonian view at the basis of current attempts at formulating a physical mechanism for astrological influence.</p>

<p>This page would benefit from becoming an historical view of astrology rather than an epistemic one. There is no viable argument that astrology is anything other than a pseudoscience (e.g. non-falsifiable in many cases). Attempts to legitimize it use arcane references or invoke speculative "future" knowledge or complex physics theories - indeed it seems that a blanket of "quantum physics" can be used to explain just about anything. Instead of piecing together unrelated data to support an esoteric explanation of astrology, wouldn't it be better to become an astromomer, learn all we can about the universe, and then formulate a simple model for the masses and call it astrology? =) For example, look at the explanation of "electron clouds" in an elementary science text-book and compare that to Molecular Orbital theory in a university-level inorganic chemistry book. The former is an incorrect, or at least incomplete, view of atomic electron interactions but serves as an elementary model by which one can gradually learn advanced theory. So instead of getting in a giant snit, explore astrology in the context of history rather than that of science, and your problem is solved. Any attempt to legitimize something not commonly held as fact will result in bickering, and therefore a crappy wiki article. Taken from the viewpoint of a cultural phenomenon (like wiki discussions of world religions, cults, memes, organizations, fads, or whatever) there is no controversy.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I believe our anonymous commentator is correct - all of these odd subjects would be better off approached from a historical standpoint. But even that will not end controversy or bickering because all weird subjects attract believers, and some of the beliefs include that about the history (which often cannot be substantiated, particularly in cases of topics dealing with pre-literary history.) <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 02:43, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

So <i>Nature</i> is absolutely no authority on any research into astrology, scientific or not. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 14:21, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No joke at all. You don't need to know anything about astrology to test if its predictions work. If someone says based on A, becuase of blah...blah..yadda..yadda B and C should be same, you don't need to know the "blah...blah..yadda..yadda" to see if B is the same as C. Meanwhile, I'll find a few refs which says why the objections to the Calson test are silly. It's not that they didn't learn not to publish, but the fact that the other researches didn't have sufficent quality as per the peer review. This is exactly why we should include peer review.<a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVorpal_blade_8a31.html" title="User:Vorpal blade"><font color="green">Vorpal Blade</font></a><a href="../../../v/o/r/User_talk%7EVorpal_blade_f4dc.html" title="User talk:Vorpal blade"><font color="blue"><sup>snicker-snack</sup></font></a> 14:27, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Vorpal. I would like to keep the Flammarion woodcut pic for a couple of reasons. The first is that if we were to simply put a horoscopic chart there in its place, that wouldn't be representative of all of the different forms of astrology in the article because not all forms of astrology are horoscopic, or use the same reference points or even birth charts. So, we would only be pandering to one form of astrology. The second issue is that it is the only piece of media that I have found that has some intimations of an underlying astrological meaning by hinting at some sort of link between man and the cosmos. I think that the strength lies in its subtlety. Surely if you came up with something that trumped the Flammarion picture in the scope of its representation, and that everyone agreed with, then we would go with that instead. But I would rather go with the Flammarion picture than nothing right now until something better is put forward.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>We need to create some sort of all-inclusive template for the See Also section. This will be kind of difficult because of all of the different traditions and techniques that need to be covered, but I think that the Astrology Project will get to it before too long.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As far as the meanings of the planets go, I think that it would be best if we left that out due to length restrictions. The reasons that I say this is because the meanings associated with each planet, and the differences between the different traditions of astrology would ensure that it would be an overly long section that still excludes several traditions. On the other hand, I've never really cared much for a few of the later sections of the article such as 'Language' and 'Astrology as a descriptive language for the mind', so maybe there would be a little bit of room for these additions if those areas were done away with. It would still run the risk of being a pretty poor treatment of the planets though and I would still have to advise against it from the perspective of someone who has studied the different traditions and knows how diverse they can be. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Brennan_4621.html" title="User:Chris Brennan">Chris Brennan</a> 17:13, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Chris Brennan that the woodcut is acceptable as it conveys mystery but is not aligned to a particular approach to astrology.

<p>My eyes get weary wading through the debris that the underinformed and debunkers keep spewing on my favorite articles (Astrology, Supernatural, Progressive Politics, Dictatorship), but what's really get my gall on the Astrology pages are the freshmen astronomy students and Sidereal (Vedic) "Astrologers" venting their mis-information on these pages.

<dd>Yes, star constellations of arbitrary sizes are absolutely crap from an astrological standpoint, and tropical is legitimate, but let's not be too quick to can standard sidereal astrology, based on constellations of equal length.

<dd>Though I respect sidereal or Jyotish astrology, and astronomers, I wouldn't say that starry constellations have equal length. The problem with constellations is that they are imaginary and lack natural symmetry that is found in the other two astrological frames of reference, houses and aspects. They seem inconsistent in the minds of Western astrologers who use the tropical zodiac. Astrologers do look for patterns of natural organization. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 13:43, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Moon and stock returns (again)</span></h2>
<p>I've reinstated the Moon/stock returns research. Astrology has had a long and well-known association with stock market research. There is no known cause and effect to this Moon relationship and no explanation other than what has been advocated by astrology. Speculation about sleeplessness patterns, tides, etc. is OR. The first source cites a negative article, "The Moon was Full and Nothing Happened" by Kelly, Rotton, and Culver, inferring a refutation of the anti-astrological view. References do not need to declare themselves to be astrological in cases where they clearly are such.</p>
<p>For example, Gauquelin felt no need to mention in "Is there Really a Mars Effect" that it was astrology or Neoastrology. Similarly, Lois Rodden's book <i>Modern Transits</i> is a standard astrological textbook that is full of astrological interpretations, but astrology is not mentioned anywhere in the book. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 15:51, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Chris, you have removed this book, which I'm not familiar with (and the author's name was incorrect I believe). Amazon's reviews are very positive in general, and 52% buy the book after viewing its page (which is a very high ratio). In your opinion, do the inaccuracies outweigh the overall value of the book to justify removal? In other words, is the reader better off without knowing about this book? <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 18:57, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, that's all you talked about: positive reviews on Amazon, and good sales. Both of those are merely indications of popularity. My point is that this does nothing to indicate that the book has any value at all-- the only thing that's been said that is indicative is that it's inaccurate. <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVariable_3b71.html" title="User:Variable">siafu</a> 22:16, 11 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Not at all, you are misunderstanding me. Getting good reviews does not equal popularity. The fact that people decide to buy the book and not something else after viewing it on Amazon does not equal popularity. They both translate to perceived value. Sales volume or sales rank would correlate to popularity, but this is not at issue. My comment was directed at seemingly good perceived value at Amazon vs. Chris' evaluation. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 23:33, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think I misunderstand so grossly. A sales figure, like the fact that 52% of people buy the book after viewing the page, is a measure of popularity only. So too is the fact that it is reviewed positively. The <i>content</i> of those reviews may be interesting to us, but the mere fact that they are generally positive is not. However, it's also true that "perceived value" based on the perceptions of the public at large is no more useful in determining a book's overall value in terms of its factual accuracy and informativeness than popularity. <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVariable_3b71.html" title="User:Variable">siafu</a> 13:42, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Given the fact that there are a number of other books on the history of astrology written by astrologers and academics that don't make the same ridiculous mistakes that this book makes, I do think that people would be better off without knowing about the book because then the same blunders wont be repeated over and over again by astrologers and researchers alike over the coming decades. I would much rather recommend books by more serious scholars such as James Holden, David Pingree, Nick Campion, Peter Whitfield, or Jim Tester. Bobrick's book suffers from a number of issues such as an over reliance on secondary and tertiary sources, bogus citations, religious favoritism, overtly biased reporting to the point of fanboyism, and generally poor organization. One of the more egregious, if not hilarious, examples of the types of mistakes contained in this book is on pg. 20 when he starts talking about "Palchus"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the morning of July 14, A.D. 479, a worried client sought out an Egyptian astrologer in Smyrna by the name of Palchus and, at 8:30 A.M., asked whether a ship that he was expecting from Alexandria, now way overdue, would eventually arrive safely, and, if so, when...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem with this story is that "Palchus" is merely a pseudonym of a late 14th century Byzantine astrologer-scribe named Eleutherius Zebelenus of Elis, and not a 5th century Eyptian astrologer, as Bobrick would have you to believe. The data is actually from a group of genuine charts from the 5th century that Elutherius gathered together and edited under the name of "Palchus", but it is ridiculous that Bobrick simply attempted to turn "Palchus" into a living Egyptian astrologer from the 5th century when this was merely a handle of this Byzantine scribe, not to mention the fact that these might not even be horary charts to begin with. If he had really done his homework he would have realized how faulty this statement was, in addition to a number of other statements. Although it is possible that he was aware of these issues and decided to leave them in anyways in the thought these little issues of ‘historical accuracy’ aren't that big of a deal, and that no one would notice anyways. Who knows? The majority of the astrological community doesn’t know that much about the history of astrology so its not like they are going to call him out on this, and actual scholars would drop the book after a couple of pages.</p>
<p>The astrological community was swooning over him for a little while last fall because he was supposedly a neutral historian who wrote a book that was going to be kind of favorable towards astrology, but that couldn't be further from the truth. He is so biased in his coverage of astrology that he actually makes mistakes in reporting the history of the subject because of his overt fondness of it. I hear that he is actually a student of John Frawley's which makes complete sense because the entire book reads as if it were written from the perspective of a 17th century Christian astrologer- even when it is talking about other traditions of astrology! Some might say that any book on the history of astrology written by an astrologer is going to be biased, but to that I would reply that they should compare Bobrick's work with the work of other astrologer/historians such as James Holden and Nick Campion and then you will understand the difference. There is a line between reporting about something that you actually practice and perhaps endorse, versus this sort of overt fanboyism where you are simply raving about how great astrology is and downplaying anything negative to the point where you are actually skewing and distorting the historical record. I see no reason to advocate such an approach, especially in a place like Wikipedia where neutrality is the standard that we are trying to maintain.</p>
<p>Sorry for the rant. I've been meaning to write a review of this book since I read it earlier this year because I was so excited when it first came out but then so disappointed when I actually got into it.

<dd>Chris, thanks for that detailed overview. Given your firm opinion on this, we should replace that cite with Holden, Campion or Curry, or whoever is appropriate in the context. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 23:27, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Chris, thanks from me, too. I didn't purchase this book because I couldn't find an academic review of it. I do purchase books by astrologers to learn about the practice, but have <i>typically</i> found that practitioners who write about the history can't help but include an agenda in making astrology seem as favorable as possible. A rare exception is Holden, but he seems to have some classical training. Even Curry and Campion's works were disappointing because their biases show in their research. On the other hand, it's distracting when writers of history of ancient beliefs add arguments or commentary on why the belief is silly in modern times. I just want the facts, not whether or not it's stupid to believe in something. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 13:33, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>P.S. On Palchus, Pingree thought Eleutherius was identifying Abu Mashar with this name. So the question might then be how much of the material is 14th century and how much is Abu Mashar. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 13:33, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've actually been thinking that maybe we shouldn't have that section in the first place because of issues such as this, and also because any books placed on that list seem to act as a sort of endorsement of a particular position, or tradition, or school of astrology. I mean, I personally like all of the books on the list right now, but that is just because they sort of cater to my own astrological tastes, but that isn't necessarily true for other people. So eventually, unless we expand that list considerably (which I don't think that we should do), we are going to end up discriminating against certain traditions or types of astrology just by the fact that we have putting some books in while leaving others out due to space restrictions. I mean, I have a pretty good reason for preferring that some other book replaces Bobrick's book due to specific mistakes inherent in it, but is there really a reason why we don't have a book on Indian astrology up there? What about Chinese, Mesoamerican, Traditional astrology, etc.? Do you get what I'm saying? --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Brennan_4621.html" title="User:Chris Brennan">Chris Brennan</a> 23:41, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm just pointing out that the article is on the general topic of "astrology" and from the point of view of other traditions of astrology there are far more important books which should be on the recommended reading list. There is no book currently in existence which covers or even touches upon all of the different traditions and branches of astrology, so somehow you would have to narrow it down to one book to represent the entirety of each tradition in the interests of neutrality and length restriction issues, and it would still be a longer list than we need here. Unfortunately we all know that there really isn't one book in any tradition which is ever really able to summarize everything from that period. So... I would rather just get rid of it because it forces us to make the article biased. Its not like we are <i>supposed</i> to have a recommended reading section, or that this is some sort of requirement or something. Who are we to say which book best represent astrology as a whole? What do we say to those who want to put the major books of their tradition in the list? 'Get lost'? --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Brennan_4621.html" title="User:Chris Brennan">Chris Brennan</a> 01:57, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've often wanted to remove some of the overreaching adjectives and commentary myself, and have edited some lately that seemed redundant as well as overreaching. When the writing strains a little to hard to make a point it actually dilutes its effectiveness. Both sides are occasionally guilty. Adding "peer reviewed" to <i>Nature</i> makes it seem like trying to milk the one source article that made it there for every last drop of credibility and substance. The strain shows and it's a bit undignified if nothing else.

<p>This discussion was discontinued.

<dd>We should use the latest sources we can find, and Ertel's is the latest. It applies citation analysis to all the prior studies and found results, the "eminence effect". There has been some detailed response by Dean, answered by Ertel, but this was just speculation as to possible demographic factors that might have caused the eminence effect.

<p>The findings should be listed in detail but are crammed into one sentence because of violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue_weight</a>. Undue weight is given against astrology. The fact is that researchers have been creating astrologically valid hypotheses and finding positive results faster than critics have been able to create astrologically invalid hypotheses (such as Dean and Kelly) and find negative results. There are now qualified scientist/astrologers to peer review articles for science journals, so that should no longer be an obstacle. As far as the research output goes, the astrology critics are in the minority. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 18:21, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I said previously, I think that it is a bad idea to attempt to list all, or even give a partial list, of the astrological works in each tradition within the context of what is supposed to be a broad article which touches upon many different types and traditions of astrology. If anything, I think that this should be relegated to the articles specifically on certain traditions, branches and astrologers. Plus, the recommended reading section is not a requirement of a Wikipedia article and I see no reason to push other more important parts of this specific article aside in order to make room for what would still ultimately end up being an inadequate and essentially biased list which would slant towards one tradition or type of astrology or another. The list that you just gave here could be matched by an equal number of important books from the tradition of Chinese astrology. Twice as many extremely important books could be listed from the Indian tradition. Quite a few more from the Hellenistic tradition. This would amount to a gigantic list that would be completely unnecessary within the context of this specific article. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Brennan_4621.html" title="User:Chris Brennan">Chris Brennan</a> 04:33, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Unlike the very excellent article, which is professional and reasonably objective (despite all the arguments about it), the External Links look like pandering to some particular individuals.

<p>The historical section is not only brief, but misleading. It needs to have some summary of what the various developments in astrology have been over the centuries, with mentions of specifics. Notable is the omission of the attacks on astrology by Pico and Ficino, and answers to it. There is also need to mention motives and applications other than divining the future.02:04, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article is short on scholarly sources and rich on popular opinion-pieces. How about re-writing appropriate parts of the article from scholarly sources alone, and adding John North's comprehensive study of astrology in Chaucer? Or maybe Shakespeare and Chaucer don't warrant a whole section of their own anyway. They're used here primarily as examples of how pervasive astrological thought was, not examples of astrology itself. It'd be more interesting to point out Chaucer's books on the astrolabe and equatorium to show how serious he was about it. There is no such mathematical link for Shakespeare. This would also be evidence for how astrology related to science in Chaucer's time (notwithstanding the debatable claim that science did not exist before the Scientific Revolution). - 15:56, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why not sign up with a userid and help with this article? You have excellent suggestions. Please look at the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_astrology.html" title="History of astrology">history of astrology</a> article where much material has migrated from this general article. While I would only use scholarly sources, it doesn't seem to be the general wiki policy to do so - many non-institutional websites are referenced, and most editors are not academics with access to the proper book and journal materials. Experts in any given topic are treated in an egalitarian manner, which is a reason why one of the founders of wikipedia left. Astrologers generally do not think outsiders are experts in 'their' subject. This is partially true when you get down to the nitty-gritty of contemporary practice (techniques used, information about the astrological community) but biases about what is and is not important to the general public are frequently introduced. There are numerous spin-off pages about specific methods and meanings - astrologers are writing these pages. They don't seem to receive as much scrutiny as this article from an epistemological standpoint, but this is the one article that discusses claims of astrology as a science. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 16:45, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is my proposed list of <i>involved parties.</i> If you have another one, present it.

<p>I guess we now have come to the question of your intentions because ultimately that will decide the list of parties. Do you want mediation regarding article content (balance, majority view, sources)? Or do you want mediation regarding my conduct on WP? I don't think it's healthy to mix the two. So perhaps you wish to clarify this issue first, then we can come back to who the involved parties should be. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 10:39, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Shawn Carlson study is non-notable.

Just because it was published in Nature (which is non-notable with respect to astrological research), it doesn't suddenly make the study credible and notable.</dd>

<dd>Re, last comments, it's a "piece of junk" because you don't like it's outcome, which doesn't bear on whether it should be included. The sound bite you're insisting on does indeed violate undue weight; find a source equivalent to the source itself (say, a letter published in the journal in response to it) and it would make sense. If nothing else it's a strawman (Smith said X; Smith is an idiot). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 15:52, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, it's a piece of junk due to the design of the study. Like I said, place of publication in this case doesn't strengthen the credibility of the study, quite the opposite. <i>Nature'</i>s editorial board had no clue about astrology and how a proper study should have been designed. It is a top scientific journal, but that doesn't qualify it for astrological inquiries. On the other hand, the critique of it comes from somebody who is grounded in both psychology and astrology. It should also be obvious to you now that <i>Nature</i> will not publish any more astrological material, especially not something that will make the editorial board look stupid with respect to an article they have published before.</dd>
<dd>So, the original study is non-notable except from a historical perspective to show how bad research can be published in top scientific journals. Criticism of it must naturally be included. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 12:10, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As an astronomy educator, I take great issue with many of the pseudoscience claims in this article. The removal of the historical connection to alchemy was ridiculous and the claims that it represents a protoscience because it can explain human traits is laughable. You will find no professional astronomer (that is people who actually study the heavens) who agrees with this subject as a legitimate research topic. I have no objections to characterizing this popular folk-superstition as such, but since it is not a belief based on the rigors of the academy nor the scientific methods, claims to the contrary need to be contextualized and the considerable amount of work that debunks astrology needs to be covered in this article in a better fashion than is currently done. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 13:35, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Some things are true and some are false, some theories are scientific and the overwhelmingly vast majority are not. Here are an aleph-null number of theories for your consideration which someone (or some group) somewhere might consider for experimentation and potential falsification: 1) "theory of the invisible elf"-- there is an elf which immediately intervenes and endows human beings with free will whenever they (appear to themselves ) to make a choice. 2) There are two such elves. 3) there are three such elves......there are an infinite number of such elves!! How do you KNOW it's not true. Has it been tested and disconfirmed or what?? Of course not. Why?? Because it is "apriori" ridiculously implausible. Science (or better humanity) does not have infinite resources to spend investigating all of the outlandish theories that the imagination of man CAN INVENT. It certainly cannot be <b>impartial</b> about them. Quantum mechanics is a scientific theory because it has controllable practical consequence which HAVE been effectively controlled and demonstrated to explain and predict measurable phenomena in a laboratory setting.

<dd>Lacatosias, correct me if I'm wrong, but what you seem to be saying is that the article should consist solely of the statement - "Astrology is pseudoscientific superstitious nonsense, you don't need to see its identification, move along." If unscientific or wacky theories have existed in history and have had an impact, an encyclopedia should describe them. (Actually, there is historical precedent for the invisible elf theory - replace the word elf with 'guardian daimon' and you have Proclus' ontology of sublunar beings, although there are not infinite daimons but fewer daimons than human beings, and some daimons, acc. to Proclus, influence other human beings by way of a mediating human.) Editors are attempting to describe astrology, which has had considerable impact in history and contemporary culture, and what practitioners do, and what they actually believe. If some practioners believe that astrology is a science and have attempted to investigate it by scientific methods, or if they have offered pseudoscientific explanations, let it be described. Where input from believers is most unhelpful is in the POV edits that slant it toward some sort of scientific status. If you find the description of how some astrologers are clinging to quantum physics to be slanted toward POV, then edit away. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 17:24, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">question about Tycho edit</span></h2>
<p>ScienceApologist recently made an edit to this sentence with the comment, "Characterizing Tycho as a "mathematicus" is trying to gain a connective legitimacy for astrology that is unwarranted." The sentence was:</p>
<p>"The famous <i>mathematicus</i> <a href="../../../t/y/c/Tycho_Brahe_a182.html" title="Tycho Brahe">Tycho Brahe</a> also used a similar phrase to justify his studies in astrology..."</p>
<p>The term mathematicus for astrologer is long standing - goes back to the late Hellenistic/Late Antiquity Greek - mathematikos. I think SA misunderstood and thought it meant mathematician. It's well-documented that Brahe was an astrologer.</p>
<p><br />
On other matters, I wish this article were locked until arbitration is complete. I wanted to make some suggested revisions for the science section, but it's a moving target. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 18:06, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe this article simply moves too fast for me rather than other editors. Everytime I sit down to look at it as a whole, it has changed. My first suggestion is not beginning with the current first paragraph in the science section, but beginning with a summary statement about the issues discussed below. Some of the first paragraph and beginning of the second seem to belong in the history section. Secondly, this sentence:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"From the classical period through the scientific revolution, astrological training played a critical role in advancing astronomical, mathematical, medical and psychological knowledge." The word 'training' seems awkward. Isn't this sentence meant to express that astronomical observations such as eclipses and comets were astrologically 'motivated'. Using 'training' leads to questions of what sort of training. Third, the titles "Research" "Causality" don't seem descriptive enough for the material in these sections. &#160;:::Fourth: The beginning paragraph under "Research" sounds like an apology. be condensed:</dd>
<dd>"Astrologers have argued that there are significant obstacles to carrying out scientific research into astrology today, most of which are due to funding issues.[27][28][29] It has also been suggested that a large majority of astrologers do not have the necessary background in science or statistics to carry out scientific testing.[27] Similarly, astrologers have argued that few scientists have the training and experience in astrology that would qualify them for competent astrological inquiry."</dd>
<dd>Rather:</dd>
<dd>"Astrologers argue that obstacles to scientific research in astrology include funding, lack of training of astrologers in scientific and statistical methods, and lack of training of scientists in astrological methods." I question why "a large majority of astrologers" are needed for any such tests - all that is needed are scientists and a dew competent astrologers to supervise the set-up of the studies so it tests what astrologers claims.</dd>

<dd>That Tycho practiced astrology wasn't surprising considering that most people who studied the heavens in Tycho's day did this. That's part of the protoscience aspect of astrology. However, calling him an astrologer is putting undue emphasis on this part of his work. I say undue because he is remembered not for his contributions to astrology but for his contributions to making an accurate accounting for the motion of the planets which is independent of whatever belief you may or may not have about how the planets effect your day-to-day life. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 18:48, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The term <i>mathematicus</i> doesn't equate to <i>astrologer.</i> This is clearly explained in the introduction. And just because today with our heavily materialistic and reductionist minds "we" (i.e. scientists) tend to remember Tycho de Brahe for his "scientific" contributions, that doesn't justify editing history. He was called <i>mathematicus</i> in his day. Therefore he was. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 12:19, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Thus is your opinion. But the term is not in common public usage and Tycho is much more widely known for his "materialistic" and "reductionist" contributions, than his astrological ones. For our plain speaking readers, plain English is better. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a> 13:46, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In fact, I think his belief in astrology explains his resistance to a heliocentric model!

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wrong references</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>First, this <a href="http://www.astrodatabank.com/Astrology_Research.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.astrodatabank.com/Astrology_Research.htm" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> is given as a claim that <i>astrological researchers have found statistical correlations for behavioural attributes</i>. That reference does not validate that claim. This <a href="http://www.astrologyresearchjournal.org/article82702_1/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.astrologyresearchjournal.org/article82702_1/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> is the other reference given for that claim. In the reference, it's clearly stated that</li>
</ul>
<p>"This is a work still in progress so <i>no claim is being made</i> (or can be made) as to whether or not there is any <i>validity to astrology</i>. The claim I do make is that this method (comparing objectively observable horoscope features, such as angles between planets and midpoints, with objectively observable phenomena in the lives of people, e.g. murder) is a valid way to put astrology to the test. Further results will be reported as obtained.".</p>
<p>As a result, I'm removing the ref and the claim of behavioural attributes.<a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVorpal_blade_8a31.html" title="User:Vorpal blade"><font color="green">Vorpal Blade</font></a><a href="../../../v/o/r/User_talk%7EVorpal_blade_f4dc.html" title="User talk:Vorpal blade"><font color="blue"><sup>snicker-snack</sup></font></a> 06:37, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Then this<a href="http://cura.free.fr/xx/18cas3en.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://cura.free.fr/xx/18cas3en.html" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> which claims a link between birth and death, is unconclusive and calls for further research(see bolded). Importantly, the major claim is not an astrological effect (see italics).</li>
</ul>
<p>"From this examination, <b>an questionnable</b> statistical association emerges. Deceases occuring around the birthday, more or less thirty days, <b>might</b> be more numerous than predicted by chance.</p>
<p><b>The research should be extended by studying the reasons why the decease occured</b>. <b>Maybe</b> suicides are more frequent around birthdays. <i>We can also think about these birthday parties that tragically end, for example, because of a car crash or a too violent emotion</i>. As many factors which, however, come under the astrologers' cyclic conception of life. "</p>
<p>Next, the other claim, the one which was published in the scientific journal Med Hypotheses, concludes</p>
<p>"<i>Early adherents of Rudolf Steiner</i>, the founder of the anthroposophical movement, tend to be born and to die during the dark half of the lunar month. There is significant correlation (P = 0.03) between the distributions of the lunar elongation at birth and at decease. <i>However, this correlation</i> <b>does not operate at the level of individuals</b>, suggesting that the effects of birth date and death date are <b>statistically independent</b>. Copyright 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd."</p>
<p>So, this ref clearly <b>disproves</b>, the link between astrology and birth and death rates!</p>
<p>As a result, I'm removing these references and the claim. <a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVorpal_blade_8a31.html" title="User:Vorpal blade"><font color="green">Vorpal Blade</font></a><a href="../../../v/o/r/User_talk%7EVorpal_blade_f4dc.html" title="User talk:Vorpal blade"><font color="blue"><sup>snicker-snack</sup></font></a> 06:53, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Finally, this <a href="http://www.billmeridian.com/articles-files/lunar.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.billmeridian.com/articles-files/lunar.htm" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> reference clearly states</li>
</ul>
<p>" Serotonin is the substance in the brain of a homing pigeon that sensitizes the bird to the earth's magnetic field, allowing the pigeon to 'home in.' The field itself has been shown to fluctuate with lunar and solar influences. Nelson's work demonstrates a relationship between all of the planets and solar activity. Serotonin exists in the human body. The substance was neglected until biotechnology companies recently took an interest."</p>
<p>So the primary hypothesis is a <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific.html" title="Scientific">scientific</a> one, not an astrological one. This is <b>not at all</b> astrology! So, I'm removing this ref, but I'll let the claim stand.</p>

Bob Foster is a geologist who claims that Climate Change is inevitable, and it's an effect of the sun. His claim is that the observable, physical effects of the sun drives the climate change.

<p>"Geoffrey Dean, a vocal critic of astrology, has noted in his landmark book surveying scientific research into natal astrology in the twentieth century: "In 1900 astrology was effectively medieval. Since then it has advanced and proliferated enormously."[25] Dean has suggested that continued interest in astrology is based on intuition and gullibility, though his analyses have been criticized by astrologers as agenda-driven.[26]"</p>
<p>Given the context, the quote makes it seem as though scientific research "has advanced and proliferated enormously" since 1900. Interest in and astrological techniques proliferated after astrology was popularized at the turn of the century. Secondly, "though his analyses have been criticized by astrologers as agenda-driven." Is every criticism of astrology going to be countered with "agenda-driven" or just this one? It seems unnecessary. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 13:40, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This was a "yes, but" that turned into a "yes, but, but", which is why the "agenda-driven" bit is there. I agree it shouldn't be seen to imply scientific research.

<dd>Astrology is the subject of 'it' in 'it has advanced'. I will have to dig out my copy of <i>Recent Advances</i> and see the quoted sentence in context (no page number is cited). What about astrology characterized it as medieval before 1900 in contrast to after 1900? It's a strange quote without the context.</dd>

<dd>Now you can make up your own mind about (1) what Dean meant, (2) whether it's relevant in the context, (3) my judgment for including the quote, (4) my intentions (as all have been questioned). You may also be awed by the sheer amount of material.

<dd>Not sure but the new editor may be removing the word 'constellation' since not all traditions are based on constellations. On a related point, I don't think the sentence in question is accurate:</dd>
<dd>"All astrological traditions are based on the relative positions and movements of various real celestial bodies and construction of celestial patterns as seen at the time and place of the event being studied."</dd>
<dd>Maybe it's a grammar issue and 'or' should replace 'and', but not all traditions are based on <i>real</i> bodies - Uranian uses non-existent hypothetical planets. I met a Chinese astrologer several years ago who did not use any planets or stars at all in her calculations - only the date and time of birth. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 17:02, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Right. For example, even western tropical astrology intentionally hasn't used the contellations as the main reference point since the second or third century. I just wanted to see if there was a specific argument that ScienceApologist had for adding in the reference to constellations here.</dd>
<dd>The sentence previously said:</dd>
<dd>"Most astrological traditions are based on the relative positions and movements of various real and construed celestial bodies as seen at the time and place of the event being studied."</dd>
<dd>I thought that it was vague enough to work, but I don't know.

<dd>Hmmm. I like "real or construed". The Chinese practice, like 'lots' in Hellenistic seems to be largely 'derived' in the sense that they might start with bodies or some celestial frame of reference, but become a set of calculations that are not directly based on celestial observations. I read a book on Chinese astrology that constructed a chart with something called constellations, but they were not based on star patterns but were divisions similar to Western and Hindu houses. Many techniques in Western astrology alone are not based on visible bodies but on measurements such as the Ascendant and Midheaven. It could also be the case that soem things called astrology are not proper to the name. Astrological associations in other systems of divination such as palmistry or tarot do not require time and place of birth, but borrow astrological symbolism. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 18:14, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"All" is too sweeping a statement to be accurate because of exceptions. Though vague, I agree that "most" is acceptable and would correspond to "mainstream" Western tropical astrology, which would be the most inclusive for the audience. Chinese seems to be based on a 12-year cycle with an arbitrary starting point, and a corresponding two hours per rising sign. Compared to Western astrological system, it doesn't seem to have anything to do with astronomy. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 20:29, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There may be a number of offshoots or types of Chinese astrology - the 12 year cycle may have been originally sidereal, but the contemporary practices and Chinese pop astrology seem to be divorced from the sky. Derek Walters' work is the only really meaty source I have encountered on the history of Chinese astrology. It mostly developed in the period corresponding to the Medieval West. Before that, there are some records of omenic astrology - comet observations, eclipses, etc, similar to Babylonian and some Hellenistic practices. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 12:53, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Carl Sagan</span></h2>
<p>Ok, I think that the sagan comment on the humanist article is being twisted out of context. His statement, from <a href="http://www.astroconsulting.com/FAQs/mercuria.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.astroconsulting.com/FAQs/mercuria.htm" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> was</p>
<p>"I find myself unable to endorse the "Objections to Astrology" statement, not because I feel that astrology has any validity whatsoever, but because I felt and still feel that the tone of the statement is authoritarian. The fundamental point is not that the origins of astrology are shrouded in superstition. This is true as well for chemistry, medicine, and astronomy, to mention only three. To discuss the psychological motivation of those who believe in astrology seems to me quite peripheral to the issue of its validity. That we can think of no mechanism for astrology is <b>relevant but unconvincing</b>. No mechanism was known, for example, for continental drift when it was proposed by Wegener. Nevertheless, we see that Wegener was right, and those who objected on the grounds of unavailable mechanism were wrong. Statements...that appear to have an authoritarian tone...confirm the impression that scientists are rigid and closed-minded"</p>
<p>It currently says "he found the statement's tone authoritarian and the points made peripheral and unconvincing." Notice that he did say <i>That we can think of no mechanism for astrology is relevant but unconvincing</i>. The statement, as it stand now, is very misleading.</p>
<p>Any objection in the article from sagan should say,</p>
<ul>
<li>astrology has no validity whatsoever</li>
<li>tone of the statement is authoritarian</li>
<li>To discuss the psychological motivation is peripheral to issue of validity</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Victor Mansfield</span></h2>
<p>Victor Mansfield's ideas have become twisted. He did not "acknowledge" that there is little support for physical mechanism. He says they are too undeveloped to fight over. He asserts that this is a straw man argument that does not illuminate other possibilities, such as those that can be drawn from quantum physics.</p>
<dl>
<dd>On the subject of VM, how are his claims received in the theoretical physics community? I went to a lecture of his a few years ago, sponsored by a Jungian psychology institute. I got the impression that his career is lecturing and writing to astrologers and new age communities. Does he maintain a career in physics? <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 16:30, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also VM says</dd>
<dd>" However, given the state of the proposals with which I am familiar, within currently accepted science, there is little support for a physical mechanism for astrological influence"</dd>
<dd>So he <b>does</b> say that there is little support for physical mechanism. I think that a major problem in this article is putting words into other peoples mouth.

<dd>He does indeed say that, but this is not his conclusion.

<p>This edit removed alchemy on the basis of "POV tangent". I don't think this is tangential since astrology is often grouped by historians with alchemy as protosciences or pseudosciences that result in motivation of the development of a science (in this case, astronomy and chemistry).</p>
<p>I know there has been some discussion of protoscience here, and I didn't write this phrase originally, but it seems that it should not be removed since it helps define protoscience. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 16:23, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't see how the comparison is POV, but it might be tangential because it leaves a lot just hanging out there. If Newton wasn't an alchemist, would he have been as motivated? Astrology has contributed to astronomy, math, and psychology. It still contributes to psychology, as most Jungians study it to some degree and are motivated by it.

<dd>This doesn't really reflect the actual historical state of affairs. Zeusnoos or Chris Brennan could tell you a lot more on this issue. However, it is safe to say that the priesthood forbade the practice of astrology by the masses because they would have felt threatened otherwise (they were using it themselves). This is in some ways analogous to the Biblical Tree of Knowledge. So there is a lot more to astrology and religion than simple rejection. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 22:49, 23 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That statement, as I'm reading it, that Marskell is referring to is not really making a claim about the beliefs of the masses of these religions, but rather a doctrinal matter, which it is. Obviously many Christians are believes in astrology, but most Christian churches officially reject it for various reasons (e.g., as idolatry, polytheism, whatever). I'm not exactly convinced that the reason that astrology was forbidden in these cases has or had anything to do with a sense of being "threated" on the part of the priesthood so much as a perceived theological incompatibility. <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVariable_3b71.html" title="User:Variable">siafu</a> 23:00, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The issue of astrology's reception by religious traditions is terribly complicated and would be a separate article in itself. To make matters more complicated, at least in late antiquity astrological symbolism was borrowed by religious groups such as gnostics, although what they were doing (with the possible exception of one founder of a gnostic cult) was not really astrology. To the original query, there was not much astrology in the Bible - Paul uses language of powers and thrones once in a letter to a town that would have been familiar with astrology. Divination and magic are condemned (in the Old Testament or Hebrew Bible as well). It can be argued that the Magoi story was a later elaboration as Jesus' life began to take on mythical characteristic, and that if priests from Persia did visit, any type of astrology they practiced was omenic or not recorded in history, and not as M. Molnar argues, Hellenistic astrology of Ptolemy (his theory is full of holes in my view). The Revelations symbolism is arguably gnostic - astrological or constellational symbolism is mixed up with other symbolism that you might find in similar apocryphal works. Its inclusion into the canon at the councils was permitted by a slim margin, simply on the basis that it was thought to have been authentically written by John near the end of his life.</dd>
<dd>Ok, that aside, Marskell's statement is largely correct - most Christian denominations reject astrology outright as do Islamic, though everyone knows the Muslim Arabs were responsible for developing and transmitting astrology in the 9th-10th centuries. Hinduism embraces astrology and is perhaps the largest religious proponent, Buddhism largely rejects divination and astrology, though Tibetan Buddhism maintains an electional astrology. Individual Christians who embrace astrology are in a unique position of having to reconcile their beliefs (of course it depends on what those beliefs are since they vary on fundamental points) with astrology. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 13:33, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Jung reference</span></h2>
<p>I added a reference to the statement that Jung thought astrology was a descriptive language of the psyche, but not predictive. The specific passage is the following. After he says mythologized processes in nature are not allegories but "symbolic expressions of the inner, unconscious drama of the psyche which becomes accessible to man's consciousness by way of projection," he indicates his adherence to famous precession argument:</p>
<p>"In the case of astrology, for instance, this age-old "scientia intuitiva" came to be branded as rank heresy because man had not yet succeeded in making the psychological description of character independent of the stars. Even today, people who still believe in astrology fall almost without exception for the old superstitious assumption of the influence of the stars. And yet anyone who can calculate a horoscope should know that, since the days of Hipparchus of Alexandria, the spring-point has been fixed at 0* Aries, therefore quite arbitrary, the spring-point having graduatlly advanced, since the, into the first degrees of Pisces, owing to precession fo the equinoxes...</p>
<p>"'The stars of thine own fate lie in they breast,' says Seni to Wallenstein-a dictum that should satisfy all astrologers if we know even a little about the secrets of the heart. But for this, so far, men have had little understanding. Nor would I dare to assert that things are any better today." <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 14:46, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It would be nice to have a little more perspective on this "not predictive" statement. Jung didn't associate the workings of the psyche with the stars as constellations (sidereal zodiac) and neither do Western astrologers, who use the tropical zodiac. When he says that astrology is not predictive, I take that to mean not predictive in a fatalistic or deterministic sense. The drama projected by the psyche is not a question of specifics, but of archetypal processes. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 20:23, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't write the sentence in question. But it's clear that what Jung criticizes is "people who still believe in astrology fall almost without exception for the old superstitious assumption of the influence of the stars." Influence of stars, to him, means physical, causal, influence of constellations/stars. He does not explore that fact that western astrologers practice with a tropical zodiac - it's irrelevant to his take on astrology. Rather, he proposes that the symbolism of astrology is not dependent on such mechanism for <i>meaning</i>. In a later work published before Synchronicity he describes his experience of coincidence when putting together the sun/moon marriage study: "Although I was obliged to express doubt, earlier, about the mantic character of astrology, I am now forced as a result of my astrology experiment to recognize it again." (The Structure and Dynamics of the Unconscious). He describes this 'mantic' character is the coincidental arrangement of pairs of charts on his desk with Moons conjunct and other configurations that he considered meaningful. While his use of the word mantic is anachronistic, what he means is that astrology offers symbolic meanings that show up without the predictive character of 'such and such will/is likely to happen in the future' because it is written in the symbols. Using astrological symbolism to find meaning through coincidence is not normal astrological practice.<a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 14:03, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jefffire, please become familiar with Ertel's work by reading the references before attempting to edit. You have tried to present Ertel's work as a "replication," but this is untrue. Ertel analyzed all the Mars-athlete data already researched by Gauquelin and the Gauquelin critics. His analysis shows a linear relationship between Mars placement and success in sports. It shows up on all the collected data. It was predicted by Gauquelin. It has been critically discussed among concerned scientists, but after eight years the finding still stands without any explanation other than astrology. Yet you have removed Ertel completely from the article, arguing that it is given undue weight. Undue weight in relation to what?

<p>I have read the references cited (again) and they do not discuss the Ertel's analysis and his finding of the eminence effect but are old discussions regarding Gauquelin's Mars effect that precede Ertel's work. Ertel's analysis was published in a peer reviewed scientific journal and in his book (coauthored with Kenneth Irving) <i>The Tenacious Mars Effect.</i> Ertel's analysis is well known among the concerned scientific community. Gauquelin himself refered to the eminence effect in his article "Is there Really a Mars Effect?" Goeffrey Dean, who did not take Ertel's analysis at face value, provided his critism, which I've included. Ertel's analysis has received published attention from the concerned parties, which, no matter how it was originally published, makes it known and notable. Are you trying to say that to include Ertel's analysis is cherry picking but to ignore it and go back and choose among the old criticism that it resolved is not? <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 14:17, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

A simply mention as in my prefered version avoids this problem. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a> 14:25, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem you have is that Ertel published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and the astrology critics did not. Now you are trying to claim that none of the sources are reliable or "notable" and try to use this argument to justify your removal of any specific mention of Ertel's research. Doesn't this give undue weight to the sources of the astrology critics, most of which predate Ertel? <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 21:35, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Which reliable journal did Ertel publish in? So far all I've been shown is <i>Correllation</i> and <i>Scientific Exploration</i>, both of which are a long way away from being reliable sources. Did Ertel publish in <i>Nature</i> without me noticing? The journal you cite are not reliable. Until you cite from reliable sources do not insert controversial text. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a> 10:58, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia is built upon authority. If Ertel lacks the temerity to publish in a proper journal that is his problem, not mine. Until he overcomes his aversion to mainstream scrutiny, nothing he publishes can be treated with any authority here. Also, criticisms of the Mars effect have been reduced to the words "claim to refute", so I'm not sure where you're getting the idea of undue weight from. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a> 11:25, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
