<p>Hi. I'm glad to see I wasn't the only one who objected to deleting posts and replacing them with a "user has plagiarized" message. I'm kind of new, so I'm not quite sure how things are done. I <i>do</i> know that a very large percentage of the stuff in an encyclopedia is <i>not</i> copyrightable (factual), and Jazz77's articles were no exception. I certainly don't have any objections to band members writing about their band. They should maybe keep the facts and their experiences/observations separate, but isn't there a place for first-hand articles, opinions, essays, that sort of thing? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesteve_4de4.html" title="User:Thesteve">-- Stephen</a></p>

<p>Somebody mentioned that you are fluent in Spanish. If this is true, I wonder if you might be interested in being the English <a href="../../../e/m/b/Wikipedia%7EEmbassy_0364.html" title="Wikipedia:Embassy">Wikipedia Ambassador</a> to Encyclopedia Libre? They seem to want to upgrade to Phase III and to get interlanguage links working but we do need a point of contact with that project. I would do this myself but my Spanish skills are not good enough to reasonably prevent yet another misunderstanding with that project. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></p>

<p>This is what my source (<a href="http://www.pantheon.org" class="external free" title="http://www.pantheon.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.pantheon.org</a>) says on the <a href="../../../k/a/c/Kachina.html" title="Kachina">kachina</a> article:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But in the mythic sense and ritual significance they are better conceived as spirits of the dead or departed. After the end of a good life, they go to the West, where the sun sets, and become kachinas, but there is no clear identity with the deceased and a specific kachina.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It's a reliable source, but I wouldn't trust it to be one-hundred percent accurate.</p>

<p>An, thank you for commenting about my contributions and reading them. I have to admit that I didnt know how to write some of my first articles. But also , here is the problem: At first, I took this as a magazine and so, I wrote my articles like a magazine writer probably would. Take Carlos Monzon's page, for example, which you mentioned to <a href="../../../z/o/e/Zoe.html" title="Zoe">Zoe</a>. I thought I was being partial by publishing he was a great boxer, which, in fact, 90 percent of boxing fans would say he was because he had an excellent record, but also pointing out the fact that he had a history of violence, which is a fact because he was even accused and jailed for the murder of his wife.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But Ive realized my mistake and I know what you meant by saying that I was expressing an opinion with adjectives like <i>great</i> and <i>excellent</i>. As a matter of fact, in my latest entries, Im trying to stay clear of those.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Out of the 3 people who have critizized me, youre the one I like the most, because you did it in a constructive way.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The fact you have told me how to do my articles so that I can do a better job in the future, gives me a lot of respect towards you.</p>

<p>Hey! Thank you for praising my job about the <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernie_Gonzalez_6ad0.html" title="Ernie Gonzalez">Ernie Gonzalez</a> page! I had no idea anyone had looked at it until I checked it today, (one month after you posted your messegae in it) and so I was glad to find out you liked my job there.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Dont you feel sometimes like an educator when you're working these pages? I do..I think if anyone can be benefitted from what I write and research about daily, (which is, mainly about boxing, air transportation and entertainment, cause I am not doctor material, LOL! ), well if anyon can be beneffited out of what I have to give, Im very, very happy. Dont you feel that way too?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Well, once again, thanks! Hope to hear from you again soon!!</p>

<p>Dear An:</p>
<p>Hi! How are you? I have a problem with that photo I uploaded, apart that I need to put courtesy of Phillipe Bleus near it cause he requested me to, I meant to upload it into the <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aeroflot.html" title="Aeroflot">Aeroflot</a> page, but I have no idea how to do that. On the other hand, I was told I need some equipment to make it in JPeg. The fact it is on a page by itself is an accident, since I meant to send it to the Aeroflot article and I dont know what happened. But anyways, Ill have to see either if anyone here knows how to do that or if I can find out by myself.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Anyways it was as always, great to hear from you. Id say <i>Pleasing</i> but I like using happier words than that, LOL. So it was great to hear from you again! Im glad to be working in a website where people like you and me put our stone to make this a great world thru educating.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Thanks for everything, and God Bless!! Hope to hear from you soon!!</p>

<p>An: Please take a look at my response to Roadrunner's regarding typical <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solid.html" title="Solid">solids</a> as <a href="../../../d/e/g/Degenerate_matter.html" title="Degenerate matter">degenerate matter</a>. Initially I shared your gut feeling, but a couple of minutes thought persuaded me that the explanation that I have added to the talk page is a worthwhile explanation of a legitimate misunderstanding and therefore potentially worth transfering to the main page.

<p>Hi Astro. I hope you don't mind but I have removed your redirect from the 'Republic of Japan' page and proposed the page for deletion. I know we don't normally delete redirect but in this case the name of the page is <i>so</i> misleading in claiming Japan is a republic that it may confuse students using Wiki into thinking Japan <i>is</i> a republic. (I know if they read the Japan page they would know it is a constitutional monarchy, but as all ex-students know, sometimes pages aren't read through fully. I'd hate some kid to lose marks because some vandal had originally created a site with a misleading name.

<p>Dear <i>Astrojet</i>: Hi! Thanks for your message. As for Astrojet, I couldnt resist myself: Dont worry, the Astrojet were very famous airplanes used by <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Airlines_cdc7.html" title="American Airlines">American Airlines</a> during the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>, to counteract <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Airlines_8d0f.html" title="Eastern Airlines">Eastern Airlines</a>' <i>Whisperliners</i>. The Astrojet was so famous and fad, that some American airplanes were repainted as <i>Astrojets</i> recently.</p>
<p>About Dr. Wilfredo Santa. I dont claim to know every <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rican_ff02.html" title="Puerto Rican">Puerto Rican</a> who is famous, and who can? Angelo Cruz was super famous for the shot he hit in a <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> <a href="../../../b/s/n/BSN_15b0.html" title="BSN">BSN</a> game that gave his team the championship, but I doubt anyone in the new generations there know him at all. Anyways, ironically, me being originally from the island, I never heard anything from this Dr. Santa. I do know a Dr Iris LA Santa, my mother's personal doctor back in the day, but I dont think she's worthy of an article...lol</p>
<p>So, well if he was famous then the article could be legit, kept and all the other whatevers. Unfortunately, I dont know much about this person. I receive <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Vocero_36d7.html" title="El Vocero">El Vocero</a> daily, and Ive never even read news about him there. On the other hands, from what I read here, he's written books, so time will tell, maybe soon he will be worthy of an article. I guess when I call my family back there Ill ask them if hes on tv or something.</p>

<dd>Hi Ed. about Pinochet again. The article insist that he was dictator of Chile. Ok...i went to Fidel Castro and found "ruler". Changed to dictator, for consistency, but was reverted by a user claiming he was "elected"... what do you think of it? If "election" is the rule, Pinochet was elected for the 1981-1989 term by the mayority of voters that approved the constitution in which the transitory articles gave him that term.</dd>
</dl>
<p>There's been a long-running controversy (I mean, in the real world outside of Wikipedia) about whether any people have ever "voted for" Communism or any other form of dictatorship. Advocates of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">democracy</a> and admirers of the US version of it, insists that no one ever would vote to give up their rights to a dictator. Advocates of socialism, opponents of democracy and enemies of the US provide what they claim are counterexamples: Castro, Hitler, Allende, Aristide.</p>
<p>I don't know enough history to evaluate these claims, but my dialogue with other Wikipedians has stimulated me to start doing some research. It looks like, at best, some of these leaders DID win an election somehow, but on false pretenses. They said one thing and did another. Which is why people generally wanted to overthrow them, as soon as they found out.</p>
<p>Opponents of democracy use the tricky argument that to overthrow "a democratically elected leader" is anti-democratic and hypocritical. Supporters of democracy should shut up and leave Haiti and Chile alone. But they forget one thing: <b>"governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute new government"</b> (<a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Declaration_of_Independence_ee24.html" title="US Declaration of Independence">US Declaration of Independence</a>). --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 14:00, 29 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks, nice to hear you like it. But there are still some parts missing like the interior and the distribution and abundance of Black Dwarfs - I'm trying to add them the next days. It's not easy to get good information on this topic.</p>
<p>Maybe there's someone else who can translate it, I sometimes translated articles or parts of articles from en, it would be nice to give something in return.

<dd>Thanks for the note on my Talk page pointing out that issue with the new text. (My rewrite was intended to just make it more concise.) Perhaps you'd like to make proposed edits to the sandbox, which is somewhat more stable, if you want to avoid getting reverted by 172. Anyway, the page was unprotected by Ed Poor, not me; I don't know why he did it, since I didn't talk to him about it, but since he did it's an opportunity to get back to work. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 21:05, 21 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually, it didn't get protected in "the wrong version". 172 reverted it <i>after</i> it was protected. He may not have done it deliberately, as it was before Raul put up the protection notice. Still, weeks of haggling and 172 won't budge at all. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily">V</a> 01:46, 22 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, I regret that setting the bot status is too late, but the request was made <b>less</b> than 24 hours ago on the request for permission on meta (precisely one hour and a half before I set the status). I think we could not make it be more speedy than this.

Is it you who left a word on my talk page on meta ? Yes, the page exists, and I trust Jorge; I put the comment on es, to ensure everyone would be aware of the new status, and could complain if needed... ant</p>

<dd>I'm likewise curious how you first came across the early wikipedia, and what made you decide to be involved with the editing here? <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 12:48, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I moved 'AN' to 'AN (disambiguation)' and thus had to update some links to avoid double redirecting. To my surprise I often encountered on talk pages: --[[:AN|AN]] while on one page I also finally found who this genuine pain in the *** might have been, since that page also contained --[[User:AstroNomer|AN]]. If you have nothing to do with the first AN who often occurs on talk pages for articles about astronomy, my hu<i>b</i>ble apologies. Else, would you mind to lookup --[[:AN|AN]] and (now) --[[AN (disambiguation)|AN]] that had to replace a few --[[AN]] and replace your signature with --[[User:AstroNomer|AN]], please. So far, users ended up and after my changes continue to end up on <a href="../../../a/n/_/AN_d968.html" title="AN">this</a> instead of your user page. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../s/e/p/Sep_17.html" title="Sep 17">17 Sep</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 12:46 (UTC)</span></p>
