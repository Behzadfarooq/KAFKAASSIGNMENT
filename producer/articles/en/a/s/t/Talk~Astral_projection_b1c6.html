<p>Anyone who would like to edit this article and perhaps add a source can quote me if they want. First things first, defining Astral Projection properly. Astral projection is the seperation of the "mind" or the "spirit body" from the phsyical form, by inducing states relative to sleep. In order to "project" oneself onto the "astral plane", a "trance" or very relaxed mindset and physical body is very important. I myself have projected before and you may use me as a source if you want. (Not trying to be cocky just helping) Astral projection is not lucid dreaming, therefore you probably wont see a silver cord (unless you dream about those sort of things). "- It took me a good deal of mental control to stop the constant flow of thoughts to my mind, but once I gained enough control over my mind I could quiet the thoughts of my surroundings and began to relax. That is always the hardest part for me, after relaxing my whole body I could concentrate on falling out of my average mindset and become entranced. I always think about falling down a mineshaft or an elevator well, and then everything goes quiet and it all gets heavy. It feels like someone put an even weight on all of your limbs and your body, and your head always feels heavy and numb, almost lethargic. You feel like your vibrating while your physical body is actually sleeping, and you are in total conscious control. Then, it's all about concentrating on lifting your arm out of your body, without moving a muscle. The separation is entirely surreal, everything seems to whir, and yet you are aware of everything. It's entirely frightening at first... I myself have never seen any sort of umbillical cord of silver coming from my navel, but I can say things are eerie, you can see everything that happens, but cannot move or talk to anyone of them. People hold conversations and you actually hear them, you can see the cars moving around you and people in thier houses. If you try and notice something while you have seperated from your body and remember it, you can prove that its real by looking the next day. I have never seen any spirits, but I have heard voices, especially in the sky. They are kind, and always tell me to go back where I am safest." I know its not much but you can use it if you want.

<p>Rather than have this article be a mockery of the idea that there are ways to interpret lucid dreaming besides just "disconnected brain receiving random static", it would be great if a balanced presentation of the meaningful concepts and abstractions were given. It's clear that this article is going to have "adherents believe..." and "some who claim to be able to astral project say..." disclaimers, but even still Astral Projection should be honed down to something better than a catchphrase for "mind over matter". Is Astral Projection completely distinct from Remote Viewing, or does it include Remote Viewing as a subfield? I know the silver cord is fairly definitive (though I lucid dream quite frequently and have never seen such a thing), is there anything else? <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetaeducation_c35a.html" title="User:Metaeducation">Metaeducation</a> 29 June 2005 11:35 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I am sorry for editing yours to poke this in, but as I don't know how to create my own post I have little choice. Having researched projection for some time now, I must inform and clear away some things. Astral Projection is NOT a form of lucid dreaming. It is more easily attained through this but it is possible and commonplace to project consciously. In short the body falls asleep (much as a foot or leg would) whilst the mind does not. The reason that it may be believed to only be attained in sleep and thus lucid dreaming is probably that at the second conscious projection is acheived, the body does indeed enter sleep mode and the brain likewise becomes just as inactive as an average sleeper would. It is the mind that is active, not the consciousness, transfered into one of the seven subtle bodies or layers of Aura, the astral body, which can walk around in the physical plane or jump to the astral. Astral projection really does not have much of anything to do with "mind over matter..." it is more accurately described as the mind going out for a walk. And since the mind is unlimited, so is it's neihborhood. Remote viewing IS completely distinct from astral projection in that you walk around outside of your body, whereas remote viewing is just seeing something that will happen, only lightly dipping the astral plane. It's the difference between seeing through a webcam with a blurring screen over the lens and actually being in the room and walking around unhindered. I hope this helped. And to your last question about the silver cord, since astral projection is completely separate from lucid dreaming, you will never see a silver cord as it is linked to your body, and thus only visible when your astral shell is outside of it. See my addition to&#160;:Astral Projection and the Bible: now&#160;:Astral Projection, the Bible, and the Silver Cord:. <a href="../../../s/a/c/User%7ESachiel_2b90.html" title="User:Sachiel">Sachiel</a> 18 July 2005 9:37 GMT</p>
<p>actually there is no such thing as 7 auric layers and you do not actually leave the body. You actually do what is called "phasing". You change your focus of counciousness to a higher level of reality, The auric layers are from the traditional, mystic ways of astral projection and are all just assumptions. If you believe there are only 7 astral planes than that is all you will get!</p>

<p>Hi, Can someone post some links to prove that atral projection exists? It would help. Without any proof this article looks a little mad if you get what I mean.</p>
<dl>
<dd>In my opinion, there are no proofs, it's only a known phenomena which does not seem to be definitely linked to an illness (i.e. not associated with schizophrenia psychosis). The experience happens to some individuals without any known reason and their personal beleif system only seems to affect their own interpretations of it. Reading my own lines, it reminds me of the alien abduction phenomena, which might have more in common than we suspect with astral projection&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>I don't think the article seems mad personally, but I agree it's controversial like many psychology (and para-psychology) related topics. --66.11.179.30 21:43, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I set out to discover if AP was a real phenomena some years ago, and after having read many accounts from regular APers I concluded that the only way to know for sure if it was real or not was to learn to do it myself. After a month of following readily availible training instructions I projected for the first time, and a year later I started doing so regularly. Today I still don't have a proper repeatable technique, but I do find that I can usually project about once a week on average. Repeatability is important for scientific experimentation, but I have proven to myself that the phenomena does indeed exist. Mine is however just one account amongst many. If you like me demand undisputable proof, you might want to try learning this for yourself. - Setting about doing this is what separates the agnostic from the sceptic. --Nosforit 62.72.248.134 22:56, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've researched the subject out of curiosity for many years yet I never believed that people who astral project put their counsciousness in an astral body. I thought the proponents were saying it was all about your counsciousness leaving the body, and the other "astral" body was in fact just a visualisation made from your imagination.

<dd>Since I found the question interesting but can't answer them scientifically I thought I would just share some of my own subjective sensations about it:</dd>
<dd>Having experienced two distinct types of similar experiences, the disembodiment sensation is indeed only observed as a sensation, but I couldn't by any means come up with any scientific data proving that this actually happens. Consciousness being used to feel focused from a certain point of view might be what causes the body sensation.</dd>
<dd>In some of my personal experiences (especially astral ones which aren't happening on the physical plane, more on a mental plane), sometimes I actually didn't feel I had a body, while at other occasions I felt having a fluid body which easily could change shape, so it really seems subjective more than anything else... As for the apparently popular silver cord, it's interesting that I never could observe such a link, and I tend to believe that it is also highly subjective. In this kind of experience the environment also doesn't feel as stable as the physical one, and interestingly the perception is expanded over that of the eyes (i.e. virtual 360 degrees view is common for some reason, also it's possible to get a view of our perceived body shape as seen from the outside).</dd>
<dd>As for etheral experiences which are definitely more intense and stable, I feel like if I am in my physical body which I can't change shape, and this accompanies most physical sensations (these experiences can include elements of gravity, magnetism, high molecule-like vibrations rate, even velocity, and although levitation works and physical objects can be penetrated there is a sensation of resistence or wind of sorts, and I can't effect voluntary changes in the surroundings). Since these seem to happen in the actual physical reality (this kind of experience is often refered as real-time projection), but that there is no popular scientific data to corroborate it, I'm really unsure of what's exactly happening, the physical sensations could still be subjective, although the projector does not experience it as virtual...</dd>
<dd>So the questions you raised are very adequate and interesting, and there's no evidence to back any of the "body" theory other than personal subjective experience. If this matters, my own experiences were always spontaneous, although I remember previously trying to trigger them using various means, it was impossible for me to project at will (anxieties caused by vibration sensations and perception of the four heart valves perceived as my heartrate caused me to stop the experience all the time). My experiences usually occur in the morning on the weekends when I decide to sleep an hour or two over what I'm used to (I have theories why such times raise the odds of a projection, but won't get into these now). --66.11.179.30 21:22, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The research section needs to be cleaned up. The book reference should be at the bottom with the other references and less emphasis on Robert monroe should be put. Make an article on him instead and put a link. Also we need more scientific and serious studies on this. I know remote viewing is more studied by science since there is interesting empirical evidence but we I'm sure a couple of scientific papers have been written.

<p>I've reverted your change to astral projection as there is certainly no policy against adjectives on Wikipedia. Hell, the first sentence of today's featured article uses "important". — ceejayoz talk .com 04:02, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I reverted it back since the adjective "controversial" tends to remove the neutrality of the current article. Bragador 13:30, 1 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Also about the fact that there is no policy against it. I'll remind you that articles must adopt the neutral point of view. I invite you to read any good encyclopedia or dictionary to notice that no adjectives are used unless absolutely necessary since it tends to change the ideas of the reader. The fact that something is controversial or not is a conclusion that the reader must get by himself. This is something they teach in every introductory science class. Afterall, isn't everything controversial&#160;? I also checked today's article and it doesn't contain it in the article, only on the main page of wiki for the short description.Bragador 14:05, 1 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Again, that there is a controversy is a state of fact. Wikipedia's neutrality policy isn't an idiocy pact, either - see <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a>, for example. <i>Pseudoscience is any body of knowledge, methodology, or practice that is erroneously regarded as scientific.</i> Here are some selected quotes off other Wikipedia articles that use controversial in their text.

<dd>Again it depends of the context. If you think I said nobody must use the word "controversial", then you got me wrong. I said nobody <i>should</i> use it unless it is absolutely necessary since it tends to influence the reader's opinion depending on how you insert it in a sentence. In the current case, since we can do without the word "controversial", I don't understand why you really want to point out a useless fact. Even more to make it a link. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBragador_b653.html" title="User:Bragador">Bragador</a> 16:21, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Controversial" in this case is not a judgement on Astral projection, it is a statment on the current consensus of general opinion in this matter. As such it states fact. I don't think the NPOV policy should be invoked to suppress a fact just because it might affect a readers opinion. <a href="../../../d/v/8/User%7EDV8_2XL_8587.html" title="User:DV8 2XL">DV8 2XL</a> 20:28, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

"Controversial" means essentially <i>"marked by controversy"</i> and "controversy" is defined as "<i>A dispute, especially a public one, between sides holding opposing views."</i> In this context, I think it is accurate to state that astral projection is controversial, and that <i>omitting</i> the word influences the reader's opinion to a non-neutral POV by passively implying that there is no debate about the concept. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardian_b62f.html" title="User:Edwardian">Edwardian</a> 20:35, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree - omission is potentially just as POV as a blatant opinion.

<dd>I am also responding from the RfC. The use of "controversial" is prosaic in context, and I think reasonable and appropriate given the status of the subject. The word is used exactly once (granted, that use is prominent in the introduction, though it is nowhere harped upon) and I think places no undue burden on the topic that wouldn't be present in any balanced presentation of the subject (which, BTW, this article emphatically is not). It would be helpful in the extreme as well if the article were better sourced overall; while I'm here, I'll see if I can clean up a bit. --<a href="../../../k/g/f/User%7EKgf0_e092.html" title="User:Kgf0">Kgf0</a> 23:20, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What this article really needs is an opposing view, such as can be found in the Neon Genesis: Evangelion article, where multiple views as to the symbolism of the topic are mentioned, though not necessarily cited. All opinions are not verifiable, yet are agreeable. The topic of this article is both proven/disproven by opinion alone, as psychology was so many centuries ago.</p>

<dd>Would it be appropriate to have a speculation section? I'm interested in the similarities between the OBE state and a psychedelic dose <a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimethyltryptamine.html" title="Dimethyltryptamine">Dimethyltryptamine</a> experience. I would be willing to write a section with references regarding this. Looking at the article on <a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimethyltryptamine.html" title="Dimethyltryptamine">Dimethyltryptamine</a> they have a similar section speculating DMT production by the pineal gland.

<li><b>Some projectors</b> claim that during an astral voyage, communication with other projectors or <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirit.html" title="Spirit">spirits</a> is possible. <b>Pets have been said</b> to react in a frightened manner when encountering a projector, and <b>some people claim</b> to have seen an astrally projecting person's spirit as a colored beam or shot of light darting around the room.

<li><b>Many projectors, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clairvoyant.html" title="Clairvoyant">clairvoyants</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiritualist.html" title="Spiritualist">spiritualists</a></b> describe the seventh, or <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chakra.html#The_7_basic_chakras" title="Chakra">crown chakra</a> as a golden bowl, which is said to shatter at death, especially in a rare form of death caused by a <a href="../../../k/u/n/Kundalini.html" title="Kundalini">kundalini</a> surge.</li>
<li>This cord mainly appears to a novice projector as assurance they will not become lost. However, even <b>experienced projectors find it useful, claiming</b> it is a fast way to return to the body. <b>Some claim</b> the silver cord can be severed during life, as a rare form of <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">suicide</a> or naturally by death, and that when this happens, one returns to the astral plane as one of eight phases of death, ending either in one's shard of spirit being returned to God or by <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebirth_%28Buddhism%29_ecf7.html" title="Rebirth (Buddhism)">rebirth</a>.</li>
<li>Another popular term to refer to this kind of OOBE consists of "etheral projection" as opposed to "astral projection". <b>People who claim</b> to have experienced both say they can clearly observe the distinction between these two states. <b>Some claim</b> that the sensations of real-time projection are usually as vivid as the ones of the physical body, which can be a source of serious <a href="../../../a/n/x/Anxiety.html" title="Anxiety">anxiety</a> when it unexpectedly happens.

<dd>One line was from myself, although it was altered (more common grammar was replaced by "claim", etc, like it was done to a number of sentences of the article by someone who probably thought that OOBEs are a myth). That line was the one about "etheral projection", and this is from personal experience followed by a few years of personal research on the subject (reading books) in an attempt to relate myself to some of the others and find terms to classify two forms of distinct experiences which I could differenciate.</dd>
<dd>Some people want to relate to books as a reliable source. From my experience, half of the books I found on the subject either seemed to be written for money by an author claiming to know about it, and putting together a bunch of references and of pseudoscientific theories or mysticism. Some others seemed to be written by people who experienced it themselves who describe their own experiments as they can. In both cases, all you'll find are still personal views and interpretations of some phenomenon which a number of people live but is hard to describe. At least, some people and groups have agreed on a few terms, such as the difference between "etheral" and "astral" projection. Some others will use other terms to describe the same thing, but it appears that most authors made up the terms themselves, so you'll find a lot of controversy when attempting to classify those experiences properly.</dd>
<dd>What do you know about the phenomenon, other than varying claims and descriptions from all over the world by people of different beliefs? Other than the few scientific (or at least, scientific attempts) of Monroe and a few other institutes who merely allowed to establish a link between a few brain wave or resonance patterns and a particular dream-like state of mind observed by experiencers? The only other scientific data I know attempts to link this phenomenon with a few other frightening states which some people live (i.e. some being sightings).</dd>
<dd>I wouldn't be so prone to discount most of the available information, which are invididual testimonials filtered through an attempt to intellectualize the phenomenon.</dd>

<dd>I understand your point and feel you are right. On the other hand Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and it tries to get all the knowledge in the world in one place except for original research and personnal opinions... So sadly your own experience doesn't count unless you publish a book and cite it as a source while mentionning it is the author's opinion. It's the only "loophole" I can think of. Also, if many groups have different opinions, it is still interesting to write them down in seperate sections while mentioning their publications or, if you really need to, their website. The main goal of wikipedia is to be able to track down each written sentence to a published work afterall... <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBragador_b653.html" title="User:Bragador">Bragador</a> 20:50, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not stupid. It actually says that this is witchcraft, right in the bible. Here is a forum post. Read it:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>-FROM HERE ON I DID NOT WRITE. IT IS A COPY OF A POST I SAW IN A FORUM-</p>
<p>Hello everyone, i'm not going to take course in October for Christian purposes. It's been fun, but i see the truth now.</p>
<p>In the book of Samuel, Saul seeks Samuel after he dies through a medium (todays version of a clairvoyant séance). Anyway, the clairvoyant managed to summon Samuel back from the dead. However he was a bit miffed about being disturbed from his sleep. 1 Samuel 28:11 (read about it)</p>
<p>There are a few instances that took place in the book of Acts: 8:39-40 39. And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away; and the eunuch saw him no more, but went on his way rejoicing. 40. But Philip found himself at Azotus; and as he passed through he kept preaching the gospel to all the cities, until he came to Caesarea. There were also numerous examples from Jesus visiting on a mountain with Moses and some angels, while the disciples sat there gasping. Then finally Jesus leaving his body at the cross and coming back 3 days later to only leave again to be with his Father in Heaven. Also, angels escorted some of the disciples out of the local jails without anyone ever seeing them- isn’t that a neat trick. Ok, now that you have seen these examples in the Bible, lets see what God said about practicing such things: Deut 18: 9. "When you enter the land which the LORD your God gives you, you shall not learn to imitate the detestable things of those nations. 10. "There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, one who uses divination, one who practices witchcraft, or one who interprets omens, or a sorcerer, 11. or one who casts a spell, or a medium, or a spiritist, or one who calls up the dead. 12. "For whoever does these things is detestable to the LORD; and because of these detestable things the LORD your God will drive them out before you. 13. "You shall be blameless before the LORD your God. Now wait a moment! Why is the Lord condoning these practices in the Old Testament and yet it is being practiced with some of the Bible characters you ask? Simple, you have to put it into context to properly understand God's laws. God told Moses he did not want his people to even associate with witches and those who practice such things as astral traveling (spiritist) and yet Saul did it? Yes, but Saul was also very disobedient to God’s law and he ended getting the shaft (literally) in the end.</p>
<p>Then what about the disciples and Jesus? Who can question this? Jesus and the disciples only did this through the Holy Spirit as mentioned in Acts 8 and as mentioned in Mark 16:</p>
<p>19. So then, when the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, He was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.</p>
<p>Ok, my point is this. God created the physical and spiritual realms, but not really for us to be wondering around in. The astral planes are really meant for his angels to use. Of course, the devil and his angels are also using the astral planes and that can be a bad encounter with one of his cohorts (demons). There are those who insist on going out there and wandering around looking for fun stuff to do, but sooner or later, they will run into some problems and may not have anyone to help. Happens more than you think. After all, who is watching out for your unattended body if your spirit man is out wandering around? What happens if you run into a demon with strong powers that wants to sever your cord and inhabit your body? What about spirits that may follow you back to your body and hang around to torment you? What happens if your body won’t let you back in or dies while your out wondering around? Books and people who encourage these practices don’t really discuss this much, do they? Because these points don’t sell books. You say, Ok, I will just cast them all out in the NAME OF JESUS! This only works if your where God wants you to be. If your not obeying his Word, your not under His protection.</p>
<p>This is why God does not like his people practicing such things. To call this a gift is incorrect because God has placed a spirit in each one of us, that is quite capable of Astral traveling. But He has put us in our bodies for one purpose. To use our body to fulfill God’s plans while we are here on earth! Not to be wandering around the spirit world. Unless it is under the direct supervision of the Holy Spirit, this should not be practiced. To answer your first question about going to hell, I will let the Word of God speak for itself: Rev 21:</p>
<p>5. And He who sits on the throne said, "Behold, I am making all things new." And He said, "Write, for these words are faithful and true." 6. And He said to me, "It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to the one who thirsts from the spring of the water of life without cost. 7. "He who overcomes shall inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be My son. 8. "But for the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their part [will be] in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death." 9. And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues, came and spoke with me, saying, "Come here, I shall show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb." 10. And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,</p>
<p>Astral traveling would fall under a form of sorcery as most of the New Age Practices. Interestingly enough, notice the last verse mentions that John is doing a little astral-time travel himself, but ONLY UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT AND JESUS, WHO IS REVEALING THESE THINGS TO HIM IN THE BOOK OF REVELATIONS. He is not just out there wandering around by himself without any divine supervision asking Jesus questions.</p>
<p>And that is my new view on the topic of astral projection. Goodbye everyone. Turn to Jesus while you can.</p>
<p>-THIS IS THE END OF THAT POST-</p>
<p>It is true, Astral travel is wrong. Now quit calling people stupid. I don't call you stupid, do I? <a href="../../../x/d/3/User%7EXD375_8785.html" title="User:XD375">XD375</a> 15:36, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, but I disregarded pretty much everything you said there - you see, I don't believe a single word in the bible. Now, a more pertinent question has arisen - your statement "it is true, Astral travel is wrong," which appears to be based on what the bible says, makes me wonder what <i>you</i> are doing on Wikipedia? Did you know that this is an encyclopedia? Yet you think information about something which not only might be true, but you <i>yourself</i> even admit may be true, should be removed? I have news for you, friend. Some people don't believe in the bible, and some people will always have viewpoints that oppose your own. I suggest you do some growing up and learn to live with that knowledge. <a href="../../../h/u/w/User%7EHuwie_d686.html" title="User:Huwie">Huwie</a> 07:22, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Recently, the etheric projection article has been nominated a second time for deletion, which had brought me to an interesting observation about both of the OBE related pages. This article does not cite its sources, as to how or why "astral" as a term has anything to do with outer body travel. All I see are many arbitrary assumtions, without any evidence to indicate that "astral projection" is even a valid ideology, aside from New Age hogwash.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This article should either be removed, or merged with a general "OBE" entitled article. There are no sources stating that "astral" relates to a semi-physical state, and so, it is incorrect to assume that OBE of the mundane nature are astral travels at all.</dd>

<dd>Astral projection is a widely used term within the western occult, <a href="../../../e/s/o/Esoteric.html" title="Esoteric">esoteric</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermetic.html" title="Hermetic">hermetic</a> schools of thought, as well as within more contemporary literature often described with the blanket term '<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_age.html" title="New age">new age</a>'. Astral Projection is also used in the titles of countless books in this area, which on its own would make the term notable. A simple search on any online bookshop or any search engine will show how widely used the term is. New age subjects will be included in Wikipedia as they are notable cultural concepts. The article needs work but deletion is not an option as the subject is too notable, merging would also not help. The article should simply be taged for sources and accuracy.

<li>I still think merging in the least would be best-- there can be headings for all the names of psychic projection, and their various distinctions, if any. You can have all kinds of books with a name, but this article contains no explanations of the link between a psychic event and "astral". From what I can tell, people simply chose an arbitrary label without a logical reason. Parapsychologists and other researchers do not even use this phrase, during experiments; they usually say something like "exteriorization", physical "disassociation" or "externalization". <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychicbody_1e68.html" title="User:Psychicbody">solstice</a></li>

<p>I agree that we should have more than one side to any OBE article. However, recent comments made on this page and others like it have been opinionated and dogmatic. For example, "an OBE is a hallucination and there is no scietific evidence" is a belief, because there are numerous scientific investigations, yielding positive evidence (weak and strong). It is also dogmatic to say that investigations into the OBE phenomenon are "pseudoscience" when there are many respectable scientists who conduct objective experiments-- science is not a belief system, and so arguements need not be based on belief.</p>
<p>What should be said, is perhaps a view on the alternative explanations, based on the evidence. For example, there is no conclusion as to whether or not an OBE (astral or etheric) is an authentic "externalization" or even proof of life after death. One might say that an OBE may be psychical in nature, but might only be some vivid clairvoyant experience, which does not actually imply "exiting" the body.</p>
<p>Another side to this, in the cases of alleged OBE under the influence of drugs, or can not be physically validated might be hallucinations. There is nothing wrong with this arguement, as long as it addresses specific examples, rather than making general assumptions. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.179.7.201_baca.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.179.7.201">64.179.7.201</a> (talk) 05:40, 6 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>I think the criticism section needs to be refined. Firstly, the paragraph regarding no reason being given why the astral body is the vehicle of projection while subtler bodies exist. There are large amounts of material out there concerning this, firstly ethric projection usually concerns OBE (or in the phasing model, a real time projection i.e. a locale 'spatially' close to physical and so resembeling it resembling), and astral projection usually concerns an inner journey, The body name is simply gained from the area of exploration (i.e. astral body in the astral planes).</dd>
<dd>Secondly, what is the criticism section supposed to be criticising? Currently it seems to be criticising the definition of terms used on the AP sphere, wouldn't it be more prudent to actually criticise the validity of the AP experience in regards to it being an hallucination or having a greater reality than creative visualisation? Currently this section seem's a bit vague and undefined. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterjingo_36cd.html" title="User:Misterjingo">MisterJingo</a> 18:50, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Astral and etheric projction deserve two seperate arguements, however this page does not permit that in a manner than it easy to follow, unless you lump the two together.<br />
There appears to be no scientific evidence to support astral projection being an actual OBE (by that name), however every source that I came across is compatible with the concept of etheric projection-- Charles Tart and Harvey J. Irwin for example have shown this. Every study confirms that OBE are all in the Physical realm, or there is more than one kind, assuming visiting fantastical/surreal places is even a valid state of existence.<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychicbody_1e68.html" title="User:Psychicbody">solstice</a> 10:46, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I re-added the mystical model section with some sources. The majority of books hold the view that the astral planes are somehow external to the body, and one projects consciousness in an energy body to experience them. The etheric body for the RTZ zone and the astral body for the astral planes. In his book Astral Dynamics, Robert Bruce extended on this by claiming each plane requires a subtler body to be projected from a prior energy body. The mystical model more concerns a view of creation containing the source (of everything) at the 'centre', and increasingly dense vibration eminating from this until the physical solidifies from it. The planes in-between the source and the physical are the various astral, mental etc planes. As this idea seems to be the prevalent one currently, I feel it’s important that it is represented in some form. I can go through my library and produce more sources if required. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterjingo_36cd.html" title="User:Misterjingo">MisterJingo</a> 04:51, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are required to supply sources, actually. So, please do. This page should be as factual as possible, but so far a lot of it is heresay and speculation. Otherwise, the additions will be removed, sorry.<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychicbody_1e68.html" title="User:Psychicbody">solstice</a> 10:47, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sources sited, and when I have time I will go through my library of AP literature and take sources from all books which adhere to these ideas. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterjingo_36cd.html" title="User:Misterjingo">MisterJingo</a> 12:44, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Coming back to this article after many months I notice a lot was deleted with no specific reason given. I am happy for something to be flagged up due to it not quoting sufficient references (this can be fixed and should be discussed), but it seems some of the deletions are based on a users own philosophies of this subject and so they remove ideas they do not like. Also, 2 links were deleted yesterday and the reason given was they were not high in Google rankings. Can someone please link me to a wiki article which states only certain ranked sites can be linked. The site in question does currently have a low user number (it's growing), but does have thousands of page views per month (see forum stats). The site is also growing as a repository of AP articles and should remain as a link for those who wish to explore this area imo. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterjingo_36cd.html" title="User:Misterjingo">MisterJingo</a> 12:59, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My bad. There was no stat counter that I could see, so I had to base the site's relavance on two things: community participation, and search engine ranking. The latter being more signigicant, because it shows that the website is in fact popular.<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychicbody_1e68.html" title="User:Psychicbody">solstice</a> 10:35, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been looking at other wikipedia pages concerning OBEs and I think this article might need a rewrite. Astral projection is a specific kind of projection (notably to the astral planes). So shouldn't this article deal exclusively with that? The OBE article goes into detail regarding the different kinds of projection (astral, etheric, VR etc). Surely this article should document just the information available on astral projection alone. Etheric projection is not AP, AP on the whole is considered an inner journey, or a place reached through inward visualisation usually utilising various visualisations, trance states, or even the bodies natural mechanisms of sleep. It seems many have contributed in the light of taking AP as projection - where this should surely be left to the OBE article? Perhaps mention could be made to how the AP is reached, but leave it at that? Opinions? Ideas? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterjingo_36cd.html" title="User:Misterjingo">MisterJingo</a> 09:56, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes! There was an etheric projection page, but it was deleted (unfairly), despite there are facts to support it as being distinct from astral projection. You are correct, and I am glad someone sees that-- the EP discussion page had actually concluded it should even be kept, but all the evidence was ignored. Since the "commity" completely ignored those facts, I have since done what I could to include them in the AP page.</dd>
<dd>I think that if They want just one article, then it should be merged in a big "OBE" page, then each kind of projection can be discussed in the correct context (see the above section on deletion). <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychicbody_1e68.html" title="User:Psychicbody">solstice</a> 10:39, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
