<dd>I'm trying to verify the sources of the newer images you've uploaded and can't find them from the links you provided. I don't mean to be a pest about this, but it is very important that images uploaded to Wikipedia have clear (and verifiable) licensing information. Wikipedia's content license is extraordinarily generous - in general, anyone is allowed to use any text from Wikipedia for any purpose, including commercial purposes, so long as they in turn provide the same right to anyone else (<a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyleft.html" title="Copyleft">copyleft</a>). Images are mostly meant to follow the same principles, which mean they must be originally created by the submitter (who can agree to such a license) or be from some free source. Nearly all images on the internet are not free, and cannot be used at Wikipedia. Images from a forum <i>might be</i>, but unless the creator of the image has said something like "anyone can use this image for any purpose" (and you can specifically point to where this claim is made) I don't think we can accept such images. Is it your belief that the newer versions you've uploaded are indeed free (the creator of the image is OK with anyone using these images for any purpose)? I think that's what you're currently claiming by what you've said on the image description page. Without identifying the creator of the image, it's fairly difficult to verify such a claim. So, can you either identify the creator or identify where the creator's "free for anyone to use for anything" claim might be? Oh, and BTW, if it seems like this is a pretty stringent policy - it is. If you simply didn't understand, that's OK (and we can delete the images you've uploaded). If you don't understand all the image copyright stuff and you want to add images, the safest thing is to not upload anything you find on the web but to upload only photographs you've taken yourself with your own digital camera. Thanks. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 03:31, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Astuishin. Thanks for all your work on the list of WU alumni! Where did you find all those names? I started the article a long time ago (under a different article title) and spent awhile combing through the annual Distinguished Alumni awards on the WU website, but you must have found another, better source. Regarding the controversy over the school seal: I'm not sure I know very much about how this works under Fair Use, so I really don't have any knowledge or expertise to lend to the discussion. I'll weigh in briefly, though, on the Talk Page just to say I agree that it should be up there (the Fair Use argument is fairly convincing). I think you might be best off getting this arbitrated if the problem continues. Best. <a href="../../../r/o/p/User%7ERopcat_d539.html" title="User:Ropcat">Ropcat</a> 23:22, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>On another matter: the article <i>used</i> to be called "List of Washington University alumni" or something similar. It got renamed to "List of Washington University people." I'm thinking it should be returned to a name using "alumni" rather than "people." The "people" university articles usually list faculty, alumni, and so on for smaller schools. But this is clearly a list of <i>alumni</i>. Most other schools have such a page (i.e. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_University_of_Michigan_alumni_a198.html" title="List of University of Michigan alumni">List of University of Michigan alumni</a>). Do you have any thoughts or objections on renaming the article in this way? Thanks. (I'll post this on the article talk page, too, in case anyone else objects.) <a href="../../../r/o/p/User%7ERopcat_d539.html" title="User:Ropcat">Ropcat</a> 23:33, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hi Rick Block I'm sorry to get back to you so late, and I sorry to have not clarified where I got the pictures of the east Asain cities skyline's from. The exact web page where I found the photos of tokyo skyline- <a href="http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=2008" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=2008" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> a forum user Sonie took these pictures and I sent a message to the user asking if I could post these pictures on Wikipedia. I don't quite on how to expressed that when placing licensing information about the picture. The Hong Kong and shanghai pictures were from a website I can quite recall and listed as desktop backgrounds. All of the pictures were slightly altered to fix the resolution requirements on Adobe photo shop elements.--<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstuishin_8fb0.html" title="User:Astuishin">Astuishin</a> 02:31, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Like I mentioned above, copyright status for any pictures uploaded to Wikipedia has to be very clear. I'm assuming you did not take these pictures, which means you cannot grant permission for anyone else to use them (which labeling them as GFDL does). If user Sonie at www.skyscrapercity.com claims to have taken the Tokyo skyline one, formal permission must be obtained (and recorded) as described at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequesting_copyright_permission_5781.html" title="Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission">Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission</a> (an email asking if it's OK to use at Wikipedia is NOT enough - the email has to specifically mention the implications of Wikipedia usage under the GFDL and the email and response have to be forwarded to <b>permissions AT wikimedia DOT org</b>). Even though the others were posted as "desktop backgrounds" at a website, this does not make them legal for use here. In particular, you don't own them so you can't give permission for others to use them (which GFDL does). Really, truly, unless you take a picture yourself or whoever originally took it puts it on a website with a free license of some kind (and uploaded by some random person to a forum is generally not adequate), it's very difficult to obtain the right kind of permission. Wikipedia has had problems with unlicensed images in the past which is one reason so much attention is paid to this now. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 03:59, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Gate.gif</b>. I notice the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this file yourself, then there needs to be a justification explaining why we have the right to use it on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you did not create the file yourself, then you need to specify where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the file also doesn't have a copyright tag, then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media meets the criteria at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>, use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>.

<p>Hi Astuishin. I wanted to point out that anonymous user 65.246.8.178 continues to add what, to me, seems like a very non-notable name to the list of notable Wash.U. alumni. I'm not sure what steps can be taken in the case of an anonymous user. But maybe you could help me keep the article cleaned up, if you wouldn't mind putting it on your watchlist? Thanks! <a href="../../../r/o/p/User%7ERopcat_d539.html" title="User:Ropcat">Ropcat</a> 07:04, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sure <a href="../../../r/o/p/User%7ERopcat_d539.html" title="User:Ropcat">Ropcat</a>, I will put the article on my watch list, by way did you check the IP address of the user it could be registered to a wash u student or administrator. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstuishin_8fb0.html" title="User:Astuishin">Astuishin</a> 01:41, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks Astuishin! I didn't check the IP address but I did put a note on the user's Talk Page (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:65.246.8.178" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:65.246.8.178" rel="nofollow">here</a>), which he or she promptly ignored. <a href="../../../r/o/p/User%7ERopcat_d539.html" title="User:Ropcat">Ropcat</a> 20:18, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Astuishin. Thanks for your edit to the pictures on the WUSTL alumni list. However, I wonder whether Tennessee Williams is the best person to feature in a picture. Although he's probably the most notable on the "arts and literature" list, he is not an alumnus (attended but didn't graduate). I added him a long time ago because it seemed "close enough" to be worth including his name. What do you think? I could go either way on this, but just wanted to raise the question and get your opinion. By the way, our vandal who is intent on including that totally non-notable Triangle Sport Wear executive seems to have taken a break from the vandalism... <a href="../../../r/o/p/User%7ERopcat_d539.html" title="User:Ropcat">Ropcat</a> 07:15, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Ropcat I actually agree with you WUSTL should not the focus Williams so you are welcome to remove to the picture if you want.<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstuishin_8fb0.html" title="User:Astuishin">Astuishin</a> 07:34, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Astuishin. I've introduced a more formal warning at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Hoff728" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Hoff728" rel="nofollow">Talk Page for Hoff728</a>. Thought you'd want to see this as our past warnings haven't slowed down the pace of the vandalism at all. However, by introducing the warning on the user's Talk Page, and by introducing a Final Warning template if the vandalism happens again, we will then be eligible to list the user for blocking by admins. (That is, if I understand the procedures correctly.) Best, <a href="../../../r/o/p/User%7ERopcat_d539.html" title="User:Ropcat">Ropcat</a> 02:31, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hey Ropcat, okay good I was wondering if there was some type of official process for alerting the the administrators about continuing vandalism. I'm pretty sure Hoff728 will ignore your final warning as usual so hopefully a administrator can put some closure to this and expell him as well as block his ip address. Also I thought you might want to inspect this page; <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotable_Alumni_e2d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Notable Alumni">Wikipedia:Notable Alumni</a>, it's about a new policy proposed for the Notable Alumni pages, perhaps it will give us more clarity when trying to suppress the other looming vandalism to the alumni page.<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstuishin_8fb0.html" title="User:Astuishin">Astuishin</a> 21:03, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks Astuishin. That user was actually blocked by an administrator today after this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Washington_University_alumni&amp;diff=98432375&amp;oldid=96888309" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Washington_University_alumni&amp;diff=98432375&amp;oldid=96888309" rel="nofollow">remark</a> about me on the article. (I didn't even know the process had taken place until the block was made.) He may be back after the block expires, though. I looked over the new proposed guidelines for Notable Alumni. Generally I think they are good, except I don't agree that any alumni notable enough to have a Wikipedia article is notable enough for a "notable alumni" list. If one glances at the CATEGORY of Washington University Alumni, it is apparent that many articles are only of minor notability and would only clutter up a notable alumni list. Wonder what you think. <a href="../../../r/o/p/User%7ERopcat_d539.html" title="User:Ropcat">Ropcat</a> 07:48, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your edits to the WUSTL series. They are welcome. Regarding the navigation template-- how is use of the image not fair use? Additionally, why not welcome additions by WUSTL administrators? All of the WUSTL entries need a lot of work . . .</p>

<dd>Makes sense about the template. Would you mind providing a link to the disccussion about the WU Seal? I can't seem to find it. I still do not understand you follow up comments about WUSTL administrators. Are you referring to the WU Seal discussion?

<p>I noticed you removed a nav box. The clump of templates at the bottom of the WUSTL page was precisely the reason I had originally positioned the WUSTL template directly before the "External links" heading. To me, it made logical sense (and looked better) to have it there, sine the box functions as navigation to all WUSTL-related material. Shall we return it to that location? There is no rule saying nav boxes must be directly at the end of an article. We could then return the "Colleges and universities in metropolitan St. Louis" remplate without having such aa mess. Thoughts? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../l/m/b/User%7ELmbstl_3b5b.html" title="User:Lmbstl">Lmbstl</a> (<a href="../../../l/m/b/User_talk%7ELmbstl_20d4.html" title="User talk:Lmbstl">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lmbstl_1e3d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lmbstl">contribs</a>) 06:46, 18 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>I see your point <a href="../../../l/m/b/User%7ELmbstl_3b5b.html" title="User:Lmbstl">Lmbstl</a>, however I think because this is the WU page any templates created to nav through other WU daughter articles should be a priority, and other more cluttered templates should be set to auto collapse.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If truth be told I am in a slight dispute concerning the placement of community colleges on that nav box. In comparing with other articles community colleges are usually put under public university systems, however that seems to be disputed.<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstuishin_8fb0.html" title="User:Astuishin">Astuishin</a> 10:04, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

For every 1 source he has provided during our debate I've provided 3 and that's not even mentioning that 70% of his sources were weather maps LOL.

<dd>I think it is ok to use the approved WUSTL logo-- it was uploaded by clyerla without restriction (of course, as long as it is not defamed in any way, which we are not interested in doing). I would prefer to remove the outdated business school logo-- it doesn't seem that the business school uses a special logo any longer; it simply appends its name to the WUSTL images.

<p>Hi. Thanks for your work on this. But I am unsure what you wish me to do. Duke and Ohio Wesleyan are the ones that seem the most glaring by their absence. Both are still VERY MUCH United Methodist, despite objections by some wikipedians. Yes, to put it mildly I was "out talked." Some people seem to have so much time to spend on various issues, and so verbously. I just can't keep up. But if you want a vote to return Duke and Ohio Wesleyan and any others which are Methodist schools, I will be glad to add my tupence. Just let me know. God bless. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastorwayne_2dac.html" title="User:Pastorwayne">Pastorwayne</a> 11:55, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. I appreciate the time you are taking with this. I hope you will not find the same resistence I did. This whole wikipedia thing seems odd to me. For the most part, it is good and I enjoy it. But this "fact by voting" bothers me some. People can vote to get rid of something, and majority rules, no matter what is fact or what is helpful, etc. I have found this in terms of categories, esp. But here, too: OWU is definately Methodist. But just because a majority says it is not, it gets excluded. Funny. Anyhow, thanks for what you are doing. And indeed, God bless you! <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastorwayne_2dac.html" title="User:Pastorwayne">Pastorwayne</a> 18:05, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yes, GBHEM is accountable to the General Conference of the U.M. Church. It is one of our General Agencies. I've noted the discussions about OWU especially. I really cannot understand it. Ohio Wesleyan, though surely not AS connected to the Methodist Church as it once was (it was one of the premier schools of our denomination back in the 1800's) still very much IS a U.M. School. We have five of them in Ohio: Ohio Northern, Otterbein, Baldwin Wallace, Mount Union and OWU. They are all STILL U.M.!! I do not understand the passion that some seem to have about asserting that it is not. Anyhow, I appreciate what you are doing! <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastorwayne_2dac.html" title="User:Pastorwayne">Pastorwayne</a> 01:25, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Dear Astuishin,</p>
<p>Burtchaell's book "The dying of the Light" has a very extensive chapter on the progression and the eventual demise of the relationship between Ohio Wesleyan and the UMC over the past 150 years. If you would like to be very particular about the meaning of the association and the list that you have found on the web, I know you may run into issues of notability, as some have already suggested on the template's talk page. I know the issue will be, as it has been, controversial among many WP editors. Thank you for your time! <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaSaltarella_7b57.html" title="User:LaSaltarella">LaSaltarella</a> 22:12, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for the message, Astuishin! I appreciate it! I can point you to the relevant pages in the book. I am in the process of getting the OWU article in the FAC process where its stability is essential to its successful nomination, therefore I do not wish to get into any drama. I appreciate you following up! <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaSaltarella_7b57.html" title="User:LaSaltarella">LaSaltarella</a> 23:33, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Dear Astuishin, thank you for the compliments regarding the Ohio Wesleyan article. I have put a lot of time in it and solicited help from other WP editors, so I hope that it will pass through the FAC process. I am glad you understand that any premature insertions that have generated discussions on its page, <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_University_c8f9.html" title="Duke University">Duke University</a>'s page and UPS may compromise its stability. Thanks again for your time! <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaSaltarella_7b57.html" title="User:LaSaltarella">LaSaltarella</a> 23:45, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, I reverted your edit regarding nicknames on the Columbia, Missouri page. "The Athens of Missouri" is a historical nickname for the city as specified by William Swiztler's A History of Columbia and Boone County and many other local history sources.

<p>Have you seen what Cylera's changed image to? It looks a promotional image out of a magazine... big stamped not for print use.

<dd>I don't feel we should be forced to use scanned photos when we are clearly in fair use to use the shield. The copyright info. is on the info. page, just like every other image on Wikipedia, and this is more sufficient to show how it belongs to. What I think is needed is bar WUSTL from editing till they act rationally. <a href="../../../c/a/z/User%7ECazador_0189.html" title="User:Cazador">caz</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/z/User_talk%7ECazador_359b.html" title="User talk:Cazador">speak</a> 05:34, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
