Scene from <i>Astro City</i> #3. Art by Brent Anderson.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Astro City</i> is set in a world where <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhero.html" title="Superhero">superheroes</a> have existed since at least the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a>: the first public hero, Air Ace, appeared soon after <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>. Busiek, Anderson and Ross have crafted a complex world with a huge cast of characters, many of whom have extensive backstories sketched out which are revealed as the series progresses.</p>
<p>The series is an anthology that focuses on different characters living within Astro City and the stories are usually narrated from a first person perspective from the story's protagonist. Some issues of the series are one- or two-part stories, while others run as many as seven issues in an extended arc.</p>
<p>The essential hook of <i>Astro City</i> is that it explores the reactions that people -- both ordinary people and the heroes and villains themselves -- have to living in their world. For example, in the first story, the character Samaritan reflects on his life during a typical day, in which he spends almost all of his waking hours flying around the world to help people, and never has any time to enjoy the sheer physical sensation of flight. Other stories involve a date between two high-profile heroes, the initiation of a "kid <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidekick.html" title="Sidekick">sidekick</a>" hero, the efforts of a reformed <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supervillain.html" title="Supervillain">supervillain</a> to find a life outside of prison, a superhero being driven away from Earth by his "love's" attempts to expose him, and the life of an innocent bystander in the days after having been held hostage by a supervillain.</p>
<p>While the focus has been on Astro City itself, the series does mention (and at times occasionally shows) heroes from other cities such as Boston's Silversmith, Chicago's The Untouchable and New York City's Skyscraper. Some members of Honor Guard hail from other cities such as MPH from Detroit and the Black Rapier from New Orleans. There have also been appearances from international heroes such as England's the Lion and the Unicorn. Such appearances are fleeting as the focus is always on Astro City itself.</p>

<p>Astro City is the seat of Hood County in an unspecified state. Though there is an actual <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hood_County_1691.html" title="Hood County">Hood County</a> in <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>, the name was chosen by Busiek because it "is another play on secret IDs; Mask County or Cowl County wouldn't have sounded right." <a href="http://www.physics.mun.ca/~sps/kbac/kbac0204.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.physics.mun.ca/~sps/kbac/kbac0204.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> The city was originally called <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romeyn_de_Hooghe_d784.html" title="Romeyn de Hooghe">Romeyn</a> Falls (until its rebuilding, post-<a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>). At that time it was renamed in honor of the superhero Astro-Naut, who apparently, at the cost of his own life, saved the city from an as yet unrevealed devastating disaster.</p>
<p><a name="Description" id="Description"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/t/Astro_City_ff46.html" title="Edit section: Description">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Description</span></h3>
<p>The bulk of the city is contained between the Wildenberg and <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Gaines_8647.html" title="Max Gaines">Gaines</a> rivers, which define its western and eastern edges, respectively. Mount <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Kirby_cae4.html" title="Jack Kirby">Kirby</a> hems in the built-up area to the north. The Wildenberg merges into the Gaines to the south; in the juncture lies the prison facility of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Biro_7d51.html" title="Charles Biro">Biro</a> Island. The remains of Torres Island, destroyed by an explosion in 1983, lie between it and the city proper. The Gaines is navigable below Astro City (there are "seaport shops" near Astro City's southern end), but the "Falls" in its original name suggests that it is at the river's head of navigation (though the falls could be on the Wildenberg rather than the Gaines, or on both rivers).</p>
<p>Astro City is made up of numerous neighborhoods, which include the rebuilt City Center, centered around <a href="../../../o/t/t/Otto_Binder_bd43.html" title="Otto Binder">Binder</a><a href="../../../c/2E/c/C.C._Beck_602d.html" title="C.C. Beck">beck</a> Plaza; Old Town; <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_A._Chesler_f271.html" title="Harry A. Chesler">Chesler</a> (also known as "The Sweatshop"); Shadow Hill; <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Baker_%28artist%29_3144.html" title="Matt Baker (artist)">Bakerville</a>; Derbyfield; Museum Row/Centennial Park; <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Iger_37d3.html" title="Jerry Iger">Iger</a> Square; Kiefer Square; <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Kane_d0c8.html" title="Bob Kane">Kanewood</a>; South Kanewood; Fass Gardens; <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_B._Gibson_4308.html" title="Walter B. Gibson">Gibson</a> Hills; and Patterson Heights.</p>
<p>Notable locations in Astro City are the Astrobank Tower, home of the Astro City Beacon, the city's warning beacon; the tower also has a statue of Air Ace in front. Other locations include <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Grandenetti_d8ac.html" title="Jerry Grandenetti">Grandenetti</a> Cathedral; the <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_F._Outcault_410d.html" title="Richard F. Outcault">Outcault</a> Bridge; Bruiser's, a bar catering to heroes; Butler's, a private club for the superhero set; and Beefy Bob's, a fast-food chain.</p>
<p>Outside the angle between the rivers comprising the city proper are outlying suburbs such as Goldwater Heights, west of the Wildenberg. The area's primary college, <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gardner_Fox_9234.html" title="Gardner Fox">Fox</a>-<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Broome_%28writer%29_4eeb.html" title="John Broome (writer)">Broome</a> University, known for its advanced biolabs, would appear to be in a similar suburb to the southwest. Wildenberg Center, a failed riverfront development, is also southwest of the city.</p>
<p>Astro City’s world is also populated by additional fictional towns, as well as real ones. One other fictional town that has been shown is <a href="../../../b/u/c/Bucky.html" title="Bucky">Buchanan</a> Corners, a long overnight bus-ride somewhere to the east of the city.</p>
<p>Most of the city's physical features, neighborhoods, streets and businesses, as well as the other fictional locales in its world, are named for past individuals or characters associated with the comic book industry and comics history.</p>
<p>For example, the nearby Alcatraz-like penitentiary, Biro Island (where Steeljack once served time) is a reference to comics creator <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Biro_7d51.html" title="Charles Biro">Charles Biro</a> (famous for the comics series "Crime Does Not Pay").</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/t/Astro_City_ff46.html" title="Edit section: Location">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Location</span></h3>
<p>Astro City has been stated to be a city in the western <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, presumably west of the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi_River_e27c.html" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</a> due to the "K-designations" of two stations (KBAC, KACT). Since it is portrayed as an inland city at the juncture of two major rivers, a location in the Mississippi/<a href="../../../m/i/s/Missouri_River_243a.html" title="Missouri River">Missouri</a> <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drainage_basin.html" title="Drainage basin">watershed</a>, or possibly either the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_River_350b.html" title="Columbia River">Columbia</a> or <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacramento_River_fddc.html" title="Sacramento River">Sacramento</a> <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_basin.html" title="River basin">river basins</a> might be implied, depending on how far west Astro City is. Busiek, however, notes that the local geography, including the rivers and Mount Kirby to the north of the city, are entirely fictional.</p>
<p>References within the series to real cities demonstrate that Astro City is <i>not</i> intended to occupy the place of <a href="../../../a/n/c/Anchorage%2C_Alaska_36ac.html" title="Anchorage, Alaska">Anchorage</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco%2C_California_b6e2.html" title="San Francisco, California">San Francisco</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palo_Alto_10e4.html" title="Palo Alto">Palo Alto</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver.html" title="Denver">Denver</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salina%2C_Kansas_3bb3.html" title="Salina, Kansas">Salina</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junction_City%2C_Kansas_5ff2.html" title="Junction City, Kansas">Junction City</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/p/Topeka.html" title="Topeka">Topeka</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leavenworth.html" title="Leavenworth">Leavenworth</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis%2C_Missouri_7f9c.html" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</a>, the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quad_Cities_f138.html" title="Quad Cities">Quad Cities</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, or <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit.html" title="Detroit">Detroit</a>; most of these also lack anything approaching the requisite geography. All of <a href="../../../i/o/w/Iowa.html" title="Iowa">Iowa</a> and <a href="../../../w/y/o/Wyoming.html" title="Wyoming">Wyoming</a> are effectively ruled out as locations by references to them by characters in Astro City as if they are different states from the one in which the city is situated. An argument for the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midwest.html" title="Midwest">Midwest</a> in general is a story in which the floating Honor Guard headquarters is said to be temporarily positioned over that region, and the members of that hero group travel directly from their base to Astro City in response to a bank robbery.</p>
<p>The best clues as to Astro City’s whereabouts come from the experiences of the character Steeljack as he flees the city and then returns to it. After heading south out of town along the river he is next found in a truck heading east on <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_70.html" title="Interstate 70">Interstate 70</a> in <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas.html" title="Kansas">Kansas</a>, twenty miles west of Salina. He proceeds thence by various means east to <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh%2C_Pennsylvania_b3a2.html" title="Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh</a>, the then-current location of Honor Guard headquarters, from which he is flown back towards Astro City in a jet that crashes “hundreds of miles” from its target. He completes the journey in a biplane commandeered in Wyoming.</p>
<p>A direct line north from the point we encounter Steeljack in Kansas delivers no promising geography for Astro City short of <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Dakota_9b0f.html" title="South Dakota">South Dakota</a>, which seems too far north, and we do not know how far south or east he had traveled at this point, or if these were the sole directions he took. His return journey from Pittsburgh points further west, since the stop in Wyoming was short of his goal. On present evidence <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_California_27a3.html" title="Northern California">Northern California</a> or the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Northwest_2643.html" title="Pacific Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> would seem the most likely possible locales.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/t/Astro_City_ff46.html" title="Edit section: Real World Analogs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Real World Analogs</span></h3>
<p>Busiek has not given any information as to what analog Astro City has in the real world or if it actually has one. As a western city, it shares some similarities to actual western cities such as San Francisco and <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles, California</a>, yet also has echoes of cities in Texas such as <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Antonio%2C_Texas_74ae.html" title="San Antonio, Texas">San Antonio</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston%2C_Texas_c0fa.html" title="Houston, Texas">Houston</a>. It also has features recalling American riverfront cities such as <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis%2C_Missouri_7f9c.html" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a>.</p>
<p>Series artist Anderson has used photo references from as far afield as <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> in creating the physical look of Astro City, and Busiek also implies such a connection, by noting that the City Center started out as the "<a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a>" section of town (this reference could also be an allusion to <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romeyn_de_Hooghe_d784.html" title="Romeyn de Hooghe">Romeyn de Hooghe</a>, the early Dutch <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caricature.html" title="Caricature">caricaturist</a> who provides the city's original name.) A published draft version of the Astro City map shows that certain aspects of its layout were in fact consciously modeled on New York. Similarities to Boston are also prevalent (an early story references a real article from a <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Boston_Globe_7aad.html" title="The Boston Globe">Boston newspaper</a>, rewritten with an Astro City byline), which is not surprising given that Kurt Busiek lived there for some years.</p>

<p>The world of <i>Astro City</i> has numerous heroes and villains in the cast, as well as normal, everyday civilians and other, sometimes stranger, entities. The influences that inspire the creation and definition of the character are rich and diverse. Kurt has delved deep into various forms of literature, spanning a broad range of history providing the characters of Astro City with structure and texture that are the very essence of myth-based storytelling. Several characters have also been modeled on actual persons, a standard process that most writers employ to develop solid, deep characterization. Kurt has been especially fond of paying tribute to famous <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor.html" title="Actor">actors</a> and specific people from the comic book industry itself.</p>
<p>Some of the more prominent Heroes and Villains of Astro City are listed below; see the article on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_in_Astro_City_series_01c4.html" title="List of characters in Astro City series">Astro City Characters</a> for a more complete listing.</p>
