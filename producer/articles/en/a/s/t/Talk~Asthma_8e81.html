<p>Several types of "Smoker’s Paradoxes" [29], i.e. cases where smoking appears to have specific beneficial effects, have been observed; often the actual mechanism remains undetermined. For instance, recent studies suggest that smokers require less frequent repeated revascularization after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) [29], [30]. Smoking appears to interfere with development of Kaposi's sarcoma [31], breast cancer among women carrying the very high risk BRCA gene [32], preeclampsia [33], and atopic disorders such as allergic asthma [34]. A plausible mechanism of action in these cases may be the nicotine in tobacco smoke acting as an anti-inflammatory agent [35] and interfering with the disease process.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking#Health_benefits_of_smoking" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking#Health_benefits_of_smoking" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking#Health_benefits_of_smoking</a></p>
<p>I would also like to point out this website, the list of the worlds oldest living smokers. <a href="http://www.forces.org/evidence/hamilton/other/oldest.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.forces.org/evidence/hamilton/other/oldest.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.forces.org/evidence/hamilton/other/oldest.htm</a></p>

<p>Anyone object to listing oxygen as a treatment? In South Australia, ambulance paramedics switch over to oxygen when inhaled bronchodilators are not working. Hospital emergency medical teams administer adrenaline, which is also being considered for use by ambulance paramedics. Also additional symptoms: sweating, panic, anoxia, unconsciousness and death. -- <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawsonsj_503d.html" title="User:Lawsonsj">Lawsonsj</a> 21 Aug 2003</p>
<p>Oxygen is given to alleviate the hypoxia that is the result of the asthmatic attack, and not to treat the asthma per se. It does nothing to end the episode (unlike the treatments listed). As long as the distinction between the two is made, it would be a good addition. -- <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeone_else_bc03.html" title="User:Someone else">Someone else</a> 04:32, 21 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It does nothing directly to treat the asthma, but the reduction in hypoxia itself does reduce the panic involved, and hence adrenaline release, that is driving the attack. As such it does treat the asthma, as does calming the sufferer down, as you might someone undergoing a panic attack. | <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpaully_efd5.html" title="User:Spaully">Spaully</a> 14:27, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Confusing panic attacks and asthma attacks is a very dangerous idea as one is associated with <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypoxia.html" title="Hypoxia">Hypoxia</a> and the other with <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperoxia.html" title="Hyperoxia">Hyperoxia</a>. For "panic" please read "exercise" or "the need for laboured breathing" in place of the two words at the end of that first sentence. Brain damage has occured in someone treated for "panic" instead of asthma.</li>

<p>I removed this section because it is obviously quackery and devoid of any merit whatsoever. Two major hallmarks of charlatanism are 1) unsubstantiated claims and more importantly 2) demand that the person pay for "classes" to learn a "natural" (in the sense of not requiring machinery or supplies) technique. Having read the writeup on Butekyo, I note further that patients who go to these classes are then required to swear not to reveal the "technique" to others. Rubbish of the worst variety. I and other members of my family have dealt with asthma all our lives, and I assure you that breathing exercises do not by any means take the place of drug therapies. If this Butekyo nonsense stays in here, then I guess we also need to mention homeopathy, naturopathy, crystals, magnet therapy, falun gong, and every other "alternative medicine" we can think of. <a href="../../../j/e/e/User%7EJeeves_f660.html" title="User:Jeeves">Jeeves</a> 15:35, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Whilst the claims made for improved lung function have not been shown by independant research, there is some usefullness in the technique. It is long recognised that anxiety or distress aggrevate the sense of difficulty in breathing that sufferers experience during an attack (anxiety increases attempted respiration rate and the extra effort of struggling with breathing increases oxygen demand). I was always taught to be reassuring and to try and help the patient relax whilst assessing and treating acute cases in casualty. What has been shown from such techniques as Butekyo is not that lung function improves, but that patients are less anxious about their asthma and make less use of their salbutamol bronchodilating drugs for mild symptoms (use of steroid inhallers remains the same). So whilst it does little for the disease itself and I agree with your points on exagerated claims &amp; cost, patients may report mild symptomatic benefits. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> 20:48, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>As an asthma sufferer, I've never heard of vegetarianism being recommended as a treatment, so I removed it. Certainly some foods can provoke allergic reactions, which may induce attacks, but just as many people are allergic to fruits/veggies as anything else. "Regular exercise" is another thing I've never heard of for treating asthma. If anything, some asthmatics must <i>avoid</i> certain exercises to avoid attacks. Please correct me if I'm wrong about this (there are many asthma sufferers in the world and I am only one). <a href="../../../j/e/e/User%7EJeeves_f660.html" title="User:Jeeves">Jeeves</a> 09:17, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're most certainly right. It's not standard medical practise to recommend vegetarianism as a treatment for asthma or being useful to help prevent asthma. As you said in the above section, charlatans abound everywhere. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex.tan_6c56.html" title="User:Alex.tan">Alex.tan</a> 09:03, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I would be careful about throwing around the word "charlatan" before doing a search of the scientific literature. Below are references which report that vegetarians have reduced asthma exacerbations and medication use and that switching to a vegetarian diet achieves the same effect. It is also well known that regular, moderate cardiovascular exercise can reduce the number of asthma attacks. 1-Knutsen SF, Lifestyle and the use of health services. Am J Clin Nutr. 1994 May;59(5 Suppl):1171S-1175S. 2-Lindahl O, Lindwall L, Spangberg A, Stenram A, Ockerman PA, Vegan regimen with reduced medication in the treatment of bronchial asthma, J Asthma. 1985;22(1):45-55.</p>
<dl>
<dd>One single study in thirty-five patients done in 1985 showing an improvement for vegetarians isn't really strong evidence. And the other study merely shows a relationship, no evidence at all that is a causal relationship. Apart from these two studies I couldn't find anything useful on the subject. But moderate exercise is indeed advisable. --<a href="../../../w/o/u/User%7EWouterstomp_b006.html" title="User:Wouterstomp">WS</a> 14:45, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Just because only one diet study has been performed doesn't mean that it shouldn't be included as an option, and just becuase it's older doesn't mean it's not good. After all, physicans don't make any money by saying "eat right and exercise" nor could a large study of that type be easily funded. Most of the currently available medical interventions don't provide relief for every patient, but their validity is not questioned. Why not put it in the alternative or complementary medicine section?</p>
<dl>
<dd>As a life-long vegetarian and also life-long asthma sufferer, I sincerely doubt that vegetarianism alone is enough to mitigate the effects of asthma. I would doubt the validity of the quoted study on the grounds that the sample size was much too small, and that it wasn't testing a single factor - "vegetarianism" is a much broader concept than a single scientific study can encapsulate. Each dietary variation should be studied specifically to identify just what it is about vegetarianism is thought to help alleviate asthma symptoms... I'd also like to mention that I've never heard of the correlation between a vegetarian diet and lower incidence of asthma before now, but I'm very skeptical of the connection. <a href="../../../g/h/o/User%7EGHoosdum_851f.html" title="User:GHoosdum">GHoosdum</a> 18:55, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From personal experience, not eating meat has little or no effect on asthma (my younger brothers asthma is a lot worse than mine and he rarely eats meat, whereas i eat a lot). However, regular exercise has noticably reduced the severeity and regularity of our attacks. I have no idea as to whether exersise is recommended as a treatment, so i will have to find out.

<li>This is technically very good with a detailed description of the immunological processes involved. However, as a mere <a href="../../../g/p/_/GP_ad2d.html" title="GP">GP</a>, I struggled to understand it, got bored and started skipping; I do not think that, as an encyclopedic article, it is currently useful to a non-medical newly-diagnosed asthmatic who would be trying to learn the basics about asthma. Unlike the comment above ('Theories of asthma pathogenesis' suggesting taking an axe to the article) I do not suggest removing the technical stuff, but it urgently needs to be in a separate section <b>at the end</b> of the article. I would leave in their current place the <b>general</b> discussion bits on the theory of pathogenesis/pathology.
<ul>
<li>The structure of the article needs be 3-levels: the general introduction, a lay guide to cause/symptoms/diagnosis/treatment and then a technical discussion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Asthma diagnosis is <b>not</b> via pulmonary function (spirometry) testing for the majority:
<ul>
<li>Children can't do the tests, diagnosis is by history taking and confirmed by response to treatment</li>
<li>In adults, diurnal-variation or reversibility to bronchodilators using Peak Flow Rate Meters is the norm (at least in the UK)</li>
<li>Spirometry was rarely performed (in UK), being largely a hospital test, although becoming a little more common in General Practice now. Spirometry is usually used if the diagnosis is in doubt or chronic obstructive airways disease is instead suspected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A greater emphasis needs be made to distinguish treatments for symptom control (<b>relievers</b>) verses disease modification (<b>preventers</b>). The current passage is too alarmist, very few asthmatics are so severe as to need nebulisers. There is a ladder of treatment depending upon severity (UK NICE/SIGN) that needs adding.</li>

<dd>David - I appreciate your comments. I welcome the effort to translate what I've written into more comprehensible language (and if you think that is bad you should read what was there before I edited the article). Working in a lab talking about science all day, one loses track of what a layperson can and cannot understand easily. Also, I agree that the article makes asthma seem like a death sentence. There are, of course, many different degrees of asthma, including the kind I suffer from, excercise induced asthma. I was hoping the physicians in the crowd could flesh out more of the clinical aspects of the disease. The "Signs and Symptoms" and "Diagnosis" sections are pretty fragmented - please modify it as you see fit. I think a GP's perspective is exactly what we need for those sections. <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr.Bip_5e91.html" title="User:Mr.Bip">Mr.Bip</a> 22:29, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

<p>Hi Folks,</p>
<p>In response to a request by <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr.Bip_5e91.html" title="User:Mr.Bip">Mr.Bip</a>, I've given the asthma article a "layperson's review." Some of the things I stumbled over and a few ideas for addressing them are listed below. I'm also willing to help implement them if there's something you want to address but aren't sure how.</p>
<p>I've never really done this sort of review before, but I hope you'll take these comments as they're meant -- as constructive criticism and suggestions -- rather than as any sort of complaining or insistence that anything be changed. I think you've put together a great article -- and I certainly learned a great deal reading it. --<a href="../../../a/v/o/User%7EAvocado_d936.html" title="User:Avocado">Avocado</a> 00:21, August 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>It's not immediately clear from the beginning (unless, presumably, you have a medical background) that we're discussing a human medical condition. BTW, do animals other than humans ever have athsma?</li>

<ul>
<li>In general, I think the descriptions of athsma symptoms and causes would be easier for the layperson to understand if they explicitly compared the "normal" function with the "athsmatic" function of the organs and systems in question.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I think the article reads a bit like it's addressed to a first-year med student, rather than to an average high school graduate. Say you had just diagnosed a kid with asthma and were explaining the diagnosis to his distraught mother (who's no rocket scientist but not especially dimwitted either -- say she works as a receptionist in the office down the street). How would you explain it? That might be the appropriate sort of style and tone to use.</li>

<ul>
<li>Opening of article is almost overwhelmingly technical. "Chronic inflammatory condition"? responsiveness of airways to stimuli? I imagine an introductory medical textbook might sound a bit like this.
<ul>
<li>Why not at least open the article with a simple layman's explanation that asthma is a chronic condition that can cause difficulty breathing? Then the jargon has a context that might make it easier to puzzle out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Similarly, with terms like "Bronchial hyperresponsiveness", with no links to articles with further detail, and no explanation, the layperson is going to be easily lost.
<ul>
<li>The jargon is presumably important for the medical reader, but you could either use non-medical terms to describe the symptoms, with the medical terms added in parentheses, or vice-versa.</li>
<li>A bit of linking to other articles for the sake of vocabulary might help a bit (i.e. for words like "symptom", which is a common word but nonetheless outside of a lot of people's vocabulary), but isn't really a substitute for explaining terms that really are specific to the profession.</li>
<li>One symptom of the jargon problem that I noticed is a tendency to use a whole lot of nouns and noun phrases (e.g. "leads to narrowing of the airways" instead of "causes the airways to become narrower").</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The diagnosis section is a bit better in terms of jargon, but could use proofreading.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Mechanisms section is the worst jargon offender. I know that it is in fact a technical discussion, but the first paragraph could be made accessible, and the others perhaps just a bit more comprehensible.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The second and third paragraphs of "Pathogenesis" are IMHO the most accessible paragraphs in the article, and might be a good stylistic reference point. FWIW, this section seems to be essentially redundant with Epidemiology, and the chart showing the prevalence of Asthma is better explained by the information given in Pathogenesis than in Epidemiology.</li>

<li>What on earth is the box on the right side titled "Asthma", with a couple of bizarre codes in it?</li>

<p>The recent edits may have improved the readability but have introduced/highlighted several errors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Peak flow meters measure the restriction of airflow through the bronchi, not 'lung capacity'; a term that has a very specific meaning in lung function measurement.</li>
<li>I would dispute the term 'Many' for those asthmatics with allergy. It is generally a tiny minority of the total. Yes a few people get asthma-like bronchoconstriction in the presence of cats or dogs and a greater number find they get symptoms along with their hayfever. But for the majority of asthmatics, direct allergy is not relevent to their disease and antihistamines have NO effect. (the use of serology tests of dubious significance does not prove an allergy, merely the presence of some antibodies)</li>
<li>The terms used (at least in UK) for bronchodilators and steroid inhallers is very specifically 'Relievers' &amp; 'Preventers'.</li>

<dd>DR - I corrected the first two errors you found, which are my fault. I'm not a doctor (yet), so thanks for catching those things. I actually feel like there might be several more technical inaccuracies in the language in this article, but we need doctors to look at it to be sure. I think that the UK and US terms you mention in your last comment are both used in the article.

<dd>Thanks, Dr. Ruben. Regarding the terms <i>relievers</i> and <i>preventers</i>, perhaps it is a UK thing then? I, of course, can deduce their meaning, but an average patient in the United States would not recognize the terms. I don't really care about a U.S. vs. U.K. thing, but the terms <i>reliever</i> and <i>preventer</i> sound a bit too informal to me to be section titles (perhaps I just prefer overly formal speech?). I'm going to reword them slightly; please feel free to edit it further if you think appropriate. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 20:18, August 22, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good idea, KS. I am wondering about a couple of things though:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li><b>References</b>. The first two use the footnote template system, but the first doesn't work (I think the ref number in the article was removed). The second jumps to [1]. A larger issue I think we need to discuss at our MCOW or Lounge pages is what form of references should we use for our medical articles? If I recall correctly, the MoS is vague on this point. For us the matter will essentially boil down to Harvard vs. Vancouver, I should think. The footnote template on WP is essentially of the Vancouver form, and biomedical journals generally do follow that form; however, the problem with this is on WP that if any edit is made to a footnote in the article, I believe the "jumps" get screwed. More experienced users pls correct me if I'm wrong.</li>
<li><b>Red links.</b> Is it considered unwise to submit for FA with red links in the article? Should we start stubs on some important terms, eg. wheezing? I think I'll go ahead and get one or two started by tomorrow.</li>
<li><b>Images.</b> These need to be all cleared — it's the first thing they seem to look at on FAC.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000066">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="red"><sup>ζ</sup></font></a>&#160; 02:12:16, 2005-08-24 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've had my eyes on getting this article to FA status for a while. I think it's probably close to ready, thanks to the last push by Encephalon, KS, and DR. I've just done a another combing through the article, added a few links and corrected a few typos. To address Encephalon's concerns: I think that WP articles are quite mixed when it comes to footnotes. I think that little recent research is discussed in this article, so I feel fine about using the general reference section at the end of the article without in-line citations. I don't think the red links are a problem in themselves either, but starting stubs is never a bad idea. And lastly - the images. Since I picked all of them myself, I can promise that they are all from government or public domain sources - I made super-sure that they would be OK. Double check them please. Let's nominate this article&#160;:) <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr.Bip_5e91.html" title="User:Mr.Bip">Mr.Bip</a> 05:10, 24 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>PS - On second thought, I feel like this article needs a "History" section before it would really be FAC quality. I can't find any good online resources on the history of asthma, and I don't have access to a library at the moment. If someone can add a section soon, that would be great. Otherwise, I would like to nominate this to FAC to see how close we are to the featured standard. <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr.Bip_5e91.html" title="User:Mr.Bip">Mr.Bip</a> 06:05, 24 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Mr.Bip and I briefly discussed the best way to do references a little while ago. I am not entirely certain what FA prefers; my feeling is to keep it this way and if the reviewers would like us to do it differently we can change it. Same for the red links—I don't think it will hurt us but we can always write stubs at least. The images should be fine—they all look properly tagged to me. Mr.Bip, a "history" section would be good, I agree. I'll see if I can scare one up, although I am not sure what I will be able to find. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 06:27, August 24, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I threw a "History" section together, but it could use some work. One of the sources I used was the abstract from <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=6757243" class="external" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=6757243">PMID 6757243</a>, but it would be nice to get the complete article, and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=14160430" class="external" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=14160430">PMID 14160430</a> looks to be a good source for history as well. If anyone has access to these articles, that'd be great; otherwise, I'll see if I can hunt them down at the hospital.

<p>Hi guys, the nomination is going well, but the reviewers have brought up several things to add to the article. I will try to work on most of them, but there are a few I could use some help on. Does anyone have any information on links between smoking, COPD, and asthma? Also, any information about alternative medicine? How about athletes and asthma?

<dd>Yep, saw that. The whole asthma-smoking issue has been quite heavily researched, and is important from several angles:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>the effects of smoking in adults with asthma,</li>
<li>the effects in children inhaling 2nd hand smoke,</li>
<li>relationship btwn maternal smoking during pregnancy and asthma in children, and</li>
<li>the effects of smoking on the efficacy of glucocorticoids used for treatment.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>Incredibly, and I didn't know this until I looked, Cochrane doesn't have a single MA or protocol on any of the above. Cochrane Central lists 31 RCTs to do with various smoking-asthma issues. Cochrane does have some 125 SR/MAs related to asthma, per se. I can help with writing up the smoking bit, although I can't promise a time frame at the moment. Incidentally, that was an excellent catch by Dr. deWollf - I completely missed the fact that we'd forgotten smoking. However, you're supposed to be telling us these things <i>before</i> we go to FAC, JFW!

<p>Hi guys. Just wanted to urge caution when editing the article, now in FAC. Always check after you've edited that the footnote system hasn't been upset. Thanks.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000066">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="red"><sup>ζ</sup></font></a>&#160; 21:19:07, 2005-08-26 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/t/Talk%7EAsthma_8e81.html" title="Edit section: Refs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Refs</span></h3>
<p>I checked out the first reference and it just referenced the fact from another article writen in 1995. So, although the cited article was writen in 2005, the information is 10 years dated. Maybe people should reference sources where the orginial data comes from. I don't believe the prevelence asthma is still 'rapidly increasing.' In some developed nations I believe the rates have declined since 1995.</p>
<p><a href="../../../o/k/_/OK_e0aa.html" title="OK">**</a>, here's the deal <a href="../../../g/u/y/Guy.html" title="Guy">***s</a>. I've spent some time going through the refs, the footnote guidleines on WP etc. I haven't been able to find a way to incorporate a footnote template that skips to the relevant reference but which does not include a number. What this means is that all our references need to be in the Vancouver style. I'm willing to work through this and clean it up, place templates at each relevant text area (eg. XYZ ) and target reference (eg. XYZ, and then rearrange the refs below numerically using # to fit with the number in the text. I believe this is the best way to do it, because if we use the deplorable X system, the moment anyone comes along and adds a ref or moves the text around, the entire reference system breaks down. The first way it's considerably more stable; the only thing I'll need to adjust when there are changes is the # sequence in the references section, because each "ref" will always be tagged to its "note" .</p>
<p><b>What I want</b> is for everyone who placed references in the <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asthma.html#References" title="Asthma">references</a> section to please paste here what statements in the article are based on a reference you placed at the bottom. Just write the relevant text sentence you want the citation to go to, and name the reference. I'll give an example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>In the Treatment section</b>: "The U.S. National Asthma Education and Prevention Program's Expert Panel Report 2: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (EPR-2) (ref: National Asthma Education and Prevention Program. <i>Expert Panel</i>...) and the British Guideline on the Management of Asthma (ref: SIGN document) are broadly supported by many doctors. Bronchodilators are recommended for providing short-term relief in all patients..."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Just place similar notes here as to which statements you wrote require citations to which refs, and I'll handle the rest. How's that sound?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wow, sounds great, Encephalon. I'll get you the references—it'll take me a couple days, though: I'm on call tomorrow.

<dd>Encephalon - I want to get on top of this stuff soon too - I added several of those refs. I'm moving back to school this weekend and starting a job, so I'll be pretty busy too.

<dd>Don't worry about it, Mr. Bip. You deserve a barnstar for the work you've already done. Just post your info on this talk page when you have time, as above. If there are still refs unaccounted for after Seeker posts here, I'll manually go through the edit histories and locate them. I'd have gone ahead and done it over the weekend, but since I didn't place many of the refs, I thought it courteous to ask the editors who did to say where they want them. Your point about Biochem is an important one, and something we may need to think about. Because of the Asthma FAC, I have not worked on RA; poor WS has been making improvements all by himself. I'm doing some clean up work today, but there is SO MUCH more that needs to be done on RA. We might have to rethink our timing: perhaps, MCOTW can be skipped during those weeks when there is an active push for FA status of one of our articles?—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000066">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="red"><sup>ζ</sup></font></a>&#160; 00:56:18, 2005-08-29 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bah—I came home and slept all day, woke up to eat a late dinner and study for an hour, and now am going back to bed. It's not so much call that's tiring, it's the recovery period. I'll get to this tomorrow. Yeah, I'm worried we're getting spread too thin; this is something I'll bring up on MCOTW's talk page (or you can). I'll get you your references; it'd be such a laborious task for you to sift through the history.

<dd>In Treatment: "For those in which exercise can trigger an asthma attack, the episode usually occurs after the exertion, not during it. Higher levels of ventilation, colder air, and drier air all tend to make the episodes worse. For instance, activities in which one breathes large amounts of cold air, such as cross-country skiing, tend to be more worse for asthmatics, whereas swimming in an indoor, heated pool, with warm, humid air is less likely to provke a response." is from Harrison's. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 17:28, August 30, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Really? I find the first sentence hard to believe. I mean what about prolonged exercise? If the sentence were true, then for the most part asthmatics could delay symptoms simply by continuing to exercise. Myself as an example I get symptoms during prolonged exercise, even as short as 5-10min into it if I think about the last time I had symptoms. I think the author was implying short duration exercise, but never said. What do you think? The rest of that quote is golden though, and covers exactly what I had found and was thinking of adding. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 18:35, August 30, 2005 (UTC)

<p>COLD air? You're kidding, right? It's warm air that makes you huff and puff and wheeze.. like from overheating from exercise.. well that's me anyway.. and logically everyone. &lt;.&lt;</p>
<p>Just for an extra parameter, I think humidity is a factor too. Of course 100% humidity is a function of temperature. I find a steam inhalation can sometimes help relax, dialate, allow emptying of lungs more gently. Paradoxically it is not always helpful and tends towards positive results when the weather is cold and dry.</p>

<dd>Well, just going on the numbers, if that 0.06% referred to the entire population of the USA, that would mean that, assuming a population of 300m, a total of 180,000 people die in the US every year from asthma alone. Sounds a bit high to me, so I'll put my money on 0.06% of asthma sufferers per year. Some googling found <a href="http://www.merckmedicus.com/pp/us/hcp/diseasemodules/asthma/epidemiology.jsp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.merckmedicus.com/pp/us/hcp/diseasemodules/asthma/epidemiology.jsp" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> which says "5500 asthmatics died across all age-groups in 1994" and that there were 17m asthma patients in the US in 1998. Granted, the years don't match but the calculated mortality from that is around 0.03% so 0.06% is not far off. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex.tan_6c56.html" title="User:Alex.tan">Alex.tan</a> 16:37, September 1, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry to have caused any confusion. There is no reference; I just made it up as it seemed like a reasonable estimate. Just kidding. It's from <i>Harrison's</i>. The actual quote is "The mortality rate from asthma is small. The most recent figures for the United States indicate fewer than 6000 deaths per year out of a population of ~10 million patients at risk [that is, with asthma]." I thought the percentage was more meaningful than the raw number but change it if you think that'd be better. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 22:22, September 1, 2005 (UTC)

<p>The article notes that asthma is more common in relatively prosperous strata of society. This seems to contradict the conventional wisdom in the U.S. It's widely reported here that poor urban children are at greater risk than wealthier children. I have also read mainstream press speculation that the greater likelihood of exposure to lead based paint may be at the root of this. Any comments?</p>

<dd>I don't know how the U.S. health system works (i'm british), but as far as i'm aware, if you can't pay for healthcare, you don't get it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore poor, urban kids would be less likely to regularly see a doctor, and so they'd be less likely to be diagnosed as asthmatic. to extend this, poorer people are unlikely to go to the doctor because their kid is a tiny bit 'wheezy', so poor people would be less likely to be diagnosed of mild asthma. i for example was diagnosed as athmatic aged 8, before then i was just assumed to be unathletic and not have fantastic lungs - nothing serious.</dd>

<p>Hi there! I'm sorry I missed this message earlier. You're absolutely right, that sentence is misleading, and I'd have re-written it if I'd seen it. There have been varying reports on how socioeconomic status correlates with asthma prevalence: some studies indicate no correlation, others a negative one, yet others a positive one. A problem with the data is that many of the earlier studies done on this issue were of a design that made it easier for spurious associations to be "found". One very large study in Europe recently found that lower socioeconomic status correlates with asthma incidence; however, a new New Zealand study that used what we call a longitudinal design found no real relation between s-e status and the risk of getting asthma, when possible confounding factors had been controlled for. So it's something of an open issue; I think there is likely, in many societies, a <i>low</i> s-e + asthma correlation. I'll remove that bit that seems to point to the opposite conclusion, because it's misleading. Do note, however, that <i>it is true</i> that the prevalence of asthma in <i>developed countries</i> (ie. irrespective of socioeconomic class) has shot up enormously over the last two decades.

<li>Hi Steve, thank you very much for both asking your question and contributing to the article. I saw the sentence you'd written, and I'm the rascal who took it out.&#160;:) However, it was not because I thought it was wrong—that chlorinated swimming pools can induce asthma in some people is correct—but because I wanted it moved to a more appropriate section of the article (you'd placed it under <b>Treatment</b>, whereas that information is better recorded, in this article, under <b><a href="../../../p/a/t/Pathophysiology.html" title="Pathophysiology">Pathophysiology</a></b>, where we mentioned all the other things that can trigger asthma). You can see that I've added the information you wanted included by clicking on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asthma&amp;diff=24896257&amp;oldid=24895860" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asthma&amp;diff=24896257&amp;oldid=24895860" rel="nofollow">this link</a>. I rewrote the sentence to fit the paragraph, and added a reference to a medical journal article for you (it's actually an editorial that is non-technical and quite easy to understand). If you'd like to read more about it—especially since it seems you've had personal experience—it's reference number 7 of the article.

Does it have something to do with local environmental contaminants (chemicals, smoking, cockroaches, dust mites...)?

<dd>Please take care with terminology - to state polution as cause of asthma is very POV. As I understood things, there is generally <b>no</b> proof for polution causing asthma (as the article states <i>it has not been proved that air pollution is responsible for the development of asthma</i>) although they are strongly <a href="../../../c/o/r/Correlate.html" title="Correlate">correlated</a> and seems a not unreasonable theory - but <a href="../../../c/o/r/Correlation_implies_causation_%28logical_fallacy%29.html" title="Correlation implies causation (logical fallacy)">correlation is not causation</a>. One proven environmental cause is house dust mites. Again as I understood things, polution is a certainly a cause of asthma being exacerbated (e.g. ionisation from thunder storms results in increased hospital asthma admissions), but it is not an original cause. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 00:56, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The title of the section is "socioeconomic factors." The correlation between asthma and pollution seems well established by studies such as this one: <a href="http://www.ij-healthgeographics.com/content/4/1/14" class="external free" title="http://www.ij-healthgeographics.com/content/4/1/14" rel="nofollow">http://www.ij-healthgeographics.com/content/4/1/14</a>. I don't see how Hume's problem of induction applies uniquely to this correlation. It is a fact that pollution is subsidized by free waste disposal. Polluters are permitted atmospheric disposal of waste at no charge. This is a plain statement of fact. A consequence of this subsidy is increased risk factor for asthma in communities with higher pollution rates. Leaving out these facts or failing to clearly state them constitutes a bias of ommission.</p>
<ul>
<li>I agree a (very) good study and some (mostly) well thought out discussion. However:
<ul>
<li>It only demonstrates a strong correlation, rather than provides proof of primary causation (but that is not to say a correlation is not important to take note of).</li>
<li>Even if the effect should be proven, this study does not clarrify whether polution increases the de-novo incidence of asthma, or raises the profile of asthma by exacerbating established cases (either of otherwise mild sub-clinical asthma to a state that it gets diagnosed, or of exacerbating established cases causing greater usage of medical resources).</li>
<li>Polution can not on its own be a full description of the cause of asthma (tends run in <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atopic.html" title="Atopic">atopic</a> families, other areas of the world have far higher polution levels than in the USA yet do not have the developed world's prevelence of asthma). So whilst polution is important (including for reasons other than asthma of course), the discussion needs to be balanced &amp; NPOV. Medical consensus has yet to be reached, but polution is clearly a matter than should/is/must be carefully investigated - and WP of course should so discuss this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So I still think the precise language used needs to be careful - but whatever clarification future research yelds, there is no disputing that environment factors have a real affect on asthma (I prefer 'environmental factors' as exacerbation due to thunderstorm ionisation is very real, repeatedly been proven, but can hardly be called polution. Likewise the effects of secondary smoking whilst significant and 'not a natural phenomena' is not what is generally understood by the word 'polution'). So yes, include the topic, but phrase carefully. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 20:59, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

I think everything you have said is fair, but again the section is "socioeconomic factors." Some effort ought to be made towards explaining the higher prevalence and greater severity of asthma in low-income populations. If the research on pollution is ongoing that's fine, but it seems to me to be highly suggestive. And if pollution causes increased health and economic costs then that's an <a href="../../../e/x/t/Externality.html" title="Externality">externality</a>. It would be a pro-polluter bias of ommission not to mention this. I propose the following: "The incidence of asthma is higher among low-income populations, which in the western world are disproportionately minority, and more likely to live near industrial areas. Research on the degree to which industrial pollution can be a principle cause of asthma is ongoing, but existing data strongly suggest that industrial pollution is amoung the environmentla factors that can trigger asthmatic episodes. At least some of the health and economic costs related to asthma are negative <a href="../../../e/x/t/Externalities.html" title="Externalities">externalities</a>. Additionally, asthma has been strongly associated with the presence of cockroaches in living quarters, which is more likely in such neighborhoods." I'll leave it to a regular editor to decide if that's fair.</p>
<p>User:64.74.106.225 (please use 4 tildes ~~~~ to sign your entries) I agree "<i>effort ought to be made towards explaining the higher prevalence and greater severity of asthma in low-income populations</i>", but also think you have hit upon an important issue more wide ranging than polution &amp; asthma alone that needs better inclusion within wikipedia.</p>
<ul>
<li>1st suggested sentance - <b>Yes</b> - I completely agree with this; it expands on the last sentance of the Epidemiology paragraph above and is both well phrased &amp; NPOV.</li>
<li>2nd suggested sentance - <b>No</b> - I confess to completely failing to understand (as I suspect most doctors and patients would), but then I did not understand the <a href="../../../e/x/t/Externalities.html" title="Externalities">externalities</a> article either&#160;:-)
<ul>
<li>I think (?hope) this is meant to explain that there are a wide range of 'costs' to patients &amp; society caused by polution that is not billed to those that polute, and that if they had to bear these additional costs then they would choose not to polute (i.e. they polute because there is no cost directly payable by themselves). Or did I really misunderstand totally&#160;?
<ul>
<li>Of course proof of either primary causation or secondary exacerbation then gets important as one would need to calculate both the overall 'cost' of asthma to society and then the proportion attributable to polution, and then to each type of polution/poluter. I agree with the sentiment, but its very politically contentious, difficult to write about in a NPOV, <b>and exceeds what one can reasonably fit into an article about a single disease.... so....</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If my understanding is correct, then this issue of your second sentance needs to move a sentance forwards to the end of the paragraph.</li>
<li>I wonder if you think it would be better to give a non-jargon (ie get rid of the word 'externalities') but <i>brief</i> overview of this issue, linking as approapriate to other articles that deal with this subject more fully (and also a more appropriate location for that word).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You are obviously better versed in socioeconomic terms than myself, but the pages I could locate on a quick search were: <a href="../../../h/e/a/Health_disparities.html" title="Health disparities">Health disparities</a>, <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_inequality.html" title="Economic inequality">Economic inequality</a> particularly the 'Effects of Inequality - Population Health' section and <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_expectancy.html" title="Life expectancy">Life expectancy</a>. Of course this sort of discussion includes far more than just asthma, with rates of smoking, heart disease, infant mortality, life expectance all notable. As a doctor, I think back to discussions given at Medical School about these issues in my <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medical_sociology.html" title="Medical sociology">Medical sociology</a> lectures, however this seems a small stub of an article.Whilst all these articles make some mention of social factors, is the real issue that wikipedia is missing a single article that puts 'socioeconomic effects on health' all together as an issue&#160;?

<p>I recently posted on the asthma page regarding OTC epinephrine inhaler use. You state that epinephrine when given via inhaler results in increased cardiac side effects, but this is not true if the medication is used in an appropriate manner. I refer to a study published last year: [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=16400891&amp;dopt=Abstract" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=16400891&amp;dopt=Abstract" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>] Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol. 2005 Dec;95(6):530-4 Newer medications for relief are of course more selective, but to my knowledge, if used properly epinephrine via inhaler does not result in increased cardiac effects as a result of its selectivity. Please let me know your opinion on the matter. Thank you for your time. '--Iamahalfer 02:58, 19 May 2006 (UTC)'</p>

<li>Interesting, that single study indeed suggested less effect on heart rate, although seemed less helpful/larger doses needed as <i>"6 patients were symptom free after 14 cumulative actuations of epinephrine compared with 6 cumulative actuations of albuterol."</i>.</li>
<li>A (quick) search of PubMed showed that whilst that study included 8 patients in a cross-over study, there is a metanalaysis of 6 studies (161 adults and 121 children and adolescents) that found <i>"there were no differences in heart rate and Pao(2) between treatments. CONCLUSIONS: There was no statistically significant benefit of nebulized adrenaline over salbutamol or terbutaline in the treatment of children and adults with moderate-severe acute asthma."</i>

<li>So issues of long-term use, duration of action etc would need to be compared to draw any conclusions over the merits of epinephrine over other agents. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 10:48, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I might add that salbutamol (as used in UK), was until fairly recently available over the counter without prescription, but this was changed as a minority of people (asthmatics &amp; non-asthmatcs) were abusing the drug, becoming dependant upon the "buzz" they obtained on taking high doses. Furthermore routine salbutamol use alone is not generally considered to reduce the incidence of deaths from severe asthma attacks (incidence dropped for use routine steroid inhallers) or reduce presence of morbidity (it may reduce wheeziness for 6 hours at a time, but that accepts that a patient gets wheezy upto 4 times a day, has to stop what they are doing to take salbutamol and feel unwell for the 20-30mins it takes to work - better never to get wheezy in the first place with preventative twice daily steroid inhallers). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 11:41, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>HERE IS MY RESPONSE:</p>
<p>You wrote: <i>Interesting, that single study indeed suggested less effect on heart rate, although seemed less helpful/larger doses needed as "6 patients were symptom free after 14 cumulative actuations of epinephrine compared with 6 cumulative actuations of albuterol."</i></p>
<ul>
<li>What I find interesting about that statement is that even with 14 cumulative actuations of epi as compared to 6 with albuterol, epinephrine still resulted in less cardiac symptoms.</li>
<li>The meta-analysis you linked to also showed there was no difference between pulmonary function or cardiac symptoms.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>---“The pooled data showed no significant difference in pulmonary function between both drugs.”</i></p>
<p><i>---“Thus, data from this review did not show any significant difference in heart rate between groups.”''</i></p>
<ul>
<li>I do agree that inhaled epi or inhaled salbutamol, when available OTC, could result in abuse and neither product should be used as a preventative medication for asthma. However, in the asthma article on wikipedia they are listed under the relief medication category, which is appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>My problem is with the statement: “Cardiac side effects, although uncommon, occur more often with these less selective drugs.” That is not supported by current studies (including the link I posted and the meta-analysis you posted), which is why I attempted to adjust that.</p>
<p>My other concern is with this statement: “They also provide a shorter period of relief than the selective bronchodilators.” This statement is 100% correct if it is in reference to Salbutamol/Epinephrine being used as a maintainence/preventer medication, and in that case duration is hugely important. However, when being used as a rescue/reliever medication to abort an acute asthma attack, both drugs equally/fully resolve the attack, which makes the duration inconsequetial as the acute attack has been resolved.</p>
<p>Those two statements were my reason for posting. If my original wording was inappropriate let me know because I would love to try again. Let me know what you think. --Iamahalfer 17:55, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is the wrong article for such a section. This article is already longer than normal and I suspect such an section may lead to a merger. The place for any comparision between cats and mankind in relation to members of each species being said to have asthma (whatever you mean by "asthma") is an article about cats or animals with asthma or bronchitis. Humans can be regarded as animals: Not all animals can be regarded as human. If the word "asthmatic" has been applied to cats (or come to think of it americans) then I expect that only happend long after it had been first applied to humans and therefore using the word "asthma" should promt comparision with the human condition &amp; n as part of the human condition.

<p>It seems to me that the article is perhaps lacking some up-to-date information about airway remodelling, which is currently viewed as a very important aspect of asthma. I see that the only two references regarding Remodelling date from 2002 and 2003, respectivelly, which might be a bit outdated.</p>
<p>Tang, et al, say in June 2006: "These include epithelial hyperplasia and metaplasia, subepithelial fibrosis, muscle cell hyperplasia and angiogenesis. These structural changes result in thickening of the airway wall, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and a progressive irreversible loss of lung function.", in Pharmacol Ther</p>
<p>In the same month, Prescott states: "there is also evidence that airway inflammation and early remodelling can progress in a subclinical state. New studies suggest that early airway damage is irreversible and that subsequent lung function is 'set' in the first years of life.", in Paediatr Respir Rev</p>
<p><br />
(I'd also like to point out that there seems to be no consensus in the literature whether it is remodeLing with one L, or remodeLLing with two. Is this a case of UK vs US?)83.132.98.149 03:09, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The reference to the greek 'aazein' should be removed completely from the encyclopedia article as '"asthma"' is defined in english (a language that did not exist in ancient times) &amp; the term was coined only after WWII as far as I know.

<p>I read several claims of monitoring exhaled NO (eNO) being useful for adjustment of drug dosage and prediction of asthma crises. eNO measurement is a technique known from environmental science and since '99 applied to lung inflammation detection, monitoring etc.. Probably the best known device for asthma eNO measurement is the Aerocrine MINO, which is offered to professionals substituting a part of the spirometry.</p>
<p>Would it be useful to mention this methods? It would highlight the cause of asthma (inflammation) compared to the current focus on the symptoms (as assessed by PEF or spirometry). Since I'm not an MD and english is not my mother tongue, I will leave the decisison and execution to the experts.</p>
<p>OUTSTANDING: I am very impressed with this article. I sometimes have disagreements with Wikipedia but than Wikipedia has moments of sheer genius. The articles about Hungarian are also first class.</p>

<dd>Alec, stop being disruptive please and take a careful look at all those tags at the top of this talk page. Asthma is well regarded as an article - it has been <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_91e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review">Wikipedia:Peer_reviewed</a> and awarded <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">Wikipedia:Featured_articles</a> status, meaning it has been identified as one of the best articles produced by the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedians_0c31.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedians">Wikipedia community</a>. It was a featured article on the <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a> in October, has been selected as one of the best articles on the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Portal%7EMedicine_91c0.html" title="Portal:Medicine">Medicine Portal</a>.

<p><s><a href="../../../r/e/g/User%7ERegan123_9441.html" title="User:Regan123">User:Regan123</a></s> It has been proposed merging <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asthma_medication.html" title="Asthma medication">Asthma medication</a> into this Asthma article.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b> - Asthma medication not only covers the exact same topics, but is rather less detailled than that already covered in <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asthma.html" title="Asthma">Asthma</a>. Indeed it makes some unsubstantiated claims and I doubt anything much will actually need be added across.<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 03:59, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Just to clarify I have not made a proposal to merge the articles. The tag for merge into was here and I simply added the merge to tag on the other page.

<dd>Just did the redirection for <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asthma_medication.html" title="Asthma medication">Asthma medication</a>. I think it's a waste of resources to go through <a href="../../../a/f/d/AfD_0ef6.html" title="AfD">AfD</a>.

<dd>This list seems to be nonsense and un-encyclopaedic. Asthma is not an awful lot of things, but we don't need to specify everything (eg its not cancer, vascular nor psychiatric).

<p>This is a condition characterized by coughing, wheezing and chest tightness that occurs 5-8 minutes into strenuous exercise. These symptoms can be exacerbated by cold temperatures or a polluted environment. Treatment usually centers around Beta<sub>2</sub> agonist inhalation therapy. Two common ones are the short-acting Albuterol 2 puffs 15 minutes prior to exercise and the long-acting Salmeterol 2 puffs 30 minutes prior to exercise. For persons who find difficulty in using an inhaler, leukotriene inhibitors are beneficial when taken at least 1 hour prior to exercise. DrCarter12 16:48, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The study showed that children in the high ozone communities who played three or more sports developed asthma at a rate three times higher than those in the low ozone communities. Because participation in some sports can result in a child drawing up to 17 times the “normal” amount of air into the lungs, young athletes are more likely to develop asthma.</p>

<p>That text has been reinserted as your personal opinion is irrelavent and this text has been removed as it is unsourced</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another theory is based on the correlation of <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_pollution.html" title="Air pollution">air pollution</a> and the incidence of asthma. Although it is well known that substantial exposures to certain industrial chemicals can cause acute asthmatic episodes, it has not been proven that air pollution is responsible for the development of asthma. In <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Europe_1e16.html" title="Western Europe">Western Europe</a>, most atmospheric pollutants have fallen significantly over the last 40 years, while the prevalence of asthma has risen.</p>
