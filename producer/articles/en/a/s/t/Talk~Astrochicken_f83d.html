<p>Astrochicken was placed on VfD, and was properly voted on for <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Astrochicken_faef.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Astrochicken">deletion</a>. In fact, I was one of those who voted for deletion. However, I now feel that I voted improperly, and that other voters may not have had very good information on the subject. Astrochicken is the name given to a theoretical unmanned spaceship, one of the many fascinating notions of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freeman_Dyson_c83a.html" title="Freeman Dyson">Freeman Dyson</a>. It is interesting that, while ( astrochicken dyson ) seems to get very few Google hits, the notion is discussed in numerous books and at a number of important space-related websites. I think it is notable, and deserves a place on Wikipedia. At the very least, I would like to suggest the possibility that the page be undeleted so that a merge and redirect to Dyson's page can be considered. Thank you. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func"><tt>func</tt></a><a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunc_0951.html" title="User talk:Func"><tt>(talk)</tt></a> 15:04, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Func could you provide us with some links to the important space related websites? It would help us decide if it really is notable after all.

<p>Outside of Freeman's own books, such as <i>Infinite in All Directions</i> and <i>From Eros to Gaia</i>, I encountered his astrochicken in <i>Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey Through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the 10th Dimension</i>, written by <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michio_Kaku_913c.html" title="Michio Kaku">Michio Kaku</a>. On the Internet, a number of "bloggers" (such as at <a href="http://www.transterrestrial.com" class="external free" title="http://www.transterrestrial.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.transterrestrial.com</a>) and newsgroup users refer to Dyson's astrochicken. I also believe that many other things which are called "astrochicken", (like characters in video games, the names of certain webservers), were possibly inspired by Dyson's astrochicken. I offer this link as possible evidence for this: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Paris/8926/kiting.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/Paris/8926/kiting.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/Paris/8926/kiting.html</a></p>
<p>Something else I wanted to try online was a periodical search, could I couldn't find one on the Internet that doesn't require a subscription.&#160;:(</p>
<p>The overall evidence is scant, I grant you, but let me put it another way: any student, researcher, or reporter who would want to know about Dyson's fascinating ideas would definitely be missing out if they never got to hear about his extraordinary astrochicken.&#160;:)</p>

<li>No vote - The deleted article is short and fantasy. The inventor/fiction writer's quote (taken from the deleted article) says it all: <b>Dyson says <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dujs/2001F/fromspacetravel.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dujs/2001F/fromspacetravel.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, that "this is really a joke, and not a serious scientifc proposal."</b> - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">Tεx</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User_talk%7ETexture_2199.html" title="User talk:Texture"><font color="blue">τ</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">urε</font></a> 17:38, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My personal feeling about this quote was that Dyson may have received some "flack" for choosing such a whimsical name. He took/takes the notion of biological-inspired spaceflight quite seriously. In choosing a name like "astrochicken", I think he may have felt some need to let his friends in the scientific community know that he hadn't gone off the deep end into pseudo-science. He discusses asrtochicken in (at least) two of his own books, without hinting at any believe on his part that it is a "joke" notion. At the very least, others have taken the ideas underlying astrochicken very seriously. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func"><tt>func</tt></a><a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunc_0951.html" title="User talk:Func"><tt>(talk)</tt></a> 18:55, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<li>Which books? Fiction or non-fiction? If fiction then no one would expect otherwise.

<li>Non-fiction books, which are collections of his essays. I listed them above: <i>Infinite in All Directions</i> and <i>From Eros to Gaia</i>. When I get home, I can give you some direct quotes from them, as well as from Michio Kaku's <i>Hyperspace</i>. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func"><tt>func</tt></a><a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunc_0951.html" title="User talk:Func"><tt>(talk)</tt></a> 20:26, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>To further address some of Texture's concerns, (jeeze, this is a lot of work for me&#160;;-) ), Dyson, (who is a theoretical physicist, btw, not a fiction author), wrote a book called <i>Disturbing the Universe</i>, copyright 1979. In it, he describes a <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thought_experiment.html" title="Thought experiment">thought experiment</a> concerning how humanity could build small, self-replicating <i>automata</i> that could explore space more efficiently than manned craft could. He actually attributes the general idea to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_von_Neumann_321b.html" title="John von Neumann">John von Neumann</a>, based on a lecture Neumann gave in 1948 entitled <i>The General and Logical Theory of Automata</i>. Dyson basically expanded on Neumann's "robot" theories and added a biological-like spin to them. The term "astrochicken", however, does not occur in this work. You can read how the term was invented in the pdf file that Texture references above, basically, someone called the phrase out at a lecture Dyson was giving. Subsequently, Dyson used the term in his later books, as have others like <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michio_Kaku_913c.html" title="Michio Kaku">Michio Kaku</a>, for the Neumann/Dyson self-replicating automata theory. From Kaku's <i>Hyperspace</i>: "Small, lightweight, and intelligent, Astrochicken is a versatile space probe that has a clear advantage over the bulky, exorbitantly expensive space missions of the past, which have been a bottleneck to space exploration. ... It will not need huge quantities of rocket fuel; it will be bred and programmed to 'eat' ice and hydrocarbons found in the rings surrounding the outer planets".</li>

<li>Undelete. Func has made a case for the topic's notability.

<p>I believe that the article is notable and worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia, but I wanted to address what I said in my undeletion proposal, "<i>At the very least, I would like to suggest the possibility that the page be undeleted so that a merge and redirect to Dyson's page can be considered</i>". If others feel that a merge of the article's contents should occur, I would welcome discussing the matter, here or on my talk page. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func"><tt>func</tt></a><a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunc_0951.html" title="User talk:Func"><tt>(talk)</tt></a> 17:32, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does anyone know enough about microsattelites to write an article? In analogy to <i>astrochickens</i> chip sized microsattelites intended for self replication would be <i>spaceflies</i>. I assume for such small devices there are a whole lot of possibilities not acessible to astrochicken, such as changing its orientation by shifting electrical charges while flying through a magnetic field.</p>

<dd>Has anyone published anything about spaceflies before? If not, writing about them in Wikipedia would probably violate the <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy; we're not supposed to come up with new ideas here, just describe existing ones. A quick Googling seems to only turn up references to a series of computer games by <a href="http://www.egosoft.com/news/current_en.php" class="external text" title="http://www.egosoft.com/news/current_en.php" rel="nofollow">Egosoft</a> that contains things called "spaceflies", but of course Google doesn't know everything. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 20:00, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not that I knew, not as such. But microsattelites doesn't seem to fall under that restriction. If they were subsequently used as spaceflies, so what? By the way, saying <i>"we're not supposed to come up with new ideas here"</i> is a very remarkable paraphrase for NOR.&#160;;-) 84.160.251.15 22:34, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're right that microsatellites don't count as original research, they're an established technology and the term "microsatellite" is commonly used to refer to them. They're covered over at <a href="../../../m/i/n/Miniaturized_satellites.html" title="Miniaturized satellites">miniaturized satellites</a> and I just added a disambig notice to <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsatellite.html" title="Microsatellite">microsatellite</a> to direct people there. However, <i>self-replicating</i> microsatellites are an "original idea" if there isn't any significant preexisting work on them that can be referenced in writing an article about them. And if nobody's used the term "spacefly" to refer to them then we'd be making up the term as well. Do you know of anyone who's written about these sorts of self-replicating machines before? I've got Freitas and Merkel's <i>Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines</i> <a href="http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> at home, so I can go rummaging for references in a bit. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 23:54, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for the link. I couldn't find it myself because I was mentally stuck on <i>micro</i>satellites with a mass far less than 1kg, on the maximum mass of a cell phone or even one-chip structures.</dd>
<dd>At the moment nothing like that can be found on the internet which seems fairly odd, so I think a precautionary <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">NOR</a> warning is due:</dd>
<dd>Do not assume that anyone before has had the idea of further reducing the mass of satellites so that they could benefit from the greately enlarged surface / mass ratio, thus using new or previously unefficient ways to change orinetation and trajectory (especially on long time long way scale <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_sail.html" title="Solar sail">solar sail</a>), using the heat difference between "dayside" and (very nearby) "nightside" (see <a href="../../../p/e/l/Peltier-Seebeck_effect_e1a3.html" title="Peltier-Seebeck effect">Peltier-Seebeck effect</a>) for the generation of electric energy, using this energy to generate a magnetic field in analogy with <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnetic_sail.html" title="Magnetic sail">magnetic sails</a>, using (permanent) ferromagneticity to space-assemble such satellites into larger structures, the magnetism dosed week enough that it can be overruled by actively generated magnetism to separate the parts again, ....., please do not think of this because this would all be new ideas</dd>
<dd>&#160;;-) .... sorry, couldn't help this.</dd>
<dd>Sending <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warble_fly.html" title="Warble fly">flies</a> to <a href="../../../i/o/_/Io_%28moon%29.html" title="Io (moon)">Io</a> is <b>not</b> a new idea as <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hera.html#Io" title="Hera">Hera</a> did it before.</dd>
