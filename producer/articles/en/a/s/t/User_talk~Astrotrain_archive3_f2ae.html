<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:HMAS Sydney.jpg</b>. I notice the image page currently doesn't specify who created the image, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is therefore unclear. If you have not created the image yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the image on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the image yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the image also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture then you can use {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}} to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>.

(I'd actually wondered if the lack of them in British royalty articles was intentional or not!) I've been having a bit of trouble with discussing this (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:R.D.H._%28Ghost_In_The_Machine%29#Reversion_of_Edits_to_Richard_O.27Connor" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:R.D.H._%28Ghost_In_The_Machine%29#Reversion_of_Edits_to_Richard_O.27Connor" rel="nofollow">and other issues</a>) with key contributors to O'Connor, or the idea that a policy is desirable.

<dd>I can't see any discussion on the issue in relation to British Royality. I tidied many of the British Royality articles recently and removed honours in the lead sentence to a Titles and Honours section at the bottom of the page, however looking back, I see that has been reveresed! I am all for removing the post nominals, as they mess up the articles and are confusing to first time readers. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 23:07, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I also do not like them in lead sentences—but I can't speak for British people, and it sounds like there is consensus that "British" topics use British spellings...so maybe this is another one of those kinds of issues. I'd just like it if the Manual of Style had something to say about it. If it says there's no convention and we don't need one...well, I guess whoever has the most willpower in reverting wins! If you know others who'd be interested then invite them along to discuss...thanks! <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetaeducation_c35a.html" title="User:Metaeducation">Metaeducation</a> 23:19, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree. You make a very good point. I was in two minds about it. I was interested to hear your observations on it and I think your argument makes perfect sense. I suppose though we should try to get a larger debate going. It could be rather controversial if implemented without a full discussion.

<p>Hi mate,</p>
<p>You may remember the war on <a href="../../../s/t/y/Style_%28manner_of_address%29.html" title="Style (manner of address)">styles</a> that was waged some time ago and the eventual compromise reached which meant that styles (Holiness, Majesty, Royal Highness, etc) are no longer used at the start in royalty articles. A series of templates were created to enable users to warn other users who attempt to reinsert styles into articles that that is no longer WP policy. However a user who is trying to get a whole series of templates deleted has nominated them on the <a href="../../../t/f/d/WP%7ETFD_eab7.html" title="WP:TFD">WP:TFD</a> for deletion. I am thoroughly fed up having to defend necessary templates from the minority of deletion police on WP who seem to act as a group: one nominates, then the rest all vote to agree with them. All help to defend the necessary templates in the <i>styles</i> series gratefully received.

<p>You amended the Politics section of the Scotland article re the need for Sewel motions. My earlier edit had indicated that Private Members' Bills which relate to devolved matters require Sewel motions. Your subsequent edit (in the summary) indicated that Westminster Bills do not require such motions, and stated that the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunday_Working_%28Scotland%29_Act_2003_61b2.html" title="Sunday Working (Scotland) Act 2003">Sunday Working (Scotland) Act 2003</a> had not required one. We were, in fact, both partly correct and partly in error. Private Members' Bills at Westminster which relate to devolved matters invoke the Sewel convention as much as Government bills do. The problem with the text of the article, which I had not picked up, is that the Sunday Working (Scotland) Act 2003 does not relate to devolved matters - it amends the Employment Rights Act 1996, the subject-matter of which is squarely reserved by the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland_Act_1998_07e7.html" title="Scotland Act 1998">Scotland Act 1998</a>.

<p>Time for you to put your foot down somewhat here, I think. Some person is insisting on including assertions based on Kitty Kelley, on the basis that they are published and therefore bona fide sources. Not necessarily so, of course. Please see my observations in the discussion. There are needless to say plenty of legitimate qualifications of the almost universal praise the Queen Mother received; it is not necessary to include scurrility. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 07:29, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Crown copyright is not at all the same thing as public domain. Crown copyright is just as restrictive as normal copyright in Australia, it just has a shorter duration.

<p>Thanks for uploading <b><a href="../../../a/r/a/Image%7EARA_Belgrano_sinking.jpg_4dc5.html" title="Image:ARA Belgrano sinking.jpg">Image:ARA Belgrano sinking.jpg</a></b>. I notice the image page currently doesn't specify who created the image, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is therefore unclear. If you have not created the image yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the image on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the image yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the image also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture then you can use {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}} to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the image qualifies as fair use, please read <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>.

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>A user just changed the opening of <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diana%2C_Princess_of_Wales_d703.html" title="Diana, Princess of Wales">Diana, Princess of Wales</a> to refer to her as <i>Diana Spencer</i>. To be honest I have been thinking that that needs to be done for a long time. It is crazy that Diana, as a (former) royal consort, is <i>still</i> at her death name when others who died subsequently have long since reverted to the standard royal biographical format of maiden name. It isn't as if we can even use the <i>most common name</i> rule to justify it given that far more people would use the non-existent <i>Princess Diana</i> than D,P o W. In addition, D, P o W lapsed as a style on her death. I'd be interested to hear your views before formally proposing it. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 20:35, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As you can see from Category:Philately by country, there are lots of such articles already, but normally I don't create them for short writeups like this one. BTW, one of the things that happens when you delete text with image references in them is that the images can become orphaned, and with the current strict policies on fair use, all orphaned fair-use images are deleted, usually within a few days. So you very nearly caused a number of image deletions too. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 23:27, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As for your question on what continent BIOT is attached to, I came to pick Africa for two reasons. As you know, the nations that BIOT was created are the Seychelles and Mauritius. These nations are generaly thought of as being African.

<blockquote>
<p><i>The Chagossians originally came from Mozambique, Madagascar, Senegal and southern India. The descendants of slaves, they worked on the coconut plantations and made a living trading in copra, a lamp oil derived from coconuts and a sought-after commodity on Mauritius and in the Seychelles. Indeed, the Chagos Islands were also known as the "Oil Islands."</i></p>

<dd>In most of the european countries we have something called <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_speech.html" title="Freedom of speech">freedom of speech</a>. It took us some centuries to get rid of the censorship power of the religion (in this case the Christian religion) and gain <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_speech.html" title="Freedom of speech">freedom of speech</a>. Now everyone is free to say and write what he thinks, and <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satire.html" title="Satire">satire</a> is a form of free speech. We have some problems here in Italy with people trying to censor satire, but it is one of the sign of the democracy and freedom of a state. I shouldn't answer you in the first place because you are probably a troll, but I think you should respect at least the right of other people to say what they want. Then if you don't agree, you shouldn't boycott or kill or use violence to impose your point of view. This applies to what is happening now in the muslim community, but the Americans did the same thing when France and Germany didn't want to invade Iraq; they tried to boycott them and impose their point of view with violence. Pay attention to what you are doing, you are acting very similar to the same people you commend. --<a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiandrea_d865.html" title="User:Giandrea">giandrea</a> 02:23, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I had removed the seat 1a claim mainly because I thought it took up a disproportionate amount of space (almost half the paragraph on the documentary) for an assertion that was patent rubbish (although of course the tutor did say it which they shouldn't have). I have now summarised. Hope that is OK. Also put a comment on Ryanair talk page. -- <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlorg_b615.html" title="User:Blorg">Blorg</a> 21:03, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Astrotrain, the image Image:Kingcrown.jpg has had its copyright status disputed; see Image talk:Kingcrown.jpg. The image is clearly acceptable under fair use for the articles it appears in, but really shouldn't be used in a template. Can you think of a different image that might be used? Thanks. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 22:38, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've now replaced the image with another image, a PD engraving of the same crown that was there before. Is this an acceptable short-term solution until we can come up with a free color picture that would work?

My reasoning is that they are now officially called "British overseas territories" per the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Overseas_Territories_Act_2002_bae5.html" title="British Overseas Territories Act 2002">British Overseas Territories Act 2002</a>, plus it sounds good, is quicker to type and read, and this wording wins the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Googlefight.html" title="Googlefight">Googlefight</a> handily. There were dozens of synonyms, some of them in wide use because of history, some others useless; I did my best to sort them and fix a few pages with redundant links to the same concept under different names in "see also" sections.

<p>Hi, just looking through the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_of_Pakistan_91a0.html" title="Military of Pakistan">Military of Pakistan</a> article and it's daughter articles, I noticed there were two templates in use of which you created one in August 2005. A new larger template is now being used which includes the links to the daughter articles. Would you be bothered if I ask for your template to be deleted? <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen_Giant_e03e.html" title="User:Green Giant">Green Giant</a> 05:17, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
