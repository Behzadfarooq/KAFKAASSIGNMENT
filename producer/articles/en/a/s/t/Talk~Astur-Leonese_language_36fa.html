<p>No one in León speaks the Leonese language, it is largely an invention of those who seek greater political autonomy for León and to break away from Castile. I believe this article gives the false impression that it is a genuine spoken language.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The language is NOT an invention. It exists, and has been spoken for a very limited extent during centuries, specially in the mountain regions of León. Now it's true that Leonese autonomists have greatly exaggerated the importance of Leonese and to a certain extent distorted history: I'm a Leonese and Leonese language is not my heritage, the language of my ancestors for generations has been Castillian. But Leonese IS a genuine language, if quite almost dead. (UNSIGNED)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'd also like to add that while many do not pay attention to the claims of those seeking greater political autonomy for the province/city, there is an increasing impact on youth.--<a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EEleuthero_444b.html" title="User:Eleuthero">eleuthero</a> 06:08, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article doesn't directly define the title. Asturian is one of the languages in the Asturian-Leonese branch, as well as Mirandese. Saying that Asturian is official in Portugal under the name Mirandese makes as much sense as saying that Mirandese is unnoficial in Spain and known under the name Asturian. The correct would be to either name this article Asturo-Leonese/Leonese or erasing/adapting the Mirandese and Leonese parts of it.</p>
<p><br />
Leonese is NOT an invention and it is NOT almost dead as some of you say. Still some leonese writers publish books in the leonese langauge. In some part of the north of Leon, where I come from, even young people learn and speak daily the leonese lanaguage even though most of them do not even release or do it constantly. My parents spoke leonese which then they tough me and that is the same way I will teach my sons. A recent study of the language in the north of Leon done by the Asturian Language Academy states that still about 30.000 people use leonese daily and even a bigger amount use it mixed with castillian.</p>
<p>Well, 30,000 speakers out of well over a million, that's what I call almost dead. <a href="../../../u/n/o/User%7EUnoffensive_text_or_character_9c05.html" title="User:Unoffensive text or character">Unoffensive text or character</a> 09:42, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/t/Talk%7EAstur-Leonese_language_36fa.html" title="Edit section: Proposed rename and merge">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Proposed rename and merge</span></h2>
<p>I propose to (a) merge <a href="../../../m/i/r/Mirandese_language.html" title="Mirandese language">Mirandese language</a> here, as a sub-section of a new "Dialects" section; and then (b) move this article to "Astur-Leonese language".</p>
<p><b>Rationale</b>: This article is called "Asturian language" but apparently covers "Astur-Leonese", including Leonese and Mirandese. The differences between the three languages seem to be small, and many sources consider them dialects of the same language.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="../../../m/i/r/Mirandese_language.html" title="Mirandese language">Mirandese language</a> article that claims significant differences from Asturian, but judging from <a href="../../../m/i/r/Talk%7EMirandese_language_4a57.html" title="Talk:Mirandese language">Talk:Mirandese language</a> the evidence is hard to come by.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonese_language.html" title="Leonese language">Leonese language</a> article was just a stub with no significant info, so I already made it into a redirect to the present article.</p>
<p>The merge would concentrate the scarce edit efforts, reduce duplication of information, and give readers a better view of the whole branch. Also, it seems unlikely that separate Mirandese and Leonese articles will grow to a size comparable to that of Asturian any time soon.</p>
<p>Given its present contents, and assuming <a href="../../../m/i/r/Mirandese_language.html" title="Mirandese language">Mirandese language</a> is merged into it, the name "Astur-Leonese language" is more accurate than "Asturian language".</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>No</b> Mirandese is an officialy recognised language of Portual. Astur-Leonese is not a language it is a language group. No matter how small the differences in your 'opinion' one is an officialy recognised language, the other is not.</dd>
<dd><b>Maybe</b>. If an english-speaking country stops legally recognizing english, that doesn't magically make the local english dialect not english. Furthermore, if you look on the <a href="http://ast.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portada" class="external text" title="http://ast.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portada" rel="nofollow">Asturian wikipedia</a>, you can see at the top that it includes Mirandese. From this and the opinions/research of others, I believe Mirandese should be considered a dialect.</dd>
<dd><i>However</i>, there are examples on our own Wikipedia where the same language is listed differently for political reasons. The example I'm thinking of is <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian_language.html" title="Romanian language">Romanian language</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/l/Moldovan_language.html" title="Moldovan language">Moldovan language</a> (they're the same language!!!) The Moldovan language page explicitly states that fact, however. Here's what I suggest. Either:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Merge the two, if the combined article is not too long and is unlikely to become too long.</li>
<li>Keep them separate, and <i>explicitly</i> state that Mirandese is a dialect of the Asturian language, recognized differently for political reasons.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Those are my thoughts. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka"><font color="red">Grand</font></a><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrandmasterka_5f38.html" title="User talk:Grandmasterka"><font color="blue">master</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grandmasterka_b497.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grandmasterka"><font color="green">ka</font></a> 16:36, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>No</b>, keep seperate. Considering that I decided that I should come back after seeing this discussion, it's odd that I'd forget about it. The Ethnologue counts Mirandese and Asturian as two seperate languages, but Moldovan as an alternate name for Romanian. They don't even count Serbian and Croatian as seperate languages, so there must be a reason for counting Mirandese as seperate. And considering the history Spain, I think I can see it. The gradual <i>Reconquista</i> brought the Christian settlers into the valleys slowly over time, with a number of petty states in the mountains. Mountain regions historically, though not always, tend to isolate by valley, as happened with the five original spanish dialects as they were brought south.--<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuintucket_ce2b.html" title="User:Quintucket">Quintucket</a> 00:57, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>That's not exactly true. Ethnologue has a separate section for Mirandese, but says that there are asturian-speakers in Portugal, in Miranda do Douro. Actually, looking at Portugal section, you could think that both Portuguese, Asturian and Mirandese are different languages spoken in Miranda do Douro, what is obviously a mistake of the Ethnologue Base. Anyway, it could be interesting to maintain a separate article for Mirandese, as some speakers think this is, for political and historical reasons, a separate language from Asturian (this doesn't occur with Leonese). But that's only because of political and ortographical reasons, and is not the opinion of the majority of philological studies. This case is similar to <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galician.html" title="Galician">Galician</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese.html" title="Portuguese">Portuguese</a> one, but in a different historical stadium. However, Asturian speakers feel Mirandese as the same language and probably some Mirandese speakers do the same (in fact, Asturian and Mirandese wikipedia is the same one), so it would be important to give a global view in both articles, if both are kept. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuestia_cd22.html" title="User:Guestia">Guestia</a> 15:56, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>No</b>. Mirandese is co-official (by law) in that small region of northern Portugal and the article must be kept separate because it is specific to Portugal. I must also remember that the language is known there as Mirandese, not Asturian.</li>
<li><b>No</b>. I agree with <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuintucket_ce2b.html" title="User:Quintucket">Quintucket</a>. If Mirandese is mostly considered a separate language, it must to be kept in a separate article.

<li><b>Yes.</b> Hello, I am Portuguese. I hope I'm not too late to the conversation. First, some information, for those who can read Portuguese: here is the <a href="http://www.avogacia.org/w3/article.php3?id_article=107" class="external text" title="http://www.avogacia.org/w3/article.php3?id_article=107" rel="nofollow">piece of legislation</a> which recognized Mirandese as a language in Portugal. It does not say anything about it being an official language, but allows the teaching and the promotion of Mirandese in the regions where it is spoken, as well as its use in public offices (does <i>this</i> make it official?...) It also says nothing at all about the relation between Mirandese and Asturo-Leonese. Now for my opinion: I am in favour of a merger. It is true that the situation of Mirandese and Asturo-Mirandese is similar to the relation between Galician and Portuguese, but there are also important differences:
<ul>
<li>With Portuguese and Galician, you have a language that is official in a state, and another that is regional in another state. But Asturo-Leonese is not recongized at all by the Spanish state, I believe.</li>
<li>Portuguese and Galician have official institutions that set their orthography, their vocabulary, etc., and which, in the case of Galician, define the two as separate languages. Asturo-Leonese and Mirandese do not. Although a committee of linguists has come up with an orthography for Mirandese when it was recognized, I don't think they have any official authority. As far as I know, no institution has officially declared that Asturo-Leonese and Mirandese are separate languages.</li>
<li>Mirandese is very clearly related to Asturo-Leonese, and is spoken in a very small area. Asturo-Leonese itself is spoken in a modest area. It saves space to discuss them together. Needless to say, the merged article should have <b>separate sections</b> for each. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilipeS_f1e1.html" title="User:FilipeS">FilipeS</a> 15:54, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>NO</b><a href="../../../m/i/r/Mirandese_language.html" title="Mirandese language">Mirandese language</a> requires a sepearte entity as it is a recognized minority language of Portugal216.95.23.169 19:39, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>NO</b> I am a Mirandese, and I am planing to further improve the article on Mirandese soon. I would agree to a merge in some kind of <b>Astur-leonese</b> article. Mirandese, like Asturian, can be seen as one of the dialects in Astur-leonese. <b>Not</b> as an Asturian sub-dialect. I have been countless times in Asturias and the differences to their dialects are quite big. There's often no mutual inter-comprehension, and even if that's not a decisive characteristic when defining languages' areas, it just proves how wrong it would be to include Mirandese in the Asturian branch of Astur-leonese dialects. To FilipeS, Mirandese <b>is</b> recognized as an official language, even if its use is given a geographical limit. The 1st article in the 7/99 law reads as: "This diploma means to recognize and promote the Mirandese language". I really cannot see how this could be abiguous. Either way, when people mention Mirandese they are <b>never</b> reffering to a wider group of astur-leonese dialects: "mirandese" is itself a denomination that isolates the Astur-leonese dialects spoken in Portugal (and never the Asturian dialects). Further connection with a page about Astur-leonese dialects would be welcomed though.</p>

<p>It was used a lot of time ago but, at least in the entire province in Salamanca is not used anymore. Maybe a little in the northern provinces of Spain, and the Castile-León community.</p>
<p>Be careful with some opinions. They could be only for politicals purposals (there is a political party that claims for a "Païs Llionés" but of course here in Salamanca they cannot say that, nobody would understand them&#160;:)).

However, I didn't choose Etnologue as a source because of its bibliography, but because it's very used in Wikipedia (although it has a lot of errors, because of its enormous database) to take information on languages, especially on small ones. And yes, Etnologue's source it's Federico Fierro Botas (who was a jesuist priest involved in asturian language promotion) but that's not the primary source. They're taken from Llera Ramo, F. (1994) <i>Los Asturianos y la Lengua Asturiana: Estudio Sociolingüístico para Asturias-1991</i>. Oviedo: Consejería de Educación y Cultura del Principado de Asturias, a book with the results of a sociolinguistic study made by Asturian Administration (yes, Llera Ramo too is involved in Asturian language promotion, but he's also the director of Euskobarometro, a basque public institution of social studies). There's a more recent study, organized too by the Asturian government, Llera, Francisco J. y San Martín, Pablo (2003) <i>Segundo Estudio Sociolingüístico de Asturias</i>, Uviéu, Academia de la Llingua Asturiana, but I haven't got it here to consult. If you have the data of this study, we can put more recent data. But these numbers of 1991 seems to be the more accepted ones, not only by those "involved in the promotion of asturian" but also by recognised international institutions. Besides the Etnologue database, some examples are Mercator Education <a href="http://www1.fa.knaw.nl/mercator/regionale_dossiers/PDFs/asturian_in_spain.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www1.fa.knaw.nl/mercator/regionale_dossiers/PDFs/asturian_in_spain.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (part of a european network on information of minoritized languages, directed by the Fryske Akademy in the Netherlands) or Euromosaic <a href="http://www.uoc.edu/euromosaic/web/document/asturia/an/i1/i1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uoc.edu/euromosaic/web/document/asturia/an/i1/i1.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> (a project of the European Comission). However, I can accept, quoting the last web, that "these data has to be interpreted with care: the diglossic condition of Asturian generates different situations which are difficult to fit into a survey". But there's no POV with no other data of such acceptability in specialized studies. If you find one, we could (we should) put both. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuestia_cd22.html" title="User:Guestia">Guestia</a> 21:45, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't really like how this paragraph it's written. But I must say it is because it's unofficial (not only, but this is one of the causes). Danger of disappearing is a situation where languages ends because of its minorization. That's produced because an unequal relation of power, not only because of laws, but also politics, economics and some other. Almost all sociolinguistic studies would agree on that (I only will give one reference, being brief and avoiding to talk of catalan sociolinguistics: Calvet, Louis Jean (1974) <i>Linguistique et colonialisme. Petit traité de glottophagie</i>, Paris, Payot). Being unofficial it's clearly for Asturian language a situation of minorization if the Language A (i.e: Spanish) it's official and has a bigger use in Administration (almost all the use of Administration). However, I don't like the sentence because, really, to be official wouldn't mean for Asturian language to survive. There are a lot of other factors and those should be considered, too. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuestia_cd22.html" title="User:Guestia">Guestia</a> 21:45, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Several authors had wrote this, like all the articles in Wikipedia. Looking to article's history, I can count pretty more than 100 different ones. Even when some are minor changes, I can presume not all of them were involved in Asturian promotion. But the argument shouldn't be who wrote this, but if there's some statements who are not NPOV. Let's look for those supposed statements and not for the supposed ideology of the authors. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuestia_cd22.html" title="User:Guestia">Guestia</a> 21:45, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem to obtain a NPOV here is that there is a group of people who cares very</dd>

<dd>Anyway, the article needs more information and many sources. I really don't like it much. If I'll have time, I would reform it completely and add sources, but I didn't have time to yet. And only to be honest, I'm involved in Asturian language defense, but I'm also a linguist, and I have always tried to made a good work in my field of study. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuestia_cd22.html" title="User:Guestia">Guestia</a> 21:45, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is intended to be a general response to Guestia. I respect the science of linguistics, but my concern is that people involved in the promotion of Asturian may have a personal interest in the subject. I am not saying this is your case, but certain groups of Asturian advocates stand to gain a lot if, for example, it is made official: lots of public jobs (translators, teachers...) and money would have to be allocated. Politically, it would also be good for nationalism/regionalism. Of course, that does not mean there is nothing wrong in defending Asturian, but it could interfere with an honest exposition of the subject.</dd>
<dd>I am glad to see that this article has at least been checked by a linguist, because I had doubts about it. I may be wrong and this article may be portraying the subject in a neutral way, that is why I wanted to hear some thoughts about it.

<p><i>"is disputed the fact of speaking a dialect of Spanish Language or a variety of Astur-Leonese."</i></p>
<p>What does this mean in English? I would be bold and correct it but I haven't the least idea whatsoever what it means. Is the writer trying to say,</p>
<p><i>"There is a dispute as to whether Cantabrian is a dialect of Astur-Leonese or simply a dialect of Spanish."</i></p>
<p>OR does it mean,</p>
<p><i>"There is a dispute as to whether Cantabrian and Extramaduran are dialects of Astur-Leonese or simply dialects of Spanish."</i></p>
<p>OR something else I haven't thought of.</p>
<p>You'll notice that the two sentences above have completely different meanings, and to be honest the way it's written right now I don't know which is right. At any rate, that phrase shouldn't be tacked on to the back of the sentence like a caboose. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 23:27, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't quite understand it either. I have changed the term "speech" for "idiom", which is more neutral in English following the WP article <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialect</a>: &lt;&lt;The term Idiom is used by some linguists instead of language or dialect when there is no need to commit oneself to any decision on the status with respect to this distinction.&gt;&gt; I hope this helps for the future correction of this very sentence&#160;:-) <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMax-hu_3fd7.html" title="User:Max-hu">Max-hu</a> 19:08, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The paragraph (or rather sentence) on language basics is, excuse me, pure nonsense. Or is this basically castellano?</p>

<p>Though I am not familiar with the current linguistic situation (from what I read, Asturo-Leones is on its way to extinction), I can assure you that the language that used to be spoken by peasants in Asturias and Leon in the first half of the 20th century was very much distinct from Castellano.<a href="../../../u/n/o/User%7EUnoffensive_text_or_character_9c05.html" title="User:Unoffensive text or character">Unoffensive text or character</a> 09:28, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
