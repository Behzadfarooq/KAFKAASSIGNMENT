<p>[Validity of astrology] seems to be gone, where did the content move? I can't even get a history of that page.

<dd>The deletion of that article was a horrendous move, a colossal blunder; talk about 'skeptics' hijacking certain pages (just as they claim 'the believers' do) and influencing the vote. In reality, these 'skeptics' probably have nothing more than a high-school diploma and get all of their 'NPOV information' from the Internet, as if real people with their filthy POV's didn't put it there. Books and the like are unknown to them, these pseudo-skeptics with their amateurish, Google-obsessed minds (they have NO CLUE how much information has yet to be put on the Internet). OH WELL -- months and months of work and research, dozens of sources and valid links and intricate paragraphs...it's all down the toilet now, it was all for naught and this means that everyone involved (including the 'skeptics') wasted countless hours. This article has gone into the great Internet void (though the article <i>does</i> live on and can be found on many of the Wiki-clone sites all over the Web). This only proves that Wikipedia has just become another angry and raging message board where whomever has the most friends (to influence the vote) and can type in the fanciest manner (so that they <i>sound</i> educated; they don't actually have to be) has their preferred information left in. So thanks Wikipedia; your site is a great beacon of bright-white truth among the disgusting darkness of soiled, POV sources! All hail the Wiki-God and it's unbiased hive-mind. --<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.12.116.202.html" title="User:64.12.116.202">64.12.116.202</a> 02:54, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The debunkers (pretending that they're objective sceptics) besides proving their lack of knowledge and lack of integrity on the various Astrology pages have also been personally attacking me on my own talk page. When I dare try to defend myself, they block me out of Wikipedia. So much for honest dialogue. They can't win an argument fairly, so they resort to dirty tricks. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Homer_3ed5.html" title="User:Andrew Homer">Andrew Homer</a> 08:11, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First of all, I do not fully understand how you deferentiate between debunkers and skeptics. To me, it seems debunkers are those trying to disprove something and skeptics are those who remain, well, skeptic, about stuff they do not feel has been sufficiently proven. Do you disagree on this?</dd>
<dd>Also, I will ask you (again) not to claim that "we" have lack of integrity - such a charge is vague and, at least so far, unsubstantiated. If you want to criticize me or anyone else, please do so civily and explicitly. And make sure you stop attacking people first.</dd>
<dd>And it was not me nor other "debunkers" who blocked you - it was an administrator who saw you making personal attacks. He was not trying to argue either way and may be, for all you know, 100% behind your every argument and a fellow astrologer who believes I am just as much an idiot as you do. He is upholding guidelines which are there so secure a good "working environment" and which make wikipedia more than a discussion forum.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">The history of deletion</span></h3>
<p>It started with the following post on Talk:Objective validity of astrology:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Incidentally, I'd say this article is pretty much superfluous; it looks like a POV fork of Astrology. The lead section of Astrology presents the reader with a neutrally stated and verifiable summary of the validity of the subjectand Astrology#The_objective_validity_of_astrology is sufficient, in my view, as a coverage of this issue. Just zis Guy you know? 15:52, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Which was followed by:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Per JzG's concerns over the necessity of this, I have started an AfD. There is, of course, a very good chance of keep, but this is one of the best ways to find out what community thinks of the info we're presenting. Marskell 16:07, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</i></li>
</ul>
<p>The actual AfD read as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Fundamental concern is that this is a POV-fork used as a platform to present questionable, obscure astrological research that would not pass WP:V, WP:RS, and WP:NPOV on a more frequented page. The one entry here that has received sufficient attention to warrant Wiki-coverage is the Mars effect, which has its own page. The main astrology article has a section which can be expanded somewhat to include any other critical points. We have an astrology and astronomy to boot, which we can use if we really need comparative analysis. The page is also a gawdawful mess which is constantly being reverted over. Delete. Marskell 16:05, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Together with the originator, 30 people argued for deletion (65%), 16 for keeping or not deleting (35%). According to the originator, the AfD should have normally resulted in an automatic <i>keep</i> because the <i>delete</i> votes didn't go over 67% (Marskell: "Three-quarters and above (assuming no sockpuppets etc.) and an admin will generally delete. Two-thirds and below and it will be a "no consensus keep". Between the two is borderline and an admin will use their discretion.").</p>
<p>This is how the matter was closed:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The result of the debate was Delete. This was a hard one to close and required a LOT of reading. What it boils down to is that the arguments for deletion (most of which are valid policy-type of arguments) definitely outweigh the arguments for keep. Deathphoenix ʕ 04:00, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</i></li>

<dd>The reasons were covered very clearly by the many people who voted to delete the article. I can't help but feel that if I had been listened to when I complained about the gross abuses of WP:RS, WP:NPOV#Pseudoscience and Undue Weight instead of being disregarded, the article may have been saved. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a> 11:45, 19 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In responce to the new additions, Wikipedia is not a democracy. It is not the number of votes that is weighted, but the quality of them. A number of keep votes were entirely irration, accussing editors of "scientism" and some were from extremely new or inexperienced editors. These were likely weighted lower, or discounted altogether. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a> 12:55, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>J, I don't dispute your opinion. However, I am waiting for the views of the admin who made the decision to delete. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 13:07, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In the meantime, perhaps there is something there for you to learn about Reliable Sources, since it was your repeated insertion of unreliable sources which brought the article down. You might start at <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Mabey <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Pseudoscience" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Pseudoscience</a> would be helpful as well. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a> 13:21, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here's a CC of my response to Aquirata's talk page:</p>
<p>I took a long to time read the AfD (and believe me, there were so many comments that it took me quite a while). No other AfD closer wanted to put the time and effort into weighing those comments. I was a neutral party who has no vested interested either way in this article. My closing comments may have been, in your mind, somewhat brief, but they were a lot longer than a lot of other AfD closing comments. In any case, I won't change my mind about this because whatever arguments need to be presented were already presented in the AfD, unless you have new information that wasn't already presented in the AfD. If you have any new information to present that will likely result in the overturning of the result of this AfD, I suggest you read <a href="../../../u/n/d/Wikipedia%7EUndeletion_policy_6fe1.html" title="Wikipedia:Undeletion policy">Wikipedia:Undeletion policy</a> and the instructions in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a> before arguing your case in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a>. If you do so, please let me know so I can look at whatever new information you present so I can also suggest an action (which may be to overturn the results of my AfD closure, depending on the new evidence that you present). Thank you, <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 13:38, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'd like to add this on top of the arguments above: the fact that this was one of the last AfDs to be closed that day shows how difficult it was to close this AfD. Whatever you may think about my closure of this AfD, please note that I usually close the last AfDs that others don't touch: the ones that are often contentious and have many arguments either way. My closure of this AfD was done in good faith and in doing so, I very carefully looked at the merits of each and every comment. I can assure you that I did not make any hasty decisions when closing this AfD, nor did I do so recklessly. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 13:45, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>DP, I'm not questioning your decision - I simply want to hear about your <b>reasoning</b> that lead to the decision. All I've read so far is that: <i>"the arguments for deletion (most of which are valid policy-type of arguments) definitely outweigh the arguments for keep"</i>. Could you expand on that please? <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 13:52, 19 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Okay, my reasoning is that most people arguing for deletion are saying that it's a POV fork. POV forks are not allowed in Wikipedia, and this is against Wikipedia policy. I weigh comments based on Wikipedia policies very seriously. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 14:18, 19 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks. So basically you took people's comments on the article being a POV fork at face value. Or did you actually look at the article and came to the same conclusion? In the latter case, could you please explain to me what you based your judgment on? <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 15:41, 19 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I took the comments on the article being a POV fork a face value. What I believe about the article itself has no bearing on how I close it. My own feelings and beliefs are irrelevant when I close an AfD. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 15:57, 19 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>OK, thanks. I'm sure that you acted according to WP practice and policies. However, it would seem that this approach could be wide open to abuse. Those wanting to force a decision their way need only cite policy violations without having to provide a basis for their opinion. Those arguing rationally but without citing policy violations will naturally lose out. Which is fine because, after all, WP can only reflect the way the community is.</dd>
<dd>It is also apparent to me now why certain editors are heavy on quoting policies and chopping articles but thin on rationale and substance. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 18:26, 19 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No problem. I suppose the same could be true for any type of approach: they'd be open to abuse. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 18:47, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I haven't looked at Aquirata's actions, nor have I looked at the actions of anyone else involved with astrology articles (nor do I have to, since I'm just looking at the AfD and nothing else), so I won't comment on their actions. It doesn't matter to me what anyone believes, including myself. Articles should not go against Wikipedia policies, including articles that I've worked on. I have personally worked on some crufty articles, and some of those articles have also been deleted via AfD because the community consensus can sometimes run counter to my own beliefs. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 14:37, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Most people argued that the article was a "POV fork," but did not clarify what POV they meant -was it an astrology POV fork or a skeptic POV fork? Most voters did not say, so the claim that it was a "POV fork" is ambiguous. When I first saw the article it was clearly a skeptic POV fork, as well as against WP:NOT and WP:V. It could have been deleted at that point, but I believe there is a need for this article, because the skeptic nonsense has been responded to by critical astrologers and neutral scientists. As the article shifted toward neutrality, the skeptics begain to complain. To delete the article as a "POV fork" is meaningless since both sides were involved in digging up the facts, and the article was improving through sourcing and research. I'd especially like to hear from an administrator comment on WP:V with regard to the article in question. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 15:59, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The reasoning behind calling it a fork was explained in the initial nom and in numerous responses to Aquirata. Thirty people happened to agree.

Deleting the article was a mistake by the community. Majorities dont have to be right. Differing opinions exist and will have to be represented in Wikipedia somewhere. The deleted article was the place to hold both sides it wasnt balanced but had swung in both directions and an equilibrium would have been found given time. Now I predict the astrology and science section of the main Astrology article will grow to take on this role until we find a way for all sides to say their piece. <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumos3_fc96.html" title="User:Lumos3">Lumos3</a> 21:58, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Clear consensus</span></h2>
<p>OK, the leading part of the second sentence under 'Astrology and science' (<i>"there is a clear consensus within the contemporary scientific community that there is no verified scientific basis for astrological claims"</i>) still needs sourcing in my opinion. I haven't seen anything in the references supporting the statement. For example, on beliefnet.com:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"When it was discovered that the Earth was not the center of the universe, astrology became impossible," said Hawking, delivering a lecture through voice synthesizer to a standing-room-only crowd of thousands.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>What kind of bullsh*t is this? I have been a big fan of Hawking, by the way, ever since his <i>Brief History of Time</i>, but he goes ballistic here. It appears he knows nothing about astrology at all.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"The reason most scientists don't believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment," Hawking said to a rapt and quiet crowd..."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Here he makes an unsourced statement, and it's about the supposed <b>belief</b> of scientists, not a statement of fact or evidence.</p>
<p>The rest of the references are similarly unsupportive of the claim in the article. Could someone please point me to the relevant parts of these references in case I missed something? <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 18:52, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For the passage that you described, would "...there is a belief within the contemporary scientific community..." be acceptable? --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 18:57, 19 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, the word <i>belief</i> is probably much closer to the truth and would be easier to source. Since it is impossible to disprove astrology <i>per se</i> in practical terms, and the vast majority of the scientists couldn't be bothered with looking into astrology anyway because they have an <i>a priori</i> opinion about it being a 'pseudoscience', the most appropriate term is <i>belief</i>. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 19:39, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So we should agree to change this to a neutral statement like, "there is a clear consensus of belief within the contemporary scientific community that there is no verified scientific basis for astrological claims".

<dd>I'm not so sure. The sentence goes on to state that "astrologers and a significant portion of the population continues to believe in astrology". Well, you can leave off "astrologers" because of course they believe, but then this makes the article seem to be between scientists and the public, which is not accurate. This is about scientific belief versus putative findings that go contrary to that belief. How about, "Although contemporary scientists commonly believe that there is no scientific basis for astrological claims, astrologers believe that there is evidence to the contrary." <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 20:37, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The sympathetic view must be given preference as you know, so I have moved the paragraph accordingly. The section looks fairly balanced with the exception of the lack of citing tests where no correlation was found. A few sentences to that effect should be added. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 10:34, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To take the rewording effort further, I can live with "commonly held belief" but not with "clear consensus belief". Two other editors seem to agree with this.

<li><a href="../../../p/r/o/Protoscience.html" title="Protoscience">Protoscience</a> article: "Protoscience is a word with two meanings. It may mean an unscientific field of study which later becomes a science (e.g. astrology becoming astronomy and alchemy becoming chemistry).

<li><a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">Pseudoscience</a> article: "Pseudoscience is a term applied to a body of alleged knowledge, methodology, belief, or practice that is portrayed as scientific but diverges substantially from the required standards for scientific work or is unsupported by sufficient scientific research."

<dd>Very much agreed. Pseudoscience implies a large measure of con job; though some practicioners may be on the level, they're basically indistinguishable from those who aren't. Astrology has always attracted its fair share of loonies (let's be real!), but is nevertheless a valid field of study with its own rigorous procedures and methods. Someone who is pushing a con can be discovered in a matter of seconds by an experienced astrologer (as I've sometimes had to do, unfortunately); the same can't be said for a tea leaf reader, etc. who may be legitimate, but follows no set method, and thus can't be challenged for lack of proficiency. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoovinator_deb5.html" title="User:Doovinator">Doovinator</a> 04:36, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Astrology is listed as an example of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protoscience.html" title="Protoscience">protoscience</a>. Astrology is not being portrayed as scientific, and tests of it adhere to the scientific method; some of its claims are also supported by scientific research. Which means it cannot be considered pseudoscience. That some people label it as such is a fact, but that has no bearing on classification in WP. On the other hand, astrology is "a field of study which appears to conform to the scientific method but is either not falsifiable, or if it is, its predictions and principles have not yet been accepted as science or verified by a consensus of scientists." This is a very apt description of the current state of astrology, so I'd say astrology perfectly fits the protoscience category. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 11:56, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

He criticized the article for authoritatively characterizing astrology as superstition and for authoritatively assuming that a mechanism ("scientific basis") is necessary for validity (although he himself did not "feel" that astrology is valid). By describing the origins of chemistry, medicine, and astronomy and Wegener's proposal, he seems to suggest that astrology is a protoscience. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 17:39, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Playing stupid would be beyond my skills. You don't seem to understand that sourcing a representative opinion is different from sourcing the same statement from a number of parties. Representative opinion may take the form of organizations representing people's views or beliefs, opinion polls or cross-section interviews. Just because your government makes a political statement, it doesn't follow that this statement is representative of the opinions of the people. An opinion poll would represent a true picture. Same goes for the scientists. How do you know what their beliefs are? Did you talk to every one of them? Did you read an opinion poll somewhere? Did somebody interview a representative cross-section of them? You don't seem to realize how grave an error you are making by assuming scientists' views and beliefs. The Humanist article is certainly not representative of scientists. It was a political attack filled with authoritarian and pseudoscientific arguments. Does the NSF claim to represent the views and beliefs of scientists? If not, end of story. If so, how are they doing that? <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 13:47, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good God Aquirata. By your logic we couldn't use the American Medical Association to cite a medical claim. We have to accept Year Zero because (in your opinion) it represents a cross-section of astrologers' viewpoints—this despite the fact that on the vast majority of Wiki articles it would be considered dubious and not allowed—but the largest cross-discipline scientific organization in the U.S. is out. This is ridiculous.

But that isn't the case: every non-dubious scientific link says the discipline is non-scientific with some wording or other. Of course, that doesn't mean that every scientific organization in general will see fit to publish a statement on astrology—I can still live with "the scientific community, <i>where it has commented</i>..." <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 15:15, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I'm not. Astrology is a minority view amongst the population at large and (more importantly) an extreme minority view amongst experts that we might cite on Wikipedia (perhaps you can find a Nobel winner to match the 18 that signed the Humanist piece). In letter and spirit NPOV makes clear that we do not have to give support for things like astrology equal weight alongside science.

<dd>Minority vs majority only applies to undue weight. I am talking about something else. You cannot criticise something first and then write about it later.

<dd>Also undue weight absolutely applies here--it applies to everything we discuss basically ("including, but not limited to, depth of detail, quantity of text, prominence of placement, and juxtaposition of statements"). Insofar as we are debating prominence of placement we are debating undue weight. And we are not "criticis(ing) something first and then writ(ing) about it later." There are five sections describing astrology in detail above the section! The section is called "Astrology and science". And we should begin by "represent(ing) the majority (scientific) view as the majority view." <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 14:06, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This particular meta discussion is referenced within WP:NPOV. The wording within the policy is similar to that of the meta discussion, so the discussion was probably the source of that section of the policy.</dd>
<dd>Undue weight applies everywhere, of course. I am not debating undue weight. The order of paragraphs has no bearing on weight. If anything, the last word carries more weight than the first in an argument. Nowhere does NPOV say that we should begin with the majority view. However, you cannot start a section with criticism. This is not only common sense, but also follows from the text quoted above.</dd>
<dd>Undue weight should be dealt with separately by adding more arguments on the science side. I have already suggested that above. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 14:58, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would have to agree with part of what Marskell has been saying. Let me explain. There are outspoken critics who proclaim astrology to be pseudoscience. These critics have strong beliefs and publish their opionins in the most authoritative places they can reach. Politicians and lobbists do much the same thing. I think Aquirata is correct that the vast majority of scientists have remained silent on the issue. But here is where Marskell is correct. If silence is consent, then due to the silence, there is a de facto "consensus" that astrology is pseudoscience. I would not by any means characterize this belief as being "clear" as it is now worded. That qualification would require what Aquirata has asked for, a poll or cross-section to prod those who are silent for an opionion.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I believe that Michael Harding speaks for many postmodern astrologers when he states that empirical observations do not need to support any theory at all. Astrologers say they observe. Observation is the basis for science theory, and observation either confirms/supports or falsifies/denies science theory, not the other way around. Claims of knowledge based on observation and lack of science theory makes astrology a protoscience within the Wikipedia definition. Aquirata is right. This is the correct (astrological) way to represent astrology as contrasted to the pseudoscience (skeptic) view. Both of these POVs should be represented. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 03:25, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've included more of Carl Sagan's letter to the Humanist in the article. It pointedly demonstrates that Sagan did not want to be implicated in the highly controversial article. It was a shock for most people that highly regarded scientists would endorse a manifesto in a highly opinionated non-scientific journal. Sagan did this to make it clear he did not give silent consent to the apparent "consensus" of opinion. Because of his level-headed response, his letter became almost as famous as the article in question. Although Sagan was a skeptic and "felt" that astrology is not valid, he added comments in his letter that were clearly sympathetic to the idea of astrology as a protoscience, and this is a good source for acceptance among scientists for this idea. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 19:23, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The <i>Humanist</i> article was written in 1975, an interesting period historically in science. At this time there were many scientists who strongly believed that the absolute definitions of natural phenomena and the linear progression of science was being threatened. The scientists who attacked astrology in this article, by their own later admissions, confessed they knew practically nothing about astrology. The attack was based largely on ignorance. In the early and mid-1970s, some philosophers and other thinkers had begun to think of science as "interpretive" and "constructed," and challenged the old views.</p>
<p>Thomas Kuhn's views, published at this tme, were highly influential. He saw science as a series of "paradigms" where newer scientific ideas replaced older ones. Kuhn also introduced the idea of "protoscience" during this period. The postmodern era, mainly during the 1990s (Uranus conj. Neptune), threw great doubt on the strict discrimination of many things, including many ideas in science. For example, boundaries between science and religion began to disolve, particularly in the mystical sense. Many things previously considered to be certainties were questioned and reconsidered.</p>
<p>As part of these changes, serious researchers began to reconsider astrology. They read Gauquelin. They took the time to actually learn astrology and design astrologically sound tests. There are positive results of astrolgical tests, but because of resistence on the part of some scientists clinging to the old highly-regimented beliefs, these results have not yet entered the scientific establishment. The 1975 <i>Humanist</i> article is an important landmark, but it should be contrasted with the dissolution of barriers and new, more inclusive definitions that have developed since then. It does not represent the "vast majority" today in any sense. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 15:56, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand what you are saying, but I'm afraid this revolution hasn't happened yet, nor does it look likely to. If you can find a reference of a large group of respected astronomers saying what you are, then we have something to work with. But on other similar pages I have worked on, such as creationists or cold fusion researchers, there was almost identical claims that we were on the brink of a revolution and that the ideas were being held back by an old gaurd of bigoted scientists who just happened to the editorial team for every major science journal. If this revolution is coming, can I suggest that we wait for it rather than trying to pre-empt it in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a> 16:03, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just so you know, <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Positive_tone" class="extiw" title="meta:Positive_tone">meta:Positive tone</a> is a <i>suggested extension</i> to NPOV that is not. There does not appear to be any discussion about it, it is not a guideline or even an essay on en itself, and there are people who <b>strongly</b> disagree with it. The people who proposed it thought about only a limited set of cases, like politics and abortion, where opinions are everything and facts don't matter much. Following that proposal, how would you make <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">Time Cube</a> not be a complete embarrassment to Wikipedia? As for your comments on the state of science, I can't understand how you can support your claims. Every single astronomer and physicist at my university would disagree with you. For one thing, Science is more threatened now than it was in the 70s, with an upsurge in pseudoscience, helped by the Internet, and unscientific thinking in government. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus">T</a></sup> 11:54, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have difficulty spelling, not anything else. I am also an expert on pseudoscience.

<dd>For those of you following this, the result was -no block-, and my self revert was unneccasery. I shall leave it in place as a peace making move, and hope that Aquirata sees reason.

<dl>
<dd>FWIW, I took a look at the diffs, and the admin made the right call. Jefffire did not revert to the same version four times in one day. The first diff was removing some text. The next three diffs were to place (or replace) <a href="../../../p/s/e/Category%7EPseudoscience_c4dd.html" title="Category:Pseudoscience">Category:Pseudoscience</a> in the article. So it looks like Jefffire made three reverts in a day, but did not make the potentially-blockable fourth revert. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 17:37, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I maintain that the article talk page is not the appropriate place to discuss this, but whilst it is going on I would like to make note that user:Aquirata accussed me of vandalism in the report. I have never vandalised any page, anywhere, ever. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a> 17:43, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't understand DP's interpretation. The first edit by Jefffire was a reversion of an edit made by <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">User:Piper Almanac</a>, not just "removing some text". The next three were admittedly reverts. That makes four in a day.</dd>
<dd>And if blocking is not meant as a punishment, then why a self-reversion after having been reported for 3RR violation makes a difference? Isn't a break still called for especially if the violator is continuing to revert, albeit less than 4 times a day? <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 18:12, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>IMO, the change in title didn't change the meaning, and it doesn't fall under the category of "comments". Section headers need to be neutral and unprovacative so as to be effect, so I changed it as a good faith edit. If you regarded the change as vandalism, why the devil did you say nothing about it until now? I did once before unintentionally violate the 3rr due to an honest mistake on it's wording, however, you violated it in full knowlegde of the wording. Further more, I think this whole conversation come under the title of "bickering", so unless a different editor asks for a response, I will cease my input into this section. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a> 19:06, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Regarding my interpretation, yes, the first was a reversion, but the next three were different reversions. That's how I saw it. Anyways, his reversions are pretty far in the past, and a preventative 3RR block is not necessary at this time. I don't understand your question with regards to the block not being punishment, but it doesn't matter. A point of principle on Wikipedia is that blocks are not meant to be as punishment. Period. Any questions you have about inconsistencies in optics about blocks as punishment vs. prevention are because Wikipedia is large, and admins have different ideas about blocking policy. My interpretation might not even be correct. But in any case, I think any more comments I provide in this area will largely be useless, so I'll just take Astrology off my watchlist now and wish you all the best. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 19:37, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
