<p>Deuar at 25 August has re-written the heading, and defined asteroids as rocky bodies, to be distinguished from the icy bodies further out. While this may be a sensible classification, I do not believe that it has been followed in astronomical literature: i.e. "minor planets" and "asteroids" (and "planetoids") have been used as synonyms, even if the Wikipedia makes a distinction. Burned out comets, the Centaurs, and I think TNO's have been called minor planets or even asteroids. Also if we restrict "asteroid" to the rockies, then we lack a generic name for the icicles. Obviously the IAU has more work to do, but the expose by Deuar seems premature. Waddayathink? <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_Peters_0511.html" title="User:Tom Peters">Tom Peters</a> 08:45, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Rmhermen argued under "Merge Asteroids, Minor Planets" that we should make a distinction. I agree that we should, but the fact is that the use of nomenclature up to now does NOT make a distinction between rocky, inner solar system, and icy, outer solar system objects: even within the new size-based class "SSSB" there is no sub-division between inner and outer bodies (although the icy outer DWARF PLANETS do get their own class: Plutonians; while Ceres and other round inner planetoids do not).</p>
<p>I asked Brian G. Marsden, head of the IAU's Minor Planet Center, and he wrote me this (personal communication, quoting explicitly allowed): " The term "minor planet" continues to exist. It is precisely synonymous with "asteroid" and "planetoid"."</p>
<p>And also, when asked whether Ceres still is and Pluto now also is, an asteroid, he wrote: " Given now the definition "dwarf planet" (for want of a better term), clearly applicable to Ceres and Pluto, I don't think we should continue to speak of these objects as "minor planets" (or "asteroids" or "planetoids"), even though they (will) all appear in a single catalogue, as regards their orbits, astrometric observations and names."</p>
<p>So I maintain that the distinction in the Wikipedia between "Minor planets" and "Asteroids", as exemplified by having two lemmata, is an invention of the Wiki authors: and that the two pages should be merged.</p>

The articles say that asteroids are a subclass of minor planets, but I do not believe that such a distinction is consistently made in old or current astronomical literature; besides, there is much overlap between the two articles.

<dd>Minor planet to SSSB, yes, but probably best to keep "asteroid" seperate - the term is going to stay in use, and if nothing else Ceres is still going to be grouped with them. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 19:57, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A clear distinction still exists between asteroids and comets, both types of minor planets or, as they are now called, small solar system bodies. Less certain is the classification of Centaurs. Not to mention the large difference between asteroids and small TNOs (now also called SSSBs). <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 20:53, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes there is a large physical difference between (small) TNO's and proper rocky astroids: but all have been numbered as minor planets and I have not seen asteroids defined as a subclass of minor planets in literature: rather they are synonymous. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_Peters_0511.html" title="User:Tom Peters">Tom Peters</a> 08:45, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Even if TNO are not numbered separately - comets are, and so are some Centaurs. So we cannot simply say that they are the same. <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 15:52, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I guess it doesn't surprise me that the IAU doesn't have a definition of "asteroid" etc. - they've only now gotten around to defining "planet"! However, this doesn't change the simple fact that there are these two large, important, groupings of physically distinct bodies that get called <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asteroid.html" title="Asteroid">Asteroids</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trans-Neptunian_Object_6e23.html" title="Trans-Neptunian Object">Trans-Neptunian Objects</a> in Wikipedia, as well as a few less prominent groups as well such as <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centaur.html" title="Centaur">Centaurs</a> and others. Then there's also <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comet.html" title="Comet">Comets</a>, and I wonder whether the IAU has gotten around to defining them? I suspect it's a grey area as well, especially given the so-called <a href="../../../m/a/i/Main-belt_comet.html" title="Main-belt comet">main-belt comets</a>. All these groupings certainly need their own articles - as evidence, let me just point out that over 32K has been written about the asteroids alone! The curent division in Wikipedia presumably comes about because it the most widely held view among people interested in solar system bodies.</dd>
<dd>In principle, I'm OK with renaming the "asteroid" article to something else like "rocky minor planet" or some such, although I have to say this seems like a pretty cumbersome and distasteful way to do deal with the issue. Perhaps a better way would be to keep the current division we have in Wikipedia, but somewhere in the introductory part of "asteroid", "TNO", etc mention that these are not official or universally accepted definitions. Finally, "minor planet" or "small solar system body", or whatever that article gets renamed to, should be an umbrella grouping that points out the different categories of small bodies without going far into their individual details − that should be left for their individual articles. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeuar_eca8.html" title="User:Deuar">Deuar</a> 15:04, 28 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Deuar, I find your attitude very disturbing. You justify the current status with "The curent division in Wikipedia presumably comes about because it the most widely held view among people interested in solar system bodies". I hold that someone started an article on minor planets and someone else started an article on asteroids, and that the two evolved and cross-pollinated along the way. However, this is not a matter of opinion that requires a NPOV and fair representation of majority and minority opinions. This is about classification and the technical terms used for them. The Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, which means that its purpose is to describe and explain the meaning of the lemmata as they are used in the real world. In this case, it is the actual use by (professional) astronomers that should be decisive, not some opinion among Wikipedians. Bradler could not be more explicit: "minor planet" and "asteroid" are full synonyms. So we may not have two articles with different content under these two terms. Yes, now that "planet" is (re-)defined, the IAU should come up with a clearer definition of "minor planet" (the preferred term over "asteroid"). Yes, this term indicates several very different types of objects, not all of which have a proper definition or even a proper name. There is a good reason: these objects are discovered by the thousands, and get a designation. What their nature and proper classification is, is usually unknown. In any case, the definition that you wrote on this page that an asteroid is a rocky body and a sub-class of minor planets, is your own invention. It is not a fair representation of current use in astronomy. It is wrong and should be reformulated.</dd>
<dd>I do agree however on your practical proposals that the various objects deserve their own pages, if only because the current pages get too big. Unfortunately then we'll have to make up some cumbersome title just because there is no generally accepted proper term. But that appears to be just the sad current state of affairs. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_Peters_0511.html" title="User:Tom Peters">Tom Peters</a> 19:21, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hey, I hope I didn't disturb you too much!&#160;:-)</dd>
<dd>As for the introduction, please feel free to improve it - I won't complain (probably). I had put it in as mostly a stopgap measure, and to do some compacting. You might remember that before we had "An <i>asteroid</i> is a predominantly rocky body that orbits around its star", which did not exclude e.g. the Earth or rocky planets around other stars. This seemed to be glaring and prompted me to do my likely amateurish edits. I personally don't care very much about the actual naming, being more interested in the physical properties of all these bodies, and that the groups do get their own articles whatever the names. Lastly, yeah, of course I agree that professional use takes complete precedence over wikipedia use, but I had the impression that professional use was pretty sloppy itself. I've mostly read journal articles on main-belt asteroids, and there they are predominantly called such (not minor planets); as for the other groups of numbered bodies I'm not familiar enough to say anything useful. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeuar_eca8.html" title="User:Deuar">Deuar</a> 11:03, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am rethinking my previous comments in support of naming asteroids using just the most common name first and then sorting out naming conflicts later. As it is, many articles and redirects will be directed to the most common name if an article is made with that name. Then when the inevitable renaming comes, all those links will be either broken or linked to the wrong article - what an unnecessary mess. How about we establish some kind of naming convention for asteroids? I suggest either following the type of naming convention found in the planets articles (e.g. <a href="../../../e/r/o/Eros_%28asteroid%29.html" title="Eros (asteroid)">Eros (asteroid)</a>) or we use catalogue numbers (e.g. <a href="../../../4/3/3/433_Eros_e4e0.html" title="433 Eros">433 Eros</a>). I personally prefer using the second method since it is more precise and easier to link to in another article. Then the <a href="../../../e/r/o/Eros.html" title="Eros">Eros</a> article can be about the god - which makes sense, since all other uses of the word "Eros" are derived from the name of the god. A couple of links at the bottom of that article can then be added to the other uses of the word. Any other suggestions? --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">maveric149</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not wedded to any particular method, but your ideas intrigue me and I would like to subscribe to your newsletter. As long as the "common name" articles either disambiguate or redirect directly to the fancy technical name, there shouldn't be a problem; it'll still be easy to link to asteroids without having to always look up the technical name for [[433 Eros|Eros]]ing. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan Derksen</a></dd>

<p>I am convinced that the number preceeding the name of an asteroid needs to be between parentheses. This is the naming convention in the Dictionary of Minor Planet Names by Lutz D. Schmadel and on the website of the Minor Planet Center (<a href="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides/Bright/2003/00021.html" class="external free" title="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides/Bright/2003/00021.html" rel="nofollow">http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides/Bright/2003/00021.html</a>). Does anyone have information that proves the contrary&#160;? If not, this should be changed, but I am not active on the English wikipedia. - Tom. 81.240.23.198 18:03, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are quite right, the formal naming convention does require the parentheses. Dropping them lightens the text (they are kept for asteroids numbered but unnamed, because otherwise the name doesn't parse correctly). I have nothing against retrofitting them in, but the task would be immense.</dd>

<p>So, bringing the discussion back to the topic: should Quaoar be listed as the largest asteroid or not? If asteroid is a standalone concept (say, an undifferentiated body orbiting a star) and if Quaoar fits the definition, then we should put it first. But, it asteroid is a relative concept (like <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hill.html" title="Hill">hill</a> is to <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mountain.html" title="Mountain">mountain</a>), then we don't have lists of the tallest hills in the world, so the whole table of largest asteroids is kind of silly.</p>
<p>I can see the argument both ways -- <a href="../../../h/i/k/User%7EHike395_91ce.html" title="User:Hike395">hike395</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I've only heard Quaoar described as a Kuiper belt object. Also asteroids are often distinguished from other sub-planetary bodies by being rocky but most of the time an asteroid is called an asteroid if any part of its orbit is within the orbit of Jupiter and it is not a comet, moon (or meteoroid - not sure where the cut off is though - it may be a mountain/hill thing). Comets are composed of a very large percentage of volatiles. However, to complicate the picture there are burned out comets which have lost most of their volatiles that are now called asteroids (it still doesn't break the definition). Kuiper belt objects are so named because of their position and not really based on their composition (although due to their distance from the sun and the fact that so much damn water and other volatiles were created from our proto-planetary disk, it is thought that these objects have a high percentage of volatiles - but I haven't heard about any spectral studies to back this up though). That knowledge is from my Geology of the Planets class I took a few years back and the class textbook <i>Moons and Planets, Fourth Edition</i>, William K. Hartmann, (Wadsworth Publishing Company; 1999) <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-534-54630-7</a> pages 159-161. IIRC many of the non-comet objects in between the orbits of Jupiter and Neptune have a messed up and uncertain classification (although comets at that distance won't have tails so it is kind of hard to distinguish them from more rocky bodies, again IIRC). --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a> 06:44 12 Jul 2003 (UTC)~</dd>

<dd>OK, so last night I thought: the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Astronomical_Union_54bc.html" title="International Astronomical Union">IAU</a> should have figured this all out, right? Nope. There is no official IAU definition for a planet! People are still quibbling about it. So, some people same Quaoar is a planet, some say an asteroid, and some say a KBO (Kuiper Belt Object). What a mess. This is probably what <a href="../../../p/i/z/User%7EPizza_Puzzle_d32e.html" title="User:Pizza Puzzle">Pizza Puzzle</a> was alluding to, above.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This definitional mess certainly casts doubt on the table of largest asteroids. I've got an idea: I'll change the header to say "Table of Largest Asteroids inside the orbit of Jupiter" and then it will be correct. -- <a href="../../../h/i/k/User%7EHike395_91ce.html" title="User:Hike395">hike395</a></dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, the IAU <i>does</i> have a definition for what planets are, at least within the solar system; planets are any of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. There's a lot of debate over how to classify extrasolar planets, especially with <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brown_dwarf.html" title="Brown dwarf">brown dwarf</a> stars in the picture, but they're a recent discovery so confusion is understandable.</dd>

<dd>As for renaming the table, I object. When I first created it I used a list of "biggest asteroids" from an astronomy book that did not give their orbital diameters, and I think a few others may have been added from other sources since then as well. Do you know for a fact whether all of those asteroids really <i>are</i> within the orbit of Jupiter? And even if they are, Jupiter's orbit is not part of any definition of asteroid that I'm aware of. What if we discover a big asteroid between Jupiter and Saturn? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ah but the IAU isnt a definitive source either, some respectable sources now say that Pluto isn't a planet, but rather it is a Kuipter Belt object. There isn't a definitive definition, but certainly the spirit of the list is to refer to those relatively small rocky things that lie mostly between mars and jupiter. <a href="../../../p/i/z/User%7EPizza_Puzzle_d32e.html" title="User:Pizza Puzzle">Pizza Puzzle</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Bryan -- The IAU has an enumerated list of solar planets, but that's not what I would call a definition. The lack of definition definitely affects the status of Quaoar, and hence the table: should Quaoar be in it or not? See <a href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/planet_denitions_030227.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/planet_denitions_030227.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/02/26_planet.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/02/26_planet.shtml" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> for some of the controversy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If Quaoar is not a planet, it might not still be an asteroid; Kuiper belt objects seem to be considered a class of their own based on what I've read. For now, perhaps a similar table to the "biggest asteroids" one covering the "biggest KBOs" could be put over in the KBO article. I'll start putting one together, in fact. If they ever end up being merged, it should be fairly straightforward to do so. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a></dd>

Is it an asteroid? Should it be listed? This is the sort of mess I'm trying to avoid by restricting the table to list only those asteroids within Jupiter's orbit.

<dd>Fortunately, Chiron's size is below the smallest asteroid currently on the table, so that particular mess is very easy to ignore for the immediate future. Perhaps Pizza Puzzle's at-the-time sarcastic suggestion of a <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_debris.html" title="Space debris">space debris</a> article could be useful as a sort of "disambiguation page" which lists asteroids, KBOs, Oort cloud objects, etc. with brief descriptions of how they're distinguished in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a></dd>
<dd>Oh, just noticed while building that page; Chiron's classified as a Centaur, which appears to fill in the definitional region between the asteroids and Kuiper belt.

<p>I changed the number of asteroids to a much larger and much vaguer number. We had listed 9000 discovered which is far too low. The Minor Planet Center mentioned almost 15,000 numbered asteroids in 1999 before most of the computerized searches hit ful swing. NEAT claims over 5,000 new designations and LINEAR over 198,000! But they don't specify what kind of objects are being designated. I presume mostly asteroids. The committee to investigate a replacement for Spaceguard estimates half a million near earth asteroids over 50 meters. Asteroids are first designated, than numbered, than named as they meet better criteria.

<p>The section on asteroid discovery was very interesting to me, and is the reason I came to this article. I wish someone would add information about when the accumulating data on asteroids clearly indicated the existence of the "asteroid belt." <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> 19:09, 25 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Apparently the term "asteroid belt" was first coined in SF, not astronomy, as early as 1931. A search of the NASA ADS Abstracts database finds the first use of "Asteroid Belt" in an abstract in Frank J. Kerr and Fred L. Whipple, <i>Possible explanations of the secular acceleration of PHOBOS and Jupiter V</i>, Astronomical Journal, Vol. 56, No. 5 p. 131 (Oct 1951). Their use of the term seems casual, however, so it was clearly in use before that date (this is more a reflection on the ADS Abstracts database incompleteness than anything else).</dd>

<p>Looks like I am late but here is my detailed look responding to AllyUnion's message on my talk page:</p>
<p>"One of the things I noticed that was missing from the English article is a notable asteroid section."</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, because we have separated out the List of noteworthy asteroids in our Solar System as well as having the List of asteroids, List of asteroids named after important people, List of asteroids named after places as well as Meanings of asteroid names and Pronunciation of asteroid names.
<dl>
<dd>There should be an article link or a summary none the less. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 18:48, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There is, and always has been, a link to these articles. <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 23:02, Mar 3, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>"The other are the images, which are not present."</p>
<dl>
<dd>We have fewer pictures, perhaps that should change. The 3 pictures which differ are already present on the pages of the individual asteroids in better resolution or description. They could be added to the asteroid article. The animated piture is certainly nice.</dd>
</dl>
<p>"If you notice, the information may be the same, it is just that the French article is slightly more detailed." "If you look closely, their section of "The discovery of the first asteroids" is more detailed than the English history section, with minor information missing."</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting from the bottom, the 3 nav bars are directly copied from us. Our links section has the same link and more and we have a see also section that the French version lacks completely. We have a long "Asteroids in fiction and film" that the French article lacks completely also.</li>
<li>Our noteworthy asteroids is a separate article. Our spectral classification section is superior in detail and the additional details in the French are treated in separate articles such as the arbitrary addition of only 3 of the 11 additional classes or the class details.</li>
<li>Our denomination section needs a little work and probably moved earlier in the article but is more detailed. I see the French article has these details in the Modern methods section.</li>
<li>What the French article has under principal groupings we have in the separate article Minor Planets - which subject the French article fails to mention at all. The French article also misidentifies cubewanos and promotes Trojans to an odd level of importance. But perhaps a less detailed description than that found on minor planets could be added to the asteroid article for some of the major groups. Not sure it is necessary though.</li>
<li>The French article has no unmannned exploration section, nor any mention of von Zach or Wolf. It does go into more detail about the discovery of 1 Ceres although we have more detail in our Ceres article. Is it useful to expand this on the asteroid article?</li>
</ul>
<p>"My suggestion of merging was that I see the French article is a Featured article and the English article is not. The objections that may be raised is the layout of the article, and being too brief in certain areas where the French article is not."</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is clear that the standards for featured article are not the same between encyclopedias. I know that the French version would not qualify through our process, especially the "how-to" observation section and no footnotes or references sections. Also I don't believe that our article has ever been proposed for featured status.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This line from the French article is not in our description of asteroid naming. Is it a useful addition? "The appearance receives a designation, made up of the year of discovery, a code of two letters representing the week of discovery, and of a number so more than the one discovered one took place in this week (example: 1998 FJ74). When the orbit of an asteroid is confirmed, it receives a permanent number (example: (26308) 1998 SM165), then, later, a name (example: <a href="../../../1/_/c/1_Ceres_30f7.html" title="1 Ceres">1 Ceres</a>)." <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 15:25, Mar 3, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I factored in the Ceres discovery already --- seemed short enough and relevant. The material in the paragraph immediately above is well-described at <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provisional_designation.html" title="Provisional designation">provisional designation</a>: I should check to see if we link to that article in a prominent way. -- <a href="../../../h/i/k/User%7EHike395_91ce.html" title="User:Hike395">hike395</a> 15:47, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>My apologize to those who have already worked on this article so much. I do feel that the article could be nominated for a Featured Article status, but it does seem lacking in pictures, and I was attempting to discover what made the French article a Feature Article and what made the English one not one... aside from it not being nominated. However I feel that looking at the French article and seeing the differences between the two is important. Their NPOV and our NPOV are different, and we can learn from something by looking at their article version. After all, if we can make improvements to the English article simply by looking at the French version, why not? -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 18:48, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't beleive NPOV has anything to do with it. And asking us to merge in information that we have already purposely removed to separate articles dosesn't seem productive. I don't believe that the French article would have made it through our Featured article process. It seems very incomplete and unbalanced, lacks a strong lead, and in a couple places is actually incorrect. <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 23:02, Mar 3, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wikipedia drops the parentheses for named asteroids because it makes the text somewhat easier to read, because this convention is already quite common elsewhere, and because, frankly, it would be too much work to convert the existing pages to the formal format...

<p>It is claimed that "This has led to great confusion though in that an asteroid's type is <i>not</i> indicative of its composition". That sounds too categorical to me. As far as I know, in most cases the spectrum <i>is</i> quite indicative of composition (but maybe someone has evidence otherwise?). Rather, the confusion (but was it a "great" confusion?) has been because different scientists have used different bits of the spectrum to classify the asteroids. This led to several classification schemes which are not directly comparable and which disagree for many asteroids. Still, by eye about 2/3 asteroids are classified consistently, so the present classification clearly is of some use. Accordingly, i've toned down tha paragraph in the article. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeuar_eca8.html" title="User:Deuar">Deuar</a> 12:05, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The recent edit suggesting mining asteroids for iron is bizzare. I can understand asteroid mines for some kind of rare mineral (yet to be proposed), but we're not likely to run out of iron any time soon.

<p>The part refering to fictional refrences to asteroids was terrible jumble, with all kinds of items having no logical connection other than all mentioning asteroids, in no logical order - and very many important SF refrences were missing altogther. I have reordered the existing items, by theme rahter than date, and added what I felt needed to be added (quite a bit).

<dd>I like what you've done, but I think you need to include the names of some the major books or films as examples for what you're saying; in other words, if you're making claims about the changing representation of asteroids, you need evidence to back up your claims. Have a look at the 'Mars in Fiction' section of the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mars.html" title="Mars">Mars</a> article to see an example of what I mean (it's not perfect itself, but it makes the basic point). <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Singing_Badger_db89.html" title="User:The Singing Badger">The Singing Badger</a> 21:28, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To clarify what's happened, Adam wrote a super detailed "asteroids in fiction" section, that was great. The problem, I thought, it was far too long.

<p>There seem to be two widely differing mass estimates for the whole belt going around:</p>

<li>High: ~3.2&amp;times10<sup>21</sup> kg. This comes from some research by E.V. Pitjeva where she fitted aberrations in the motion of planets (ref #4 in the article, or e.g. <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2004cosp.meet.2014P&amp;db_key=AST&amp;data_type=HTML&amp;format=&amp;high=43a5c7f7b426048" class="external autonumber" title="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2004cosp.meet.2014P&amp;db_key=AST&amp;data_type=HTML&amp;format=&amp;high=43a5c7f7b426048" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, and some other papers).

<p>Something streaks across the field of view in the animated gif (Image:Asteroid 2004 FH.gif). The caption says that this is a meteor, but it doesn't say that on the NASA site. I can't imagine the asteroid is traveling at an apparent velocity anything like a meteor, so isn't it more likely that the streak is a satellite in high orbit? <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 19:15, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The same question struck me just now, when reading the article. The streak across the image is very obviously a satellite, not a meteor. A meteor streak would be much too fast to process across several time-lapse images. After a quick search, the following web page confirms that the time-lapse is at 15-second intervals, and agrees that the streak is a satellite. <a href="http://aida.astronomie.info/displayimage.php?album=lastupby&amp;cat=0&amp;pos=96&amp;uid=32" class="external free" title="http://aida.astronomie.info/displayimage.php?album=lastupby&amp;cat=0&amp;pos=96&amp;uid=32" rel="nofollow">http://aida.astronomie.info/displayimage.php?album=lastupby&amp;cat=0&amp;pos=96&amp;uid=32</a> I will update the image caption appropriately.

I've been adding and correcting some of the entries here and in other sections. How do I prove that I'm using the original sources if they are not accessible with links, because I'm not going to spend a bunch of my time doing this work and then have others question if the citations are correct?</p>

<dd>The citations will gradually appear at this URL: http://scully.cfa.harvard.edu/~cgi/ShowCitation.COM?num=1234 (they are working backwards from the most recent namings). This will eventually allow a direct link to be put in. For now, I suggest using the style <code>&lt;small&gt;[MPC 1234]&lt;/small&gt;</code>. Footnotes or endnotes are not desirable because the pages are already unwieldy. Please also try to sum up who or what the asteroid was named for. For example, simply stating that 4002 Shinagawa is named for "Seishi Shinagawa" is unhelpful. He was presumably described in the MPC, no?</dd>

<blockquote>
<p><i>"Q: What is Ceres? A: Ceres is (or now we can say it was) the largest asteroid, about 1000 km across, orbiting in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Ceres now qualifies as a dwarf planet because it is now known to be large enough (massive enough) to have self-gravity pulling itself into a nearly round shape."</i></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"Q: Didn’t Ceres used to be called an asteroid or minor planet? A: Historically, Ceres was called a “planet” when it was first discovered (in 1801) orbiting in what is known as the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Because 19 th century astronomers could not resolve the size and shape of Ceres, and because numerous other bodies were discovered in the same region, Ceres lost its planetary status. For more than a century, Ceres has been referred to as an asteroid or minor planet."</i></p>

<dd>The IAU's dispatch on the numbering of Pluto and Eris infers that they were added to the minor planets catalogue <b>not</b> because they were considered to be minor planets (now "small solar system bodies"), but instead because Ceres was already on the list - i.e. for consistency. Minor planets are now SSSBs, but dwarf planets are a separate category from SSSBs, so dwarf planets aren't minor planets, I would think. --<b><a href="../../../c/k/a/User%7ECkatz_0c62.html" title="User:Ckatz">Ckatz</a></b><i><small><sup><a href="../../../c/k/a/User_talk%7ECkatz_91bf.html" title="User talk:Ckatz"><font color="green">chat</font></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ckatz_cb51.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ckatz"><font color="red">spy</font></a></sub></small></i> 08:58, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ckatz, this is false reasoning. The IAU has said nowhere that (all) minor planets are now SSSBs. The IAU defined the terms "planet" and "dwarf planet". Also they now call SSSB anything that is not a planet, dwarf planet, or meteorite, and it includes comets next to minor planets. Thusfar the IAU hasn't made a closer definition of the older terms minor planet = asteroid = planetoid. For now, minor planet and SSSB are overlapping, not hierarchical categories. But just because Ceres, and now Pluto and Eris, have minor planet numbers, the intention obviously is to classify them as minor planets - which makes sense, since they are planets, be it of the dwarf variety, which is somehwat bigger and rounder than your average minor planet. It also makes sense from observational methodology: a new speck of light is discovered, and it gets a minor planet number. Only after closer investigation it can be classified as a dwarf planet or SSSB (maybe even a distant comet). <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_Peters_0511.html" title="User:Tom Peters">Tom Peters</a> 09:50, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As Ceres is no longer an asteroid, it can't be the largest of them, even if it is still a minor planet. 132.205.44.128 05:23, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My perception is that the preference of the editors is to keep this subject on hold, pending some sort of clarification from the IAU. While the website is an official IAU publication, and other IAU web pages have expressed a similar intent, their wording is vague enough to warrant caution before incorporating such a significant change into the astronomy articles. Temporary solutions have included using text such as "largest object in the asteroid belt" instead of "largest asteroid".
