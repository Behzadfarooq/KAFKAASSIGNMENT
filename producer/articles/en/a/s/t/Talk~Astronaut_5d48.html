<p>A lot of the stuff in the space milestones section should be in a table I think.</p>
<p>Also, I think the use of the more neutral term "space traveller" might be useful than using the American term "astronaut" most of the time.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree, why must we use the American term? Because it's American?</dd>

<p>I still don't know how many civilians have been in space. The first section says that the Americans take a fairly lax definition of astronaut (people in training and people who have been on the edge of space, but not actually in space), then later in the section on non-military personnel the article talks about two people who only match up to the american definition (the first died before they got into space, the second only went to the edge). So who was the first non-military person in space, by international (npov) definitions?</p>
<p>p.s. - I've taken the 'badly-constructed' bit out because it doesn't say <i>why</i> it's badly constructed - a similar Latin/Greek word (<a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">Television</a>) says its a <a href="../../../h/y/b/Hybrid_word.html" title="Hybrid word">hybrid word</a>, mentioning nothing about being badly contructed. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESheridan_4356.html" title="User:Sheridan">sheridan</a> 20:45, 2005 Jan 8 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>IIRC the first American who was totally a civilian in space was probably <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Schmitt_e8a4.html" title="Jack Schmitt">Jack Schmitt</a> on <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_17.html" title="Apollo 17">Apollo 17</a>. All the previous Americans had been in the military before and this was primarily why they were selected - ie excellent test pilots. Even guys like <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Armstrong_5dd2.html" title="Neil Armstrong">Neil Armstrong</a> who is often described as being civlian had been military pilots, though sometimes they had retired from the forces before being selected.</dd>

<dd>Of course I can't speak for the Russians. Probably be looking at one of the members of the <a href="../../../v/o/s/Voskhod_1.html" title="Voskhod 1">Voskhod 1</a> crew, one of whom was a designeer (supposedly put there to guarantee his design would work!) and another was a doctor. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Monkey_6b08.html" title="User:Evil Monkey">Evil Monkey</a> → <small><a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvil_Monkey_65b0.html" title="User talk:Evil Monkey">Talk</a> 21:22, Jan 8, 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The main reason I focused on this is because I read or heard once (typically it was a long time ago and I don't have the slightest idea what the source was) that all the early astronauts were military while all the early cosmonauts were civilian. While that's obviously wrong, especially in the light of this article, I was wondering what the truth was. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESheridan_4356.html" title="User:Sheridan">sheridan</a> 17:59, 2005 Jan 11 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All the early Soviet cosmonauts (and probably still today) were military pilots of some sort. Valentina Tereshcova may not have been but I do remember that she was involved in parachuting which was why she was selected (the cosmonauts were nothing more than passengers but were ejected just while they were still descending as the capsule landing would have been quite rough). <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Monkey_6b08.html" title="User:Evil Monkey">Evil Monkey</a> → <small><a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvil_Monkey_65b0.html" title="User talk:Evil Monkey">Talk</a> 07:47, Jan 12, 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>It is disparaging POV to detail that Mellville's Spaceship One flight was suborbital, when NASA's first astronaut, Alan Shepherd's flight was also suborbital, but this is not mentioned. All X-15 astronauts, whether by US or international standards, are also suborbital.</p>
<p>No it's not. Remember to assume good faith. <a href="../../../d/m/e/User%7EDMeyering_6ce4.html" title="User:DMeyering">Antimatter</a>---<a href="../../../d/m/e/User_talk%7EDMeyering_58d6.html" title="User talk:DMeyering">talk</a>--- 21:54, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is there any proof that Taikonaut was coined by Chiew Lee Yih aside from the usenet post on May 19, 1998? In standard Mandarin spoken on the Republic of China, astronaut is called "Tai Kon Ren". I am almost certain that many other people might have called Chinese astronauts "Taikonauts".</p>

<p>I have a question about civilian "astronauts". Is the term really used to indicate any person who travels into space, or is it reserved for the trained spacemen of various space agencies? There is a note in the article on <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shatner_9433.html" title="William Shatner">William Shatner</a> that he has reserved a seat for a civilian spaceflight on Virgin Galactic, and that when he takes his ride he will become "a full-fledged astronaut". To my mind this is simply not right; there's a big difference between someone who has trained and sacrificed for years to pursue the <i>career</i> of being a space traveller, and someone who hasn't (even if he did play one on TV). I'm tempted to remove the word "astronaut" from the Shatner article, but I decided to check here first. Is there a more appropriate term for civilian space tourism, or is "astronaut" appropriate? -<a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 23:04, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While that may be and we should certainly add some citations to that effect, it is coined term by the media and not the Chinese word for an astronaut. Consider that nine citizens of France have flown in space, while only three from China. Should we not list the coined term "spationaut" in the opening paragraph?

<dd>Would you propose removing cosmonaut from the introduction too? Why should use by governments be the criterion for including an alternate name in the introduction, rather than popular use of the term? It seems to me popular usage would be a more important factor, perhaps even the most important. What places taikonaut in the category with astronaut and cosmonaut, as opposed to spationaut and all the various other alternate-language versions people regularly add to the introduction, is that China, like Russia and the U.S., has its own manned space program. The three Chinese space travellers were launched from China, aboard Chinese spacecraft (Admittedly glorified Soyuz redesigns, but still) - I think this is a pretty concrete distinction, and between the official, government-sanctioned term and the term in popular usage, I would favor the latter. — <a href="../../../s/w/p/User%7ESwpb_9c6b.html" title="User:Swpb">Swpb</a> <sup><i><a href="../../../s/w/p/User_talk%7ESwpb_ffe5.html" title="User talk:Swpb">talk</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swpb_aa66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swpb">contribs</a></i></sup> 05:22, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The word is hángtiān yuán (in Pinyin), not taikonaut, and when the Chinese translate hángtiān yuán into English, they translate it as astronaut, not taikonaut. Unless we can find some citations that show the term has become as commonly used and as commonly known as the Russian version космона́вт, it doesn't merit mention in the opening paragraph. <a href="../../../r/i/l/User%7ERillian_e63f.html" title="User:Rillian">Rillian</a> 13:59, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The International Astronaut section is a mess.

Also we say that the Italian astronauts were merged into the ESA ones but we never list there being any Italian astronauts before then. It would be nice to have a statement of how many countries have sent people into space.

<dd>The selection history is a mess because it is a mess&#160;:-) Most international selection where for just one mission - one flight opportunity and then usually two astronaut candidates get into training. France, Germany, Japan and Canada (maybe Italy as well, I am not sure) however did create actual astronaut teams when more regular mission participation was planned. But I don't have that many details, I can only give more detailled information on the german astronauts.

<p>This is an English language wiki and the subject matter gives no reason why a Russian or Chinese translation of the name should appear. Why not Swahili or Dutch? Why not have all article titles on this entire wiki translated in all languages. There have been nationals outside of Russians and Chinese in space, why not list them? There have been many notable attorneys and physicians in other countries besides English speaking ones, but you don't see the Portuguese or Vietnamese translations of those titles. Seriously. There is no possible argument for having those translations that has any weight at all. All I can think of that might lead to such translation is nationalism POV which has no place in this encyclopedia. I don't have a problem with the Taikonaut section, that seems relevant. A section about different astronaut programs around the world is fine, but not the translations of titles in the intro.(<a href="../../../b/t/i/User%7EBtipling_4d9e.html" title="User:Btipling">Bjorn Tipling</a> 04:07, 7 February 2007 (UTC))</p>

<dd>This has been discussed at length in the past. The (clear) distinction of the term cosmonaut is that Russia actually possesses its own manned space program, like the US, and cosmonaut is the formal term for participants of that program.

<dd>No person who has flown in space, including those from India or Brazil, has done so as a participant of those countries' programs. Those who have flown with NASA are officially known as astronauts, those who have flown with the Russian program as cosmonauts. The Chinese space agency (the only other space agency to launch its own astronauts) translates the Chinese word as "astronaut".

<dd>It may be appropriate somewhere inside the article, but perhaps not at the top. Again, I don't see a lot of other articles that have synonyms with foreign origins (that have worked their way into the English language or not) listed at the top. I don't see a lot of articles with a list of synonyms at the top, period, foreign origin or not. What is the criteria or standard used to determine if an 'or'and a synonym should be placed in a Wikipedia article? Perhaps Cosmonaut should be its own article or just be a redirect with a statement about other nation's programs in the body with the translation. I'm not anti-Russian, it just made no sense to me, and if you're going to do something like this it should be consistent with established Wiki policy and established wiki precedence. Can you provide evidence to satisfy either of these two requirements? At the very least, it should make sense, and it doesn't. I my first impression was, why Russian? why Chinese?

McAuliffe's crew member status is debatable. She was selected for special program that was intended to be non-professional in nature (i.e. by completing her training, she did not become a member of the NASA Astronaut Corps), and NASA classifies her as a "Space Flight Participant" on their Bios page, not as an Astronaut. However, she did train with the Challenger crew. <a href="../../../r/i/l/User%7ERillian_e63f.html" title="User:Rillian">Rillian</a> 03:50, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You're right, that was from a separate section. Unfortunately, it's still vague. "Participate" might be argued to mean simply "being there". The word "astronaut" means "star traveler". No one has gone to any stars yet. Unless there is an authoritative body that has official authority to define what the word "astronaut" precisely means, and can be cited, then the broadest possible definition would seem to be required. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 04:18, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Since they're non-NASA, it seems to me that the FAA criteria is what applies here. It's like been a pilot: you can't say you're one until you have the license, until you take the final check ride.

I won't remove the infoboxes again, but I still think they should come off, and would like to see it there's consensus on this. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 15:47, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed. The colloquial use of the word seems to follow an and/or basis: Either a person has flown in space, or they have been trained by one of the major space programs.

<dd>Acutally, within NASA, the term "astronaut candidate" is used for people selected by NASA to join an astronaut class but who have not yet completed their training.

<dd>Well, you are correct in a way, there is no such thing in the U.S. as a "pilot's license". We have Pilots Certificates and associated ratings (but we don't have "badges"....I have no idea where you get the idea of a "badge", as there's no such thing). Melvill and Binnie didn't get a "licence" but a rating added to their pilots certificate for flying into space. The other two did not. It wasn't something "honorary", it was an actual rating, so they are rated as astronauts, while Shane and Siebold are not. You can train as a pilot all you want, but until you take the checkride, you don't get the rating or certificate. For the astronauts, you don't get that until you make the actual flight. Though I didn't say this earlier, by calling those who aren't really astronauts such a title, you denegrate the work and qualifications of those who have accomplished it. Let's bring this back to wikipedia-land, though: you have to have verifiability for statements, you don't get to make up stuff yourself. NASA certainly doesn't officially recognize these two as astronauts, so that leaves the only other body who can officially recognize them as astronauts, and that is the FAA. If you can point me to some other official, verifiable source that has designated these two as astronauts, then I'll gladly concur with you on this, but until you can, we should stick with wikipedia verifiabilty guidelines. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 21:25, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've expanded the deaths section a bit, and wanted to let everyone know why. Before doing this, the section said that there were 18 deaths, and referred the readers over to <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_disaster.html" title="Space disaster">Space disaster</a> which, in the opening paragraph says 22. One has to cull carefully through that article to find out which were actual space mission deaths and which were subspace or training accidents. Since there have only been 4 spaceflights that have resulted in fatalities, it seems that a summary of them here isn't too much of a waste of electrons and provides our readers with easier-to-obtain informaiton, and since ulitmately this article is about astronauts, honoring the fallen by listing there names here seems quite fitting. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 18:47, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A couple of comments. I agree the number of deaths should be reconciled with Space Disasters. However, this is too much detail for an overview article on Astronaut. The danger of being an Astronaut should be described with some summary but the details of specific disasters should be left to Space Disasters. Also, as this article is about astronauts, people trained to fly in spacecrafts, the discussion of danger should not be limited to deaths during spaceflight, but training accidents as well. <a href="../../../r/i/l/User%7ERillian_e63f.html" title="User:Rillian">Rillian</a> 13:40, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

Besides, the way it was presented before, only the US incidents were mentioned.

<dd>well you are too fast for me I think I made my point about that POV. My other point, is what actually brought me to this page but I got sidetracked - and that is that I wanted specifically to find out about taikonauts, ie specifically Chinese astronauts and got me redirected here, nothing to do with cosmonauts at first, although when I found that that also redirected here I thought it was a problem. I can understand the article wants to be about all space travelers, and probably you could do chinese space program or something but, well from there it gets rather complex ---------your other point, Yes the etymology of Cosmonaut is Russian usage by way of the greek Greek kosmos, universe + Greek nauts, sailor- the etymology of oh, say barge is <i>french</i> it is still an <i>english</i> word Cosmonaut in french is cosmonaute in greek its κοσμοναύτης in Finnish kosmonautti and, there you go 68.60.68.203 14:13, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes. Arguably, cosmonaut is the better word, since astronauts don't fly to stars. But Americans are also known for thinking beyond the practical, i.e. "reaching for the stars", so it fits.

<dd>well since we got off on this I did a little checking, although I am not sure they should be emulated the french wiki redirects cosmonaute to Spationaute, italian cosmonauta to Astronauta.

<dd>The article <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Federal_Space_Agency_d91a.html" title="Russian Federal Space Agency">Russian Federal Space Agency</a> should give you specific information about Russian space flight, as opposed to general human space flight, which this article is intended to do. Given that astronauts, cosmonauts, and taikonauts are all discussed on this page, the choice of article title reflects the term used in anglophone countries, as it should be, since this is the English Wikipedia.
