You'll find a list of a few common ones you might try to avoid <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoiding_common_mistakes_8f85.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoiding common mistakes">here</a>.</p>
<p>The sections of the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> that apply directly to this article are:</p>

<p>These policies have guided the shape and content of the article, and new arrivals are strongly encouraged to become familiar with them prior to raising objections on this page or adding content to the article.

<dd>The "peers" in question don't necessarily have to be the same as the subject; there are more experts on astology than just astrologers.

<dd>What the hell does "at the very least listed an astological sign" have anything to do with legit astrology? Your fluffy friends and you are only b.s.ing yourselves. Since you're pretending to know what you're talking about: where's your Jupiter/Pluto midpoint and what narrow orb aspects does it make to other points in your natal chart? And what experiences have you had during the periods of the solar-arc directed Jupiter-Pluto midpoint making hard aspects in your natal chart?? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Homer_3ed5.html" title="User:Andrew Homer">Andrew Homer</a> 08:39, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

These are issues that are addressed and discussed at length by astrologers. Current thinking in astrology is NOT a blind application of unvalidated ideas in a pseudosientific manner. The excellent information currently in the article accurately reflects the various opinions and perspectives. I think it is unfortunate that this valuable information is being removed, but I cannot claim to have an objective view of what is most relevant and important material for the encyclopedia. I am speaking from the minority view of astrologers. I think that most astrologers would agree with me. However, if the majority view from the academic non-astrologer's point of view is that this material is better removed, then go ahead and do what you think is best. I just want to make sure that the view from the point of view of astrologers has been presented for consideration. I have saved a copy of the article as it is because it is superb, and this removal of important information is, at least in my opinion, removing information that is appropriate for a general introduction to astrology and the current status of astrology in the modern world. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Cochrane_9e46.html" title="User:David Cochrane">DavidCochrane</a> 14:06, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>David, don't forget that Crawford's market report has been voted one of the top 3 stock market prognosticators year-after-year. And with the gazillion rabbits I've pulled out of an astological hat in my readings since 1969: I don't need to justify my existence behind the phrase "scientific method." The word "empirical" satisfies me. In fact, Louis Freeh, former FBI director, refers to me as "He's the Southwest's early warning system." Gee, I wonder how many of the psuedo-academics who spam here can make that claim? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Homer_3ed5.html" title="User:Andrew Homer">Andrew Homer</a> 11:10, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>David, if you disagree with some of my changes then I am very much open for discussing them. In the absence of some of the more polarising elements, I think such a discussion is very much possible (There is also no need to save the information as barring a deletion it will be stored safely in Wikipedia's archives). <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a> 11:40, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Andrew, I agree that you and other astrologers do not need to pursue the scientific method, but until astrology does astrology cannot claim to be a science. "Scientific method" is a formal set of procedures that are clearly defined, and is not just a phase to hide behind. I am developing software to test various theories. For example, I recently found (this is not in print yet) Bradley's formula for the DJIA worked with statistical significance in the 1970's (after his book was written) which is impressive, but the formula has not worked since then. I plan to contact Arch and see if I can get his complete formula and test it. The bottom line is that like you, I know astrology works from my personal work with it, but until astrology is validated in controlled studies or controlled observations, astrology is not yet a science. The Gauquelin studies almost, but not quite, put astrology in the category of being a science. There is also a growing movement among astrologers that asserts that astrology lies outside the domain of science, although I personally disagree with this. So continue moving forward with the important work you do. All of us have a part to play. I was a practicing astrologer in the 70's but since then am focusing on software and validation of astrology, which are also important.</dd>

<dd>Jeffire, thanks for the welcome to discuss issues. I will continue the discussion little by little, as I find time. The most important point right now is that I think that what astrologers do and what astrologers believe can be quite different from what non-astrologers may think they do, and some of the material in the article may seem to be superfluous, but most it hits right on major issues that astrologers currently are deeply involved with. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Cochrane_9e46.html" title="User:David Cochrane">DavidCochrane</a> 10:15, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/t/Talk%7EAstrology_ec9e.html" title="Edit section: Scientific proof">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Scientific proof</span></h2>
<p>This morning I woke up to the first indisputable scientific proof of some of astrology's major claims in five thousand years of written history.</p>
<p>This particular line of inquiry was started 29.5 years ago (one Saturn cycle), and significantly augmented 11.9 years ago (one Jupiter cycle). No doubt I have arrived in this life with ample preparation for the moment.</p>
<p>I am not making this up, and I'm not exaggerating (unless of course my interpretation of the data is faulty). Although the investigation in this form has just started, I can already see strong confirmation for the signs of the zodiac, rulerships, and houses. The current setup is geocentric, tropical, planetary (Placidus) houses and traditional rulers, but this doesn't preclude the potential validity of other systems (they will be tested in due course). I should also note that, while strong (3 sigma) correlation exists between certain combinations of the above mentioned factors and certain earthly events, interpretation of celestial phenomena may markedly differ from what astrologers are generally used to. I haven't yet had enough time to look at the data to say either way for sure.</p>
<p>Times are extremely exciting, to say the least. I will therefore devote my efforts to where they are most effective. I may pop in here, too, sometimes, but it will be more conducive to the well-being of humanity if I simply publish the results in a reliable source.&#160;:)</p>

<dd>5000 years of written history? You assume an unbroken tradition. In the Sumerian/Babylonian/Greek/Indian line, I can't think of a single thing, except the general importance of the sun, moon and seasons that has not changed, not even the basic meanings and associations of the planets. You are aware that the 12 sign zod did not come into existence until approx. 7th century BCE?

<p>I too will bid this section adieu, though like Aquirata, I may drop in from time to time. I have learned a lot from the experience of contributing and editing. For the most part I enjoyed the dialog and exchanges. I would say that it has been an interesting battle of vision versus rules. With my colleagues in this effort (and I include you all), I've tried to find the middle way whereby vision can be understood while staying within the rules. You have all helped me. This section on astrology and science has improved from when I first got involved, but it has now reached a psychological barrier that I don't believe it's going to get through.</p>
<p>I believe this barrier has something to do with the perceived belief that astrology should have a mechanism, and I haven't been able yet to put my finger directly on the psychology of this issue. Though it stops many scientists cold, the mechanism argument really does not belong here at all. Since Newton, science has prefered mathematical relationships over causal mechanisms. With quantum physics, even relational math gave way to a preferred epistimology of statistical reality. The patterns of chaos physics are taking scientific preference even farther from mechanistic and mathematical determinism. Causal mechanism is not a scientific argument. Yet it crops up here as if it holds ultimate authority. Why? When it comes to astrology, there's an anchor holding us way back in the past, and it needs to be brought into the present.</p>
<p>As an astrologer I am very interested in how people think and what they believe. This exercise has given me a glimpse into the minds of others that I would get nowhere else and I am grateful for the opportunity to share mind. I plan to devote more of my time to theory and papers that I have been trying to finish and get published. This article was unlocked when Mercury went retrograde. Now Mercury is about to go direct. Let's see what happens. Thanks again. I love you all. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 23:29, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Frank Brown did a number of experiments in the 50s involving oysters and crabs. He found that oysters, contrary to the scientific belief of the day, open and close their shells in syncronicity with tidal forces. Before his experiments, it was believed that oysters opened and closed their shells due to the physical forces of the tidal waters at the ocean. However, placing them in a controlled environment without the waves and currents of the ocean proved otherwise.</p>
<p>While this does not prove the practice of astrology, it suggests that tidal forces do indeed have an impact on biological organisms, which belies physical explanation, according to nearly all astrophysicists.</p>
<p>These experiments are well known in Biology, and as far as I know, undisputed in their findings. I will dig up some relevant source material.</p>
<p>I'm thinking that I should add to the "Research claims and counter-claims" section a short blurb explaining Frank Brown's experiments. However, as it doesn't exactly pertain to astrology, as practiced, I'm not sure if this is correct. Comments? (currently anon, soon to be a real user, I'll add my username shortly)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I read Brown's studies on these 'circadian' rhythms - a professor I worked for as a research assistant in psychology used them and other similar cosmo-geo cyclical studies as the basis for his work. They have little, though, to do with astrology - the only similarity is the proposition that there are cycles connected in some way to the sun's and possibly the Moon's force upon earth. Such natural cycles do not pertain to how astrology might interpret them as well as non-natural symbolic methods (which makes up most of astrology), or how interpretations develop through history. If, for instance, a scientific consensus is formed, one that says the Moon does in fact affect human biological and psychological states, astrology is not proven since it has nothing to do with the symbolism of say secondary progressions, or the meanings of the 12 houses or signs, or other popular astrological techniques for prediction. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 04:47, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The sentence "The scientific community considers astrology to be a pseudoscience" has 2 references, but I did not find any documentation in these references of the statement. The phrase "where it has commented" which was recently removed was helpful because the scientific community's statements about astrology being a pseudoscience have typically been volunteer samples, and I do not believe we have any data on what the majority of scientists believe in regards to astrology. I suspect that the majority are agnostic on the subject and do not regard astrology as a pseudoscience, but that is only my anecdotal evidence, which is of no more validity than the belief that "the scientific community" (which I interpret loosely as "the majority of scientists") believe astrology is a pseudoscience. Opinions seem to vary in different countries also. I have found many central European scientists, for example, to be more skeptical of modern psychology than astrology. We need documented data, not personal assumptions and anecdotal evidence, on this. If we have the data to support the statement, I have no problem with it and, in act, it would be a useful and helpful statement, but without proper references it is a statement not worthy of being in an encyclopedia. Perhaps I did not read the references thoroughly and the documentation is there, or perhaps I am overlooking some detail that justifies this statement as being appropriate. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Cochrane_9e46.html" title="User:David Cochrane">DavidCochrane</a> 11:06, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm sick of this pseudo-academic wrangling. As I've said on innumerable occasions, Wikipedia should not seek to be simply a democratic exercise in knowledge databasing ("Wikiality") but also should seek to forward rationality and, dare I say, sapience. Superstition and mystification of phenomenon have no place here. Don't legitimize this as science just so you can sleep better at night. Ascribing causality without due justification is called wishful thinking, and is injurious to the psyche. Any internally valid system that one sets up to ascribe causality, will do so seemingly effectively, especially if said system is based on some elementary emperical observations, no matter HOW specious or dubious. -TheT</p>
<p>p.s. Central European scientists? Are you kidding? As a bona-fide scientist, you can quote me: the scientific community en-masse shuns astrology as not even pseudoscience, but as wholly specious and even dubious. Since astrology is unfalsifiable (as are most spiritual beliefs) the best you can get as a primary reference is anecdotal snippets from scientists, as the scientific community as a whole cannot legitimately take up un-falsifiable topics.

<dd>The definition given of superstition deals specifically with behavior as the cause. I think this is a narrow definition of superstition since behavior implies the behavior of the superstitee. For instance, a black cat crossing ones path, or a bird flying in the house are both superstitious symbols of bad luck that will befall, but no behavior is needed except the believe. Friday the 13th as bad luck involves no behavior at all. Furthermore, superstition usually involves fear - fear of something bad happening if some symbolic event happens or if someone does or does not do something (step on a crack). Given this, I don't think astrology falls in the category of superstition because astrological symbolism may or may not be treated superstitiously. Treating astrological superstitiously means following behaviors based on the belief. For example, an astrologer may treat Mercury retrograde superstitiously by not driving for 3 weeks or not mailing any letters for 3 weeks. Another astrologer may continue life as usually, but his belief that Mercury retrograde symbolizes lost letters and auto accidents will put him on the alert for such things or expect such things (no behavior required but belief). A third astrologer may believe that Mercury retrograde does not inherently means these things will happen, but she will interpret the symbolism in another way, such as revisiting old matters, or something else benign. Astrological beliefs may be treated with greater or lesser degrees of superstition. Perhaps superstition should be defined more rigorously before astrology is added. Most superstitions involve good or bad luck while astrological symbolism is more varied than that, and the same astrological event is interpreted differently by different astrologers. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 16:06, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You could also question the causal aspect of this definition. Empirically, the planets <i>are</i> causes, it's just that as with gravity there's no <i>causal mechanism</i> by which behavior is transmitted from point A to point B. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 17:52, 9 August 2006 (UTC)t</dd>

<p>Tit-for-tat editting is not good practice. Just because you think that astrology is as superstitious as prayer, Christianity, etc. doesn't mean that since those pages don't offer the category neither should this one.

<dd>It's an irrational belief in the same sense that it is a pseudoscience. The question of rationality either boils down to whether it conforms to a scientific understanding of reality or whether it is externally consistent. Since astrology fancies itself as a manifestation of observable properties, it is only proper that we ask the question whether there is any observational evidence for it. Since there isn't any found by neutral investigators, the belief is irrational (in that it is simply not scientific). --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 18:58, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Stay tuned and perhaps the so-called scientists may some day catch up with the Astrologers empiricism and give the "scientific method" explaination as to why Astrology DOES work.

<dd>Related to reality is another way of saying empirical. To an astrologer, astrology is 'empirical' because it is experienced (and, I'm certain, <i>shapes</i> the astrologer's reality). This type of empiricism is not scientific (controlled neutral study) but it is to the observer/astrology a collection of 5 white swans and no black ones, generalized to the statement that all or most swans are white, so we can expect the next swan to be white. That doesn't make it correct, but it doesn't make it irrational, just non-scientific. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 19:20, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Certainly. Let me say first that I'm not an astrologer but I have studied astrology for a number of years. While I do not believe astrology is a science or that it could be proven to be a science in the future, I do not at this time agree that it should be categorized as superstition for the following reasons. (I could be persuaded otherwise if superstition and irrational are more carefully defined.) Furthermore, the category of irrational fits in the context of astrology versus science, but not in the context of what actually happens in astrological belief which does involve a consensus reality and type of empiricism, albeit a marginal one. Most superstitions are isolated cases of an event (black cat crossing ones path) that is interpreted as meaning something good or bad, or of a ritualistic action that is taken to prevent bad luck (the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding), or the belief that not taking such an action (that of separating the to-be-betrothed) will result in bad luck. When we speak of the empiricism of the link between the omen or ritual and the good or bad luck, if such luck later befalls, the superstitious person will say 'see, the black cat indicated this would happen!" Luck or chance, as an isolated omenic or ritualistic event, one that cannot be repeated or falsified, is typically the theme of superstition, and astrology <i>as a whole</i> says little about incidental luck or chance. However, an astrologer can be superstitious (as I said above there are varying degrees of superstitious treatment of astrology) when they say "See, Mercury Retrograde caused my computer to fail!" However, to the astrologer, this does not conflict with rational 'scientific' causes such as failure to update antivirus definitions, but Mercury retrograde symbolized the event even if the astrologer uses the inescapable causal language to describe it. Some astrologers think it is causal, some do not. In comparison to the isolated superstitions, astrologers believe in astrology because their empirical experience proves astrology to them consistently and repetitively in everything (this is obviously non-falsifiable and pseudoscience IMO). The symbols are flexible enough to handle nearly everything - their entire reality is interpreted by the interaction of these symbols. It is a consensus reality because astrologers typically hang with other astrologers and share a basic agreement on the symbols, but not on the details. Astrologers would not be so fanatical in their beliefs if this empirical 'evidence' were weak. On the white swan thing (crows would be a better example since there are in fact brownish-black swans), this type of empiricism, from the perspective of the astrologer, is largely inductive, and a black crow will be predicted rather than a white crow. A white crow in astrologese might be something like "Saturn square Mars means a harmonious time." The nature of the symbolism itself is neither inductive or deductive, but based on rationales created in different periods in the history of astrology. The aspect doctrine was based on Neopythagorean theories of harmonics. I expect astrologers will disagree with me, but I agree with them on superstition (not to make astrology more favorable) because superstition is too narrow to define astrology. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 14:03, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Empiricism is irrational when it does not accept the collaborative empirical contributions that have been offered with regards to a subject. The whole point of rational empricism is that ideas based on isolated personal experiences do not count if they contradict the collective sensory exploration of the universe, and they can be explained by alternative explanations that do not contradict other empirical investigations. Astrology may be based on empiricism, but it is an irrational empiricism because it is dismissive of collaborative empirical evidence to the contrary. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 19:32, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Collaborative empirical contributions": what are you referring to? There aren't any that invalidate astrology. The most thorough analysis of astrology is the Gauquelin studies which are inconclusive and clearly involved more ethical violations by the skeptics than the believers. "astrology that says that certain alignments of stars at the time of one's birth has an effect on personality. This seems to be the definition of irrational": Not true. Common sense does not equal irrational; otherwise relativity and quantum mechanics are irrational and we need a superstition link on these pages as well. The skeptics obviously have not read the writings of leading astrologers (like winners of the Regulus awards, etc.) and a study of Cornelius's The Moment of Astrology, etc. will reveal that leading astrologers are typically erudite, intelligent, and have outstanding critical thinking skills, so astrology may or may not valid, but is clearly not superstition as practiced and understood by leading astrologers today. Anyone who reads Hand, Cornelius, Curry, or any of the other leading thinkers on the subject will see that astrology is not superstition. The skeptics should read these authors before commenting and editing this article. The Wikipedia guideline to present the majority view is not a license for editing without fully studying the subject. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Cochrane_9e46.html" title="User:David Cochrane">DavidCochrane</a> 09:39, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, skeptics should read most of the material in the footnotes in the astrology article, including the article by Victor Mansfield and the one by myself and other articles that I have written. After a few years of study of astrology so that you really understand the subject, I can almost guarantee that you will not believe that all astrologers are irrational or involved in superstitions, even if you still not agree with all of the rest of their conclusions. As one concrete example: how do you find my study on physicists irrational, and the implications of this study irrational and a form of superstition? BTW, many thanks to all of the astrologers who have participated in the editing and discussions. It is tedious to go over these fundamentals that have been treated in detail in many books and journal articles. I do not know if I will participate very much in these discussions in the future; there is a strong irrational element, i.e.self-proclaimed expertise and wisdom in astrology and epistemology without having first invested the time necessary to gain expertise, and conducting an intelligent dialogue with ill-prepared "experts" is a futile exercise. One more example is the constant references to causality by the skeptics, when just one undergraduate course in the history and philosophy of science reveals that causality is sorely lacking in much of science, such as in Newton's theory of gravity, which is plagued by the dreaded action at a distance problem. To have intelligent discussion on astrology, we need to get past these fundamentals which the skeptics keep bringing up and have been addressed ad nauseum already in scholarly works on epistemology, the nature of science, and the nature of astrology. Again, starting with the footnotes in the astrology article is a good place to start. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Cochrane_9e46.html" title="User:David Cochrane">DavidCochrane</a> 10:08, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(COPIED FROM ABOVE) I'm sick of this pseudo-academic wrangling. As I've said on innumerable occasions, Wikipedia should not seek to be simply a democratic exercise in knowledge databasing ("Wikiality") but also should seek to forward rationality and, dare I say, sapience. Superstition and mystification of phenomenon have no place here. Don't legitimize this as science just so you can sleep better at night. Ascribing causality without due justification is called wishful thinking, and is injurious to the psyche. Any internally valid system that one sets up to ascribe causality, will do so seemingly effectively, especially if said system is based on some elementary emperical observations, no matter HOW specious or dubious. -TheT</p>
<p>... As a bona-fide scientist, you can quote me: the scientific community en-masse shuns astrology as not even pseudoscience, but as wholly specious and even dubious. Since astrology is unfalsifiable (as are most spiritual beliefs) the best you can get as a primary reference is anecdotal snippets from scientists, as the scientific community as a whole cannot legitimately take up un-falsifiable topics. "None but ourselves can free our minds."</p>
<p>I removed the category on August 20th, 2006 after removing it many times as an Anon-user -- I will continue removing it because Astrology as I and MANY other astrologers practice it is not "...an irrational belief or a set of behaviors that [is] related to magical thinking..." As long as this remains in the definition of "superstition" in the category header, Astrology does not belong there. To me, Astrology is nothing "magical," nor do I believe it to be "irrational" because it's largely based on the <b>highly predictable</b> orbits and the geometric/harmonic <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrological_aspect.html" title="Astrological aspect">astrological aspects</a> that the planets make; for me and other reputable practitioners, astrology is all math.

<p>The "modern era" topic begins by suggesting that reductionist methodology and objective materialistic interpretation are responsible for the divergence that made astronomy a science and astrology an "occult science or superstition".

<p>It's obvious, if you've studied the power plays of the Roman emperors and then those of the Holy See. Both the emperors and the popes banned the use of Astrologers for their political opponents, but had their own court Astrologers. Dissing Astrology to the point of discrediting it and even making it outlaw was a way to keep those ambitious to also be under informed. Now days it appears the ignorance is self-imposed - as noted by the spammers in this article who brag about not even to bother to examine the topic. As J.P. Morgan said, "Millionaires don't use Astrologers. Billionaires do." <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Homer_3ed5.html" title="User:Andrew Homer">Andrew Homer</a> 03:17, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The reword, "method of systematic empirical induction validated by experimental observations" still does not explain the divergence. Astrology used similar methods of improvement based on empirical induction. The competing almanacs and prognostications of the time were only as good as their accuracy. Is not the publication of prognostications an experiment that is validated by increase or decreased demand in the market? If anything, the publication of detailed information that is of vital interest to the public and is closely scrutinized for accuracy based on observation goes counter to superstition. There is a flaw in the reasoning as stated in the article. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 16:27, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The point is, astrology is not closely scrutinized for accuracy based on observation. The results of experimental tests which show that astrology has no effect have largely been ignored by most astrologers, and the way astrology is practised remains pretty much unchanged despite contradicting experimental evidence. This is why, while newly emerging scientific disciplines acquired a method of systematic empirical induction validated by experimental observations, astrology did not and diverged into a superstition. <a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVorpal_blade_8a31.html" title="User:Vorpal blade"><font color="green">Vorpal Blade</font></a><a href="../../../v/o/r/User_talk%7EVorpal_blade_f4dc.html" title="User talk:Vorpal blade"><font color="blue"><sup>snicker-snack</sup></font></a> 11:44, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To a large extent I agree with this statement. Astrology is an unregulated field and these statements are true for some inadequately trained astrologers, and perhaps even the majority of astrologers. However, leading astrological organizations, like ISAR and NCGR, have responded to scientific studies, and are now requiring ethics and counseling training, and using listening skills rather than making specific predictions or unqualified statements during an astrological consultation to fulfill requirements for their certification programs. Some leading astrologers (Curry, Cornelius, Campion, etc.) view astrology as lacking objective validity, so in some ways their views are closer to the skeptics than to "true believers" in astrology. Some astrologers are conducting studies using more sophisticated mathematical models than previously used in astrological research. These are concrete and real responses by astrologers to the mostly negative results of scientific research. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Cochrane_9e46.html" title="User:David Cochrane">DavidCochrane</a> 02:33, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What is that you say? A type of Astrology was "invented" in Germany? And again you say: "...astrology (such as horary) inveted before the 18th century." If you say that these two versions of astrology were "invented", are you implying that all astrology was invented? And if not, then you must be assuming that some are indeed fictious (such as horary, as stated above), for surely something supposedly as real as astrology cannot be "invented", but instead it must be discovered. And what about the constellation <a href="../../../o/p/h/Ophiuchus.html" title="Ophiuchus">Ophiuchus</a>? Ophiuchus is contained within the ecliptic and yet it is not part of the Zodiac. Why did astrologers decide to leave it out? Is it because they were unaware of its existence? Does a constellation only affect you if the astrologers are aware of it? Another reason why astrology has no basis is because the Zodiac is only accurate to when astrology was invented (ex: If you were born on April 15th, say, then astrologically, you would be Aries. But astronomically, you would be Pisces. Which is it? Are you really an Aries, or a Pisces? If you were born on April 15th, then Pisces would have the affect on you because the sun was in Pisces when you were born.). Also, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_redefinition_of_planet.html" title="2006 redefinition of planet">2006 redefinition of planet</a> explains that on August 24 of this year, a decision will be made on whether to set a definition for "planet" which has the potential of causing there to be 12 planets instead of 9 (not counting Sedna). Will this affect astrology? If not, why not? User:Walkinglikeahuricane 5:36, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Boy, you ask a lot of questions! Answers will depend on who you ask.</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>"If you say that these two versions of astrology were "invented", are you implying that all astrology was invented?"</i> Of course it was. Astrology is a series of methods that uses the planets, other objects, and measurements of the celestial sphere to make either make predictions or symbolize people, events, and situations. All such methods are invented at one time or another. I mean that broadly without quibbling about the semantics of 'invention' versus 'tradition' or 'evolution' because every aspect of tradition has been thought up by someone. Every measure that is granted significance was deemed significant by someone's criteria of establishing meaning.</p>
<p><i>"And if not, then you must be assuming that some are indeed fictious (such as horary, as stated above), for surely something supposedly as real as astrology cannot be "invented", but instead it must be discovered."</i> Surely, not. I'm not saying some types or methods are fictitious and others real.</p>
<p><i>"And what about the constellation Ophiuchus? Ophiuchus is contained within the ecliptic and yet it is not part of the Zodiac. Why did astrologers decide to leave it out?"</i> It wasn't deemed significant in the tradition, so no astrological significance was assigned to it. No one in ancient Greece or Late Babylon considered it a part of the zodiac, so it was left out of the tradition. It's hard to shake the cultural and traditional significance of 12 and 7.</p>
<p><i>"Does a constellation only affect you if the astrologers are aware of it?"</i> A question best left to someone else. Even so, most astrologers don't think constellations affect anyone, most are unconcerned for constellations but are more interested in the measures based not on constellations but on Ptolemy's division of ecliptic starting with the eastern tropic.</p>
<p><i>"Another reason why astrology has no basis is because the Zodiac is only accurate to when astrology was invented..."</i> Not quite. Astrology was practiced long before the tropical zodiac became the basis for the category of signs. The tropic zod is another contingency along the way of astrology's history.</p>
<p><i>" (ex: If you were born on April 15th, say, then astrologically, you would be Aries. But astronomically, you would be Pisces. Which is it? Are you really an Aries, or a Pisces? "</i> In Indian astrology, you would still be a Pisces. The likely reason for this is that the Greek immigrants in Indian were not aware of Ptolemy or importing material prior to Ptolemy. By the time they had Ptolemy's redefinition of the zodiac, the sidereal zodiac stuck.</p>
<p>On definition of planets, <i>"Will this affect astrology? If not, why not?"</i> Someone added links to articles on the redefinition sight to astrologers' opinions (mainly that it will not affect astrology). I think it will change how some astrologers interpret. On the speculation that Ceres will become a planet, I'm already seeing astrologers grant meaning to it. Some astrologers (such as Phil Sedgwick in western U.S) have already been astrologically interpreting every astronomical discovery (Sedna, black holes, galaxies, etc). This is quite the pluralistic postmodern approach. Some astrologers will only use the traditional 7 planets (including sun and moon) because that's the system they choose.

<p>Yeah, that guy has a lot of points, but he is also too stubborn to realize the only proof you need is look around you. Astrology is proven true to me everyday...now I'm not saying astrology is perfect....but all I know is that YES, when and where you are born directly effects your personally from birth to death. This truth is undeniable. (unsigned - [[User:TheJesterRace07])</p>

<p>What are astrologers going to do when they find out that Pluto is not a planet?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think Pluto's classification has much influence on how it is used in astrology, and it's notable that astrologers use the Sun and Moon, though these are not technically considered planets by today's definition. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuella_f97b.html" title="User:Samuella">Sam</a> 22:58, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is there a source for the claim of a correspondence between the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_arts.html" title="Liberal arts">liberal arts</a> and the planets? This passage was first inserted in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astrology&amp;diff=9451399&amp;oldid=9451171" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astrology&amp;diff=9451399&amp;oldid=9451171" rel="nofollow">an anonymous edit</a> in January 2005, and has remained substantially the same since then. The only citation that was added in support of it was deceptive, pointing to a Wikipedia mirror rather than a confirming scholarly source. In my opinion, the passage needs to be reworded, at a minimum, so that the mention of planets doesn't precede the mention of the liberal arts -- such a correspondence, if it was historically claimed, would have been more like a clever trope to symbolically arrange the liberal arts (along the lines of a Porphyrian "tree of knowledge") than an idea created concomitantly with the evolution of the liberal arts. And it would be great to have an actual citation in support of the claim. -- <a href="../../../r/b/e/User%7ERbellin_dc87.html" title="User:Rbellin">Rbellin</a>|<a href="../../../r/b/e/User_talk%7ERbellin_8a70.html" title="User talk:Rbellin">Talk</a> 02:48, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

But when I followed that link I found some decent discussion of how common belief in astrology is, and the accusation that it is a pseudoscience, but no evidence of Astrology having "repeatedly failed to demonstrate its effectiveness in controlled studies." Maybe it was there and I didn't see it, or maybe the anti-astrology folks need a different reference, or maybe this claim is too strong (indeed I can see how a particular Astrological theory might fail to demonstrate its effectiveness in a controlled study, but given the broad definitions used by this cite and the NSF webcite (Which defines it as "that the position of the stars and planets can effect people's lives," eesh), seasonal affective disorder, or any other form of seasonality would be an empirically verifiable astrological phenomena according to these kinds of broad definitions.

<p>Espoo was right, "effective" isn't really the right word for this line, look at the studies that these two sources claim astrology has failed, matching birth charts to owners, compatibility distribution curves and divorces, sun sign and job correlations, stuff like that. How is "repeatedly failed empirical tests in controlled studies"? Notice that Smit even argues at the end that there is an important sense in which Astrology is "effective" despite its failure at the empirical tests. Also "repeatedly" and "numerous" seems redundant and prejudicial. <a href="../../../b/m/o/User%7EBmorton3_53a2.html" title="User:Bmorton3">Bmorton3</a> 14:58, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Glad to see you take an interest in this topic - some of the edits can benefit from attention by logicians. While Vorpal is right to revert, you are correct about effectiveness. Effectiveness is ambiguous and can be measured in different ways, such as a client's satisfaction with astrological counseling or belief that astrology helped them know their situation. Espoo's edit was "as it has repeatedly failed to demonstrate its claimed ability to predict future events (incl. past events on the basis of earlier ones) in numerous controlled studies." This is an improvement because what was tested was claims of prediction (including knowledge of past events). This is awkward to define without saying 'to predict past, present and future', so your suggestion is good. The second edit made by Espoo is also problematic because the site sourced doesn't say anything about exposing astrology as 'fraud' (which is intentional deceit) or distinguishing between common sense and critical thinking. This strikes as an original research claim. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 16:48, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh I wasn't criticizing Vorpal, I was trying to move the discussion to the talk page because of the inherent controversialness of the topic. I think "failed to demostrate its claimed ability to predict future events (etc)" isn't correct either, for those two citations, although there might be others down at the bottom of the article that would support that claim. Like I said those studies do things like show that putatively trained astrologers cannot match people to their birth charts as well as chance, which isn't an effectiveness issue, or a prediction issue, but is a experiment that turned out in ways that cast doubt on Astrology. I think "repeatedly failed empirical tests in controlled studies" is accurate to what those two citations show, and vague enough for the lead section, so you can keep the detailed stuff in the last section of the article. I guess I do still have a vague interest in this topic, although I haven't done much conventional astrology for years, I didn't even draw a chart for my last neice. I'll change the lead in a day or two if no one has a good counter-suggestion or argument. <a href="../../../b/m/o/User%7EBmorton3_53a2.html" title="User:Bmorton3">Bmorton3</a> 16:08, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Just as soon as superior research tools are invented to measure the mechanics explaining HOW Astrology works, then you so-called academics can have something to chew on.

<dd>Do we have any evidence that the scientific view is the majority view? I've seen surveys that around 25% of the US believes in Astrology, but what proportion of the other 75% disbelieve in it and what proportion are neutral or undecided? What percentage of non-astrology believers believe that it is a psuedo-science or superstition? My guess would be that most people don't care, or don't know quite what a "pseudo-science" is and that the view that astrology is correct, and the view that it is a pseudo-science are BOTH minority views, rather than the scientific view being a majority view, but I could be wrong, anyone got evidence? Our task as I understand it is to <b>represent the majority view as the majority view, and the minority view as the minority view</b> But that doesn't itself establish that the scientific view is the majority view, although I've seen good evidence that the astrological view is the minority view (in the US, Brazil might be a different story ..., also there is a big generational gap, people under 35 are like 45% believers in Astrology last I saw.) <a href="../../../b/m/o/User%7EBmorton3_53a2.html" title="User:Bmorton3">Bmorton3</a> 13:45, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>Belief in pseudoscience is widespread. For example, at least a quarter of the U.S. population believes in astrology, i.e., that the position of the stars and planets can affect people's lives. Although two-thirds (66%) of those queried in 2004 said that astrology is "not at all scientific," about one-third considered it at least "sort of scientific" (appendix table 7-14 Excel table.).[30]</i></dd>

In the 2005 survey, Europeans were asked whether or not they considered certain subjects to be scientific, using a 5-point scale (with higher values indicating that a subject is more scientific). About 4 out of 10 (41%) of those surveyed gave responses of 4 or 5 for astrology, the same as the score for economics. However, when the survey used the word "horoscopes" instead of astrology, only 13% gave a response of 4 or 5. Disciplines most likely to be considered scientific by Europeans were medicine (89%), physics (83%), biology (75%), mathematics (72%), astronomy (70%), and psychology (53%). History (34%) and homeopathy (33%) were at the bottom of the list (European Commission 2005a). Comparable U.S. data on the various disciplines do not exist.</dd>

<dd>In the United States, skepticism about astrology is strongly related to level of education: in 2004, 81% of college graduates said that astrology is "not at all scientific," compared with 51% of those with less than a high school education and 62% of those who had completed high school but not college. In Europe, however, respondents with college degrees were just as likely as others to claim that astrology is scientific.</dd>

<dd>No, this absolutely belongs in the intro. Not deploying the scientific opinion on the subject is to allow astrology to define itself without qualification. The quote from NPOV Vorpal deploys is the primary line of policy dealing with this.

<p><font size="1"><i>I find the optimism about science vs. pseudoscience to be baseless.

<p>Hey Vorpal you added the superstition category back and said see talk page for consensus. Is there a consensus that Astrology is a superstition? Do category markers require majority view, or one citation or what? We have citations of people in print claiming that Astrology is a superstition and that it isn't on the page. Which do we use to decide the appropriateness of a category? <a href="../../../b/m/o/User%7EBmorton3_53a2.html" title="User:Bmorton3">Bmorton3</a> 13:54, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First of all, scroll up a bit on this talk page for the previous discussion. Although I understand what Zeus is saying about astrology being a faulty knowledge system, rather that a superstition, I think that astrology is believed by a significant number of people to be a called a superstition because of it's irrational (wrt to science) belief that future events are somehow influenced by planets. I do believe we have citations in the article stating this. So, I think we should include this category. In fact, we could also edit to fit the superstition page as suggested, rather than remove the cat.<a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVorpal_blade_8a31.html" title="User:Vorpal blade"><font color="green">Vorpal Blade</font></a><a href="../../../v/o/r/User_talk%7EVorpal_blade_f4dc.html" title="User talk:Vorpal blade"><font color="blue"><sup>snicker-snack</sup></font></a> 04:17, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Regardless of whether the scientific POV is majority POV or whether this matters, I think the sentence about those who think astrology is pseudoscience belongs in the introductory paragraph where the difficulty of defining astrology is presented. It is an important position that has considerable influence on how astrology is presented in educational circuits. On the issue of superstition, as I said before, superstition is poorly defined in its wp article, and astrology as a whole does not fit the common use of that word, which is either a ritualistic action resulting in, or a belief that an occurrence symbolizes, good or bad luck. Astrology has a little bit to say about chance/fortune/luck but not much. Astrologers or believers in astrology may or may not treat astrological symbolism superstitiously, but it is not an inherent and defining characteristic of astrology. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 15:26, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>oh keep the pseudo-science claims in the lead (they are documented). Also the lead doesn't claim that astrology IS a superstition, only that it's critics CLAIM it is, which if fair, and probably central to understanding Astrologies' overall role in our culture. My worry is whether we should categorize Astrology as superstition down at the botton in the cats, for the kinds of reasons Zeusnoos mentions. <a href="../../../b/m/o/User%7EBmorton3_53a2.html" title="User:Bmorton3">Bmorton3</a> 15:49, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK I went through the last two archives, and I found a lot of less than civil bickering, for which all present have my sympathies, and a certain degree of consensus on issues concerning claims about pseudo-science and proto-science terms, claims, citations, categories etc. I saw no evidence of a consensus concerning "superstition," and this page sure seems to be plenty of counter-evidence that there is not a consensus on this topic one way or the other as to whether the superstition category is appropriate to apply to astrology. If there was once a consensus on this and I missed it please point it out. Further a lot of the arguments concerning the pseudo-science issue do not seem to translate well to me to the superstition issue. For example, WP has a lot of policies in the definition of NPOV about how NPOV and SPOV are supposed to relate and a whole paragraph on pseudo-science in particular, but no corresponding policies on superstition. (unless you count the avoid religious bias clause). But just because something isn't science or even is pseudo-science doesn't make it a superstition. Likewise there was much discussion on "onus" and "reverse onus" (basically burden of proof issues) and while that line of reasoning may work for the pseudo-science issue because of WP's policies, I can't see how it works for the superstition issue. Nor is it clear that scientists per se are the relevant experts to decide what is or isn't a superstition, that looks like the job of social scientists, probably folklorists or scholars of magic or religion. The superstition page is lacking in in-line citation, and lists the folklorist defintion of superstition at the bottom, while having one odd unreferenced definition as the lead. But astrology even if false, doesn't fit either of these definitions very well. Certainly the astronomer we cite is evidence that astrologies' critics consider it a superstition, (actually hmm Fraknoi cites a number of troubling studies and calls it fantasy and pseudo-science, but I don't see him using the word superstition), but not a very good source for claiming that it really is a superstition, (as opposed to some other kind of astronomically inappropriate belief). Even if Astrology were an irrational belief that the future could be predicted, it wouldn't be an irrational belief that the future could be influenced by specific behaviours. I just don't see a consensus here on superstition. Part of respecting consensus is admitting when there isn't one. <a href="../../../b/m/o/User%7EBmorton3_53a2.html" title="User:Bmorton3">Bmorton3</a> 19:01, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Definitionism is tricky, since it changes depending on your source. This subject is cited as a superstition by a number of good sources, which is the most important thing.

<dd>While this is not usually the best way to check for common opinion on definitions, I googled superstition. Throwing out wikipedia and infidels.org, and a music studio, the first three sites all confirm the definition I offered above. It takes a giant leap of imagination (or agnoia) to fit astrology in with superstition, which is used interchangeably with 'urban legend' and 'old wives tales'.

<p>I rewrote the definition in the introduction that was significantly edited by Silence without discussion here. I removed quasi-mystical because there is nothing mystical (not sure what quasi-m is) about the common practice of astrology - there is no Plotinian flight to the One nor a union with an ineffable divine presence nor a negative theology. Astrology doesn't just use bodies (planets and stars) but measures of the celestial sphere - imum coeli, etc. It claims correspondence with earthly <i>and</i> human affairs since some mundane astrology covers attempts at earthquake prediction and weather phenomena. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 15:42, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>More restrictedly, LOTS of Astrology isn't mystical. Union with the ineffable divine presence, Plotinian flight and negative theology DO all occur in some strands, these are all present in the Gnostic traditions of ascent through the heavenly spheres for example, or in the traditions of Haran.

<dd>Well, I wouldn't call gnosticism (any branch of it in antiquity) a type of astrology or even a use of astrology. In fact, there are direct statements against astrology in gnosticism since since the planets were considered evil archons with the intention of keeping the soul enslaved to a fatalistic cosmos. And astrological symbolism is used in theurgy, but Iamblichus had to alter the meaning of astrology, distinguish his use of correspondences from apotelesmatics. His use of it is not incomparable to Hermetic use of astrological meanings of the planets (as qualities that the soul sheds when ascending). Again, not astrology itself as it was taught and practices at the time but incorporation of its symbols. Two years ago I attended a lecture in a seminar series that was to center around astrology in antiquity. The talk was about examples of Hellenistic Jewish reverence for the planets and stars. Nowhere in the entire lecture was there anything about astrology - this loose use of the term for anything that is not astronomy and involves the planets or stars is troublesome. It was nearly universal (with a few exceptions such as Anaxagoras) that the planets were living beings or gods. This does not make astrology. I've written about this sort of stuff somewhere.... <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 16:47, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>See "On the Doctrine of the Eigth and Ninth" or "Zostrianos" in Nag Hammadi, or Zosimos' "On the Letter Omega" or the old apolytrosis texts, or for that matter the modern Ecclessia Gnostica stuff. You and I disagree about the use of astrology in Gnosticism. It is true that ancient Gnostics disagreed with each other, and much of the function of the study of Astrology was to escape the influence of the planetary rulers (which some thought were evil, and others thought were merely to be transcended eventually), but trying to escape the rule of the planetary rulers IS a form of use of astrology! (And a fairly mystical one) (and you've got to beleive in the planetary rulers to want to escape them, and studying their ways is a natural strategy to take). Perhaps you mean that Gnostic and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harran.html" title="Harran">Harranian</a> Astrology resembles Samaratian (and thus Babylonian) Astrology more than Horoscopic Astrology, which is fair. It is unfair to limit astrology to horoscopic astrology. We know from Zosimos that Maria the Jewess at least used astrology to time the use of her furnaces in alchemy, which is a Hellenistic Jewish use of astrology that seems to fit the definitions. When Dante ascends through the heavens in an exstatic state, and studies them and describes them and draws spiritual conclusions from what he encounters there which are to be used in life later, does that seem like Astrology to you? It surely isn't Horoscopy, but it looks like Astrology to me. <a href="../../../b/m/o/User%7EBmorton3_53a2.html" title="User:Bmorton3">Bmorton3</a> 18:18, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Brian, I've read these works (except for modern gnostica), and to be fair, yes they would have had to know the planetary ruler to escape it, and knowing it was half the battle and a difficult exercise (<i>De mysterii</i>, 8.1-3). But they weren't going around practicing astrology like Valens, Hephaistio, Manetho (not the historian) to predict things, elect times, or know fate. I'm not limiting astrology to horoscopic, (in fact that reminds me I wanted to put katarche back in the See also). I think a limit should be drawn, however - otherwise everything dealing with celestial beings or regions gets labeled astrology. As far as Dante and the heavens, this is a part of the Hermetic tradition, and rooted in Plato's Timaeus where the planets (as it was interpreted by later Platonists) help the demiurge by fashioning bodies and given characteristics to souls. I would prefer to say that Hermeticism (of this sort, not referring to Fowden's early 'technical Hermetica' or the Hellenistic texts attributed to the Hermetic line) uses some astrological symbolism without being astrology proper. Back to practicality, I think we were talking about mystical. Mystical means some sort of direct unmediated contact, though the editor who put this in may have meant the vernacular 'mystifying'. Does this strike you as a proper description of astrology or one prominent enough to be in the opening description? <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 21:00, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't think mystical or any of its roots belongs in the opening, I agree with you there. How to define mysticism is another mess, but the mystical can certainly be mediated contact as well as unmediated. I suspect that we are not disagreeing on our interpretations of the ancients, or on the best wording of the opening section, but on the definition of astrology. I would be inclined to say that one common USE of astrology is to predict things, elect times, or know fate, (and this is certainly the most common use today) but that this is not the limit or definition of astrology. Everything dealing with the formal study of celestial beings or regions, except perhaps modern astronomy, seems like a pretty good definition of astrology to me (and I'd be tempted to say that Astronomy is just a modern sub-branch Astrology, but hey I know I'm not in the consensus there). Maybe what you are talking about should be called "divinatory astrology" since it is broader than horoscopy, but still includes only the divinatory uses of astrology. I suppose we could invent a new word for my broad sense "caelology" and then reserve the term astrology for divinatory uses of Caelology, but that is misdescribing the tradition. I think we're just disagreeing about where the bounds between "astrological" and "astrology proper" are. Can either of us find evidence for how broadly or narrowly the word was defined or used anciently or medievally? <a href="../../../b/m/o/User%7EBmorton3_53a2.html" title="User:Bmorton3">Bmorton3</a> 21:16, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm certainly happy with your suggestion of coining a broader category for meaning from the heavens. As a grecophile, I would have preferred ouranology, but by googling I see this was already coined since it is used in conference papers for the Society of Biblical Literature - and possibly for just such a meaning. Something worth looking into at any rate. As far as evidence for the terminology, there were a number of words for astrology and astrologers. In Greek and Latin, the number of instances and the contexts can be found through searching the PHI and TLG databases. I find it more useful to go by the terms that astrologers themselves use rather than the term given to them by skeptics and non-astrologers (when they don't match). Sextus E uses 'astrologoi' for astrologers and 'astrologia' for astrology in general, but he brings together a number of terms and makes some distinctions - that he introduces his Pros astrologous in this way indicates to me that by 2nd Century there still was not popular consensus on what astrology and astrologers are called. He mentions mathematikoi, genethlialogia and apotelesmata, and is quite familiar with the regular astrological terminology. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 14:14, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>We can't prefer the terms astrologers used over the ones of skeptics when trying to determine who does and doesn't count as an astrologer without begging the question. I'd just assert that Sextus Empiricus is himself an astrologer (albeit perhaps a non-Dogmatic one) because he is inquiring into the issues investigated also by other astrologers. I'll look again at SE and Zosimos at some point. But your intuition really is that only divinatory astrology counts as astrology, and any other goals for studying celestial beings must be some other discipline rather than some other use of the discipline of astrology? <a href="../../../b/m/o/User%7EBmorton3_53a2.html" title="User:Bmorton3">Bmorton3</a> 15:07, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By this definition, because I know about astrology, and perhaps I have written about it too, that I'm an astrologer, although I do not practice it. Maybe I'm an astrologerologer or a metastrologer because I study the study of astrology. My intuition on this is that an astrologer is someone who practices or teaches astrology with the intention to convey its 'truth'. Does every person who has studied astrology become an astrologer? Sure there may be a few grey cases, but SE an astrologer? He's one of the deadliest foes to astrology of his time, although not typically original in his arguments. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 16:30, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Now we are disputing about the nature of skepticism. Is a researcher on the topic of medical treatments who argues that a certain medical treatment doesn't work a medical researcher because of the topic of investigation, or an anti-medical researcher because of opposing the opinions of other medical researchers or both? Usually we say they are a medical researcher opposing a particular medical theory. What about physics? Is an anti-physicist a physicist who opposes a particular physical theory? What about ethics? Philosophy? Literature? other fields? My intuition is that quite generally we admit such people to the revelent terms but portray them as opposing certain theories. SE is an astrologer who opposed some astrological theories (by compiling the thought of others mostly), he is both an astrologer and a deadly foe of some astrological theories, just as most scholars are both scholars of a field and deadly foes of theories within those fields with which they dispute. Certainly Newton was both a physicist and a deadly foe of some physics theories. Also there are certainly astrologers who practice astrology in the sense of giving advise based on charts while also stopping short of attempting to convey its 'truth' either for legal protection reasons, or genuine skepticism. Back when I drew charts for people, I certainly expressed skepticism of the validity of the theories employed rather than assuring of their truths. But certainly, I'd concede that skeptics are an odd border-case rather than the normal cases. <a href="../../../b/m/o/User%7EBmorton3_53a2.html" title="User:Bmorton3">Bmorton3</a> 16:47, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Certainly every other word can't be controversial?&#160;:P I'm not saying all of the citations should be removed, just that there hardly needs to be two after almost every word in a sentence.

<p>OK, I realize that they are necessary, but would it be possible to trim reduntant ones down and pick the absolute best representation of the topic being cited? In some cases, there are up to three just by one word followed by more in the same sentence which is really disruptive to text flow.<br />
For example, in "As a descriptive language for the mind", three are given to uphold one fact about Geoffrey Chaucer when all that is needed is one source backing up that he writes using astrological symbolism or that an understanding of astrological symbolism is needed to fully understand his writings. Cleaning citations up would also help shorten the length of "Notes and references", a mammoth section averting the casual reader from the resources on the bottom. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuella_f97b.html" title="User:Samuella">Sam</a> 03:47, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I did my best to expand the pathetically small 'Further reading' section; I might add more later, but for now this seems like a decent list when compared to what it was a few hours ago. I made sure that all of the books were written by highly respected authors and published by respectable presses, institutions, and/or universities (i.e. people and places that practice/study SERIOUS astrology and engage in SERIOUS research regarding the subject). There are no "pop-astrology" or "Sun-sign astrology" books to be found on the list. I'd like to add more (reputable and sourced) books that deal with non-Western astrology or other branches/areas of the vast discipline, including Vedic, Cosmobiology/Uranian/Hamburg School, Jewish astrology, Greco-Roman, Babylonian, Chinese/Asian, etc. We also need to get together a good list of books that deal explicitly with the <b>history of astrology</b> as this is VERY important (I noticed MANY whilst browsing Amazon.com, but I'm not sure which are 'the best' so I hesitated to put them in the list). Again though, if we wish to expand this list further we need to MAKE FULLY SURE that the books are from reputable, reliable, and respected authors, institutions, colleges/universities, and/or organizations. --<a href="../../../p/s/e/User%7EPseudothyrum_ca2f.html" title="User:Pseudothyrum">Pseudothyrum</a> 02:53, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While we're trying to cut down the volume of this article, I agree that a few more books were needed, but not many. All are ok references -Berlinski is a bit journalistically fluffy but he manages to pull together a popular account (with considerable speculation) by consulting the right sources. Since this is not primarily an article on the history of astrology, you may want to add the sources you have in mind (including the primary sources such as Ptolemy and Kepler) to the history of astrology page instead. The best works on this subject are unfortunately not in English. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 13:25, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Removed effect size argument because of strongly biased sources. Effect size should be calculated for the best and most studied evidence available, which is Gauquelin's "Mars effect" and Ertel's "eminence effect". Ertel's citation frequency analysis, which remains effectively unchallenged, found a clear linear relationship between Mars placement and eminence in 100% of the samples in all the Mars-athlete studies, including not only all Mars data collected by Gauquelin (n=4384), but all the Mars data collected and tested by astrology critics (n=1664). The combined total represents a large sample. Eminence increases in proportion to Mars in the predicted zones. Citation sources on effect size that ignore very strong effects based on large samples but report only negligible effects based on very small sample sizes should not be documented in Wikipedia as if they are neutral. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 12:49, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Harald88, see citation 49 in the article, also 47 and 48.

<p>Removed unscientific CFEPP study (Benski, et al. "Mars Effect": A French Test of Over 1000 Sports Champions, 1996). This study fails to subject its data to "eminence effect" analysis, which had long been hypothesised by Gauquelin and was substantiated by Professor Ertel, who published in 1988, eight years prior to the CFEPP study ("Raising the Hurdle for the Athletes' Mars Effect: Association Co-Varies With Eminence," 1988). Gauquelin himself also mentions this study in his later published work ("Is there Really a Mars Effect," 1988). In scientific method, all hypotheses that could impact results must be carefully considered. The CFEPP study ignored an analysis that was reputed to be the strongest demonstration of positive findings in such a study. This is unscientific. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 18:57, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you are going to remove everything like that, then virtually the entirity of all the astrology references get removed.

<dd>I don't think so. In this case Ertel raised the hurdle and Gauquelin gave it the last word in his final summation of the Mars effect. To him it was the clincher.

<dd>Astrology research is not mainstream science. If we are going to accept publishing a topic on astrology and science at all, which is not mainstream science, then we need to follow the chronology of events within the small scientific community that was involved and accept the publications they used among themselves, much of which is now available on the Internet, as can be amply seen by the citations in use. In an area as limited as this is, mainstream science publications are irrelevant. To demand otherwise is an injustice to science. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 19:05, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>PLenty of people have found mistakes in Ertel's work. Zelin showed that the original figures were biased, and Ertel reused many of them making the same mistakes again. This is why Ertel never had the courage to submit to a mainstream journal, because his work was flawed. Instead he published in a non-notable comedy piece, and cried "bias!" as to why he didn't attempt better. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a> 07:46, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Ertel's analysis accepts all Mars-athlete data indiscriminately, even the most inferior athletes in any quantity, the more data the better. That is the beauty of it. The Mars association co-varies with eminence. I do not know if Ertel submitted to any mainstream journal, but that is irrelevant because the study and the publication that published it is well known among the researchers. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 16:19, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You are making the mistake of accepting all of Ertel's work and his supporters at face value. If it were that good, he should have published in a serious journal. Ertel didn't publish in a reliable source, so by Wikipedia standards, that means his "findings" are no better than opinion. End of story as far as Wikipedia is concerned. Until he publishes in a mainstream journal, your position is untenable under current policy. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a> 22:10, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed Ertel's work should be taken at face value at this time because no one has been able to find anything wrong with it for 18 years and the simple analytic technique he used has caused considerable embarassment to studies done afterward because it shows their flaws. The journal in which Ertel published, JSE, does not cater to mainstream or popular tastes in science, but it is certainly a serious peer-reviewed scientific journal. As I pointed out earlier, astrology research is not mainstream, so if Wikipedia is going to have this article at all, it needs to use the publications that this particular scientific community uses among themselves. Both JSE and Correlation publish astrology articles that are both pro and con. The skeptic sources used in this article are mainly books, web pages, and non-peer-reviewed journals. If there is any flexibility here at all, it needs to bend both ways. The skeptics have been getting off way to easy with their sources. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 00:48, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've added this article to the category obsolete scientific theories.

Every superceded scientific theory was at one point a proto-science by definition, near as I can tell. In fact astrology is one of the examples used on the proto-science page. There there are certainly some disputes on that talk page. But why not leave both the superceded cat, and the proto-science cat? Surely even Astrology's detractors are willing to admit that it was protoscience during some of the periods discussed on this page. I don't like fighting about cats, but c'mon. Further, there are clearly still astrologers trying to engage in scientific validation of parts of astrological theory, despite the consensus of the scientific community.

<p>Actually the categories "obsolete scientific theory" "pseudo-science" and "protoscience" are ALL inappropriate! The guidelines for categorization are quite different than I thought they were. From <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategory_37f1.html" title="Wikipedia:Category">Wikipedia: Category</a> "8. Categories appear without annotations, so be careful of NPOV when creating or filling categories. Unless it is self-evident and uncontroversial that something belongs in a category, it should not be put into a category." Whatever else can be said about the extent to which Astrology is properly described as "pseudo-science" "proto-science" or "superceded science" none of these terms is "self-evident and uncontroversial." I had thought the guideline was basically "add an article to any vaguely plausible category." But if the guideline is "do not put the article in the category unless it is self-evident and uncontroversial" then none of these categories can be sustained. I think we should keep discussions of accusations of psuedo-science, proto-science or supercession on the page (with appropriate citations), but that none of these should be categories. Anyone want to argue that these are "self-evident and uncontroversial?" <a href="../../../b/m/o/User%7EBmorton3_53a2.html" title="User:Bmorton3">Bmorton3</a> 18:44, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No the <i>guideline</i> isn't superceded by the <i>policy</i>. The policy says "to represent the majority view as the majority view" but the <i>guideline</i> says that it takes <b>more</b> than a <i>majority</i> view to put something in a category, it takes being "self-evident and uncontroversial." I concede that the scientific view should be considered the majority view here. I do not concede that it is such a strong super-majority as to be "self-evident and uncontroversial." We try hard to present the majority view as majority in the article where we can annotate the disputes appropriately. Since we cannot annotate categories in any way, we have to hold them to a much higher standard. Categories are not mediating a dispute, or reporting how it is defined, those are both done in the article; categories are designed to help users find information in a non-controversial way. There are careful doctrines on NPOV and Pseudoscience in the NPOV policy, but they are not designed to claim that the scientific POV is non-controversial, only that it is to be treated as the majority position. The long-standing compromise argument is a far better point, but that has clearly been re-opened by trying to challenge the proto-science cat. <a href="../../../b/m/o/User%7EBmorton3_53a2.html" title="User:Bmorton3">Bmorton3</a> 20:00, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Second, as has been pointed out on various topics, if "this is controversial" can be used to revoke the pseudoscience cat it would never be employed as partisans of topics will always have a means to declaim it. The guideline you cite essentially becomes suppressive at the point, as it can be used to exclude any category seen as critical of a topic. This is obviously a senseless loophole, and to turn it around it would be just as controversial to me to <i>not</i> categorize this under pseudoscience if the scientific majority terms it such. As suggested above, we need to separate whether it actually <i>is</i> one from whether it is <i>termed</i> one. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 06:59, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Policies always supercede guidelines <i>when they disagree</i>. You and I agree on this point. I think this is a case where the policy and the guideline do not disagree. The policy says treat the majority opinion as the majority opinion. The guideline says, it takes far more than a majority opinion to include something in a category. How is that a disagreement? This looks like a case where both apply without any disagreement. If the cat "pseudoscience" can always be opposed by attempting to follow the guidelines, then either "pseudoscience" isn't a very good category, or the guidelines on categories need revision. A category like "Best American Musicians of the 20th century" would be a useless category precisely because nothing would be uncontroversial enough to go in it. My guess is that "pseudoscience" is in the same boat, because it is an inherently controversial categorization. But it is also possible that we should instead rework the categorization guidelines. A third route, what I suspect will be taken, is simply to ignore the guidelines when they are inconvenient for the majority side, perhaps citing policies like WP:IAR. This route is a dangerous precedent for the future when you are not on the majority side. It would be controversial NOT to include it in the category "pseudoscience" you are right, but the guidelines have shown us how to deal with the controversy, DO NOT INCLUDE a page where the inclusion is controversial. Side A says include it, Side B says don't. The guidelines say in the case of a page present the majority position (with citations), significant minority positions (with citations), and move insignificant minority positions off page, in the case of a category, do not include in cases of controversy. This isn't a senseless loophole its a resolution procedure for fights on whether or not to include something in a category, just like the kind of fight we are having here. <a href="../../../b/m/o/User%7EBmorton3_53a2.html" title="User:Bmorton3">Bmorton3</a> 14:54, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't believe that comparing the categories "Best American Musicians of the 20th century" and "Pseodoscience" is fair. I'd say that what is science and what is pseodoscience is possible to determine much more objectively than who is the best musician. It is quite clear that astrology's modern attempts at being a science puts it into the pseudoscience category. It might be argued that astrology at some point conformed to the criterions of protoscience, but not today. Thus, I agree with Count Iblis, for whatever that is worth. <a href="../../../e/t/h/User%7EEthicsGradient_384b.html" title="User:EthicsGradient">EthicsGradient</a> 15:13, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, but Astrology is both a protoscience AND a prescience. Astrology is a protoscience according to no longer valid scientific "laws." Astrology is a prescience according to the latest discovered scientific "laws." Each discovery in physics doesn't weaken Astrologers claims, but rather comes closer to explaining how and why Astrology works.

<p>I am not particularly interested in astrology, but I notice a semantic problem in this article and in the treatment of the subject generally. What seems to be the first barrier in the scientific examination of astrology is the statement that celestial bodies "<i>influence</i>" our lives, personalities, etc.<br />
<br />
Would it not be more productive, and more accurate, to instead say that the celestial bodies <i>reflect</i> our lives, personalities, etc.? By way of a simple example, instead of saying that Mercury going retrograde "causes" misfunctions, accidents, or whatever, we would instead say that Mercury going retrograde reflects a time when such events are more likely to occur, and therefore one may predict the likelihood of such events by studying the movements of the celestial bodies in relation to Earth.<br />
<br />
Such a simple semantic change may assist in removing one (admittedly not the most important) barrier from the immediate dismissal of astrology by science, and also would be indicative of some of the underlying assumptions of astrology. Though I am not a great student of this subject (I have studied the history of alchemy to a certain extent, and many of the ancient philosophers who have touched on this subject), it appears to me that, as the universe was apparently created of a piece, all parts would likely reflect the whole, and therefore with enough study one might indeed be able to predict possible future events, at least on our level (leaving quantum physics aside). Such study might require an unlimited amount of time and an infinite number of observations, the human mind being what it is (and accumulated knowledge would render this more achievable), but it appears to me at least possible.<br />
<br />
I'm sure this is not as coherent as I intended it, but it's an idea I've had for some time now and I thought it might be worth sharing.</p>

<p>What happens when the end or beginning date of a sign is changed?

I know they're still on the cusp, but does that make them a Gemini/Cancer as opposed to a Cancer/Gemini, as it was before it was changed?

Thank's to leap year the next year a sun crosses the same sign cusp will still be 365.25 days later, but could appear on our calendar as occuring a day earlier.

<dd>The date you're referring to is position of the Sun in tropical Gemini. Dates for the tropical zodiac will never change because it is aligned with the seasons. Different sources will have different dates, but it's a minor discrepancy rather than a change; they're never more than a day or two different.

<dd>Since serious Astrologers study psychology, our psychologist hero, Carl Jung (whose research validated the synastry of couples) used the term "synchronicity." If you bothered to study the history of science, you'd know that each major discovery in physics or astronomy gets CLOSER to an explanation as to how Astrology works. If you bother to read about "hyper dimensional space," (aka hyperspace) you would not have a problem with the term "correlation." We cannot have a "clearly defined theory of the connection between celestial movements and everything else" until the research equipment used by physicists improves.

<dd>The article you mention is refering specifically to the idea that a correlation between A and B does not mean A caused B or vice versa. It does not exclude a tertiary cause or causes that a scientist might include in the next hypothesis and experiment if the correlation is significant. Correlations are still useful in science but in a limited way; and drawing any conclusions from correlations is never done without extreme caution. By "imply" I did not mean the technical use as "entail". BTW, I had to revert your change of 'supposed correlation' to 'empirical' observation since you are introducing a POV term that has even more problems than the term correlation. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 14:57, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, but you are assuming that astrology asserts causation. Some few astrologers who take things too literally might, but I don't think that's the common view. The whole idea of the possibility of gravitation affecting individuals on the planet is so... Newtonian. The basis of astrology was in the observations and correlations of first the Babylonians, then the Greeks, etc. If they could have been said to have had any theory of causation at all involving astrology, it would have been that the planets were the Gods and that their relative positions might reveal the relative strengths and mood of the Gods. It's actually more akin to <a href="../../../j/u/n/Jungian_psychology.html" title="Jungian psychology">Jungian psychology</a>, where Jung describes the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archetype.html#Jungian_archetypes" title="Archetype">archetypes</a>, their natures and effect within the psyche, but hardly goes so far as attempt to assert causation. Observation of <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synchronicity.html" title="Synchronicity">synchronicities</a> and prediction based on past records thereof is closer to how astrology is perceived by the practitioners thereof. Before you can criticize it as making claims of causation, you will first have to document those claim, and show that they are the main view, rather than a minority view, within astrology. 02:57, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am sorry, my curiosity got the better of me: Andrew, could you give me an example of a "major discovery in physics or astronomy" which explains how astrology works and <i>how</i> it does this? A reference to an article or previous post would be equally appreciated, but bear in mind its the how I am interested in.

<dd>I love folk repeating their lame debunking that they already used before. You lost your arguements before - it was only your power of relentless censorship that had you delude yourself that your arguements before were of consequence. I know Wikipedia moderators aren't required to have a working knowledge on the topics they're monitoring, but in your science courses in Scandinavia you never learned that "attraction" replaced "gravity"? So, that the celestial influences of the outer planets of the solar system upon Earth are better explained by "the law of attraction" rather than by "the law of gravity"? You flatter yourself pretending that it's just because of your "curiosity" which justifies your ceaseless pseudo-sceptic attacks. You've proved that you aren't any better informed now than you were a year ago. After this post I'm not wasting any more responses upon you. Just re-read my posts from months ago.

<dd>I'm sure they do teach string theory at upper level courses a lot of places. But the theory is not universally accepted yet, as you probably know. Did you attend such courses in the US? I study philosophy, myself, so my knowledge of physics comes from philosophy of science courses - the metaphysical background of Bohrs model for the atom. Besides that, its strictly a hobby of mine to read up on these things (as it is to ask and read on astrology, crystal therapy, candling, breatharianism, etc.)</dd>

<dd>Not only am I not going to do your thinking for you, I won't be doing your reading for you either. Each advance in physics does NOT debunk Astrology, but rather gets CLOSER explaining how and why Astrology WORKS. The Law of Attraction, which replaced The Law of Gravity, gets closer to validating Astrology. Newtonian physics was replaced by quantum physics which was replaced by hyperdimensional space. You read your copy of Brian Greene and Michio Kaku on "hyperspace and string theory" and I'll read my copies and no I won't be reading to you. Lundse: I read George Gamow's "One, Two, Three, Infinity" in the "60s. Neils Bohr atomic model was valid THEN, but physics has moved on greatly since then. How can you be a self-respecting debunker when you bring a knife to a gun fight? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Homer_3ed5.html" title="User:Andrew Homer">Andrew Homer</a> 20:57, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Uhm, while this last post of yours, Andrew, is a fine repetition of your former claims, I just do not see any <i>explanation of how the validation is done</i>. Yes, you claim that hyperdimensional space and strings has taken over from quantum physics - even if I give you that (I do put more trust in Greene's own words that string theory is still forming and in no way a certainty), then how does this relate to astrology? Why are you not answering this question?</dd>
<dd>And about what we are bringing to the table (I don't like to think of it as a fight), then what I bring right now is questions. After getting answers I will make up my mind, maybe let you know what I think in order to let you correct any misunderstandings and let me know where I went wrong. But before I get any answers regarding how you believe astrology is validated, I am not going to criticize your beliefs. But I will not take your word that it is validated either, sorry.</dd>
<dd>I hope you or someone will answer me regarding these beliefs that new scientific breakthroughs are validating astrology, and will, of course, try to answer any questions you might have. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELundse_a2f1.html" title="User:Lundse">Lundse</a> 02:18, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>More on the "law of attraction" and validating astrology. Andrew, I did contact your Danish friend and she and a small number of her friends were very helpful in trying to find out what you mean by "attraction" as a new scientific theory - although, not being sure what exactly was meant, we have so far not been able to go into how the theory you mentioned relates to astrology.</dd>

If you meant string theory in general all the way through, then I am sorry for misunderstanding but I have simply not been able to find any usage of "attraction" within that theory as a new technical term.</dd>
<dd>Any help is appreciated, if someone knows what this theory might be, please step up. After identifying it, I hope to go into how it relates to astrology... <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELundse_a2f1.html" title="User:Lundse">Lundse</a> 22:46, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is the first time you have actually come out and said that the "theory of attraction" is supposed to be a part of string theory - that why. I have, however, googled and searched around a bit and I cannot find any mention of attraction along with either of those two which is used in any technical way (only as a synonym for gravity and/or things being pulled toward each other).</dd>
<dd>But OK, it is string theory you claim is validating astrology then? I know a bit about that, although the term "attraction" is new - as I understand it, string theory works with gravitons and uses the concept of multidimensional space to account for how gravity is so weak (some of them escape to other dimensions)...</dd>

I am not asking you to do anything but argue for your viewpoints (or show me where you or others have done so in the past). I cannot read your arguments in Greene or Kaku, nor do the astrologers you put me in contact with seem to know what you mean.</dd>
<dd>I am willing to be convinced by rational argument, but I will not blindly trust you.

<p>Now, I know there must be some real scientific studies intended to refute various aspects of astrology, but these are not those!

<p>I'm sorry, what part of astrology needs refuting? Actually, the way that science is conducted involves rigorous experimental testing, generally followed these days by publication to a scientific journal and subsequently by other researchers reproducing the findings. If astrology is a respected and well-founded science then you should be able to produce numerous articles that have gone through a rigorous peer review prior to publication. Since that does not appear to be the case, and since astrology attempts to be or at least have the appearance of a valid science, then it falls into the category of pseudoscience, period. There are no other considerations or arguments that will make it not so. Do not bother making further arguments towards that point.

<p>This page seems to contain a <i>lot</i> of external links. I've not had time to go through them all, but it doesn't seem very many of them meet the <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> guidelines, or the spirit of them-providing additional source material that we wouldn't be able to cover all of in the article. It seems most of them are tangentially related, to schools, software, etc., that just happen to deal with the same subject. That isn't really the purpose of external links. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 13:13, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed. It could use a trim. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuella_f97b.html" title="User:Samuella">Sam</a> 16:05, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Proposed deletions:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Schools" section â€” doesn't seem appropriate. Listing a few schools and not all of them is bias, and is complicated by the difficult judgment of which school is better than another</li>
<li>"Associations" â€” Informative, but not something this article is concerned with</li>
<li>"Tools and software" â€” Isn't directly relevant, and poses an opportunity for linkspam</li>
<li>"Natal and relationship reports" â€” Definitely delete. Huge problem with commercial linkspam here. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuella_f97b.html" title="User:Samuella">Sam</a> 04:10, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I agree with removing these 4 links. All of these links are inclined to heavy personal bias, and the criteria for including some links and not others is unclear. If there are no objections, let's remove them. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Cochrane_9e46.html" title="User:David Cochrane">DavidCochrane</a> 18:16, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Trimmed. Specific links themselves should come into review now. An HTML comment in the section to editors might be a good idea so that it doesn't get repopulated within a week. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuella_f97b.html" title="User:Samuella">Sam</a> 19:42, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Few main problems there-first, generally, we shouldn't link to social-network sites except in articles about those sites, or sometimes to the "official" page of a person or organization on that site. (For example, we might link to a band's "official" Myspace page.) Also, <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> strongly discourages against linking to "registration required" sites unless the information on them is so high-quality and essential as to be irreplaceable. Blogs and networking sites are generally considered to be pretty low-quality information, they're not an editorially-controlled or peer-reviewed source, and pretty much everything on them is unverified and possibly anonymous. We also run into the "Shhhh, everyone will want one" problem-links from WP tend to increase Google rank, so if we link to <i>one</i> blog, or <i>one</i> networking site, without a clear reason why it belongs and any other one wouldn't, we'll quickly have a very large EL section in that article. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 15:17, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are a lot of good objective judgments of the article on the <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Astrology_4b2b.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Astrology">featured article discussion</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_Astrology_838b.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Astrology">peer review page</a>. To get more of a focus on what needs to be done, I'd like to start a "to do" of sorts from concerns on these two pages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Footnotes in the introduction â€” "the lead shouldn't have footnotes since everything stated there should be elaborated and supported by the body". Additionally I have a concern of how the numerous footnotes affect this section's readability, which I brought up in the above "Excessive citation?" section.</li>
<li>No references for much of the text â€” the refs seem to be mostly given to the disputed text only. There is much text elsewhere which have very few in comparison, such as the sections on history, traditions, and horoscopic astrology.</li>
<li>External links trimming â€” done</li>
<li>Footnote style should be consistent â€” at a glance this doesn't look like much of a problem anymore</li>
<li>Copy editing â€” sentence length should be manageable, text should be fluid</li>
<li>Linked terms â€” mundane terms not relevant to the subject shouldn't be wikified. Doesn't look like much of a problem anymore.</li>
<li>See also length â€” most if not all of these links are already in the astrology category; perhaps providing a link to it would serve as a more succinct replacement.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the article's introduction it affirms astrology is considered a science by some. The claim is cited by a <a href="http://www.nickcampion.com/nc/science/science.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.nickcampion.com/nc/science/science.htm" rel="nofollow">short article by Nick Campion</a>, but the source's reliability is questioned. <a href="http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery?s=science&amp;gwp=13#Dictionary" class="external text" title="http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery?s=science&amp;gwp=13#Dictionary" rel="nofollow">Answers.com</a> defines science as (removing irrelevant definitions):</p>
<pre>
  1. 1. The observation, identification, description, experimental investigation, and theoretical explanation of phenomena.
        2. Such activities restricted to a class of natural phenomena.
        3. Such activities applied to an object of inquiry or study.
  2. Methodological activity, discipline, or study
  3. An activity that appears to require study and method
  4. Knowledge, especially that gained through experience.
</pre>
<p>Astrology fits all of these definitions. Further, Campion is a respected figure and makes a logical argument. I'm removing the template under this reasoning. â€” <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuella_f97b.html" title="User:Samuella">Sam</a> 00:54, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree. Astrology fails criteria one of your definition.</dd>
<dd>Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary defines science as "knowledge covering general truths of the operation of general laws, esp. as obtained and tested through scientific method [and] concerned with the physical world."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, the majority of the scientific community believes that astrology is not at all a science, as it doesn't follow the scientific method. The use of Campion as a source in statements regarding science is highly questionable. However, I'm ok with the change you made. I just wanted to point out that the majority of the scientific community probably doesn't think that Campion makes a logical argument. <a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVorpal_blade_8a31.html" title="User:Vorpal blade"><font color="green">Vorpal Blade</font></a><a href="../../../v/o/r/User_talk%7EVorpal_blade_f4dc.html" title="User talk:Vorpal blade"><font color="blue"><sup>snicker-snack</sup></font></a> 15:42, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Indeed astrology is not a science in the strictest sense. Campion is arguing from a looser definition. Quoting:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Some astrologers claim that astrology is a science because it is based on empirical evidence: experience and observation. Quite simply, it seems to work. According to traditional definitions of science, astrology is scientific because it is a discipline which uses set rules to explain natural phenomena. Also, the Greek word 'scientia' simply means 'wisdom'. "</dd>
</dl>
<p>The case against astrology being considered as a science is explored in the introduction, calling it a pseudoscience. The wording for the text in question is from a proponent's view; "Astrology is variously considered by its proponents..." The claim needing reference is concerned with proponents' views, in which case Campion's article is sufficient. â€” <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuella_f97b.html" title="User:Samuella">Sam</a> 21:01, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Quoting Campion: "Also, the Greek word 'scientia' simply means 'wisdom'." - sorry to say, but 'scientia' is Latin not Greek, and it first and primarily means 'knowledge'. He is likely confusing it with 'sapientia' which does in fact mean wisdom in Latin. The Greek equivalent of scientia is episteme. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 16:13, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Well, regardless, I think it's a sufficient source. â€” <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuella_f97b.html" title="User:Samuella">Sam</a> 16:33, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Agreed Sam. Campion's article is sufficient. Good add by the way.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheodore7_f3d4.html" title="User:Theodore7">Theo</a> 13:40, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
