<p>Also has been created under Universist movement, and probably some others as well. It was AFDed several times, I believe, and recreated, etc. I know just mentioning it here is going to make me very unpopular, and I'm not even sure I want such a page undeleted, but I think it deserves more scrutiny that it's gotten since the first AFD almost a year ago. I also want to make it known I have no connection to the group, and know almost nothing about it.</p>
<p>Since it's first AFD, this "religion" or whatever you call it, has recieved some attention in national media. It's been in US News and World Report twice <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/050802/2religion.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/050802/2religion.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/050808/8secular.b.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/050808/8secular.b.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. It should be noted that only the first was really much about the group, the second was about secular humanism in general, and does little more than mention Univerism. Also, it should be noted that both articles are by the same person, so it might be reflecting the interests of a single journalist more than it should. The group was also the subject of a short bit on CNN recently. <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0602/15/acd.01.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0602/15/acd.01.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> (it's about 3/4 of the way down the page, look for the names FOREMAN or FORD VOX). They've also been written about in the LA Times <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-na-newreligion16nov16,1,6774761.story?coll=la-headlines-frontpage" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-na-newreligion16nov16,1,6774761.story?coll=la-headlines-frontpage" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. There are claims of others too, but this is what I could verify with a very quick search. I think enough has changed, in terms of the size and notability of the movement, that we cannot use prior AFDs to justify the deletion of this page, and we have to look at the group/article on its own merits. I'm not saying every group that's been mentioned in a newspaper on appeared for 2 minutes on CNN is worthy of a wikipedia article, but I think it deserves some discussion, more than "we've been through this already, delete".</p>
<p>Also, it is pretty much true that the editors of this article in the past have been Univerists, and POV has been an issue. The article, if recreated/undeleted, will likely need quite a bit of time and effort devoted to it to keep it neutral and verifiable. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 18:24, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Endorse</b> deletions/<b>keep deleted</b>. I was not involved in any of the prior deletion votes, but it seems to me that the deletion process and its outcome were completely legitimate. (There was apparently a sort of consensus at the last VfU not to bring this topic up again until March 2006, but I guess we're almost there, so no harm in discussing it now.) I think the topic is <i>borderline</i> notable, and relisting it wouldn't do any harm (though I'd still vote to delete after reviewing the "new information," which I find pretty insubstantial). If recreated, it needs very close and sustained attention for neutrality and defense against the soapboxing, linkspamming, and self-promotion that were common with the prior articles. -- <a href="../../../r/b/e/User%7ERbellin_dc87.html" title="User:Rbellin">Rbellin</a>|<a href="../../../r/b/e/User_talk%7ERbellin_8a70.html" title="User talk:Rbellin">Talk</a> 21:53, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is exactly the thing I wanted to avoid, decisions based on earlier VFDs. The first VFD (more than a year ago) was certainly valid, but nearly all the others have been speedy deletes based on that single vote. Since that time, Universism has appeared in several very well-known publications. That cannot be denied. What we should be discussing here is whether the group was "featured" or "mentioned" and whether these generally pretty short blurbs are enough to warrant an article. When looking at it that way, the original VFD cannot be used as a measurment, as it predated all the media appearances. We should look at this on its merits, ignoring all previous discussions. This is not a procedural DRV (no one is saying the original VFD was improper) this is a case of new information coming to light. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 22:04, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not sure I understand what R.fiend wants to accomplish with this DRV; he doesn't mention taking any particular action. Was the point to have a DRV to point to in order to avoid speedy deletion of this article on its next rewrite? -<font color="#2000C0">ikkyu2</font> (<a href="../../../i/k/k/User_talk%7EIkkyu2_7356.html" title="User talk:Ikkyu2"><font color="#00FF00">talk</font></a>) 23:50, 20 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Or undelete and edit one of the several articles already written. Right now various people are making what I think are good faith attempts to write an article on this, and it gets speedily deleted each time because of a year old VFD. On the last one someone said it should be taken to DRV, so that's what I'm doing. If consensus is that there should not be an article on Universism because it hasn't made an impact yet or isn't notable or whatever, I'm fine with that, but we shouldn't cling to an very old VFD as if it's the only game in town. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 00:13, 21 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>I stand with R. fiend on this; I think the speedy delete was understandable (given how many times this group has tried to recreate the article without addressing the reason it was deleted by VfD/AfD twice) but <i>incorrect</i> (since the latest version <i>did</i> address the issue by including significant proofs of notability beyond what had been provided in previous versions.) For reference, I voted "Delete" in every previous VfD/AfD for this article, based on the group having shown no evidence of notability. Based on the evidence now presented, I would vote a <i>keep</i> if the article was placed on AfD. I think the article should be <b>un-speedied</b>; if someone wants to nominate it for AfD, let them do so, but R.fiend is absolutely right that we can't just say "speedy it now because <i>most of it</i> is previously deleted content" when the part that <i>isn't</i> is directly relevant to the <i>reason</i> the content was AfD'd before. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 00:25, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep deleted</b>. I don't recall AfDs having an explicit "sell-by date" as R. fiend suggests, and speedy for substantially recreated content is perfectly appropriate <b>unless</b> DRV explicitly states otherwise: Antaeus Feldspar is putting the cart before the horse. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 02:31, 21 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Calton, perhaps the letter of policy supports that, but I suggest that the spirit does not. To work with an analogy that I suggested on Talk:Universist movement, it's like tossing someone who's 18 and has a legal ID out of a liquour store because he used to try and sneak in with a fake ID back when he was underage. Now if you want to argue that they <i>still</i> don't meet the criteria for notability, then go ahead. But what you are arguing is "it <i>doesn't matter</i> whether the <i>reasons</i> that got the article deleted before still apply; what matters is that it <i>did</i> get deleted before." -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 03:00, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Calton: Speedy for substantially recreated content is certainly appropriate, unless DRV states otherwise - I don't think that's in dispute. However, this is DRV, and the topic's being brought up to see whether or not the new source information renders it appropriate for DRV to reverse its prior consensus; i.e., has the topic gained enough notability since AfD#1 to reverse the consensus. What I can't figure out is whether your "keep deleted" vote is on the grounds of "DRV already deleted this" or "the new information isn't good enough;" if the former, may I suggest you review the new information and comment with regard to its merits? -<font color="#2000C0">ikkyu2</font> (<a href="../../../i/k/k/User_talk%7EIkkyu2_7356.html" title="User talk:Ikkyu2"><font color="#00FF00">talk</font></a>) 06:34, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Calton, (and Zoe, who deleted it again): I don't understand. What's wrong with having a copy of the article while we're discussing whether it might be suitable, with new information that's come to light? How is process so important in this regard that we have to keep it deleted, while responsible editors are engaged in a good faith effort to re-evaluate it on merit? Why not let people write an encyclopedia? It's not like it's being recreated by vandals, or socks or something. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 07:03, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

Also, I suggest if we didn't make it so hard to get stuff undeleted, there wouldn't be so much resistance to deletion. It should be easy to delete things lacking verifiable signficance, with the full knowledge, that new information, can get them undeleted, without problem. If anybody still thinks the new version is not adequate, they can obviously, renom it. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 06:42, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I won't vote since my last name is Vox. What do you mean someone "checked the claimed sources and found no credible evidence of notability at the last AfD." The point of this discussion as far as I can tell is where are the Universists now, not where we were. Where are we now? <a href="http://universist.org/media.htm" class="external free" title="http://universist.org/media.htm" rel="nofollow">http://universist.org/media.htm</a> -- far more notable than many groups on Wikipedia. Keeping us out really is just a grudge based on the fact that the first article in 2003 was a bit premature, and the contentious debate concerning it a year later. Wikipedia was a different place in 2003 as well. You also state "POV from the Universists is an obvious problem." You should note that in previous discussions on Wikipedia, the Universist Movement, the org representing Universism, has pledged not to edit the article. I imagine there are some Christians editing the Christianity article and that they may have a POV. I imagine there are some Republicans editing the GOP article and they may have a POV. We can't control our members but we can issue a statement explaining how Wikipedia works and encouraging them not to edit the article unless they are familiar with Wikipedia style and rules. As for your claim that there is "a dearth of independent verifiable evidence available from which to build a balanced view against which to weigh that POV" -- I think there is some video evidence floating around somewhere. Maybe an article too in a reputable source here or there.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUniversist_3137.html" title="User:Universist">Universist</a> 11:35, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Guy, I think I see how you arrived at that number. If I Google Universism and keep paging forward, Google indeed shows 400-odd hits<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=universism&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;start=450&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=universism&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;start=450&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> before asking me if I want to view similar entries. However, if one searches for "The Brights"<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22the+brights%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;start=580&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22the+brights%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;start=580&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> (as an exact phrase) and pages forward in the same way, there are currently only 500-odd hits. Also note that "the brights" can refer to the headlights of a car, while "Universism" rarely refers to anything other than the movement in question. So if <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Brights_378b.html" title="The Brights">The Brights</a> are notable because of their Google presence, Universism isn't far behind.64.236.245.243 22:32, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

If unique hits are a metric of notability, either both articles should stay or both should go. If they <i>aren't</i> a metric of notability, why comment on how many Universism has?

If not, then why should UM remove its response to that heated discussion, written contemporaneosly. The point of this discussion is that the old conflict is over.

<li>Gladly. The authors and proponents of this article have shown nothing but contempt for Wikipedia process. Despite the fact that <b><a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_undeletion_Universist_Movement_666c.html#Proposal:_Reconsider_in_March.2C_2006" title="Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion/Universist Movement">there is a standing agreement to revisit the issue in March 2006</a></b>, this article has been continuously recreated over and over again despite a continual consensus to keep it deleted. In addition, the article's authors have shown a continuous inability to follow <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, so recreating the article seems pointless regardless. Given all that, I find it not particularly compelling that they've managed to rack up just enough media mentions in the interim to make the most threadbare notability argument. My vote remains the same: <b>Endorse closure and keep deleted</b>. However, I do like <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis's</a> idea below to declare the AfD decisive until September 2006.

<li>I'm not sure how you can count the opinions of 6 wikipedians (one of whom is now on indefinite leave and one of whom now supports undeletion) as some sort of mandate that the issue is never mentioned again until March. And even if it were, are we really going to split hairs and argue over how the overall situation will be different from late February to early March? Yes, the Universists' consistent interest in the creation of such an article has proved problematic in the past; that is why I thought it best for someone who could not be considered an inclusionist by any stretch of the imagination to bring this to DRV. In any case, your assertions that they've garnered "just enough media mentions in the interim to make the most threadbare notability argument" is the most convincing case for a keep deleted I've yet seen. The argument, as I see it, revolves around where on the notability spectrum these media mentions lie. <i>That's</i> the discussion I'm looking for, not a rehashed argument from a year ago. Let's examine these media appearances and see what they really are. I'll readily admit not everything to appear on CNN is notable. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 04:35, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>How is <i>US News and World Report</i> a "self-reference"? Call it "a minor blurb of little consequence" if you must (I won't argue too firmly against that), but to call it a self-reference seems to indicate you haven't looked into this at all. And this isn't even a case where it was just the online edition or anything. This appeared in print, in a magazine with a circulation rivaling that of the most popular news magazines in the country. Maybe its appearance in various media has been because of the efforts of Ford Vox. But if that's the case, it's worked very well.

<li><b>Undelete and relist</b>. I originally supported deletion, but switched my vote to undeletion some time ago based on the <i>New York Times</i> publicity and other factors. They have now been on CNN. I'm not a Universist (and frankly, I'm tiredof having to say that every time this issue comes up for review). In fact, I find the Universist movement unappealing and problematic - but it's just ridiculous to keep this article out of Wikipedia on the basis of notability, which was the original justification for deletion. Like it or not (and I suspect it's a "not" for most of us), Universism is a lot more notable than many similar topics on Wikipedia. To keep it deleted is absolutely nothing more than grudge-motivated behavior and reflects quite poorly on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENaturyl_7ae3.html" title="User:Naturyl">Nat</a> 03:07, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"World religion" - can you find that phrase anywhere on the Universist website referring to Universism? You cannot. It is not there. We don't call it that. More importantly, Wikipedia has articles on new religious movements, not just major world religions. We do not claim to be a "world religion." We are a new religious movement. This is yet another vote by someone who simply doesn't like Universism. Let me save you all some time, if you want to hear from people who don't like Universism versus those who do and base your decision on that, you will overwhelmingly hear from the former. No contest. There are only 10,000 Universists and the only ones that know about this discussion are a few of them following a forum thread on our website. I don't know of any Universists in that forum thread that are long contributing Wikipedians. Since when is personal popularity of an idea among Wikipedians a factor in whether there should be an article? The notability for a new religious movement is established. Far more than most such new organizations. For a "world religion" - that is a straw man invented by mikkalai that even were it true has no bearing on whether there should be an article accurately describing us. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUniversist_3137.html" title="User:Universist">Universist</a> 06:20, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Undelete and relist</b>. I've been participating in Internet-based communal ventures since the 1980s, so I've seen a lot of battles over community rules and regulations over the years: newgroup and rmgroup debates over Usenet groups, arguments over whether spamming sites should be universally blacklisted, arguments over the ethics of DoS attacks, and so on. So I claim at least Old Fart's privilege of deserving consideration when I say that re-deletion of the Universism article at this point would be one of the most petty and high-handed applications of procedures I've seen in an online community in two decades. The Church of Scientology is arguably a pure product of the most arrant self-promotion, but no one would for a moment claim that there should be no Scientology entry on Wikipedia. The Universist Movement has reached enough of a critical mass in the culture, it seems, that people might well come to Wikipedia looking for a brief neutral overview of the phenomenon as they might for the <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster_3e86.html" title="Flying Spaghetti Monster">Flying Spaghetti Monster</a> or the Church of the <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subgenius.html" title="Subgenius">Subgenius</a> (which has been in the newspapers lately as the result of a custody dispute, BTW).

<li><b>Undelete and relist</b>. Sufficient notability established for at the very least a revote on the matter, and at best a permanent recreation of the article. I see no benefit from blocking out all attempts to work on and improve an article that's in the "grey zone" between obviously noteworthy and obviously non-noteworthy; if it later turns out to be a very brief fad, we can very easily delete the article later, whereas if it becomes increasingly noteworthy over time (as many other Internet-based movements have of late), we'll have much better stuff to work with. And in the meantime, nobody will suffer horribly because we have an article on the topic, and a lot of readers will be benefited greatly by actually receiving information rather than a "deleted" notice when they search for information on this topic (as I did upon hearing a lot of mentions of it over the last few weeks). Whether the original AfD results were valid or not is moot, as this is a review of the recent overly hasty speedy-deletions, not of the original vote, which was in different enough circumstances (i.e. occurred prior to all media mentionings of Universism) to no longer apply. Personally, I find Universism to be a somewhat inane, New Agey, intellectually lazy, bullshit-propagating movement (which is why I expect it to explode in popularity, since all of those things are becoming increasingly popular in modern spiritual subcultures), but that doesn't make it any less noteworthy. Also, I'll gladly help with any POV issues that arise once this article is recreated; if we could do it for <a href="../../../o/t/h/Otherkin.html" title="Otherkin">Otherkin</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W.
