<p>In the Mediterranean, a crisis began to brew. The small, peaceful island of Astigos and the independent nation of Lukano had been invaded by the Zagorias Federation, led by Giorgio Zott. The invasion, sparked by <a href="../../../l/u/k/Lukano.html" title="Lukano">Lukanoan</a> opposition to annexation, had several surrounding Mediterranean nations voicing opposition to the Zagorias Federation. Despite stiff opposition, the Zagorian Forces continue their invasion of Astigos and in 2-3 months, take control of 80% of the island. Zagorian Forces are also using Astigos as a tactical base to advance onto Lukano, but not without alerting the Lukano Liberation Force's leader Daniel Winston about the Tactical Missile placement within what is called "The Military Summit". Winston, his second-in-command Jake Hernandez, and other Lukano Liberation troopers attempt to attack the Zagorian Missile Silo only to be captured, resulting in a fatal disadvantage for Lukano. The Zagorian Army is now asking Lukano to capitulate with Zagoria in exchange for the lives of the hostages.</p>
<p>However, according to <a href="../../../v/s/s/VSSE_780b.html" title="VSSE">VSSE</a> sources, the potency of the tactical missiles is labeled a threat not only to Lukano, but the surrounding nations, who ironically also protest the Zagorias Federation's annexation efforts as well. Anxious about the tension within the Mediterranean, VSSE dispatches two agents, Alan Dunaway and Wesley Lambert, to remove the threat.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/t/Astigos_Crisis_0a14.html" title="Edit section: Alicia Winston">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Alicia Winston</span></h2>
<p>After watching the top story of the Ten O'Clock News edition of Euro Flash, Alicia Winston, no longer willing to see her beloved Lukano decay through the hands of the Zagorias Federation, makes her way into Marano Beach of Astigos Island. Alicia succeeds in staging a sneak attack on the Turret Command Post that contains sensitive data regarding the Zagorian Federation's true intent. Downloading the Tactical Missile and military summit data, Alicia contacts the VSSE through a special comlink and uploads an encrypted version of the information she stole. In response to the encrypted information Alicia uploaded, the VSSE sends Agents Alan and Wesley to support her cause.</p>
<p><a name="VSSE_Intervention" id="VSSE_Intervention"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/t/Astigos_Crisis_0a14.html" title="Edit section: VSSE Intervention">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">VSSE Intervention</span></h2>
<p><a name="Arrival" id="Arrival"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/t/Astigos_Crisis_0a14.html" title="Edit section: Arrival">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Arrival</span></h3>
<p>The VSSE agents, pretending to be tourists, were given a cold welcome by the Zagorian Troopers at the Marano Sea. This caused the Zagorian Troopers at the street to receive a call for backup, but Alicia, no ordinary woman, sought to distract the Zagorian Troopers, giving the VSSE room for error. Alicia steals a Zagorian Jeep and heads towards Marano Beach, only to see Victor Zahn's V-TOL Aircraft commencing an attack on a wrecked ship, pinning Alan and Wesley down. Just as Victor has the VSSE agents down to their knees, Alicia comes to their rescue and urges them to jump into her jeep. With the VSSE Agents on her jeep, Alicia then helps defeat Victor and his V-TOL.</p>
<p><br />
The three befriend each other, but is Alicia focused in having Alan and Wesley locate the missiles. Through an intense shootout at an Astigos village and the forest of Astigos, Alan and Wesley manage to get into a train which according to Alicia, "is the only way to the facility." Alicia then catches the train after being somewhat tardy, but the train trip was cut short when ninja operative Randy Garrett destroys the bridge leading to the Missile Silo and the Military Summit. Garrett's sabotage doesn't stop Alan, Wesley, and Alicia from defeating him and getting to the Military Summit, though. Shortly after infiltrating the facility, they locate Daniel, being provocated by Zagorian leader Zott. Alan and Wesley distract the troops while Alicia finds a way to rescue Daniel secretly and quickly. Before Alan and Wesley are able to rescue Daniel, they have to fight with an old rival, <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wild_Dog_%28Time_Crisis_character%29_c65d.html" title="Wild Dog (Time Crisis character)">Wild Dog</a>, and Wild Dog's apprentice, <b>Wild Fang</b>. After defeating the pair of enemies, Alan and Wesley approach Daniel only to see Zott blocking them. After Alicia lands a bullet right onto Zott's hand, Zott retreats and heads towards the missiles. Alan and Wesley chase after Zott while Alicia takes care of Daniel.</p>
<p>Through the flaming corridors of the library, Alan and Wesley chase Zott until he has them cut off by several Zagorian troopers. Alicia, Daniel, and the rescued troopers distract the troops so that Alan and Wesley can advance into the Missile Silo. Both Alan and Wesley discover that Zott has already programmed the missiles and that he's ready to launch them. Zott then challenges the VSSE agents to a duel. Despite his fierce efforts, Zott is killed, but not without telling the VSSE agents that they have no hope left. As the missiles are launching, Alan and Wesley use Zott's rocket launchers to destroy the missiles, blowing up the silo, <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immolation.html" title="Immolation">immolating</a> Zott, and saving Lukano from extermination.</p>
<p>With the tactical missiles destroyed and Zott dead, the VSSE agents leave everything else up to the LLA, but Wesley knows that they'll do fine.</p>
<p><br />
Alicia introduces herself to the VSSE agents, but Alan thinks that Alicia is out of her mind just because he thinks that a woman shouldn't work alone. Alicia then tells the agents her reason for launching her own investigation, then Wesley starts clarifying Alicia's causes. Afterwards, back in the Astigos streets, Alicia informs the VSSE Agents that a train being used for supply transportation would be the only way into the missile silo. Their conversation is cut short by a Rocket Launcher launched by a Special Weapons Trooper, and Wesley encourages Alicia to split up and meet them at the train up ahead. Alicia says that the train leaves at 15:00 without exceptions.</p>
<p>Alicia then makes her way into the streets fighting clawmen, elite troopers, a heavy tank, sharpshooters, leading her to Jake Hernandez, who was the only liberation soldier who managed to escape. However, Alicia then discovers Jake's true colors as he points his gun at Alicia's head, hoping to capture her for even more money--it seems that Jake Hernandez betrayed the LLA for the love of money. Alicia kicks Jake right in his stomach, grabs her handgun, and knocks Jake's gun out of his hand. Alicia and Jake fight throughout the streets as Jake uses innocent bystanders to test Alicia's aim, while Alicia has to contend with lorries, special weapon soldiers, and other troopers before pinning Jake to a dead-end. Alicia, in an act of anger, threatens to kill Jake if he doesn't tell her whether or not her brother is alive. A Zagorian Jeep then distracts Alicia enough to enable Jake to escape. Knowing that she would be tardy if she doesn't reach the train, Alicia makes a run for the train. The intense street fight is the reason why Alicia was tardy, something Alan is not aware of, and why Wesley started worrying about Alicia.</p>
<p>The train is littered with Zagorian Soldiers as Alan, Wesley, and Alicia try to clear the train. Alicia has to confront an attacking train at the back of the train before realizing that a group of Zagorian Sharpshooters are about to take aim at the VSSE Agents. With her sniper rifle, Alicia manages to cut the snipers off, and the VSSE Agents are able to throw Randy Garrett to his doom. Alan, Wesley, and Alicia now realize that they can only reach the summit by foot, due to Garrett's cut-off of the bridge during the VSSE fight against him earlier on.</p>
<p>The three manage to locate Daniel. Wesley tells Alicia that he and Alan will distract the enemy troops while Alicia finds a way to rescue Daniel secretly and quickly. Alicia does this without question, disposing of any Zagorian Troopers on sight. On top of the tower, Alan and Wesley, victorious against Wild Dog and Wild Fang, are blocked by Giorgio Zott, who has Daniel held captive. Alicia aims her sniper rifle and knocks the handgun threatening to end Daniel's life out of Zott's hands.</p>
<p>Left with no choice, Zott heads to the missile controls. Wesley tells Alicia to take care of her brother while he and Alan chase after Zott. Daniel tells Alicia to leave him for now and that he can catch up later because he wants Alicia to rescue the imprisoned LLA Soldiers. Alicia does this without question, making her way towards the prisoner cells, rescuing any LLA Troopers she sees. After rescuing the last group of captured soldiers, Daniel catches up with Alicia. Alicia, sensing danger, warns her brother and her now-rescued LLA teammates that the VSSE Agents are in trouble and need help.</p>
<p>Looking at the nasty surprise Alan and Wesley receives from Zott, Alicia and her fellow soldiers assist the agents, but Wesley says that Zott needs to be stopped because the missiles can be launched if Zott finishes programming them. Alicia then holds the Zagorian troopers off for the agents as Alan and Wesley chase after Zott, but not after Jake enters the scene. Jake escapes, but not before Alicia spots him. Realizing the trouble Alicia had to go through just to rescue Lukano from danger and Jake's betrayal, Daniel tells Alicia to go after Jake and leave the rest up to him for now. Alicia, knowing that Jake double-crossed Lukano, agrees.</p>
<p>Before Jake can escape through a Zagorian V-TOL Aircraft, Alicia challenges Jake to a duel, with Alicia severely damaging the V-TOL and holding the high ground. Jake threatens to blow up the place with a detonator, but Alicia destroys the detonator with her sniper rifle. The bullet penetrates the detonator, hitting Jake down as well. The V-TOL then explodes, killing the traitor and leaving Alicia with nothing to hold her and Lukano back.</p>
<p>Alicia then hurries to the Missile Silo only to see that it had already been destroyed, but sees that Alan and Wesley got out of the silo alive. With the VSSE Agents leaving the rest to the LLA, Alicia wonders what her life would be without the VSSE Agents, but Daniel reassures her that the remaining Zagorian Forces needs to be mopped up.</p>

<p>A Euro Flash newscast then announces that Lukano has regained 90% control of Astigos Island, with many Astigoans favoring Lukano's valiant effort in resisting the Zagorias Federation. Giorgio Zott was also killed during a military campaign involving Tactical Missiles plus Jake Hernandez was the traitor killed during his quest for money as well. Without its leader and its <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superweapon.html" title="Superweapon">superweapons</a> of <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weapons_of_mass_destruction.html" title="Weapons of mass destruction">mass destruction</a>, and with Astigos celebrating their independence after 1 month of conflict, the remaining Zagorian Forces are forced to either retreat or die by the hands of the Lukano Liberation Force, putting an end to the Mediterranean Crisis.</p>
