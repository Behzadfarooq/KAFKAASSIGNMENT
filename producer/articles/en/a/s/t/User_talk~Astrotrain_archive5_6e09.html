<p>Good evening,</p>
<p>I notice that you reverted at least two of my edits and called them 'nonsense'. Two of my edits were to conform the openings of the Queen Mary (consort of George V) and Queen Elizabeth (consort of George VI) to that of Queen Alexandra (consort of Edward VII), the latter of which seemed to exhibit an intelligent template for articles about Queens consort of the UK (though I did not create it). My other edit was to insert 'Queen' (but not 'Her Majesty') before the name of 'Elizabeth II', and amend the misrepresentation of 'Windsor' as her surname. Merely having 'Elizabeth II' for an article entry in a conventional paper encyclopaedia is sensical in order to maintain the easy flow of alphabetical order, but Wikipedia fortunately need not concern itself with that issue. I am keen to understand your reasoning behind these reversions. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Charlton_58a1.html" title="User:Lord Charlton">Lord Charlton</a> 15:50, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am still awaiting a response from you. In the meantime I see you've reverted another of my edits with the explanation of 'rv-consensus'. How is consensus formed, and where may I see proof of it? I will give you another opportunity to respond before reverting the articles back to my previous edits.</p>

<dd>That is not a good enough reason to block me for 24 hours. I was expanding the article to address the concerns of the user as listed on the talk page (and noted in my edit summary). The 4th edit is clearly not a revert to the third version. Note that other 3RR guidlines have not been followed- for example there was no 3RR warning posted on my talk page- and the other user never raised any further concerns with my edit- leading me to assume he agreed with the change. I strongly ask for this to be reconsidered. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 10:14, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've denied your unblock request, as you definitely did violate the 3RR. Keep in mind, the 3RR exists only to lay down a specific maximum beyond which <i>anyone</i> violating it should be blocked. But revert-warring (which is what you were doing: changing the article back to your preferred version) is very harmful to Wikipedia: after someone reverts your change you should discuss the issue, and you have to accept that the state of the article may be in your non-preferred version for some time. It's just a 24 hour block; once it's over feel free to resume editing, but don't get into revert wars! <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 13:04, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So much for compromising on keeping Gaelic in the text, but out of the infobox. Difficult to come to a consensus on the question when you're set on having your own way.

<dd>Today (or yesterday rather) it's Calgacus. But Mais oui! has done the same, and MacRusgail commented in favour of Gaelic on the talk page, An Siarach wasn't exactly thrilled by your attitude either. It's verifiably the case that the RBS's retial banking arm trades under the name <i>Banca Rìoghail na h-Alba</i>, as well as <i>Royal Bank of Scotland</i>. If you don't want to mention <i>Banca Rìoghail na h-Alba</i> in the intro, and you don't want to split the article, then the very least you can do is to mention it under Retail Banking. Would I be right in thinking that this has now spread to <i>Banca Dhail Chluaidh</i>, and that it's only a matter of time until <i>Bhanca na h-Alba</i> suffers too&#160;?

<p>The harp was also used as a symbol by the Old English of Ireland, hence its connection with modern Irish nationalsim. But the harp, or Clarsach, is also Scottish, and can be found in (Pictish) Scotland earlier than in any other European country. "Harper" was a common Anglophone Scottish surname of later medieval Scotland (compare Piper). King <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_I_of_Scotland_8930.html" title="James I of Scotland">James I of Scotland</a>, one of the most Anglicized Scottish kings, was nevertheless famous throughout Scotland, England and Ireland as a harper, and harpers were maintained at the Scottish court from at least the 13th century until the end of the Scottish kingdom. The same is not true for the bagpipes, which only became common in Scotland rather late and was not Scottish. I sense your hostility to the harp comes from your hostility to Gaelic, but the two are connected by no more necessity than Gaelic and the kingdom of the Scots itself. <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalgacus_321f.html" title="User talk:Calgacus">ΚΑΛΓΑΚΟΣ</a></i>)</b> 21:53, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was in no way trying to be rude; since I came across that way, I apologize. I just saw an article I felt was basically promotion of a company and tagged it as such. I have since looked at your other edits, which are universally positive; thank you for those.

<p>Your POV pushing is becoming ridiculous now. Alba, besides being the native name for the kingdom (incidentally used in the native language of most of those kings on that list), is also used in English, e.g. Driscoll, <i>Alba: The Gaelic Kingdom of Scotland AD 800-1124 (The Making of Scotland)</i>, Woolf <i>From Pictland to Alba</i>. "Scotland" is only a term used by as an exonym from the late 11th century, and then only as <i>Scotia</i>. "Scotland" is not used in any Scottish source until the 14th century, whereas Alba refers to the Kingdom, either "Pictland" or "Scotland", from the dark ages until the present. To quote myself, "the term "Scotland" is much later than the earliest kings of "Scotland", and Alba was the name for both Pictland and Scotland, and remains to this day the Gaelic name for the country". So you're going to have grave difficulties POV-pushing on this particular issue. Why don't you go to <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selkirk.html" title="Selkirk">Selkirk</a> and help the anon remove the Gaelic name there.&#160;;) <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalgacus_321f.html" title="User talk:Calgacus">ΚΑΛΓΑΚΟΣ</a></i>)</b> 14:08, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Astrotrain,</p>
<p>I have followed some of your disputes, for example those on the naming of Scottish banks, and see that you are up against the same problem as some of us Orcadian contributors, namely a "Spin Scotland" lobby determined to push its POV and promote its own image of the country regardless of what the facts are.</p>
<p>Take a look at the current discussion here: <a href="../../../s/c/o/Talk%7EScottish_national_identity_308e.html" title="Talk:Scottish national identity">Talk:Scottish_national_identity</a></p>
<p>(You will note that most of the Orcadian contributors who can still be bothered to get involved (or who have not been blocked) now just contribute via their IP addresses. This is mainly because they found they were be tracked by <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">user:Mais oui!</a> and having their contributions instantly reverted by him.)</p>
<p>It is a sad state of affairs, very sad, but I am at a loss to know what can be done about it.</p>

<ul>
<li>I would agree that there is some POV pushing by some of the Scottish editors, but I would say, on large that they do contribute good work to the Wiki.</li>
<li>What I would suggest doing, is create a user account, and contribute on a open basis. If your contributions are good, and and can be backed up with reputable sources, there is bound to be a place somewhere for them. If you do find other users reverting your work, there are ways to deal with it- discussion, involving others etc. I would also suggest not focusing on only one area- and widen contirbutions outwith Orkeny related articles.</li>
<li>If you need any more help, you can contact me or any other user on the talk pages- or by the "email this user" link on the right. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 21:55, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am reluctant to widen my contributions outwith Orkney, for it is Orkney that I am knowledgable about - although this would not be accepted by the likes of <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a>. You seem to have had your own brushes with him. He is an arch-POV-pusher who will delete facts to suit his own agenda. I only wish the administrators would recognise him for what he is. It would not surprise me if <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallimak_5f83.html" title="User:Mallimak">User:Mallimak</a> were contributing using IP addresses, and it seems from the above comment that <a href="../../../o/r/k/User%7EOrkadian_b921.html" title="User:Orkadian">User:Orkadian</a> has no choice but to. Other Orkney contributors such as myself dare not do otherwise, having witnessed (or been told about) the tactics of <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> seems to think that "Mallimak sockpuppet" is grounds for reverting any Orcadian contribution he does not like (does he like any?). I fail to see why this behaviour is condoned. <a href="../../../8/1/2E/User%7E81.129.246.100.html" title="User:81.129.246.100">81.129.246.100</a> 17:11, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mais-Oui! can be a difficult user to deal with, however he does make some good contributions which are to be encouraged. I also know he/she has suffered from vandalism on his user and talk pages from anon IP addresses- and this may explain some hostility.</dd>
<dd>At the end of the day, you have to move on from these things and engage in the Wiki community if you wish to continue contributing. Again I would suggest registering a user account, and contributing openly to the project, and if you encounter problems resolving them by involving others etc. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 11:31, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although I do not condone vandalism, I can understand some contributors' reactions to <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a>. It never pays to make enemies, and <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> seems to go out of his/her way to create them. Tracking a user's contributions and immediately reverting every one they make (vandalism, surely) is hardly a good way to make friends. I know this behaviour has put some off contributing at all - all to the detriment of the accuracy and reliability of Wikipedia - and others are probably so frustrated by <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui's</a> behaviour that they have to find some outlet to vent their frustration - again, to the detriment of the Wikipedia project. I just wish the adminstrators would keep a tight rein on <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> and not let him get away with this damaging behaviour. <a href="../../../8/1/2E/User%7E81.155.38.76.html" title="User:81.155.38.76">81.155.38.76</a> 13:04, 15 December 2006 (UTC) P.S. I am not a "Mallimak sockpuppet". As far as I know <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallimak_5f83.html" title="User:Mallimak">Mallimak</a> has given up on Wikipedia and is trying to set up some sort of independent encyclopaedic site.</dd>
<dd>How predictable! Look at <a href="../../../8/1/2E/User%7E81.155.38.76.html" title="User:81.155.38.76">User:81.155.38.76</a>, and you will see that since I wrote the above, <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> has accused me of being "a sock puppet or impersonator of Mallimak". Do you see the problem? What hope is there as long as s/he is allowed to carry on like this? <a href="../../../8/1/2E/User%7E81.155.38.76.html" title="User:81.155.38.76">81.155.38.76</a> 16:36, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I really admire your efforts to find more information to bulk up the article on <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Elizabeth_of_Clarence_a952.html" title="Princess Elizabeth of Clarence">Elizabeth</a>. We'll see if you can change anyone's mind.</p>
<p>On a slightly related note, the succession crisis occasioned by Charlotte Augusta's death might deserve an article of its own. It was a major event at the time, and I love how it got 3 princes to all get married in 1818. Anyway, some of the details about Elizabeth's importance can be elaborated on in such an article. I made a draft of what it might be like (<a href="../../../t/o/c/User%7ETocharianne_Succession_crisis_28af.html" title="User:Tocharianne/Succession crisis">User:Tocharianne/Succession crisis</a>).

<ul>
<li>I like the diagrams- however it does not mean Elizabeth should be denied her own article. As a Princess in the direct line of sucession and that she would have became Queen if she had lived, together with the other facts listed on her page- she deserves her own article. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 12:15, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi. "Replaceability" is defined by Wikipedia as an image that <i>could</i> be replaced by a free image. It does not mean that the image has to exists freely yet, or that I, the tagger, have to present an image to replace the current one. I'm sorry you consider these messages spam, but I am being courteous in notifying you that the image you uploaded could be deleted and allowing you to possibly find an image to replace it. I realize it is frustrating because your efforts could be deleted, but it's just application of Wikipedia policy, it's nothing personal and doesn't reflect upon you as an editor. Please don't take it personally. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecu_ba9a.html" title="User:Mecu"><font color="#CEBE70"><b>MECU</b></font></a>≈<small><a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecu_1c42.html" title="User talk:Mecu">talk</a></small> 13:53, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Astrotrain, just wanted to drop off a friendly reminder that xfD discussions aren't a vote... the action to be taken on an item nominated for deletion is based on the positions and opinions put forth by the contributors to the discussion, not by simple vote-counting. To that end, simple statements of "Keep" and "Delete" don't really help inform the discussion, and are likely to be discounted by the closing admin. If you could provide some insight as to your reason for your opinion, that will really help, even if you're just agreeing with the nominator. Thanks, and happy editing! <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;font-family: Monotype Corsiva;"><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarrens_9305.html" title="User talk:Warrens">-/-</a> <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarrens_af91.html" title="User:Warrens">Warren</a></span> 16:24, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I tried to tag him, but he kept removing it. He has also removed other warning messages from his talk page. I tried restoring them, but he reverts me and has now "banned" me from his talk page (I don't know if he can actually do that or not...). I have reported him for investigation, here (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_investigation#Vintagekits_.28talk.C2.A0.C2.B7_contribs.C2.A0.C2.B7_logs.C2.A0.C2.B7_block_user.C2.A0.C2.B7_block_log.29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_investigation#Vintagekits_.28talk.C2.A0.C2.B7_contribs.C2.A0.C2.B7_logs.C2.A0.C2.B7_block_user.C2.A0.C2.B7_block_log.29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_investigation#Vintagekits_.28talk.C2.A0.C2.B7_contribs.C2.A0.C2.B7_logs.C2.A0.C2.B7_block_user.C2.A0.C2.B7_block_log.29</a>), so hopefully we'll get some kind of decision.

<p>My post, copied from the above AfD, FYI:</p>
<dl>
<dd>When nominated this article was a stub. I did a google search, which quickly revealed an abundance of sources with significant mentions, including national press, TV documentary, questions in parliament and references by politicians. I have added this information to the article and greatly increased it, but I find it extraordinary that the nom either didn't do a google search, or, if he did, didn't see these results, or, if he did see them, failed to recognise their value. Badly researched AfD nominations not only waste community time, but stand to deprive the encyclopedia of worthwhile articles. I note the nominator has also proposed "a number of similar pages for AfD", and I trust he will check carefully to ensure that that is the right course of action for them. It could otherwise look very much like bad faith noms, which is a form of vandalism.</dd>

<p>You recently made a number of undiscussed changes to this page. Can you explain the following please.</p>
<ol>
<li>you reverted my edit stating that you considered is POV and vandalism, can you please explain both of those ascertions please.</li>
<li>As the target of the attack you stated "Christmas shoppers at Harrods" - can you clarify this answer as from all the reports that I have read on the issue the store and not the shoppers were the target and this was confirmed by the prior phoned warning to evacuate.</li>
<li>Your reverted the article from showing that is was a <a href="../../../p/i/r/PIRA_a800.html" title="PIRA">PIRA</a> attack to state that was an <a href="../../../i/r/a/IRA_6c5d.html" title="IRA">IRA</a> - what is your reasoning behind this?</li>
<li>You deleted the time of the explosion and replaced it with "Unfortunately they did not have time to defuse it" - a. why did you delete the time and b. "Unfortunately" may be correct but it is POV. can you explain these statements?</li>
<li>The article previously stated the line "Three officers and three civilians (including one citizen of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>) were killed." but then you deleted, can you please explain this.</li>
<li>you removed the line "It stated that a bomb was placed the C&amp;A deptartment store on the east side of <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_Street_63ad.html" title="Oxford Street">Oxford Street</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>." and replaced it with "They claimed a bomb had been placed in the heart of <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_Street_63ad.html" title="Oxford Street">Oxford Street</a>. It was said to be at the C&amp;A store on the east side of the shopping street." the later sounds messy and POV can you explain the edit. regards</li>

<li>you reverted my edit stating that you considered is POV and vandalism, can you please explain both of those ascertions please. Astorian - can you explain the following changes the you considered POV.-</li>
<li>As the target of the attack you stated "Christmas shoppers at Harrods" - can you clarify this answer as from all the reports that I have read on the issue the store and not the shoppers were the target and this was confirmed by the prior phoned warning to evacuate.</li>
<li>Your reverted the article from showing that is was a <a href="../../../p/i/r/PIRA_a800.html" title="PIRA">PIRA</a> attack to state that was an <a href="../../../i/r/a/IRA_6c5d.html" title="IRA">IRA</a> - what is your reasoning behind this?</li>
<li>You deleted the time of the explosion and replaced it with "Unfortunately they did not have time to defuse it" - a. why did you delete the time and b. "Unfortunately" may be correct but it is POV. can you explain these statements?</li>
<li>The article previously stated the line "Three officers and three civilians (including one citizen of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>) were killed." but then you deleted, can you please explain this.</li>
<li>you removed the line "It stated that a bomb was placed the C&amp;A deptartment store on the east side of <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_Street_63ad.html" title="Oxford Street">Oxford Street</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>." and replaced it with "They claimed a bomb had been placed in the heart of <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_Street_63ad.html" title="Oxford Street">Oxford Street</a>. It was said to be at the C&amp;A store on the east side of the shopping street." the later sounds messy and POV can you explain the edit.--<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 01:28, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

It is not sufficient to state that you have "reverted to the best previous version established by another editor" because obviously there is disagreement over this.

<p>I'm afraid you're not in a very strong position. You made a statement about him which was derogatory and not true. The article and AfD weren't deleted because of "libelous statements". I know why they were deleted, because of course I deleted them. I was not in a position to know whether they were libelous or not. Wiki does not require that stringency. We remove statements if they are merely derogatory or insulting. They were certanly some extreme comments made, which <i>could</i> have been libel, but whether they were or not depends on whether they were true or not — or in wiki terms we accept as truth something from "reliable" secondary sources. There were sources, but there was some uncertainty about them and it is incumbent on me to play safe, which is what I did. Unfortunately, you didn't. It's an easy mistake to make in the circumstances, but you must expect a reaction. Repeating it as you did apparently three times begins to look like making a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">POINT</a>. Let's move on and learn. It's your talk page.

<dd>You deleted the article because the claims were unsafe, which was of course correct. We cannot tolerate statements in Wikipedia that are are deflamatory. Wikipedia is not the place to debate whether someone was in a terrorist organisation, or whether someone committed a crime. The moment that articles on non notable terror members or suspects appear, the danger of libelous statements being made increases. I have already seen many dubious statements in these articles, some of them linked to unreliable and POV websites or forums, others with no source. I was not repeating the cicumstances of the deletion of the said article to embarras Vint- merely to point out the danger in having such articles on non notable persons creates. And per <a href="../../../l/i/b/WP%7ELIBEL_4020.html" title="WP:LIBEL">WP:LIBEL</a> "all contributors should recognize that it is their responsibility to ensure that material posted on Wikipedia is not defamatory"." <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 23:15, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually it was removed because at the time the Daily Mail article which was quoted on the page could not be found in the archives. I did not add the reference to the Daily Mail article it was there long before I ever found wiki and was on other pages also. The said article and numerous others (8 in total confirmed according to one editor) were found - 4 of which were forwarded to me - if you email me from my user page I will forward them to you. Also Davidson and McCormick were brought to trail for it and that is all over the web.--<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 23:29, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That is not quite correct Vintagekits, because there was also questioning as to whether that paper on its own, even if found, would be sufficient, so it was a much more complex situation, and basically one that needed to be resolved <i>cautiously</i> before words like "murderer" started being attached to the names of living personages. That still remains the case, and, with that in mind, I mostly agree with Astrotrain's most recent post above. However, there do need to be certain qualifications. Wiki is not the place to "debate" these things, but it is very often the place where it is necessary to establish the truth of these things, but only be referring to reliable sources that we can feel confident about. These matters still do have to be addressed, but cautiously, not like a bull in a china shop. However, they can't just be brushed under the carpet either. Dubious statements about living people? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:BLP#Remove_unsourced_or_poorly_sourced_controversial_material" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:BLP#Remove_unsourced_or_poorly_sourced_controversial_material" rel="nofollow">Zap them!</a> I will <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>, Astrotrain, as regards the intent of your comments relating to Vintagekits, but these things can very easily start to make someone feel oppressed, harrassed, intimidated, ganged-up on and ridiculed, so care must be taken to make plain what is intended. The best articles over contentious subjects can only happen when two "sides" find common ground - which is writing wikipedia.

<dd>I understand what you are saying but I dont think the wiki page ever said he murdered him, it said we has on the scene and left with security tapes. Als oit was allegedly published in the Dail Mail twice, the Mail on Sundy and the Daily Mirror.

<dd>It was not disruptive, your behaviour here is appalling. I will not raise another AFD , although I really hope someone else does!

<dd>Could I ask here, in response to Mr Darcy, what if an editor feels the entire concept of the article in question is POV; that it is wrong for Wikipedia to carry it for a whole range of legitimate reasons? Or are you just threatening those who oppose the promotion of the IRA in Wikipedia? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Lauder_8521.html" title="User:David Lauder">David Lauder</a> 19:08, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The only legitimate reasons are those in line with wikipedia policy. The argument that wiki should not include articles on IRA members <i>per se</i>, because it glorifies them, is not in line with wikipedia policy. Mass nomination of articles on a particular subject is, to say the least, suspect. When some of these nominations are then met with almost unanimous keeps, the nominator is clearly doing something wrong.

<dd>Of the articles I nominated, one was deleted, the rest were no consensus- so I am vindicated. The only article to be kept was this one, due to Darcy's POV decision to close- harrassment of my so called "canvassing" meant I was reluctant to raise more awarness of this AFD. I am sure many other people would have voted to delete it- now we will never know. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 14:09, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>On the contrary. The fact that you nominated a number of articles <s>(was it 20?)</s> for deletion and only one achieved a consensus to delete shows how inappropriate the nominations were. This reeks of POV-pushing. I trust you will take note of the fact that your views are out of line with community consensus and adjust your interpretation of deletion criteria accordingly so we don't have a repeat of this. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 01:56, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That is a complete lie- I did not nominate 20 articles! No consensus to delete mean there was roughly the same amount of people nominating to delete as to keep- so hardly a ringing endorssement. I note you yourself nominated a similar article for deletion... <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 13:45, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's not a lie, because it's not even a statement - it's a question! I've struck it anyway because it's unnecessary. It's not a ringing endorsement but it's not a consensus to delete either, and some of your noms were virtually unanimous keeps. This is history, so let's move on. The best procedure is to nominate one article to gauge community response, and then re-assess accordingly.

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Duchess of Kent.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_criteria_7a9f.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use criteria">first fair use criterion</a> in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the image description page and edit it to add <code>{{Replaceable fair use disputed}}</code>, <b>without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template</b>.</li>
<li>On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequesting_copyright_permission_5781.html" title="Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission">requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license</a>, or by taking a picture of it yourself.</p>
