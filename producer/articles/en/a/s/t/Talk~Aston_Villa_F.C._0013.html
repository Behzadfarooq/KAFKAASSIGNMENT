<p>Yet again the Villa are first to do something, yet again they give you a reason to be proud to support them, and yet again optimism rears its head. Lads, you can be proud of yourselves for being the first club of players to have the balls to raise a statement of dissatisfaction with your chairman. You can hold your heads high tonight.

<li>Per consensus at <a href="../../../w/p/f/WP%7EWPF_10e0.html" title="WP:WPF">WikiProject Football</a>, reserve and youth players should not be included unless they have squad numbers.</li>

<li>Transfer ins and outs should not be included. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a news service</a>.</li>

<dd>As my removal of the transfers section was reverted, I'll elaborate on the above before I make any further changes. This article should be an overview of the club through its 100-odd year history, not a recap of recent events. In line with similar decisions at <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arsenal_F.C._0a5a.html" title="Arsenal F.C.">Arsenal F.C.</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool_F.C._2b1a.html" title="Liverpool F.C.">Liverpool F.C.</a> to name but two, I intend to remove the section and replace it with a link to the "Transfer Deals" section of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006-07_in_English_football_071b.html#Transfer_Deals" title="2006-07 in English football">2006-07 in English football</a>.</dd>

<p>Please consider their career at Villa when adding in great players - for instance, Collymore, Solano, Davis (yet!) and Baros are not amongst Villa's all-time greats! <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperlinus_36de.html" title="User:Superlinus">Superlinus</a> 22:46, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperlinus_36de.html" title="User:Superlinus">Superlinus</a>, I disagree. The list encompasses only the most worthy players to have pulled on the famous claret and blue. My argument being that the Villa have had many 'notable' players down the years (especially in recent years!) that do not merit a mention. Players such as David Ginola, Peter Schmeichel, Stan Collymore etc were all notable but they are not worthy of a place on the list. This is why I named the list 'Greatest Players'. <a href="../../../v/i/l/User%7EVillafanuk_b61f.html" title="User:Villafanuk">User:Villafanuk</a> 19:21, 5 March 2007</dd>

<dd>But on what basis are you deciding who is a famous player and who is not? Perhaps if the list was of Fans' Player of the Season, then fine. As it is, it is not citeable and clearly fails WP:NPOV. Not that it's just this club's site - a few others are as bad and are also being looked at <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGretnagod_0e96.html" title="User:Gretnagod">Gretnagod</a> 21:57, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Who said anything about famous players? It's a list of the players that have contributed most to Aston Villa's greatness. This can be cited by the number of trophies they won whilst at the club, longevity of career at Villa, popularity at the time etc. My choice of the word greatest reflects this and not simply their noteriety or fame. I do not think it is merely a matter of personal opinion, i think it is something that has obvious credibility. You look at any history of the club and those same names appear every time. That is because they all played an important part in the Villa story. <a href="../../../v/i/l/User%7EVillafanuk_b61f.html" title="User:Villafanuk">User:Villafanuk</a> 22:10, 5 March 2007</dd>

<p>Some of this was recently reverted without so much as an edit summary. I've collapsed these again.

<dd>I edited it because it looked unwieldy and was out of character with other Premiership articles, reducing the current squad to mere "staff". I'd pretty much like to see this article look uniform as far as Current Squad goes, but I'd like to hear your justifications for the way you'd see it presented <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperlinus_36de.html" title="User:Superlinus">Superlinus</a> 14:38, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That other Premiership articles have too many subheaders isn't a great justification; I can, hoever, only work on a finite number of things at once! The header reduction is first and foremost a way of trying to figure out how the page should really be proportioned; I'm tempted to suggest moving the almanac-type stuff to a sub-article and leaving this article for text. Most team article on WP consist of nothing but statistics, so providing all the stats one can is good idea; however, Villa have a lot of history which makes the article very long in its current state. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThumperward_1d10.html" title="User:Thumperward">Chris Cunningham</a> 15:31, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">WP:CON</a> does indicate that the Aston Villa article should fall in line with other Premiership articles. Before making such widespread changes I suggest you discuss this at [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Football|WikiProject" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Football|WikiProject" rel="nofollow">Football</a>] where much good work is being done on all football articles. I would agree that the History section of the page is long and unwieldy, and would welcome a way of shortening it, but one which recognised Aston Villa's unqiue contribution to modern football. I'm going to edit the Current Squad section back in line with other Premiership articles and urge you to discuss this on WikiProject Football before continuing on your lone path.

<p>This editing is nothing short of vandalism! Chris, I'm afraid you have no understanding of Aston Villa's proud history and it's integral role in the formation of the Football League. We didn't found the FA!! It is clear you havn't even read the article properly!</p>
<p>I believe that any article citing the history of Aston Villa should mention William McGregor etc. Also, why have you taken it upon yourself to change all the subheadings, they were much better before. You havn't even consulted anyone on your proposals. I find the changes you have made offensive. I have spent countless hours getting this article up to the standard it is and your treatment of it is not respectful of the club. <a href="../../../v/i/l/User%7EVillafanuk_b61f.html" title="User:Villafanuk">Villafanuk</a> 11:01, 22 March 2007</p>

<dd>I've reverted this. There was next to no content removal, so I'm not sure what you're on about regarding "Villa's proud history" not being reflected. Copy-editing to remove the magazine-style headers ("Phoenix from the flames" - I mean, come on) is a no-brainer. I'm open to discussion of individual edits; nobody <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWNs</a> this article, so its development should proceed through the normal <a href="../../../b/r/d/WP%7EBRD_8e65.html" title="WP:BRD">WP:BRD</a> process. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThumperward_1d10.html" title="User:Thumperward">Chris Cunningham</a> 11:50, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I accept that nobody owns an article, but that doesn't mean to say that all changes are for the better. As I have a massive interest in Villa and its history and have been an avid fan my whole life, I think the changes you have made are not constructive. The point of "Pheonix from the flames" refers to the fact that Villa went from the Third Division to European Champions in a decade - but I accept it might be a bit cheesy. That's no reason to replace all the subheadings with undiscriptive date ranges <a href="../../../v/i/l/User%7EVillafanuk_b61f.html" title="User:Villafanuk">Villafanuk</a> 13:08, 22 March 2007</dd>

<dd>I have been requested to have a look at this developing edit war going on here and I think what some are failing to recognise (not naming names) is that Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia. This should provide factual information from a neutral point of view.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I admit that I'm a Villa fan myself and Villa does have a proud history but VillafanUK's edits are from a point of view, albeit subtle. I think the date headings would be best, therefore, as they provide a timeline of sorts into the history of the club. Putting headings such as 'Phoenix from the flames' is controversial and many would like to argue over it. - <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErebus555_1839.html" title="User:Erebus555">Erebus555</a> 16:46, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm obviously aware that wikipedia must present a balanced neutral point of view. As the writer of a vast majority of the article as it now stands including most of the history section, I would like to argue that the dates suggested by <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThumperward_1d10.html" title="User:Thumperward">User:Thumperward</a> are not at all representative of notable eras in Villa's history and show a lack of knowledge. They do not give the reader an overview of the era. (eg '1920 - 1950' - in which time Villa won 1 FA Cup. Doesn't tell us anything!) Perhaps a compromise of Headings with dates could be reached. What do you think?</p>
<p>I think he has a point about the 'Pheonix from the flames' heading which I have replaced. However, this was not trying to fill the article with 'magazine style fluff' - it was meant to give the reader an introduction to an era in which Villa miraculously rose from the Third division to become European Champions. I think my headings give more of a timeline of the club than dates that don't even fit an era of history at the club. <a href="../../../v/i/l/User%7EVillafanuk_b61f.html" title="User:Villafanuk">Villafanuk</a> 20:51, 22 March 2007</p>

<p>This article is woefully short of citations. I've just added a "citation needed" tag to the record transfer fees section, for a start.
