<dd>Hello. I don't quite understand your comment on Hipi insisting on revivng {{Kosovo-stub}}, because it was you who re-created the template. It was discussed at <a href="../../../w/s/s/WP%7EWSS_P_67de.html" title="WP:WSS/P">WP:WSS/P</a> in November (with the outcome not to create), then deleted at <a href="../../../s/f/d/WP%7ESFD_4ddf.html" title="WP:SFD">WP:SFD</a> in December. I think it should be speedily deleted as {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-repost_a444.html" title="Template:Db-repost">db-repost</a>}}. If you really think the temlpate should exist, let's go and discuss it with others. The issues to resolve include whether there are enough stubs, the wording of the template, the category to be used and whether the category (if a new one is created) should be in <a href="../../../s/e/r/Category%7ESerbia_stubs_35b3.html" title="Category:Serbia stubs">Cat:Serbia stubs</a>. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConscious_cf76.html" title="User:Conscious">Conscious</a> 07:58, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

I have added the following {{db|I created this stub being unaware it was previously [[WP:SFD|voted for deletion]]. Please delete and protect against re-creation}}.

<p>Hi Asterion. in setting up that category, I was following the name currently applied to the article on the province itself, which is <a href="../../../s/e/v/Sevilla_%28province%29.html" title="Sevilla (province)">Sevilla (province)</a>. Perhaps it should be changed to Seville, but it would then make sense to do so for the province article (and related articles) as well. What do you think? Curiously, the article on the city is at Seville. <i>.--<a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> <font color="#DAA520">|</font> <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright">TALK</a> 23:29, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<p>Hi Asterion. I went and looked through this little book I have, "Bosniak names and their meanings", published in Sarajevo in 1972. It listed Almedina as a variation of Elmedina and said it was of an Arabic root. It was defined as "A city woman, cultured woman. Dedicated to her faith." The name Almedina isn't as popular as Elmedina, which is definitely not an uncommon name. However, these days Almedina is more popular among younger generations (at least thats the impression I have). <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 22:06, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

I have decided to withdraw my nomination as it seems that consensus will not be reached. If you voted in support, thanks for putting your trust in me to be a good admin. If you voted in opposition, thank you as well for your constructive criticism as it will only help me be a better Wikipedian and perhaps help if/when I apply for adminship again sometime in the future.</td>

<p>The word "pada" means falling, so the el condor is "falling". It's talking about the US Stealth Fighter (nicknamed El Condor) that got shot down during the war.</p>
<p>P.S. What does "El condor pasa" mean out of curiosity? As your familar with Spanish and I, unfortunately am not. Thanks C-c-c-c</p>

<dd>What I forgot to mention was, was that <i>pada</i> is the conjugated <b>Serbian</b> word of <i>padati</i>, meaning to fall. Mhm interesting about the languange, I remember my German teacher, (who is also a Spanish teacher) mentioning how one student translated an English sentence word for word in Spanish (can't remember which), and that when she read it in Spanish it meant: "giving birth to something", but the student was going for something completely different.

<dd>You asked me about Neum. I do not think that Neum should be considered part of Dalmatia. Unlike the Gulf of Kotor, Neum even was not part of historical Dalmatia (as were its borders in Habsburg Monarchy or in the Republic of Venetia). On the contrary, the ancient Roman Dalmatia included most of Bosnia, entire Montenegro, as well as parts of Serbia and Albania. History and geography are different things.&#160;:) <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 22:28, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. I have a feeling that Ilir will respond to this message because he is stalking me. Are there rules against that? Whenever I make a change that might not agree with his POV, he suddenly appears on that page, protesting my change and reverting it. I also have a lot of inside information, about his motives, his intentions and what he is actually doing with Wikipedia. I can bring him down, but I can't do it alone. I'm just asking you to show me where I can make my case, his sockpuppets, his reverting, his constant pushing of POV has harmed Wikipedia enough. I just need to know where I can have my voice heard. Please, don't respond over Wikipedia, e-mail me at bormalagurski@hotmail.com. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>serbiana</b></font></a> <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia"><b>-</b></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><b>talk</b></font></a> 02:04, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>After a lenghty, but much-needed Wikibreak, I'm happy to announce that version 1.2 of VandalProof is now <i>available for download!</i> Beyond fixing some of the most obnoxious bugs, like the persistent crash on start-up that many have experienced, version 1.2 also offers a wide variety of new features, including a stub-sorter, a global user whitelist and blacklist, navigational controls, and greater customization. You can find a full list of the new features <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalProof_b972.html#Suggestions_Being_Considered" title="WP:VandalProof">here</a>. While I believe this release to be a significant improvement over the last, it's nonetheless nowhere near the end of the line for VandalProof. Thanks to <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">Rob Church</a>, I now have an account on <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://test.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://test.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">test.wikipedia.org</a></span> with SysOp rights and have already been hard at work incorporating administrative tools into VandalProof, which I plan to make available in the near future. An example of one such SysOp tool that I'm working on incorporating is my <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_SHM_0af5.html" title="User:AmiDaniel/SHM">simple history merge</a> tool, which simplifies the process of performing history merges from one article into another. Anyway, if you haven't already, I'd encourage you to <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalProof_b972.html#Download" title="WP:VandalProof">download and install version 1.2</a> and take it out for a test-drive. As always, your <a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_VP_suggestions_a7f1.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel/VP/suggestions">suggestions</a> for improvement are always appreciated, and I hope that you will find this new version useful.

<p>Well, I understand what you mean in the case of Kosovo article. That is also a reason why I did not worked more with that article (it is futile because most of the "good faith" edits are vandalized and are a subject to revert war). Things will change of course when the future statuses of Kosovo and Montenegro are solved and then we will have decent articles about Kosovo. Some people think that Wikipedia is a good place for political propaganda and once they had no political goal any more that they want to achieve with their edits, they will not do it.

So you have to understand my confusion. On one hand I have an admin defending a user for removing notices, and on the other I have you saying not to do it. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Cyr_2f7a.html" title="User:Paul Cyr">Paul Cyr</a> 03:53, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, I understand that. It frustrating really though, because I am dealing with a user who I am 90% sure is using socks to continue attacks against me and an admin who IMO (and numerous others) does not handle situations anywhere near proper, and has allowed the situation with the previously mentioned user to escalate way too far, because of what I believe is his personal feelings towards me. It's a very messy situation, if you wanna read more about it and voice your opinion (you seem level-headed) then it's actually at AN/I: <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html#Inappropirate_conduct_by_admin_InShaneee" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I#Inappropirate conduct by admin InShaneee</a>.

<p>Hi Asterion,<br />
I'm from Germany and saw your pictures of easter european cars. Unfortunately you've uploaded these to the english wikipedia. If you could upload them to the <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="commons:Main_Page">Wikimedia Commons</a> they would be avaliable for all language Wikipedias. (I would like some more eastern car fotos on german/czech/polish/russian... Wikipedia as well&#160;;-)<br />
I would be very glad, if you could create a commons-account and upload your pics there!

<p>Not sure if you followed the talk page discussions or edit history over the month of May but a single Anon user re-wrote most of the article to its current state which is, as you say, utter junk. In response another user has been slowly translating the Spanish Wikipedia version of this article, which is a Featured Article, and a few sections are in place. If you want to help with the translation any help would be appreciated.

I still think that taking a more moderate approach might change his behavior. Try it, might work. Not sure he is going that far to be banned from Wikipedia for good. He should really pose threat to Wikipedians to be banned like that, but as I said I am not following the problems between you(and HRE) and Hipi.

<dd>Oh oh. Sorry I did not realise. It seems to be the old "diff edits" bug again. . I was replying to the last edit by Ilir pz (I saw your edit and then clicked on older edit to check his). I have documented the problem before:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Go to your watchlist</li>
<li>Select Diff for the most recent entry of a page (i.e. my talk page)</li>
<li>Now hover your mouse over "edit this page". You can see that instead being, let's say <small>http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Asterion&amp;action=edit</small>, it shows something like <small>http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Asterion&amp;action=edit&amp;oldid=55591294</small>, even if when you click on "edit" that is at that particular moment the most recent version.</li>
<li>If you edit it and someone has added something afterwards using <small>http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Asterion&amp;action=edit</small>, you will overwrite their edits, as wikipedia assumes you know you are editing an out of date version (you only really get the warning the first time you click on an old version, but not if at the time it was the most recent one)</li>
<li>Well, the moral of the story is to ensure I always edit using the link to "edit this page" from the article namespace not from the history/diffs window.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will restore the closing brackets (I actually tried to sort this leaking myself a while ago but ended with the green edge).

<dd>That always happens to me, so when I want to edit a page (the current version) while looking at a diff, I click the tab that says "page", or I click the link that says "current version" and then I click "edit". Another thing I do is edit a section of the page, and it edits the current version. --<font size="1"><a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeMoney_583b.html" title="User:GeorgeMoney">GeorgeMoney</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../g/e/o/User_talk%7EGeorgeMoney_8d9f.html" title="User talk:GeorgeMoney">T</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GeorgeMoney_d771.html" title="Special:Contributions/GeorgeMoney">C</a></sup></font> 18:20, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That sounds sensible. I will try that next time. I have told a few people about the "bug" but no one seems to be interested. My point is that it can cause quite a lot of hassle in pages that get updated really often (i.e. RfA or VfD).
