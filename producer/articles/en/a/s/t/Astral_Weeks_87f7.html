<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/t/Astral_Weeks_87f7.html" title="Edit section: Background">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h2>
<p>At the beginning of 1968, <a href="../../../v/a/n/Van_Morrison_45dc.html" title="Van Morrison">Van Morrison</a> was involved in a contract dispute with <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bang_Records_9848.html" title="Bang Records">Bang Records</a> that kept him from any recording activity. The situation was worsened by the sudden death of the label's founder <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bert_Berns_a0f8.html" title="Bert Berns">Bert Berns</a>; born with a congenital heart condition, he experienced a massive heart attack and was found dead in a New York hotel room on December 30th, 1967. Prior to Berns's death, Morrison and Berns were having some creative difficulties, with Berns pushing Morrison towards a more pop-oriented direction and Morrison wanting to explore a new sound. As a result, Berns's widow, Ilene Berns, held Morrison responsible for her husband's death. (Years later, Ilene Berns would downplay this scenario, but several witnesses from that time, including Morrison's ex-wife Janet Planet, have gone on record describing her subsequent vindictiveness towards Morrison.)<sup id="_ref-HeylinPage166_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HeylinPage166" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ilene was given ownership of Bang Records, and the annual option on Morrison's recording contract was also due roughly the same time as her inheritance. Legally bound to Bang Records, Morrison was not only kept out of the studio, he couldn't even perform in New York as most clubs were afraid to book him, fearing reprisals.<sup id="_ref-HeylinPage167_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HeylinPage167" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ilene Berns then discovered that her late husband had been remiss in filing all the appropriate paperwork to keep Morrison (still a British citizen) in New York. She contacted immigration and attempted to get him deported. However, Morrison was able to stay when his then-girlfriend Janet Planet agreed to marry him.<sup id="_ref-HeylinPage168_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HeylinPage168" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Once they were married, Morrison and his wife moved to <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge%2C_Massachusetts_da41.html" title="Cambridge, Massachusetts">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a>, where he was able to find work performing in the local clubs. Morrison began performing with a small electric combo consisting of local students, but this group only lasted one summer. Two of the members left due to other commitments, but Morrison was able to retain the bassist, Tom Kielbania, who was a student at the Berklee School of Music. It was then that Morrison decided to try an acoustic sound, and he and Kielbania began performing shows as an acoustic duo.<sup id="_ref-HeylinPage169_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HeylinPage169" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Later, Kielbania heard flautist John Payne for the first time while sitting in on a jazz jam session. He took Payne to see Morrison, hoping Morrison would invite him to join them, and after allowing Payne to sit-in on one performance (switching off between flute and saxophone), Morrison did extend an invitation that Payne accepted.<sup id="_ref-HeylinPage172-173_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HeylinPage172-173" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The trio of Payne, Kielbania, and Morrison would continue to perform for four months,and it was around this time that Warner Bros. Records approached Morrison, hoping to sign him to their roster.<sup id="_ref-HeylinPage173_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HeylinPage173" title="">[6]</a></sup> Presumably their interest was based on the prior success of "Brown-Eyed Girl," not on Morrison's current acoustic work. Regardless, their interest allowed Morrison to return to the recording studio.<sup id="_ref-HeylinPage176_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HeylinPage176" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the time, Warner Bros. had a deal with Inherit Productions, the production arm of Schwaid-Merenstein which was founded by manager Bob Schwaid (who worked for Warners Publishing) and producer Lewis Merenstein. While Merestein went to see Morrison in Boston, Schwaid went to work on Morrison's legal troubles.<sup id="_ref-TurnerPage177-181_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TurnerPage177-181" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Morrison was still legally bound to Bang Records, and he would have more issues with them in the future. For the time being, Schwaid was able to free him from those obligations, under several conditions. First, Morrison had to write and submit to Web IV Music (Bert Berns's publishing company) three original compositions per month over the course of one year. An unusual and outrageous demand by any standard, Morrison was able to fulfill it by recording thirty-six nonsense songs in a single session. Such action risked legal reprisals, but none was taken. Morrison then had to assign Web IV one half of the copyright to any composition written and recorded by Morrison <i>and</i> released as a 45 rpm single within one year from September 12, 1968. That demand would become a moot point when Warner Bros. would refrain from releasing any single during that time frame. Finally, Morrison had to include two original compositions controlled by Web IV on his next album. Morrison would fulfill that demand with two of his own compositions, "Madame George" and "Beside You."<sup id="_ref-TurnerPage178-181_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TurnerPage178-181" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/t/Astral_Weeks_87f7.html" title="Edit section: Recording sessions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Recording sessions</span></h2>
<p>With legal matters settled, Morrison was now able to proceed with his Warner Bros. debut. Sessions were held at Century Sound Studios in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York</a> on September 25, October 1 and 15, 1968.</p>
<p>Legendary musician <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cale_6e2a.html" title="John Cale">John Cale</a> was recording next to Van Morrison's studio, and reported "Morrison couldn't work with anybody, so finally they just shut him in the studio by himself. He did all the songs with just an acoustic guitar, and later they overdubbed the rest of it around his tapes."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>This is in fact completely untrue - the live tracks for the sessions were performed by Van on vocals and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steel-string_guitar.html" title="Steel-string guitar">acoustic guitar</a>, along with <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_bass.html" title="Double bass">upright bass</a> (not bass guitar), second acoustic guitar, vibes, flute, and drums. The only instruments added afterwards were <a href="../../../s/t/r/String_orchestra.html" title="String orchestra">strings</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brass_instrument.html" title="Brass instrument">horns</a> and the occasional drum part.<sup id="_ref-RoganPage227_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RoganPage227" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Producer Lewis Merenstein had a background in <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a>, and according to Merenstein, Morrison "was not an aficionado of jazz when I met him. R&amp;B and <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul_music.html" title="Soul music">soul</a>, yes; but jazz, no."<sup id="_ref-HeylinPage189_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HeylinPage189" title="">[12]</a></sup>For these sessions, Merenstein first contacted veteran bassist <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Davis_5535.html" title="Richard Davis">Richard Davis</a>. Perhaps best known for his work with <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Dolphy_5806.html" title="Eric Dolphy">Eric Dolphy</a>, Davis was essentially the session leader, and it was through Davis that Merenstein was able to recruit guitarist Jay Berliner, percussionist Warren Smith, Jr., and drummer <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connie_Kay_379a.html" title="Connie Kay">Connie Kay</a>. All of these musicians had strong backgrounds in jazz; Berliner had worked closely with <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Mingus_778b.html" title="Charles Mingus">Charles Mingus</a> and Kay was part of the <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_Jazz_Quartet_188d.html" title="Modern Jazz Quartet">Modern Jazz Quartet</a>.<sup id="_ref-HeylinPage190_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HeylinPage190" title="">[13]</a></sup> Morrison was still working with Kielbania and Payne, but for these sessions, they were essentially replaced. According to Kielbania, "I got to show all the bass lines to Richard Davis. He embellished a lot of them, but I gave him the feeling."<sup id="_ref-HeylinPage190_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HeylinPage190" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Davis was perhaps the most pivotal instrumentalist during these sessions. "If you listen to the album, every tune is led by Richard and everybody followed Richard and Van's voice," says Merenstein. "I knew if I brought Richard in, he would put the bottom on to support what Van wanted to do vocally, or acoustically. Then you get Jay playing those beautiful counter-lines to Van."<sup id="_ref-HeylinPage190_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HeylinPage190" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Davis was not impressed by Morrison, but not out of disdain or any preconceived notion. "No prep, no meeting," recalls Davis. "He was remote from us, 'cause he came in and went into a booth...And that's where he stayed, isolated in a booth. I don't think he ever introduced himself to us, nor we to him...he seemed very shy...<sup id="_ref-HeylinPage191_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HeylinPage191" title="">[14]</a></sup>Drummer Connie Kay later told <i><a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stone_3229.html" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a></i> that he approached Morrison and asked "what he wanted me to play, and he said to play whatever I felt like playing. We more or less sat there and <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jam_session.html" title="Jam session">jammed</a>."<sup id="_ref-HeylinPage191-192_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HeylinPage191-192" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>It's important to note that 'jamming' isn't merely random <a href="../../../i/m/p/Improvisation.html" title="Improvisation">improvisation</a>. You have "what you call a <a href="../../../l/e/a/Lead_sheet.html" title="Lead sheet">lead sheet</a>," explains Davis, which is "a skeletal frame of what is to be done, and you fill in the flesh. What you fill in [comes] through your own imagination - nobody can tell you what to do. You just play it."</p>
<p>But for the <i>Astral Weeks</i> sessions, lead sheets apparently were not used or at least handed out. "What stood out in my mind was the fact that he allowed us to stretch out," recalls Berliner. "We were used to playing to charts, but Van just played us the songs on his guitar and then told us to go ahead and play exactly what he felt." Berliner actually had great appreciation for the freedom given to him and the band; something few, if any, of them were used to. "I played a lot of <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_guitar.html" title="Classical guitar">classical guitar</a> on those sessions and it was very unusual to play classical guitar in that context," says Berliner.<sup id="_ref-HeylinPage192_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HeylinPage192" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>The first session held on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_25.html" title="September 25">September 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a> produced four recordings that were used on the album. Only three were initially scheduled: "<a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus_Avenue_9909.html" title="Cyprus Avenue">Cyprus Avenue</a>," "<a href="../../../m/a/d/Madame_George_9903.html" title="Madame George">Madame George</a>," and "Beside You." Though Payne was not supposed to play, he still attended the first session and listened as another flautist played his parts. (To this day, nobody recalls the name of the flautist as he has not been identified on any documentation; he does play flute on the released takes of "Beside You" and "Cyprus Avenue" but is not credited on the album.) When Morrison tried to squeeze in one last tune during the end of that first session, Payne spoke up and pleaded to Merenstein to let him play. Payne was then allowed to play on what became the title track of the album, and for the remainder of the sessions he played on every song.<sup id="_ref-HeylinPage194_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HeylinPage194" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>The next session, according to John Payne, was early in the morning, possibly the next day, but it didn't work and nothing from this session was used. "It just didn't happen'" says Payne. "It was the wrong time of day for jazz musicians to create. I think that by the end of that session we all knew that nothing was going to be used. They just said, let's forget it." <sup id="_ref-TurnerPage190_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TurnerPage190" title="">[18]</a></sup> According to Merenstein there was tension at this second session and it was stopped after about three hours.<sup id="_ref-RoganPage226_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RoganPage226" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>The third and final session on October 15th produced three more recordings that finished off the album. Both "Sweet Thing" and "Ballerina" were originally scheduled for the session, but much time was spent searching for a 'closer.' A number of songs were attempted and rejected before Morrison suggested "Slim Slow Slider." "I don't think we'd ever done [it] live," recalls Payne. "[Morrison] had a book full of songs...I don't know why he decided to do it...And we were first doing it with the drums, with Richard Davis and Connie Kay and the guitar player and the vibe player and me and Van - all of us were playing. Then I started playing soprano [sax] on the thing, and Lew said, 'OK, I wanna try it again. Start again. And I want just the bass, the soprano sax and Van.'" It was a successful take, but it also came with a very long coda, prompting Merenstein to make a large edit. Many of the tracks on <i>Astral Weeks</i> would be subjected to edits (mainly to tighten the performances), but the one on "Slim Slow Slider" was easily the most substantial. "I would estimate three, five minutes of instrumental stuff," says Payne. "We went through stages [until] we got to be avant-garde kind of weird, which is what you hear after the splice - all that weird stuff we're playing - but there was a whole progression to that." According to Merenstein, before he cut it, the coda "was a long, long ending that went nowhere, that just carried on from minute to minute...If it had [some] relativity to the tune itself, I would have left it there."<sup id="_ref-HeylinPage195-197_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HeylinPage195-197" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>

<p>With varied rhythms and frenzied vocals, mixed with bizarre lyrics that evoke images instead of coherent ideas and narratives, <i>Astral Weeks</i> has been compared to the school of <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impressionism.html" title="Impressionism">Impressionism</a> in <a href="../../../p/a/i/Painting.html" title="Painting">painting</a>, which similarly seeks to evoke emotions associated with an image.

<p>The album uses a form of <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symbolism.html" title="Symbolism">symbolism</a> that would eventually become a staple of his songs, equating earthly love and heaven, or the closest a living being can get to it. Morrison and Berliner's <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guitar.html" title="Guitar">guitars</a> and Davis's <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_bass.html" title="Double bass">upright bass</a> can be seen as the earth opposing the tuneful horns and <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_Jazz_Quartet_188d.html" title="Modern Jazz Quartet">Kay</a>'s <a href="../../../p/e/r/Percussion_instrument.html" title="Percussion instrument">percussion</a>.</p>
<p>Morrison, himself, said about the song, "Astral Weeks": "(It) is "one of those songs where you can see the light at the end of the tunnel...I don't think I can elaborate on it any more than that."<sup id="_ref-HeylinPage187_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HeylinPage187" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>The oldest composition on <i>Astral Weeks</i> is "Ballerina", which was composed sometime in 1966, while Morrison was still a member of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Them_%28band%29.html" title="Them (band)">Them</a> and about the same time he first met his future wife, Janet (Planet) Rigsbee. Inspired by "a flash about an actress in an opera house appearing in a ballet" (according to Morrison), former Them guitarist Jim Armstrong recalls the band working on the song between engagements. "[Morrison] had all these words," Armstrong says, "we sort of formalized it, 'cause there was no structure to it." Them would perform the song one night in Hawaii, but it would not be recorded until <i>Astral Weeks</i>.</p>
<p>Morrison has denied that "<a href="../../../m/a/d/Madame_George_9903.html" title="Madame George">Madame George</a>" is about a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transvestitism.html" title="Transvestitism">transvestite</a>, as many have believed. The original title of the song is "Madame Joy" and Morrison later changed the title although he actually sings the words "Madame Joy" in the song. An earlier recording with slightly altered lyrics and a much swifter tempo changes the tone considerably from the <i>Astral Weeks</i> recording, which is downbeat and nostalgic; the earlier recording is joyous, and seems to be from the point-of-view of a partygoer who sees the titular character.</p>
<p>The song "<a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus_Avenue_9909.html" title="Cyprus Avenue">Cyprus Avenue</a>" is a live favorite of Van Morrison's fans and was the closing song for most of his live shows for many years. According to Roy Kane, who grew up with Morrison in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belfast.html" title="Belfast">Belfast</a>, Cyprus Avenue "... was the street that we would all aspire to - the other side of the tracks ... the Beersbridge Road had the railway line cut across it; and our side of it was one side of the tracks and Cyprus Avenue was the other ... there was an Italian shop up in <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballyhackamore.html" title="Ballyhackamore">Ballyhackamore</a>, that's where all the young ones used to go of a Sunday ... we used to walk up to the Sky Beam for an ice cream or a cup of mushy peas and vinegar... We used to take a short cut up Cyprus Avenue, 'cause that's where all the expensive houses and all the good-looking totty came from ... mostly upper-crusty totty... There's a couple of big girls' grammar schools up 'round that direction... That would have sunk in my head as [much] as his."<sup id="_ref-HeylinPage189_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HeylinPage189" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
