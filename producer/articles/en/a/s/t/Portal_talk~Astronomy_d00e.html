<dd>I would just like to point out that nothing says you have to only have one portal that covers all the cosmos. There is plenty of information to go around. In addition to Astronomy (which may focus on the planetary and cosmological science), there could also be one (called 'Space', or whatever) that covers space flight and other non-Astronomy topics. —<a href="../../../m/o/v/User%7EMoverton_f107.html" title="User:Moverton">Mike</a> 04:11, Feb 11, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree. Not everyone is well-versed enough in space terminology to see the difference and if you split things up too much, it'll be too much the same to WikiProjects. By defenition Portals should cover a large subject area. But since astronomy can cover everything in space, I'm fine with name now. It doesn't need changing after all. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 14:20, Feb 11, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This discussion seems confused. <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronomy.html" title="Astronomy">Astronomy</a> is a well-defined discipline in science, and that's what this portal is about. A portal for space might be useful for <i><a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_exploration.html" title="Space exploration">space exploration</a></i> and <i>space technology</i>, e.g. <a href="../../../g/p/s/GPS_8c57.html" title="GPS">GPS</a> satellites, and is surly distinct from this portal. I would agree to open a new portal for the <i>Space</i> subject, and <b>not</b> to confuse things unnecessarily. <a href="../../../a/w/o/User%7EAwolf002_16a4.html" title="User:Awolf002">Awolf002</a> 21:21, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I propose a <a href="../../../s/p/a/Portal%7ESpace_eb73.html" title="Portal:Space">Portal:Space</a> to encompass the different disciplines regarding space, including Astronomy, Space Exploration, Space Colonization (possibly as a sub-Portal of Exploration), and other sciences as Interdisciplinary Portals (Aerospace Engineering, etc).

<p>Since not much happened over the last weeks, I went ahead and "seeded" the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Portal%7ESpace_Exploration_5bf7.html" title="Portal:Space Exploration">Portal:Space Exploration</a>, which can capture all space technology related articles that do not fit in <i>Portal:Astronomy</i>.

<p>Previously posted this at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Astronomical_objects_eed4.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Astronomical objects">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Astronomical objects</a>, thought I would post it here as well:</p>
<p>It seems to me that there are lots of astronomy articles which are currently quite short and stubby, which could easily be developed into featured articles - for example <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orion_Nebula_ef07.html" title="Orion Nebula">Orion Nebula</a>,<a href="../../../g/l/o/Globular_cluster.html" title="Globular cluster">globular cluster</a>, <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_cluster.html" title="Open cluster">open cluster</a> - a wealth of images are available, and these are important and well-studied objects. So, I was thinking that maybe an astronomy collaboration of the week could be started. Not sure at all how one goes about setting up a COTW, or whether there would be enough interest in an astronomy one to justify it, so I thought I would float the idea here. Any thoughts or suggestions, anyone? <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 12:58, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The <a href="../../../c/o/l/Wikipedia%7ECollaborations_3814.html" title="Wikipedia:Collaborations">Wikipedia:Collaborations</a> page pretty much covers the process. I'm not sure how much interest it would generate. Some of the CotW pages show very little life. But I do agree there are some important astronomy topics that need further development. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> (<a href="../../../r/j/h/User_talk%7ERJHall_bed4.html" title="User talk:RJHall"><i>talk</i></a>) 02:08, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been altering this page over the last couple of days, updating various boxes and tinkering slightly with the layout. The main thing I've changed is making it automatically update the featured article and image at the start of each calendar month. I've lined up featured articles and images for the next 6 months, see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikiportal%7EAstronomy_Picture_4093.html" title="Template:Wikiportal:Astronomy/Picture">Template:Wikiportal:Astronomy/Picture</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikiportal%7EAstronomy_Featured_c71e.html" title="Template:Wikiportal:Astronomy/Featured">Template:Wikiportal:Astronomy/Featured</a>, but feel free to change anything if you disagree with what I've scheduled.</p>
<p>Once a month is not very often for a change, but once a day is definitely too often given the small pool of astronomy featured articles and pictures. However, there's loads of excellent astronomy pictures around, so perhaps we should start a list of astronomy pics that can be featured on this portal? Then that at least could be updated every day. Or, if anyone knows any simple way of making the featured pic and article change every week or 2 weeks, say, that would be really good. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 21:13, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've completed an audio program about M13 The Globular Cluster in Hercules. It is short and not too professional. However, it is certainly suitable for listening while viewing the object in one's telescope. (This is my intent.)</p>

<p>I would like to place it where others can improve upon it, as well as create similar audio programs. I am thinking of the wikipedia and commons, where I would post both the text and audio file. It is written/produced from a different perspective than a "typical" wikipedia article. It is meant to be used wile viewing the opject</p>
<p>I would like advice on copyright issues (the music was obtained under a creative commons license,) where would be a good community based site to do this project, and critiques of the program itself.</p>
<p>The whole podcasting phenomenon got me thinking about using these ideas for astronomy.</p>

<p>i want to know if there's a limiting value or something like it for a black hole</p>

<dd>Limiting how? By mass? There is thought to be a limit to the size of a black hole that can be generated by a stellar collapse, in that it requires a star three or more times the mass of the Sun.

<p>Tabs seem like a great idea for portals, especially for us.. there is such a large overlap of content between these three portals, that merging into <a href="../../../s/p/a/Portal%7ESpace_eb73.html" title="Portal:Space">Portal:Space</a> would be extremely beneficial to all three.

<dd>What are your criteria for this proposal? In my book, we should have a portal for all article categories that have a large enough article set to fill a portal page, and that are logically separate from each other. Combining <i>Astronomy</i> with all other <i>Space</i> related topics is not a good idea in regards to category. It "muddies" the waters in regards that Astronomy is a physcial science, and <i>Space</i> has all kinds of other focusses. I think we do have enough articles to have (at least) two portals. Also, you gave the <a href="../../../../de/r/a/u/Portal%7ERaumfahrt_830d.html" class="extiw" title="de:Portal:Raumfahrt">de:Portal:Raumfahrt</a> as an example, but there is a <a href="../../../../de/a/s/t/Portal%7EAstronomie_f473.html" class="extiw" title="de:Portal:Astronomie">de:Portal:Astronomie</a>. These are separate! So I'm inclined to object to a merge.</dd>
<dd>The "Tab" idea is interesting. However, it only is used to increase "portal space" it does <i>not</i> switch topics! I think this is a good principle to follow in order to not confuse the readers, if we decide to introduce "tabs". <a href="../../../a/w/o/User%7EAwolf002_16a4.html" title="User:Awolf002">Awolf002</a> 12:46, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think the purpose of a big portal is that at the moment, each of the three <a href="../../../a/s/t/Portal%7EAstronomy_efbe.html" title="Portal:Astronomy">Portal:Astronomy</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Portal%7ESpaceflight_ac9b.html" title="Portal:Spaceflight">Portal:Spaceflight</a>, and <a href="../../../s/p/a/Portal%7ESpace_exploration_83bf.html" title="Portal:Space exploration">Portal:Space exploration</a> are trying to grow, and are infringing on each others 'territories' by doing so. there is a good amount of overlap in the content, like <i>selected biography</i> and <i>selected images</i>; one could separate things with a razor sharp knife, but readers interested in one, will most likely be interested in the others - and that's the reason for merging.</dd>
<dd>I haven't thought out what the tabs could be too carefully, but something like an "Images" tab, with multiple selected images, possibly with different areas of focus; an "Articles" tab with multiple selected articles, with different focused topics (like spaceflight, or astronomy..); maybe a "News" tab, with recent and future astronomical events, as well as spaceflight information.</dd>
<dd>The point is that I feel these subjects are too closely related to warrant separate portals; I feel it is best <i>for the readers</i> to have a single unified portal. <a href="../../../m/l/m/User%7EMlm42_1189.html" title="User:Mlm42">Mlm42</a> 18:54, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm new to editing wikipedia, but I would like to contribute to the astronomy portal by updating the astronomy events a bit. This page: <a href="../../../a/s/t/Portal%7EAstronomy_Events_2007_5b41.html" title="Portal:Astronomy/Events/2007">Portal:Astronomy/Events/2007</a></p>
<p>I notice the astronomy events are a bit lacking in detail, for example this March there are barely any events listed, and things such as the partial solar eclipse of March 19 or the Moon-Saturn Conjunction of March 28 are not listed. I was thinking of putting down all of the events from this list: <a href="http://www.seasky.org/astronomy/astronomy_calendar_2007.html" class="external free" title="http://www.seasky.org/astronomy/astronomy_calendar_2007.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.seasky.org/astronomy/astronomy_calendar_2007.html</a></p>

<dd>No need to ask for "permission", just go ahead and add <i>April</i> with the items you think are notable enough to be listed. Just follow a similar list style for easy readability.
