<h2><span class="mw-headline">Spanish History</span></h2>
<p>I'm the person who wrote the "Modern Spain" article. I know my english level is quite sub-par, especially relating to translation skills and spelling mistakes, however, there was no data for Spanish history from the restoration (1870s) until the modern days, and I was studying it at the time, so I decided to create the basic articles to draw some attention to it. And you are indeed right, my english level is only secondary, as i am a native Spanish living in Spain Zespris 21:10, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Zespris, I did not intend to offend you. Wikipedia is a common project and I was not criticising you. Simply it was a call for someone else to help out.

<p>You seem to have removed on Feb. 25 the subheading about the validity and views about the term. I know (i was one of the contributors, see the talk page) that it was far from perfect. The term and their implications are highly controversial, and we wanted thru this heading to put a balanced account of the different views about it. Wikipedia should be NPOV, and that includes to show in cases like this the different facets of the problem, so I think it should be restored (and if possible with a higher quality redaction.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Advice</span></h2>
<p>You are entitled to archive your page as often you want, but editors who remove (especially adverse) comments as soon as they're added get a bad reputation, and tend to lose the trust and respect of other editors (see <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUser_talk_pages_6d08.html" title="Wikipedia:User talk pages">Wikipedia:User talk pages</a>. That can make your time on Wikipedia much less pleasant. I usually wait until editing my page gets a "this page may be too long" notice. It's entirely up to you, but I thought that you should be aware of the possible consequences of your actions. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 18:20, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks, Mel. If my intention had been to remove everything I would not have archived it and placed a link to it then. I just got tired of know-it-all people waiting to stab someone else in the back. The Fair Use page is only a <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">guideline</a> and common sense should prevail. This is the whole point of Wikipedia. I just grew fatigued of their feebles accusations and bureaucratic mentality. I appreciate your advice.

<p>I have reinstated all comments back from the archive. Any wikipedian interested on the issue should be able to revisit the event. I believe Nicholas Turnbull was ignoring process as my actions (Archiving my <b>own</b> user talk page and inserting a fair-use logo) did not amount to a reason to block me. He came from nowhere and did not even try to discuss at all (I was banned after I had quitted the discussion with Sam and gone to bed!).

When was the last time you said "Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia" or "Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonian" out loud? It just isn't done. And yes, I am trying to push a point of view... that point of view is that we don't have to listen to nationalists on Wikipedia, we can come to our own conclusions. Not Serb nationalists, not Greek nationalists, not Croat nationalists, not Romanian, Bulgaria or English, French nationalists, none of them&#160;:)) - <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisTyers_1664.html" title="User:FrancisTyers">FrancisTyers</a> 23:59, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry but I cannot see the point of starting an edit war. I stick to the internationally accepted view (UN, European Union and even NATO). Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is a NPOV term, while Macedonia or Rep. of Macedonia is not. Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia, not an "anti-nationalist platform". The <a href="../../../z/a/s/Zastava_vehicles.html" title="Zastava vehicles">article</a> is about cars, nothing else. There is no need to add wood to the fire. I respect your opinion but cannot agree with it. Regards, <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAsterion_ed2e.html" title="User:Asterion">Asterion</a> 00:11, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Don't mislabel the UN and the EU as the internationally accepted view. The UN and the EU have to the listen to nationalists whining on and they make a lot of mistakes... and I'm sure there are Macedonian nationalists who make just as boring listening. Wikipedia doesn't. The name of the article is <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Macedonia_2bfd.html" title="Republic of Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a> and that is what we should use. By disagreeing you are assuming a Greek nationalist point of view and that is no more acceptable. I'm sure you've already read it, but read <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_relations_of_the_Republic_of_Macedonia_f62e.html#Naming_issue" title="Foreign relations of the Republic of Macedonia">Foreign_relations_of_the_Republic_of_Macedonia#Naming_issue</a>. Wikipedia calls it the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Macedonia_2bfd.html" title="Republic of Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a>, look for yourself, it isn't an anti-nationalist "platform" but neither is it a Greek-nationalist-platform.&#160;:) Don't make this page one of the only ones on Wikipedia not to deal with the naming dispute to mention this absurdity. - <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisTyers_1664.html" title="User:FrancisTyers">FrancisTyers</a> 11:31, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Francis, the name Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was used by this country in its applications to join the UN and for the EU admission talks. It is not Greek namecalling. Besides, I am simply interested in writing about the car. I just would not like to see the article turned into an edit battlefield by third parties, with no real interest in the subject of the article. I will stay aside any further discussions on the country name. It is up to you all to agree on the terminology.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Your poor understanding of politics</span></h2>
<p>I suggest you pay attention to other editors' remarks, especially when these are more in the subject than you. You repeat all over again: '<i>and many high-ranked civil servants and army staff, unhappy with Milosevic's party turning away from Yugoslavism ideals.</i> I removed this passage and you stubbornly re-added it. But I have already explained in the talk page that YUL was not an extremist party which readily took hardliners from SPS. It was just as nationalist as Socialist Party was. The thing is that Milosevic just wanted to show his own party more moderate than it really was and that's why a new place was necessary for some hard-line nationalists. Neiher were there any strategical political disagreements between Milosevic (SPS) and his wife (YUL) as it concludes from your edits.</p>
<p>Most of my information is taken there [<cite id="endnote_frees" style="font-style: normal;"><a href="#ref_frees" title=""><b>↑</b></a></cite>&#160;<a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~freeserb/politics/e-jul.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.xs4all.nl/~freeserb/politics/e-jul.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>], a link that you so stubbornly censor from the page.</p>
<p><i>This coincided with Milosevic's party turn to socialdemocracy, at the time of its failed application to join the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_International_2aa7.html" title="Socialist International">Socialist International</a>.</i> -- <s>this passage makes little sense, as only two (out of 50? 100?) SI members recognised serb socialists as soc dem. Your notion is completely irrelevant.</s>According to Free Serbia, 'all others (over 160 parties from over 130 countries) voted against. With this decision, unusually (for SI) hard and unpleasant letter was sent to SPS, in which it is accused for ethnic nationalism, creating wars and dissolution of former Yugoslavia and suffering of people. Since then SPS has built relations only with obscure communist parties around the world.'</p>
<p><i>It was considered a all-Yugoslavia party, as opposed to <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slobodan_Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87_0fcd.html" title="Slobodan Milošević">Slobodan Milošević</a>'s <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Party_of_Serbia_e08d.html" title="Socialist Party of Serbia">Socialist Party of Serbia</a> (SPS), which had only a Serbian base (the SPS did not run in Montenegro, the Socialist People's Party of Montenegro or SNP, was its partner in the Federal Assembly).</i> This paragraph shows your ignorance of the matter: according to my source, in Montenegro YUL got just a few thousand ballots [in 1996/7 election] (less than there were signs on their candidates' lists). Bulatovic (as President, later appointed to be Prime Minister of Yugoslavia by Slobodan Milošević after losing Montenegrin pres el) and Djukanovic (as Prime Minister) collaborated closely with Milosevic, and their Democratic_Party_of_Socialists_of_Montenegro was little more than regional branch of SSP. --Constanz - <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConstanz_9594.html" title="User talk:Constanz">Talk</a> 08:50, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You have based the whole article and lifted several sentences from the so-called Free Serbia website, which is not neutral and is factually inaccurate in many respects. I did not remove the link to that website, as you insist on saying, I simply removed your duplicated insertion, as the link was already there and there is no point in using footnotes for such a short article (refer to wikipedia guidelines if you are still unsure). Reading your user page, it is clear you are not neutral: Just because you "oppose all forms of marxism", it does not mean you can use Wikipedia for your very own anti-marxist version of things.</dd>

<dd>Your understanding of Serbian and Yugoslav politics is -to say the less- very poor. Not only you confuse Đukanović's DPS with Milošević's allies in Montenegro (the Socialist People's Party or SNP) but continuosly confuse the meaning of the term yugoslavism with extremism or extreme nationalism, when it clearly refer to the opposite.</dd>

<dd>JUL received over 20% of the votes in the first round of the 1996 elections. Because the nature of the FRY electoral system and the outcome of the second (and third round) <a href="http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/62/061.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/62/061.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, the results were not in proportion. "All-Yugoslavia" means it decided to run in both republics, as opposed to the Serbian Socialist Party, which only ran in Serbia for obvious reasons.</dd>
