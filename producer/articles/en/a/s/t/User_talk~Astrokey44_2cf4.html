<dd>Those guys! We do have to double check. Did you upload the very early and detailed map. Even small sections would usable in australian articles. Agree with common usage for 'regions'becoming pages, or maybe a list of terms. I would go for the latter, but it is a big job. Others consider geographical names to be absolute, but your map shows I could be living in Victoria. Unless our cousins got that wrong too&#160;:) <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFred.e_8a59.html" title="User talk:Fred.e">Fred</a> 15:46, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On the WikiProject Countries talk page, you had either explictly declared a general interest in the project, or had participated at a discussion that appears related to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Countries_c1c1.html#Location_Maps_for_European_countries" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Countries">Location Maps for European countries</a>.<br />
New maps had been created by David Liuzzo, and are available for the countries of the <i>European continent</i>, and for countries of the <i>European Union</i> exist in two versions. From <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_16.html" title="November 16">November 16</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> till <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_31.html" title="January 31">January 31</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>, a poll had tried to find a consensus for usage of 'old' or of which and where 'new' version maps. At its closing, 25 people had spoken in favor of either of the two presented usages of new versions but neither version had reached a consensus (12 and 13), and 18 had preferred old maps.<br />
As this outcome cannot justify reverting of new maps that had become used for some countries, seconds before <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_5.html" title="February 5">February 5</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> a survey started that will be closed at <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_20.html" title="February 20">February 20</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 23:59:59. It should establish whether the new style maps may be applied as soon as some might become available for countries outside the European continent (or such to depend on future discussions), and also which new version should be applied for which countries.<br />

<p>Just wondering, would you revisit this article and split the lead into sections, and demote the existing sections? Also, it can be very quickly seen from South Australia onwards, that having lists included in this article would dominate the topic with "precision detail" - maybe the lists of counties should be moved to List of South Australian Counties etc - provided there is anything to add to the list other than the county name. If the only thing to include is a county name, then the best bet would be</p>

<p>I hope you didn't mind, but I nominated this article at <a href="../../../d/i/d/Template_talk%7EDid_you_know_8ba7.html#Created_on_March_8" title="Template talk:Did you know">DYK</a>. Its nice work. —<a href="../../../m/o/o/User_talk%7EMoondyne_51fd.html" title="User talk:Moondyne"><i>Moondyne</i></a> 06:08, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I second Moondyne's comments - nice work on these divisions. Given that I work in Industrial Law I am aware of and thought you might like to know (and edit appropriately where you see fit) that there are still reasonably strong relationships between Industrial Award entitlements (particularly for State Awards across Australia) and some counties. (Although the WorkChoices reforms are beginning to remove this relationship).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Anyway the boundaries of a county is sometimes used to define the exclusion or inclusion point as to whether workers are included or not in a particular award. There are a great many examples in many parts of Australia but to show you one, the NSW METAL, ENGINEERING AND ASSOCIATED INDUSTRIES (STATE) AWARD includes <b>All persons employed in the industries and callings of ... etc...</b> but excludes those persons if they are in <b>the County of Yancowinna</b> see here <a href="http://www.industrialrelations.nsw.gov.au/Scripts/isyswebext.dll?op=get&amp;uri=/isysquery/irl8c40/10/doc" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.industrialrelations.nsw.gov.au/Scripts/isyswebext.dll?op=get&amp;uri=/isysquery/irl8c40/10/doc" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> for that example. I hope that assists? --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualSteve_38d8.html" title="User:VirtualSteve"><strong>VS</strong></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EVirtualSteve_c3d0.html" title="User talk:VirtualSteve">talk</a></sup> 10:28, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>No problems. I'm glad the info helped. Yancowinna in this case is excluded because of distance from Sydney. Many awards are almost the same from one county to another but may for example include an extra weeks leave and some other entitlements. Put simply those sort of extras were negotiated long ago in an effort to gain a reward for members who were in the union's view working in more isolated areas. A broader (but still general answer) is for me to say that it is unlikely that any county reference will have anything to do with closeness to any other state because of demarcation - that is ownership of the award. I'll try to explain.... The example award is a Metals award "owned" by the NSW branch of the AMWU who would rarely if ever share anything in terms of employees (read members) with their 'comrades' in the SA branch of the AMWU. Partly this is about factionalism and partly because of sheer ability to lobby State parliaments. The whole area is pretty complex but suffice to say that throughout all of the states that have counties there are such examples. <i>Your inclusion in the article encompasses this but if you don't mind I will make a minor adjustment to give it a present tense.</i> Nice talking with you as always. --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualSteve_38d8.html" title="User:VirtualSteve"><strong>VS</strong></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EVirtualSteve_c3d0.html" title="User talk:VirtualSteve">talk</a></sup> 12:44, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just on another point regarding counties - (you may know this already - if so I apologise) but just in case and I can help by spreading the knowledge - this website of the Geographical Names Board of NSW <a href="http://www.gnb.nsw.gov.au/name/extract?id=SXKqjzqbMa" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gnb.nsw.gov.au/name/extract?id=SXKqjzqbMa" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> provides for a search function (click on either of the two Name Search buttons at the top left) for any town in NSW and then gives good details including the county of location. <b>Perhaps useful as an External Link</b> to put in the article? --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualSteve_38d8.html" title="User:VirtualSteve"><strong>VS</strong></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EVirtualSteve_c3d0.html" title="User talk:VirtualSteve">talk</a></sup> 13:14, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The three county articles that I've added are based on current ones - I used to work in a bank and we had to put the county/parish down on a lot of paperwork for mortgage securities and the like. As far as I know, the counties we have now are the same as in your map - at least for Canning, Stanley, Ward, and Elphinstone. Some of the rural counties have possibly been split more, I do not know.</p>
<p>I'd be interested in researching and adding more information on this topic, but unfortunately info is hard to come by unless you still work in the industry (and I don't). <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankiveil_3447.html" title="User:Lankiveil">Lankiveil</a> 09:02, 9 March 2007 (UTC).</p>

<p>G'day. Just thought I'd tell you that I have begun adding county information to towns on <a href="../../../r/i/v/Template%7ERiverina_5d98.html" title="Template:Riverina">Template:Riverina</a> in the following example format<br />
<b>| county = [[Buccleuch County, New South Wales|Buccleuch]]</b><br />
(which immediately stops disambiguations such as <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buccleuch.html" title="Buccleuch">Buccleuch</a>. I am progressing systematically from A to Y (but it will take a while to finish with about 250 locations).</p>
<p>As soon as I come across a redlink county I create the stub (read mini stub) - see for example <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denison_County%2C_New_South_Wales_8a62.html" title="Denison County, New South Wales">Denison</a> - I couldn't find colour pointed maps available as yet so I am leaving that part for when you get a chance(?).</p>
<p>I will let you know which county stubs I create in groups as I move along.

<p>Just got that message thanks Astrokey. I have responded also at the discussion page with this comment... (From my perspective - <b>choose - either in the info box or in the prose</b> - whatever the majority decide but don't just drop this great work. Counties and parishes are still used in property and industrial legal documents and they represent both a current and a historical fact which is most definitely encyclopedic.) I will await the end result before I go down the path of adding county and or parish information. --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualSteve_38d8.html" title="User:VirtualSteve"><strong>VS</strong></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EVirtualSteve_c3d0.html" title="User talk:VirtualSteve">talk</a></sup> 06:48, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not a lot sadly - I'm trying to find that out&#160;:/ Some sources call them "districts". Read my last main contribution at <a href="../../../w/a/_/WT%7EWA_5822.html" title="WT:WA">WT:WA</a> where I covered some of what I have. They turn up in Government Gazettes, I've mostly been concentrating on Swan, which covers all of northern and eastern suburban Perth, and southern as far south as Booragoon and Applecross. The lettered locations (eg Swan Location K - see <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamersley%2C_Western_Australia_472a.html" title="Hamersley, Western Australia">Hamersley</a>) are very long, approx 1.4km wide strip lots counted back westwards or northwest from the Swan River. 1370 is the biggest location within Swan and covers the entire suburbs from Yanchep right down to Hepburn Avenue, with 1315 being south of it and 1352 being north of it (towards Gingin). Other Perth area ones are Canning and Cockburn Sound, with Avon and Ninghan to the east, Williams to the southeast and Murray and Wellington (which surrounds Bunbury) to the south. Further south is Sussex (SW), Nelson (S) etc. Victoria surrounds Geraldton. <a href="http://aeon.sro.wa.gov.au/Investigator/Details/Series_Detail.asp?Id=978&amp;SearchPage=Item" class="external text" title="http://aeon.sro.wa.gov.au/Investigator/Details/Series_Detail.asp?Id=978&amp;SearchPage=Item" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a SRO item which hints at others (eg East, Hampton, Kent, Plantagenet etc)</p>
<p>When I have time I'll see if I can prepare a more complete list. They're used to this day by planning departments and local councils. I don't even know what these divisions are called so it's difficult to look them up in a book. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 11:44, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That appears to be it! So it would seem they're called "land districts". Many of the district names on those maps are very familiar to me from gazettes - thanks heaps&#160;:) Now what should we do with this information? (BTW re dates - it appears the Swan and Wellington ones in particular go back to earliest days - I have evidence of Swan Location K being granted just 3 months after Swan River Colony's foundation in Sep 1829, and the literature suggests Location L, known as Sandalford Estate then and part of which still is to this day, being already established by the time it was chosen. Swan Location 32, in around Bicton, was 1832ish and was allocated to a family member of John Butler, who owned the modern suburb of Peppermint Grove as a traveller's inn and was one of the first explorers to pass Wanneroo. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 13:25, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems to be Land division -&gt; Land district -&gt; Location -&gt; Lot (eg a Govt Gazette entry might refer to "Swan Location 8968, formerly part of Swan Location 1315 and comprising that part of it marked as lots 104, 105 and 106 on LTO plan 47271" (I made the numbers up) Your article looks fantastic...

<dd>I can get maps at the Battye for Perth - they're not terribly clear on those either (I've looked at one) but when I finish my gazettals project I'll probably be able to understand the map better. I think most of those districts have survived but many are of course abandoned nowadays - it seems to be that they took original land titles very seriously. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 03:55, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey there Astrokey44 (my kudos to you also for the totality of this work - along with the lads above). Can I just tell you that I have added 7 previously missing from the list in New South Wales - they were Farnell, Finch, Gowen, Irrara, Monteagle, Woore and Taila. I have also (I hope you don't mind because it will mean a couple of minor adjustments to your map image) adjusted the spelling of Gulgoa to Culgoa and Bockland to Buckland. The 1888 map is hard to read but when I looked at other sources these are now the correct spelling. Hope that all helps. --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualSteve_38d8.html" title="User:VirtualSteve"><strong>VS</strong></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EVirtualSteve_c3d0.html" title="User talk:VirtualSteve">talk</a></sup> 12:46, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>(copied from my talk page) Wow - I've never seen a genealogy page before - I agree some disambig pages will need to come also. I don't know if you have noticed that I have created all of the pages (that weren't there previously) from A to B <b>including where the name came from</b>. I have all of the rest created as a word document ready to go and will continue tomorrow putting them up. It is very interesting seeing where the names for each county came from....

<p>I see you are on-line - I have a question that has been 'bothering' me a little for some time. In the description of <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadastral_divisions_of_New_South_Wales_a3e2.html" title="Cadastral divisions of New South Wales">Cadastral divisions of New South Wales</a> - it states <i>Instructions were given to Governor Brisbane in 1825 to survey New South Wales and divide it into counties of approximately forty square miles, and parishes between fifteen and twenty five square miles</i>. To me that has always seemed far too small particularly when you do the maths between counties and parishes. Towards that point <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckland_County%2C_New_South_Wales_47bf.html" title="Buckland County, New South Wales">Buckland County, New South Wales</a> (given the new data that I have just put up) states that it is <i>about 1484 square miles</i>.

<li>Glad you like it - I sort of worked it out in my head last night. It's a lot of work in terms of sorting and then checking every link and coordinate etc but I have the template in place on my desktop and if I knuckle down then I should be able to prepare up to about 4 or 5 counties per day (perhaps a few more on weekends) so I should finish in about 20-28 days. I have opted not to link Parishes - they just turn into a very, very ugly sea of redlinks or link to other obscure pages. I thought the good, better, best touch was that each one points directly to its governing LGA and to a centralised coordinate which can be opened (as you no doubt know) via Google Maps etc. --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualSteve_38d8.html" title="User:VirtualSteve"><strong>VS</strong></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EVirtualSteve_c3d0.html" title="User talk:VirtualSteve">talk</a></sup> 02:16, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Just to let you know - I have written a small job specific macro that is speeding up the sorting through the list of Parishes and adding link brackets, coordinate specifications etc - which should decrease the time to complete this job a fair bit. I now have a list of all or at least nearly all the Parishes and will just continue through the counties in alpha order.--<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualSteve_38d8.html" title="User:VirtualSteve"><strong>VS</strong></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EVirtualSteve_c3d0.html" title="User talk:VirtualSteve">talk</a></sup> 09:59, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I like it for many reasons but mainly because a navigational tool makes the whole concept of Counties much more valid and is a tangible way of getting a reader to conceptualise this part of Australian history. <b>I think you should go for it.</b> I also think that with the Parishes and your Navigation addition the NSW GeoStub could pretty well come of the page (at that stage the page is way bigger than a stub). --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualSteve_38d8.html" title="User:VirtualSteve"><strong>VS</strong></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EVirtualSteve_c3d0.html" title="User talk:VirtualSteve">talk</a></sup> 11:59, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
