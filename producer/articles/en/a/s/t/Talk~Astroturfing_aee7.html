<p>The examples in this article are exclusively anti-Republican, which introduces POV because astroturfing is well-documented in both US political parties. In the last presidential election, pundits of both persuasions (primarily those leaning left) credited Bush's re-election to the fact that most Republican campaign operatives were volunteers (grassroots), while most Democrat campaign operatives were paid (astroturf), described as follows in a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A23754-2004Nov3.html" class="external text" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A23754-2004Nov3.html" rel="nofollow">Washington Post article</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Bush's organization may have been the more cohesive and coordinated. It included 85,000 volunteers -- nearly four times the number in 2000 -- that concentrated on what Paduchik called "volunteer to voter" contact. Among other efforts, Bush <b>volunteers</b> held thousands of "parties for the president," in which people were invited by their neighbors to hear about Bush's record and policies.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Kerry's effort was large but balkanized. It included the Democratic Party's own campaign workers, plus labor union members and other nominally independent groups called 527s (named for the portion of the federal tax code they are organized under). One of the largest of these groups was America Coming Together, which organized thousands of <b>paid workers</b> to register voters and knock on doors. ACT, which was started with seed money from billionaire George Soros, spent more money in Ohio than any other state, according to campaign finance records.</dd>
</dl>
<p>To help offset the anti-Republican bias, another good example of Democrat astroturfing would be the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22seminar+caller%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22seminar+caller%22" rel="nofollow">seminar caller</a> phenomenon on talk radio, where the same talking points from the DNC fax and email lists are often parroted by callers to radio talk shows. Several alert talk show hosts try to combat them by having a set of all the party memos and begin reading them along with the seminar caller to expose them as plants.</p>

<p>Hi, I just merged in two examples from another article on the subject. What I didn't bring in was this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>In early 2003, what some people consider to be deceptive form letters emanating from the Republican National Committee caused a scandal. Newspapers from Cape Cod to Hawaii were printing identical letters, all signed by local home-town people. The people signing the letters were real Republicans, but many editors and readers felt it was a sneaky way to publish Republican ads without paying for them or acknowledging where they came from. The Republicans claimed they were just helping their members express themselves.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I wondered if this is documented enough. Actual people signing their own name to a form letter and sending it in does not qualify as astroturfing, does it? <a href="../../../s/y/m/User%7ESympleko_94c6.html" title="User:Sympleko">Sympleko</a> 12:35, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not the same incident, but last year <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media_Watch_%28Australian_TV_series%29_bdec.html" title="Media Watch (Australian TV series)">ABC's Media Watch</a> had the story of a US national guardsman sending a letter home, which was <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s1137032.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s1137032.htm" rel="nofollow">reprinted in several newspapers</a>. It's apparently been confirmed that he wrote the letter, sent it to many friends and family, and gave instructions to send it on to others. Media Watch does a good job of dissecting the statements. Not quite astroturfing, but it's the closest example I can source at the moment. <a href="../../../i/m/r/User%7EImroy_06a3.html" title="User:Imroy">Imroy</a> 07:49, July 30, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>"The term astroturfing pejoratively describes ..."</i><br />
I am wondering if there is a non-pejorative term to describe such organizations in a factual way. An example is the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Center_for_Consumer_Freedom_5303.html" title="Center for Consumer Freedom">Center for Consumer Freedom</a>, which has been tagged as POV by some editors who don't like the term <a href="../../../f/r/o/Front_group.html" title="Front group">front group</a>. I actually believe that the term "astroturfing" describes the reality better, but if it is only or primarily used pejoratively then it will even face bigger opposition from the (astroturfing?) "Consumer Freedom" lobby. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommon_Man_4415.html" title="User:Common Man">Common Man</a> 09:40, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Astroturfing" and "front group" are both pejorative terms, with separate meanings. Astroturfing refers specifically to activities of "fake grassroots" groups. Since CCF doesn't take part in these activities (as far as we know), it would be opinionated and inaccurate to accuse them of astroturfing. Astroturfing is a specific activity - organizing meetings, sending letters to local newspapers, setting up surreptitious web sites, participating in message boards.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The use of either term, "astroturfing" or "front group", requires a qualifier in this encyclopedia. You could say something like "Group X <i>has been accused of</i> astroturfing by Group Y", assuming that this accusation has in fact been made. But it is a violation of NPOV to state that "Group X <i>is</i> an astroturfing group". Wikipedia does not make value judgments.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also resent your suggestion that anyone who opposes the term "front group" must be working for CCF. Please maintain a certain level of maturity, and recognize that many of us simply want to write neutral encyclopedia articles, as opposed to attack pieces. I am currently defending <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_on_American-Islamic_Relations_0b3f.html" title="Council on American-Islamic Relations">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> from a similar type of bias on the opposite end of the political spectrum. Before you accuse me of bias you may want to check that dispute out. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 19:28, Jun 18, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>The merits of your example aside, I don't think there's any way to refer to astroturfing groups without the suspicion of POV rearing its ugly head. Astroturfing is inherently a Bad Thing, after all. Pointing out that, say, Tech Central Station or the "Alexis de Tocqueville Institute" (golly!) are really astroturf-for-hire fronts will not irritate people beause you used the word "astroturf"; rather, the problem is that you accused them of being such in the first place. Sometimes POV/NPOV disputes resemble the "truth vs balance" argument in journalism.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> 06:26, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just temporarily removed the "Astroturfing in Canada" section. Someone needs to put in specific examples from Canadian politics and back it up with references. It was just a blanket statement that "astroturfing also occurs in Canada at federal and provincial level..." --<a href="../../../2/2/0/User%7E220.245.178.132.html" title="User:220.245.178.132">220.245.178.132</a> 00:56, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well the point of astroturf is that it shouldn't be documented. However, I have worked on provincial campaigns in Canada and we did astroturf. Jared s 22 16:28, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was surprised to see the Swift Boat campaign not mentioned here. I supposed it might have been put in and then removed by US partisans for its slant. But in retrospect it was one of the most successful astroturfing campaigns ever, and deserves mention. Karl Rove fans who don't want it mentioned should simply add in an appropriate example of Dem astroturfing to counterbalance. Right?</p>

<p>People are very suggestible, but marketers and propagandists have found that when a central core emotion is touched, creating a link between the person and the message, they accept it very readily. A figure in a crowd, whispering "We're both Christians, and he's right, you know!" I call it emotional hijacking. Not being a marketer, and frankly, suspicious of atroturfing, hijacking of people's herd mentality, etc., is there a more formal description of this with respect to astroturfing of true grassroots movements? --UB.</p>

<p>Also questioning about bias, as any astroturfing group would deny the charge. Linking to specific groups is tantamount to a charge that the group would deny. A better method may be to name a few contemporary organizations that have been charged with astroturfing, both on the Left and Right, and sketch the arguments for and against.</p>

<dd>POV doesn't mean that <i>someone would disagree with this article</i> it's more like <i>the article presents only one pont of view and fails to make that clear</i>. It's typically something that should only be applied to an article where a) the POV parts have been identified and b) attempts to fix that have failed. If an article clearly identifies who holds what view (e.g. with clear attribution) then it probably doesn't fall under POV. If you feel that there is POV here, please clearly state where, propose changes (on this talk page), try to carry them out (or whatever the consensus is) and then, if that fails a POV tag may be approporiate whilst some kind of dispute resolution is carried on (this may take a long time).</dd>

<p>I don't believe that something such as Milosevic reading letters by 'concerned citizens' on radio qualifies as astroturfing, for two reasons:</p>
<p>a) there is no evidence one way or t'other if they were genuine letters. Given that your average president receives thousands of letters a week, it's more likely to have been cherry-picking; and</p>
<p>b) the president, unabashedly in the guise of the president, was reading them and then basking in the glory of them.</p>
<p>The weakness in the Soviet Union example is also apparent: if you tell the public what to think (not covertly, just through the normal processes of government), enough of them will think it to write letters to the editor saying what you want to hear. You then publish those absolutely genuine letters for your own ends. This is not astroturfing. The story of one of the last of these (anti-Gorbachev) letters, the publication of which became a flashpoint for fighting between the pro- and anti-reform factions in the Soviet administration, is detailed in David Remnick's <i>Lenin's Tomb</i>. Remnick went to the trouble of meeting the letter-writer, who was a non-nomenklatura member of the public and actually held the views she expressed.</p>
<p>The point is that without rigorousness in selecting examples, astroturfing spreads beyond its definition, and simply becomes a synonym for 'propaganda' or (worse) 'politicking'. The thing that distinguishes it from any propaganda, or any politician looking to bolster their decisions by saying 'many concerned citizens have contacted me/there is a large swell of community feeling on this issue', is (in my view) that it is <i>material presented directly to the uninformed consumer as coming from an uninterested member of the public at large, when it is not</i>. It is the (to use a loaded term) fraud on the public as to the identity of the origin of the material, that is the essence of astroturfing.</p>
<p>On a slightly different topic, I think that things like iDon't, while a related phenomena, are better described as 'viral marketing' than astroturfing. Viral marketing (lazy definition: marketing that doesn't appear to be marketing) sites and campaigns are a dime a dozen at the moment. iDon't may be slightly different in that it purports to be <i>against</i> something rather than just (as is common) saying 'we established this site to let kids express themselves and be free'; but absent an overtly political message, I still doubt if it's astroturfing.</p>
<p>I've not been presumptuous enough to delete from the article, but I think that for the reasons I've set out, existing examples need to be culled, and future examples need to be selected carefully.203.3.176.10 03:53, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>MoveOn, as an organization founded and funded by George Soros, follows the political philosophy of it's founder. Given Mr. Soros' similar activities to dictate public policy in Europe (e.g. freely available abortions in Russia), I believe it's safe to say that members/followers/subscribers to MoveOn may be as relevant to the parent organization as teats on a boar; it's merely convenient that people ally themselves with MoveOn. One man's opinion and his billions still rule the day. Call it astroturfing with expendable disciples.</p>

<p>I appended the following aseveration to the article: The Autoridad del Canal de Panama, ACP, which administrates the Panama Canal on behalf of the panamanian goverment, contracted the services of Edelman, an american PR firm to "correct inconsistencies" that may be posted on public forums.

<p>One anonymous user recently added the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union's Wake Up Wal-Mart project to the Recent Examples section. Even if that poster may strongly dislike the UFCW and/or Wake Up Wal-Mart, that does <i>not</i> necessarily mean that one can <i>accurately</i> classify Wake Up Wal-Mart as an act of astroturfing. In fact, I can think of two reasons why Wake Up Wal-Mart may not be astroturfing after all:</p>
<p><b>1.</b> The UFCW seems to be far more honest about being the driving force behind Wake Up Wal-Mart than Wal-Mart apparently has been about its own influence over Working Families for Wal-Mart.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> Labor unions, by their nature, are (or at least tend to be) grassroots organizations anyway -- which definitely cannot be said about Wal-Mart and other large business corporations.</p>
<p>Thus, for the time being, I have removed the Wake Up Wal-Mart references, although I am open to compelling arguments for restoring the information.--<a href="../../../t/w/o/User%7ETwoTone_7b55.html" title="User:TwoTone">TwoTone</a> 00:55, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed the paragraph on Microsoft being accused of Astroturfing. It wasn't particularly NPOV because it left out some facts regarding original LA Times article the Newsfactor article was based upon (What is it with news sites reporting about other reports anyways? Attempts to Spin the article their own way?). For example, the original LA Times news story (which doesn't appear to be accessible anymore) said that the letters from deceased individuals had had the names of the deceased crossed off and family members wrote in their own and mailed them in, which is somewhat different that what the wikipedia paragraph portrayed.

aside, you have brought no astroturfing evidence to us.<br /></p>

<dd>So, I know very little of astroturffing. I have been watching this page because I was trying to help mediate a COI dispute on <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astroturf.html" title="Astroturf">Astroturf</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/e/FieldTurf_74a2.html" title="FieldTurf">FieldTurf</a>, which were (ironically) being edited by representatives of the two companies. As, I understand the definition of <i>astroturfing</i> from the [Astroturfing|article]], it is a campaign that purports to be grassroots but is not. CCF describes themselves on their website as:
<dl>
<dd>The Center for Consumer Freedom is a nonprofit coalition of restaurants, food companies, and consumers working together to promote personal responsibility and protect consumer choices.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>They seem to be honest about who is paying for it.

<dd>Astroturf has a very particular meaning - pretending to be a 'grass roots' organisation when you are not. So if, for example, activistcash.com said "we are a bunch of concerned consumers fighting against the extremists", then that would be fake grass roots. OTOH, it says quite clearly on the front page that is funded by CCF, and has a link to CCF's site.<a href="http://www.activistcash.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.activistcash.com/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> This page clearly defines what astroturfing is. An example would be posting a videos on youtube pretending to be from consumers. They don't. In fact they say who they are from. Even your source above "Berman’s efforts might not seem all that remarkable in a city where industry-funded "astroturf" groups are so emboldened that many no longer bother concealing funding sources" says that they are not concealing who they are, and therefore by this page's own definition cannot be astroturf. The heading is "Recent examples". If you have an example of sourced astroturfing by CCF, go ahead and list them. Otherwise they don't belong here. This page defines a particular term. <a href="../../../n/s/s/User%7ENssdfdsfds_5480.html" title="User:Nssdfdsfds">Nssdfdsfds</a> 14:03, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The article has serious <a href="../../../u/n/d/WP%7EUndue_weight_9fd9.html" title="WP:Undue weight">WP:Undue_weight</a> issues. The list of "recent examples" is, I think, way to long and should be severly purged. Remember the purpose of this article is to educate people what astroturfing is; controversal examples fail to do that. It is not a chance to list every astroturfing campaign that has ever occured, or to call attention to the deceptive tactics of groups who's agendas you may not like. The controversal examples should be the first to go. --<b><a href="../../../s/e/l/User%7ESelket_adc6.html" title="User:Selket">Selket</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../s/e/l/User_talk%7ESelket_51a5.html" title="User talk:Selket">Talk</a></sup> 15:48, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've removed many of them. The ones lacking citations were first to go. There was one about chocolate milk from Nestlé that I couldn't find much about online either, so I deleted that too. As you say, this article should be defining astroturfing, not finger pointing at organisations. If there is an issue with a given organisation astroturfing, it should go on that organisation's own page. Here is not a good dumping ground for criticism. It might be a good idea to remove further allegations from this list. <a href="../../../n/s/s/User%7ENssdfdsfds_5480.html" title="User:Nssdfdsfds">Nssdfdsfds</a> 17:55, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I entirely agree with Nssdfdsfds. I'd never heard of the CCF before reading this article, and it sounds self-evidant that any industry group that explicitly describes itself as such, however abhorrent I or any one else may think it, should not be presented as such. Far more importantly though, there's no point whatsoever in having an example section. Every instance will inevitably be debated as NPOV, and even if they were all accepted, there'd be hundreds more that some individuals would like to insert. It's an endless POV war, and the only solution is for the whole "examples" section to be deleted. Let the individual pages battle it out.

<p>Two points:</p>
<ol>
<li>We only need enough examples so readers understand what astroturfing is. I don't think we need a comprehensive list of organizations branded as astroturf. Especially if it's a one-sided list, rather than a representative one. If a contributor were to use this list to advance the POV that only (or chiefly) anti-environmentalist groups pull this dodge, that would be a rules violation, wouldn't it?</li>
<li>The specific example which follows needs attribution (and could just as well be shortened using the {main} template.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cut from article:</p>
<ul>
<li>In March 2006, a supposed called the <a href="../../../s/a/v/Save_Our_Species_Alliance_de25.html" title="Save Our Species Alliance">Save Our Species Alliance</a> was exposed as a front group that was created by a timber lobbyist to weaken the <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endangered_Species_Act_4d38.html" title="Endangered Species Act">Endangered Species Act</a>. The campaign director for this group is <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Wigley_d307.html" title="Tim Wigley">Tim Wigley</a>, the Executive Director of Pac/West Communications. Wigley was also the campaign director for Project Protect, another front group that spent $2.9 million to help pass <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">President Bush's</a> <a href="../../../h/e/a/Healthy_Forests_6488.html" title="Healthy Forests">Healthy Forests</a> legislation which has been criticized for its pro-industry bias. <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/journals/esthag-w/2006/mar/policy/pt_bigindustry.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/journals/esthag-w/2006/mar/policy/pt_bigindustry.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> The Save Our Species Alliance web site portrays itself as a grassroots organization against the <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endangered_Species_Act_4d38.html" title="Endangered Species Act">Endangered Species Act</a> (the word "grassroots" is mentioned no less than five times on their "Take Action Now" page), but is criticized by environmentalists for being a front group for wealthy cattle and timber interests which consider Federal environmental legislation an impediment to profit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Who says its not really an <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environmentalism.html" title="Environmentalism">environmental</a> group?</p>
<p>Who "exposed it as a front group"?</p>
<ul>
<li>Note that before it can be "exposed" as one, we must SHOW that it is one.</li>
<li>Otherwise, it's better to say it was "branded" as one or (if you want to be nice "called" one)</li>
</ul>
<p>We need to clarify what "weaken" means here. Does that mean to make the legitimate purposes of the Act ineffective? If so, who says so?</p>
<p>I linked <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Wigley_d307.html" title="Tim Wigley">Tim Wigley</a> - this was momentarily delinked. Thanks for putting it back. Is there a policy against having red links? There wasn't, 5 years ago, when I first started volunteering here. If so, when did it change?</p>
<p>All the extra stuff about Wigley: what does this have to do with the claim that SOSA (1) is a "front group" or that it engaged in astroturfing? Is the point merely to link SOSA with Bush and/or industry? And <b>who</b> criticized it for such bias?</p>
<ul>
<li>Is is the point to make the article imply that SOSA is pro-industry? If so, why not just say it up front, in the SOSA article, like this:
<ul>
<li>SOSA is a pro-industry organization which campaigns for X (or against Y). A called it a "front group". B attacked it for astroturfing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But it's not a good <b>example</b> for an article about astroturfing in general, if we only report charges against it. (Don't tell us, show us, eh?)</p>
<p>Whether it's used as an example which supports the Astroturfing article, or simply gets merged into the <a href="../../../s/a/v/Save_Our_Species_Alliance_de25.html" title="Save Our Species Alliance">Save Our Species Alliance</a> article, it still needs a lot of work.</p>
<p>I'm spending much more time talking about how to fix it, than fixing it myself because there are dozens of articles with similar weaknesses. I'd like us to work together to fix them up the same way.

<p>The inclusion of "disinformation" goes beyond knocking its claim to represent the surging masses and accuses the campaign of lying - presumably about something more serious about whether it represents a groundswell.

<p>By the way, is it only anti-environmentalists who do astroturfing? How about anti-Bush riots overseas, which are government sponsored?

<p>Despite the impression given by this article, corporate groups aren't the only ones who indulge in astroturfing. Sorry this is only a blog entry, but I'm not as good at research as I'd like to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fenton practically invented "astroturfing". You might try a google search on fenton and Alar. You might remember the Alar apple scare where Fenton built a grassroots network of "concerned environmentalist" groups nationwide practically overnight. The finale was a 60 minutes piece on the dangers of Alar on apples. Nevermind that not a single person had ever been harmed.</li>
<li>THANK YOU for shining light on this. I tried over a year ago to point out how Fenton Communications was orchestrating all of these antiwar groups/individuals and how people such as Dana Priest of the Washington Post had connections with many of these groups (Dana Priest through her husband connected to the Wilson/Plame issue and a Fenton client).</li>
<li>Fenton Communications has been the driving force. One of their tactics is simple ... hijack an event, cause a spectacle, and become the focus to get the message out ... such as when Larry Johnson heckled Rumsfeld at a press conference (VIPS ... Fenton client) or when Sheehan disrupted a Democratic press conference. The idea is to steal the media eye and use it to get the message out. <a href="http://www.mudvillegazette.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=7574" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mudvillegazette.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=7574" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I like this passage because of the vivid phrase 'Fenton built a grassroots network of "concerned environmentalist" groups nationwide practically overnight.' Also, the link from the supposed groundswell to the <a href="../../../6/0/_/60_Minutes_b078.html" title="60 Minutes">60 Minutes</a> piece. Didn't this turn out to be a classic case of <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junk_science.html" title="Junk science">junk science</a>?
