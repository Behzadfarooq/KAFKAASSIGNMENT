<p>HI Astrokey44, I've noticed that you've been working on a few Canberra suburb articles. I thought I'd encourage you to add your name to the participants list on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Canberra_c1d7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Canberra">canberra project page</a>. It's useful to know how many active people there are working on things and who to message when you have questions/suggestions/requests/whatever. Welcome, and happy wiki-ing. <a href="../../../a/d/z/User%7EAdz_7b0c.html" title="User:Adz">Adz</a> 08:40, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Further research shows that Swinger Hill is in both the suburb of Mawson and Phillip. The shops are in Mawson and Barnett Close is in Phillip - I will try to think about how to show correctly.

<dd>no worries, if people think its part of Mawson or its own separate suburb, maybe that should be included in the article? popular opinion on wiki is probably more valuable than the official view. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrokey44_a15f.html" title="User:Astrokey44">Astrokey44</a> 01:28, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do you think the new denotation on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_suburbs_of_Canberra_cdc0.html" title="List of suburbs of Canberra">List of suburbs of Canberra</a> looks subtler?

<p>I've noticed you've been adding Commons images to a <i>lot</i> of country articles. There's a lot of useful images on Commons that everyone tends to forget about when writing articles, and it's great to see someone making use of it from time to time. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 05:35, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

I'd wanted to put info on the result of each of the 4 parts to the war.. something like this: <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrokey44_cambrai_091d.html" title="User:Astrokey44/cambrai">User:Astrokey44/cambrai</a> - but I didnt know how to make the result section go across without breaking up. Maybe you know how to do it? <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrokey44_a15f.html" title="User:Astrokey44">Astrokey44</a> 13:32, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You'd need to add "colspan=2" to the result fields to make it work. I think it's a bad idea, though — both because it tends to terribly over-simplify what happened, and because it makes the box look too long. There's no good way to boil down the result into 1–2 lines, and no reason a reader interested in the result can't simply read the article. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 14:21, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I like this guide to tables <a href="../../../d/c/l/User%7EDcljr_Tables_2094.html" title="User:Dcljr/Tables">User:Dcljr/Tables</a>, but I think the easiest way to learn to make them is to find one you like in an article and look at how it was put together. If you stuck with a specific problem- I might be able to help- just ask. The message you see when people revert vandalism is generated by the rollback tool, which is only accessible to administrators. A quick edit message that you could use when you revert vandalism is rvv, and just in case you didn't know - the easiest way to revert vandalism is to open the page history, open the last edit before the vandalism, open that version to edit and then save.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 06:32, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Astro, great mapmaking on your part! Which programs have you been using? I think Wikipedia needs more maps that show not just a general tourist road map but explicitly only what the article in question deals with (wheteher it be some historical development or process, any scientific phenomenon or current events). What one wants to know when reading a fascinating article on some subject is usually relative location, distance, extent/size, and perhaps the direction of any development over time.

<dd>Well, to answer your talk the other day... Pretty much every article that I glide across in here could use an overview map to depict location, distance and extent in an easy-to-grasp manner. I'm mainly interested in the social sciences, so I guess all the history, society and current events articles need simple map illustrations. There's so many.. I have no particular requests at this time. =} <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Adamsky_7ebf.html" title="User:Big Adamsky">Big Adamsky</a> 01:38, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Astro44. I am sorry to be picking on your map so much. I thought I would answer your questions. png is an image format very similar to gif, though it is newer and can do other cool stuff the gif can't do. The otehr difference is that it is a "free" format unlike gif which has patent restrictions on it. Wikipedia has a policy of not likeing gif files. Both png and gif are bitmap file formats that are essentially just a grid of pixels with a colour value for each one (overly simplified).</p>
<p>Vector graphics instead defines images by using descriptions of shapes. So a picture of a cicle would consist of a definition of the circle so something like <i>circle,radius,500px,RED</i>. This circle can then be blown up as big as you want on the screen and it's edge will always be a perfect curve instead of going pixelated. Illustrator and <a href="../../../i/n/k/Inkscape.html" title="Inkscape">inkscape</a> are examples of vector editing programs. They are quite a bit differnet to work with than a bitmap based image program like are used to but are greatly better suited to illustrative type work. Inkscape is a free opensource program available for Windows, I haven't actually used it much myself but I would recommend you try it out if you are interested in improving your illustration skills. Don't be put off by the initial steep learning curve.</p>
<p>Vector programs can export to bitmap images (like I have been doing to png) or save natively in vector formats like SVG, ai, Postscript, pdf etc. SVG is the accepted vector format at wikipedia. Again it is a "free" format and simple enough so that you can open it with a text editor and edit the image definition by hand (not that I have tried this). Let me know if you have any questions. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartyman_a0b9.html" title="User:Martyman">Martyman</a>-<span style="font-size:90%"><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartyman_49e7.html" title="User talk:Martyman">(talk)</a></span> 12:26, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Corel painter is really inteded for producing bitmap based artworks (and is a great tool for that). Essentially painting without the messy problem of paint involved. Photoshop is again an bitmap based image editing tool that can be used for producing artwork but is aimed at proffesional photo editing/retouching. The latest versions of photoshop do include very minor vector support but it is not worth using. Illustrator, Inkscape or maybe adobe indesign are definately the tools you should be looking at for illustration/map purposes. The trouble with the list of formats you say painter can support is that I have seen objections at featured articles about graphics being gif instead of png, and png instead of svg for that matter. If you need to continue using painter you might be better off saving as a bmp (very big file but no artefacts) and doing a conversion to png through some other program. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartyman_a0b9.html" title="User:Martyman">Martyman</a>-<span style="font-size:90%"><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartyman_49e7.html" title="User talk:Martyman">(talk)</a></span> 12:49, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Again, I notice you mentioned you might get Illustrator at some point. I would definatly try out <a href="../../../i/n/k/Inkscape.html" title="Inkscape">Inkscape</a> (free software) as it may well do everything you want in a vector graphics program. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartyman_a0b9.html" title="User:Martyman">Martyman</a>-<span style="font-size:90%"><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartyman_49e7.html" title="User talk:Martyman">(talk)</a></span> 05:54, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Inkscape beign open source software is continously in development and yes the source is available for download so the download page is quite confusing.

<p>And if I might add my two cents on vector graphics (a bitlate, I know, but then we never met in the course of normal editing): CorelDraw can do almost everything Adobe Illustrator can, and it is much more affordable. Plus —in my experience, and Adobe fans would no doubt dispute that— its user interface is more intuitive. You might want to give it a try by downloading a trial at corel.com. Nice to meet you, by the way; my name is Mark and I'm a language addict who sometimes makes maps, too.

<dd>Thanks. I don't see it as critical to be changed on the right days over that period. I'll announce when I roll it over next week that I won't be doing the next few. The page has instructions on what should be one, and says anybody may do it after the time expires, so if someone gets sick of seeing the same collab, they'll get round to changing it. I only fell into the job because I was sick of seeing the same article displayed for far too many weeks at a time. ACOTW was apparently very active about 18 months ago, but had died down by the time I joined Wikipedia last January, and stalled several times before I took up regularly rolling it over. The previous attempt to revive it had included the change from weekly to fortnightly, which I think is good. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 23:28, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Great subway map of Tokyo! I drew the maps of several individual lines, but I like yours much better. If you're interested, please replace mine. BTW, I drew them with a white background to make printing easier. Something to keep in mind, although not a requirement. Certainly, color looks stronger against the black background.

<p>Hi Astrokey. I would like to know why, in your map of <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_World_e346.html" title="Third World">Third World</a> countries, you included some countries of Southeastern Europe. Firstly, these countries, particularly Romania and Bulgaria, are almost never considered "Third World". Secondly, I don't see the criteria you used to classify them in this way. Why, for example, is Romania, with a GDP per capita of $8,300, considered Third World on the map, while Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus, which are poorer and less developed, are not considered Third World. Why is Croatia not considered Third World while other countries in the region are? Classifying Southeastern Europe in the same colour as North Korea and Vietnam, which are low-income, relatively underdeveloped countries is, I believe, very deceptive. For that reason, I think that the countries in former-Communist, except for low-income countries (Ukraine, Moldova and perhaps Albania), should not be yellow, while the countries in central Asia - which are low-income - are almost always classified as Third World. North Korea and Vietnam should also be green - North Korea is currently very poor. I have also noticed that Israel is yellow. Israel is, again, almost never considered a developing country. I'm saying all of this because today, the term Third World is nearly the same as "developing country", even though it has more negative connotations. The Second World doesn't exist anymore, or if it does, it applies to the transition economies of Europe. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a> 03:25, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed you added a bunch of images to <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_Australia_5497.html" title="Music of Australia">Music of Australia</a>. The thing is, they are only licensed under fair use. Technically (or, depending on how copyright-naziish one feels, literally) they are only supposed to be used to illustrate the subject. So, picture of Foo band = ok on Foo article, not to illustrate Music of Fooland or genre or anything else.</p>
<p>This is why we could be so much better off with <i>truly free</i> images. So do have another look at the links I gave, see if you find some images you like.</p>

<p>Hi Astrokey. That is a good idea, I would like to put a map together for the bushfire article. I have thought about doing this before but was stumped by the lack of a good reference to work from.

<p>Hi. Please don't feel you have to stick with the version I uploaded. It would be incredibly rude of me to upload over your copy and expect you to keep it. Anyway, did you ever try out inkscape? I am pretty sure it is capable of nice text effects like illustrator is. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartyman_a0b9.html" title="User:Martyman">Martyman</a>-<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartyman_49e7.html" title="User talk:Martyman">(talk)</a></small> 12:59, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>All open source software is constantly under development. This does not always mean that it isn't stable and usable though. I can't vouch for the usability of inkscape myself, but looking at the artwork people have been producing with it, it seems pretty full featured. If you want to try it out download the installer from this page <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/inkscape/Inkscape-0.43-2.win32.exe?download" class="external autonumber" title="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/inkscape/Inkscape-0.43-2.win32.exe?download" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. You will probably have to select a mirror to download from. I normally choose optusnet as it is in Australia.</dd>
<dd>The feature used for producing the nice shadows behind things is usually called "drop shadows" though you can do the same thing manually by putting a black (or grey) version of the text directly behind the text you want to shaddow and then blurring it. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartyman_a0b9.html" title="User:Martyman">Martyman</a>-<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartyman_49e7.html" title="User talk:Martyman">(talk)</a></small> 13:12, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks for editing my article on <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tiny_Teddy_e957.html" title="Tiny Teddy">Tiny Teddys</a>. I submitted the original article as an experiment to see how quickly people would respond to a new and relatively obscure topic. I chose tiny teddys cause I was devouring them in front of my computer at the time! Chuckye 17:00, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
