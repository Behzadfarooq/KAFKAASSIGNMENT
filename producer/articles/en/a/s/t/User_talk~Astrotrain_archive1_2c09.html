Hi. Welcome to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>It's always worth checking if an article already exists before writing a new one. I can see you put some effort into researching and writing <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falkland_Isles_ce77.html" title="Falkland Isles">Falkland Isles</a>, but we already have articles at <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falkland_Islands_2644.html" title="Falkland Islands">Falkland Islands</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falklands_War_17db.html" title="Falklands War">Falklands War</a> which cover the subjects you were adressign in that page. I have made <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falkland_Isles_ce77.html" title="Falkland Isles">Falkland Isles</a> a <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirect_36c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirect">Wikipedia:Redirect</a> to <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falkland_Islands_2644.html" title="Falkland Islands">Falkland Islands</a>. Don't worry, your edits at <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falkland_Isles_ce77.html" title="Falkland Isles">Falkland Isles</a> are not lost, you czan see them in the history of the page at <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Falkland_Isles&amp;oldid=1203038" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Falkland_Isles&amp;oldid=1203038" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. so if you want to modify either <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falkland_Islands_2644.html" title="Falkland Islands">Falkland Islands</a> or <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falklands_War_17db.html" title="Falklands War">Falklands War</a> you can use this page as a source. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> 14:58 27 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi there, welcome to wikipedia.</p>
<p>Just one point may not yet be aware of, in creating titles royal styles (HRH, HSH etc) are not put in the link name. It is an easy mistake to make. The full rules on royal naming on wiki are at <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28names_and_titles%29_dca3.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (names and titles)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (names and titles)</a>. lol <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 19:12, 31 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Astrotrain! I see you've been doing articles on royalty. I have a good link to you: www.genealogia.sapo.pt<br />
It contains a very complete online Gotha with information about EVERYBODY. It's in portuguese, but princesa is not really that different from princess&#160;:) I think you'll find it usefull. One small problem: is offline at weekends and evenings - very stupid thing i think. And i supposed you can also find a glossary: glossário de termos. Cheers, <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMuriel_Gottrop_3ed2.html" title="User:Muriel Gottrop">Muriel Gottrop</a></p>

<p>Why is it better to have <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leo_Blair_610a.html" title="Leo Blair">Leo Blair</a> as a separate article from <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a>. Does he have encyclopedic merit outside being his father's son? <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pete</a> 16:09, 27 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>NB the material you originally wrote for the LB article was transferred to the personal life section of the TB article so nothing was lost - just a more cohesive article set gained. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pete</a> 16:11, 27 Nov 2003 (UTC)

<p>Hiyas. I reverted Posh Spice Takes it Up the Arse to again redirect to <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Beckham_45d1.html" title="Victoria Beckham">Victoria Beckham</a>. The information is all in her article, and I don't believe we need a seperate article on a single chant about her. See <a href="../../../p/a/g/Wikipedia%7EPage_size_bc13.html" title="Wikipedia:Page size">wikipedia:page size</a> for some of the reasoning.</p>
<p>Note that the redirect to Victoria Beckham is itself listed on <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_deletion_955c.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion">wikipedia:redirects for deletion</a>, with some people feeling that, even as a redirect, the title is too offensive. You may wish to comment there. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 23:37, 27 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Nicely done merge. However, I've moved the main article back to HMS Glamorgan (D19). One reason for that is the MediaWiki table at the bottom of the page. It already points to the destroyer with the pennant number, and it is possible that another HMS Glamorgan will come along at some point. If so, then we can always undo the redirect and make it into a disambig page. However, the article with the pennant number will always remain appropriate for the County class ship whatever happens in the future. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Newton_8a3b.html" title="User:David Newton">David Newton</a> 22:14, 14 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>You should have done the SSN <i>Spartan</i> on the specific page. There has been more than one HMS <i>Spartan</i> through the years. I say again to you, please create pages using pennant number or, failing that, year of launching for ships. If there has been only one ship of that name, please redirect HMS <i>Whatever</i> to the specific page. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Newton_8a3b.html" title="User:David Newton">David Newton</a> 22:43, 16 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Again, I apologise for my inappropriate actions. My actions were intended well, as I was merely attempting to accurately display information that had been given to me by a friend and not trying to wreck anything. My unfamiliarity with conventions and, more seriously, the legal implications of my additions I very much regret. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalexico_fce8.html" title="User:Calexico">Calexico</a> <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalexico_c1dc.html" title="User talk:Calexico">(Talk)</a> 10:36, 24 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I've reverted the changes you made to the Queen Victoria article. I understand why you made them but there was clear agreement on a standard format to be used in all royal pages. That was <i>not</i> to use the format you produced but the format that was on the page and is elsewhere throughout royalty. That is the standard structure agreed after exhaustive debate, involving starting articles on royalty with name, surname and birth-death dates. No other format should be used unilaterally. It took a lot of hard effort by a lot of people to find an agreed structure. The last thing we need is a return to the mess of 10 different structures for referring to royalty that existed before, with some people determined to call the Prince of Wales <i>Mr Charles Windsor</i>, etc. As an encyclopaedia we need to have an agreed structure for biographies and on royalty we have, so please follow it. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><i>Fear<b>ÉIREANN</b></i></a> 20:10, 13 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>(Responding to <a href="../../../f/o/r/User_talk%7EFord_4307.html#2004" title="User talk:Ford">User_talk:Ford#2004</a>): I am more offended (and my sense of neutrality is offended) by your repeated exclusions of changes of government, including very significant changes of government, in parts of the world that <i>you</i> do not consider important, but most reasonable people do. Your language, and the suggestions of what <i>are</i> important enough, or <i>would be</i> important enough, to warrant inclusion under your standards, are, as I said, parochial. You have a narrow conception of what matters. I have read your comments on the 2004 page, and you are quite dismissive of the rest of the world, while unaware of the relative insignificance of things of your interest. Certainly Britain remains an important country, but not to the level that you rate it. The royal doings are trivial compared to actual changes of government. Your favoring of such business over matters of genuine import is baffling to me, and is the main reason that I tagged the article. But you can also be sure that I will keep the article tagged as long as there is so much as <i>one</i> use of a royal honorific. <i>You</i> may think the queen is majestic, but that is a point of view not shared by most (in the world, that is, not your corner of the world). — <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFord_8534.html" title="User:Ford">Ford</a> 12:28, 2004 Oct 25 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your accusation of anglophobia against me on the 2004 page were bizzare. If there were accounts of minor political protests or the minute details of leader's movements in any other country listed on the page I would have removed them too. Will anyone care in 1 years time that someone put a flour bomb on Blair? No, and nor would anyone care that a protestor performed a civilian arrest on John Howard, or attempted to give Bush a handshake when he visited parliament, or dressed up as a sheep and hugged Howard which is why these (Australian) events aren't listed on the page. I'm positive similar events could be listed for most countries in the world, the fact that they aren't doesn't reflect anti-Americanism or Anti-sematism, the fact that these British events are there does reflect a British bias in the article, though. Saying I'm Anglophobic because I deleted a number of British events (and a lot of others if you had actually cared to look through my numerous edits) is bizzare, it's just that there happens to be a number of trivial British events listed on that page. <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychobabble_be56.html" title="User:Psychobabble">Psychobabble</a> 01:05, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. I am the person who recorded the storm system which recently caused damage to great part of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, and I wonder why you think it is too trivial to add. This system swept across the entire country and is responsible for at least 16 deaths, almost as many as in the Italian train crash you added at the same time. I will put this back into the 2005 article in an abbreviated way. Thank you.</p>

<p>An excellent reference for matters like this is <a href="http://mypage.uniserve.ca/~canyon/prince.html" class="external text" title="http://mypage.uniserve.ca/~canyon/prince.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a> on the "Titular Dignity of Prince in the British Royal Family Since 1714". As far as I can tell (it's very complicated, and I may have missed something), as a great-great-grandson (as you rightly say, and not a great-grandson as the article claims) of King George III, he was not entitled to any British Royal style. The letters patent mentioned in the article state that "the eldest son of and the children thereafter to be born to Prince Ernst August of Hanover, then reigning Duke of Brunswick, was granted the title Prince of Great Britain and Ireland with the style "Highness" by Royal Warrant on 17 June 1914". This, however, doesn't appear to apply to him, only to his children. (In fact, it only applies to his eldest three children, because it was changed in 1917 and the others were born after that.) Thus, it seems that Ernst August III had no British Royal style, and his son Ernst August IV (along with his brother Georg and sister Frederika) was a HH Prince. The assumption of HRH Prince of Great Britain and Ireland by the Hanovers is invalid, and thus shouldn't be used in our articles on them. (The article seems to imply that the lack of condemnation by HM is an implicit acknowledgment of the style, which seems rather contrived.) <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 12:05, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>There was no consensus to delete that page (some voted to keep, others to merge the info into <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optimus_Prime_ba88.html" title="Optimus Prime">Optimus Prime</a> proper before deleting it). Summarily deleting it, repeatedly, despite the obvious fact that others saw some value in it, and making no effort to merge the information as others fairly suggested, or even to update the article you're redirecting to, to reflect the fact that you've deleted the "person" article, adds up to rather poor manners. <a href="../../../t/v/e/User%7ETverbeek_8569.html" title="User:Tverbeek">Tverbeek</a> 19:41, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Are you reading a different Wikipedia than I am, on drugs, or just on some kind of self-important power trip? The VfD did <i>not</i> support a summary deletion of the article as you claimed in your edit comment. The vote was pretty evenly split between "delete", "merge", and "keep".

<p>"The consensus is tied" is nonsense talk; Either there's a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensus.html" title="Consensus">consensus</a> in which there's general agreement or willingness to go along, or there <i>is no</i> consensus, and there's a stalemate. That's what the VfD produced, which is why no action was taken. That is <i>not</i> an invitation for one provincial and self-centered individual to decide for the rest of Wikipedia what to do. Tell me: why do you have such a need to remove the article, when it's obvious that others want it to stay? Do you really want to get banned for editing in bad faith over this? I'm content to go along with whatever the majority wants... are <i>you</i> willing to, "Aristotrain"? <a href="../../../t/v/e/User%7ETverbeek_8569.html" title="User:Tverbeek">Tverbeek</a> 20:14, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you're going to make a redirect, you have a moral responsibility to do it properly: remove the disambig comment from the top of the target article, and honor the majority that also felt the material should be preserved. It's what I'd do in your shoes (and what I've done in similar situations). I'm adult enough to go along with consensus. Doing otherwise just because it suits <i>you</i>, and forcing others to clean up after your vandalism, is completely contrary to the spirit of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../t/v/e/User%7ETverbeek_8569.html" title="User:Tverbeek">Tverbeek</a> 22:10, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd say using "Prince Charles" or similar is definitely inappropriate, but I think I'd use "HRH The Prince of Wales" rather than "The Prince of Wales", mainly because I'd use "HRH The Duke of Kent" or similar to distinguish royalty from people like The Duke of Norfolk (especially with people like HRH The Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, who not many people will have heard of, and so won't know are royal), and I think this should be extended to people who are obivously royals (like The Princess Royal and The Prince of Wales) for consistency's sake. I feel that writing out the full style, while obviously appropriate for the person's own article, is a bit too cumbersome when merely making a reference to someone. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 23:53, 3 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Astrotrain,</p>
<p>I notice you have used a large number of my images for articles on Wikipedia, especially Royal Standards. The image of the UK Royal Arms is also by me. While I don't mind the images being used in Wikipedia, whose aims I wholeheartedly endorse, I would prefer it that my copyright in the images is acknowledged in some form. I regularly give permission for images from my site to be used on other websites and only ask that they include an acknowledgement such as "Flag image courtesy of The World Flag Database www.flags.net". Would it be possible to add this to the "image tags" of all the images of mine that you are using?</p>
<p>Incidentally Royal Arms and flags may not be protected by copyright, but drawings of them are, and the designs are protected under Article 6 of the Paris Convention on Intellectual Property.</p>
<p>It's not particularly surprising that my images turn up on Wikipedia, as I do most of the official drawings of UK flags, for both the MoD and FCO, as well as designing many new flags for state use.</p>
<p>If you want to email me you can do so at graham at flags.net.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you,</p>
<p>Graham Bartram</p>
<p>PS. Sorry if this is the wrong way of doing this but I couldn't see any email link to use instead.</p>

<p>Astro, please see my question at <a href="../../../c/a/n/Talk%7ECanada_fdbf.html" title="Talk:Canada">Talk:Canada</a>. I think you will see that the Canada article would bery quickly become overwhelmed by templates if they were added for all of the major international organizations to which Canada belongs. I look forward to your response, or I will join SimonP in reverting your changes. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevintoronto_ec05.html" title="User:Kevintoronto">Kevintoronto</a> 21:37, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't recall ever suggesting that the template be placed in <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_Relations_of_Australia_3042.html" title="Foreign Relations of Australia">Foreign Relations of Australia</a>, so I cannot understand why you be making such irrelevant statements. And on that point, I do not require an explanation on what foreign relations pertains to. Whilst discussing the matter of the "Commonwealth Realms" template, though I was not the first to remove it, I do not believe it is a necessary template for the article - especially given a "Commonwealth of Nations" template is present.</p>
<p>On reverting your edits, designating them as vandalism was perfectly valid. If you had reviewed your edits, you would have noticed the nonsensical duplication of the article. Your resentment, however, indicates that it was a mistake and not vandalism.

<p>Astrotrain: I see on SimonP's talk page that you are accusing him of being to be only one reverting these templates. If you check the history of the Canada page, you will see that I (when I was <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevintoronto_ec05.html" title="User:Kevintoronto">User:Kevintoronto</a> have also done so. This should not surprise you because I spent a great deal of time trying to explain to you why the templates were not appropriate. And you responded to me, although not very satisfactorily. Why are you now trying to portray SimonP as a lone wolf on this issue when you know that it is not true? Also, people on the Australia page have objected to the templates as well.</p>
<p>More importantly, you have not responded to my last post on <a href="../../../c/a/n/Talk%7ECanada_fdbf.html" title="Talk:Canada">Talk:Canada</a>. Instead, you went ahead to try to impose your changes on the Canada page without regard to the objections of regular editors of that page (SimonP and me). I prefer to discuss than to revert, but until you convince the active editors of the page to accept your changes, you must expect that they will be reverted. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 13:10, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ireland, South Africa, India and Canada are no more or less important than many other countries.

<p>When using your edits to this article, there is clearly a large gap between the template and the text of the article. Placing the required syntax to align the template under the 'Princess of Wales' header eliminates this gap, which is what I have done. I have reverted the changes again and surely you can see that when the syntax is placed at the start of the article it is more (and I use your description of:) "awful" than the original position of the syntax. Should you wish to change it again, please discuss it further on the article's talk page as I'm sure neither one of us would enjoy being blocked for the "revert-rule". <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraigy144_38a9.html" title="User:Craigy144">Craigy</a> 18:53, Apr 24, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please stop adding the extra templates to the country articles. Many of them had four or even five footers. If links to all these countries were actually useful it would take far less room to simply have a link to every single country on one template.</p>

<dd>I am reverting you as so far you have refused to engage in any discussion about why we should make an exception to our policies and allow your templates. I fairly routinely get into these debates about templates. Most users are reasonable and for the most part after a discussion in which I have pointed to relevant policies the other user agrees that their new template probably isn't such a great idea. You have yet to attempt any sort of discussion. Other than personal attacks and assertions that you are right you have yet to give a single reason why these templates are useful. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 18:18, May 3, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I, SimonP, am cordially inviting you to participate in a discussion about the usefulness of the Commonwealth of Nations templates. Now that I have invited you would it be possible to have a discussion rather than another round of reversions? I was reverted by others, and I then discussed with them and eventually, and with compromise, they stopped reverting. Hopefully the same can happen here. What is required for this process is to actually discuss the issue. If I knew why you believe these templates are useful perhaps I could understand what compromise might satisfy us both. If your arguments are really convincing I could even change my position and agree that the template should stay, this has happened before. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 22:29, May 10, 2005 (UTC)

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Sophie Wessex.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too.

The images were <i>not</i> included for informational purposes (as indeed, templates are not needed or expected to be) but simply for a touch of "snaz" that did not require that they be particularly distinguishable, much less, legible.</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>
