<h2><span class="mw-headline">What astrologers "don't know" about the span of each constellation</span></h2>
<p>The "boundaries" of each constellation were decided in 1930, so seeing as to how astrology is thousands of years older than that, the argument that "they don't know" these totally modern, artificially drawn boundaries is completely bogus. I'd edit it out but I'm afraid my dial-up connection would cut off at least half of this humonguous article.<a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoovinator_deb5.html" title="User:Doovinator">Doovinator</a> 00:46, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why would you edit it out? I assume you're talking about the part in <b>The case against astrology</b>. Since people actually use that as an argument against the usefulness of astrology, it's our job to document that as part of <b>The case against</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, you complain that the modern boundaries are "artificially drawn". Firstly, the ancient boundaries were artificially drawn too. Secondly, we call the same set of stars "Virgo" that we did back then. If the sun is actually inside that group of stars for 44° of arc, how is that bogus? I can't vouch for the actual arc lengths, but the argument sounds logical to me. <a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFoobaz_6eee.html" title="User:Foobaz"><font color="green">Foobaz</font></a>·<a href="../../../f/o/o/User_talk%7EFoobaz_50d5.html" title="User talk:Foobaz"><font color="brown">✐</font></a> 01:49, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>

<dd>In the original scheme the "boundaries" came first, like longitude lines. The constellations were the stars which happened to be in "x" area of the sky, not the other way around. It's as if we'd been defining "America" as "a land mass between 30 and 165 west longitude", and a geographical commission came along and declared the actual boundaries to be thus-and-so and therefore everyone who came before is "wrong". The definition has changed, not actual boundaries. All astrologers are fully aware of the "boundaries" of the constellations as defined in 1930, but this has nothing whatever to do with astrological "signs". If the sun is in the area of the sky where it habitually resides in the last month of summer, then it's in the astrological sign "Virgo". After it has passed through that area, the days start getting shorter and it's in the astrological sign "Libra". The stars are convenient markers for these areas of the sky, but nothing more. Astronomy is a completely different science, and has a different jargon.<a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoovinator_deb5.html" title="User:Doovinator">Doovinator</a> 22:17, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Doovinator is right. Astrology divides the zodiac in twelve equal parts, and this matches roughly with the existing constellations (not through coincidence). The one legitimate point of dissenssion within the astrological community is whether to stick to a calendar zodiac or to follow the precession of the equinoxes (which leads to nearly a full sign's worth of difference nowadays). The term "sign" is also used to mean 30° (360° divided in 12).</dd>

<p>This discussion is very confused. Nobody seem to "get it." Here are a few simple facts: The zodiac used by Western astrologers has been unchanged since at least ancent Greece, when it was agreed among Western astrologers that the ecliptic (which has nothing to do with stars millions of light-years away) is the basis of the twelve zodiacal divisions. Not the constellations! Critics of astrology persist in insisting that the "constellations" should be the basis of the zodiac, but they are not. Astrology uses a local system, namely, a system based entirely on our own solar system. The zodiac used in astrology is the relation between the earth and the sun. It is twelve evenly divided sections of the ecliptic beginning at the Vernal Equinox (beginning of the sign, not the constellation, Aries) when spring begins and the days and nights are pretty evenly divided (hence the name Equinox) and extending to the Summer Solstice (beginning of the sign, not the constellation, Cancer) when the days are longest and nights shortest in the Northern Hemisphere and then to the Autumnal Equinox (beginning of the sign, not the constellation Libra) when again there is an equality and then on to the Winter Solstice (beginning of the sign, not the constellation, Capricorn). All this is very clear. It is only the names of these divisions which are confusing because there happen to be constellations of stars with the same names, now out of synch with the signs although they were in synch with them millennia ago, presumably when they were first named. But when it is realized that the twelve ecliptical divisions are really twleve even divisions of the orbit of the earth around the sun, based upon the entirely measurable seasons of the year, we see that astrology is local, centered in our solar system. The twelve signs used by Western astrologers are twelve "fields" within the earth's orbit. Why they work, no one knows (nor does anyone know the ultimate "why" about much of anything in science), but it is dishonest to imply that they must rely upon remote constellations to have any efficacy. I myself decided upon them, rather than the so-called "sidereal" zodiac based on the constellations, after long and careful observation, comparing the positions of planets and the sun in the two systems.</p>
<p><br />
Reply: Western astrology is based upon the geometric relationships (aspects) of the planets (at any given time). The geometric relationships remain constant (for any particular astrology chart) regardless of one's employing the tropical or sidereal methods. See, External Link <a href="http://www.templeofsolomon.org/astro.htg/astro.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.templeofsolomon.org/astro.htg/astro.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.templeofsolomon.org/astro.htg/astro.htm</a> for a complete primer (and errors) on Western Astrology. One of the the main benefits of the study of (archetypal) astrology is the information regarding the Pantheon of Celestial Gods (Mars, Jupiter, Venus, etc.) and recognizing that these archetypal energies operate, to some degree, to erode all of the western images of pathos (crucified Christ, treks through the desert, etc.) and to refresh our minds with positive (pain free) imagery. Astrology has been discredited for two primary reasons. One reason is apparent, being the invention of the telescope which revealed (Galileo) that the Earth is not the center of the solar system (astrological charts place the Earth in the center). The second reason, deeply veiled and hidden, is that Christianity has attempted to discredit and debunk astrology with Gregorian calendar changes and seeming intentional calendar errors - throwing off the zodiac - which seem designed to hide the strong association between Christianity and astrology. (e.g. The Son (Sun) that dies (sunset) and is resurrected (sunrise), the Son (Sun) and the 12 apostles (signs of the zodiac), the son (sun) "born of a virgin" i.e., The sun's precession Precession of The Equinox out of Virgo into Leo, the sign of the king. One can gradually, by the study of astronomy and western astrology, begin to discern that The New Testament is (quite possibly) an astrological/astronomical allegory (a <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midrash.html" title="Midrash">midrash</a>) which formed the basis of Christianity. The length of the constellations is (eventually) inconsequential to a dedicated student of astrology because, over time, the advanced adept can adjust his or her own astrological chart interpretations and alignments to compensate for what he or she observes and experiences regarding their chart (rectification). Sure, it is unraveling a great puzzle which includes many red herrings but the dedicated student will gradually arrive at deeper spiritual/metaphysical truths regarding personal identity and the deeper purpose of life, including spiritual <a href="../../../e/n/l/Enlightenment_%28concept%29.html" title="Enlightenment (concept)">enlightenment</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Charles_Webb_5c27.html" title="User:John Charles Webb">John Charles Webb</a> posted July 19th 2005</p>
<p>Andrew Homer: The aspects between the planets is ONE of the tools used by Astrologers. Vedic Astrology uses the arbitrary CONSTELLATIONS. Western Astrologers designate the 12 equal SIGNS of the Zodiac by using the first second of Spring as the reference point for zero degree Aries - with 30 degrees assigned to each of the 12 Zodiac Signs. Constellations and their boundaries are arbitrary. Zodiac Signs have a fix reference point. If one has bothered to study Astronomy, one would know that it's the Astronomers who, around 1980, capitulated and also started to use the first second of Spring as their reference point for the Zodiac, too. The more proper title for this section should be "What psuedo-Astronomers Don't Know About Astrology."</p>

<p>I noticed this page is getting big; it will surely expand — it needs to be reworked from top to bottom, a lot of things haven't been said, don't know if I have the energy for it, but together I'm sure we will — so I've moved the list (which should also be expanded) to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_astrologers.html" title="List of astrologers">List of astrologers</a>. I'm not very fond of lists, since Categories are a much more organized way of presenting the same skeleton, but they have the advantage of serving as a checklist for articles that need to be written, whereas Categories only include articles that have <i>already</i> been written. Ideally, though, the better list will be <a href="../../../a/s/t/Category%7EAstrologers_65b5.html" title="Category:Astrologers">Category:Astrologers</a>. At any rate, this sets "Astrology" on the same footing as "Physics" or "Medicine", which don't list every doctor or physicist on the article page; it does astrology no service to look like we're saying "See, look how many people were astrologers." — <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 12:36, 23 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>"In his later life, Pierre d'Ailly was much concerned with defending astrology/astronomy from charges that it was inconsistent with Christianity. As a basis, he took the attitude endorsed long before by Isidore of Seville (c. 560-636) that one can distinguish between <i>natural astrology</i><b>*</b> and <i>superstitious astrology</i>, and that it is the former which is consistent with Christianity, while the latter is not."</p>
<p><b>*</b> Natural astrology being medical astrology and mundane astrology which was used and written about widely during his time, not the use of astrology for personal/predictive reasons, which many of the relgious believed would be somehow tampering with God's will.</p>

<dd>Your main thesis is flawed: "any educated person" — thank you — and see <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Isidore/home.html" class="external text" title="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Isidore/home.html" rel="nofollow">my transcription of Isidore</a> — <i>knows no such thing</i>. The line was vague and lots of people crossed over it in one direction or the other; but in general, "natural astrology" refers to what we call astronomy, "superstitious astrology" to predictive astrology. I'll concede to you the very grey area of what we now call meteorology and where it impinges on physiology: the ancients, almost uniformly, did view the weather as having something to do with the farther heavens, and there was general agreement that weather affected physiology (see for example <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/1.html#4" class="external text" title="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/1.html#4" rel="nofollow">Vitruvius on the siting of towns</a> — where clicking on the section numbers sends you to the Latin if you need it).</dd>

<dd>And before we go any further, in case you were tempted, it is pointless dismissing me as personally against astrology in any way. I've spent a good deal of time studying it, learned how to cast a chart 30&#160;years ago, for a while even making some money casting charts, have a fair library of astrological material, and view astrology as valuable both in itself as a psychological descriptor and as part of the arsenal of "any educated person" in the fields of literary criticism or Antiquity. I've done statistical studies on some facets of astrology (one of them coming up in favor of a correlation between being an organist and having Mars conjunct Uranus: at 3σ level of significance!) I am still — as you can see — fascinated by the subject; see for example <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#noteA" class="external text" title="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#noteA" rel="nofollow">my chart of Nero</a>.</dd>

<dd>Now that we've got that out of the way.... Of your 6&#160;refs, two are quite irrelevant: #4 is the Catholic Encyclopedia on Isidore, breathing not a word about astrology (which I'm perfectly willing to admit means nothing, given the recent opposition of the church to astrology: 19th-century and very straight-laced; but still, there is nothing about astrology there, for whatever reason). #6 is merely the astrology section of Tim Spaulding's site, which he named "Isidore-of-Seville" in honor of the great man because he was a polymath or an encyclopedist. Nowhere there is Isidore brought up in connection with astrology.</dd>

<dd>#1, #2, and #5 are very tertiary sources, all probably paraphrasing the same secondary source, notice the very similar turns of phrase; none of them states unambiguously that Isidore was an astrologer. #1 views Isidore — again, for what that's worth, these are people like you and me writing modern opinions — as against astrology, not for it. #2 mentions Isidore incidentally except for repeating that he was in favor of medical astrology. #5 is the most incidental repeat of the same thing.</dd>

<dd>What is needed is some kind of proof that Isidore wrote about astrology per se, or practiced it.

<dd>Right. The issue is whether or not he was an "astrologer", did he <i>do</i> astrology-predictions or alchemy and all the rest of it. Educated people do <b>not</b> know that astronomy and astrology were one in the same. Humanity has been looking up at and studying the stars from the very beginning: astronomy is our oldest science.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Neo-Platonic astrology as a study case</span></h3>
<p>'<i><b>M'</b></i>oved the following from the article as it is too much of an essay style for an encyclopedia. Someone needs to re work this into a history of the idea. <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumos3_fc96.html" title="User:Lumos3">Lumos3</a> 23:56, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Neo-Platonic astrology as a study case</b> the case of Platonic and Neo-Platonic astrology should be of particular interest. Here one can easily observe both the strong motivations towards the establishment of an astrological science, and the collapse of the bulk of these motivations in the post-Galilean world.</p>
<p>We shall begin by following a line of thought that was very strong in many parts of the classical world. So strong, it was the reason for the deportation of Anaxagoras from Athens (he was advocating that the stars were nothing but “hot stones in the sky”), and the Epicureans made the fight against this view the main point of their moral philosophy.</p>
<p>So, imagine you live in a society with a technology that is less than modern: no cars, planes, etc. The only things you would observe that have the capacity to move on their own are living things. Hence only living things have what Aristotle calls (potential) "innate movement". But all living things decease (given enough time). All? Well, look at the sky - there you will find heavenly bodies moving perpetually in well-ordered paths. If living things are the only candidates for self-induced movement, then the heavenly bodies must be alive. They are also perpetual, hence immortal. They also seem to be moving in a nice circular fashion; hence they must be highly intelligent sentient beings (circles being the most perfect of geometric forms). What would you call a super-intelligent, immortal sentient being?</p>
<p>A god.</p>
<p>So the heavenly bodies are gods. That's well enough. But there are two other things you should notice about these gods:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1 They seem to be unbound by earthly physics: they float high above, unaffected by gravity, and they also move in circular motion - a type of motion that is not very common down here on earth. So the rules that work in the heavens are not the same as the terrestrial laws of physics.</dd>
<dd>2 We already know that the heavens directly affect our lives. Think about the weather: rain, snow, light, heat, cold, clouds... the different seasons... all these things govern our lives (esp. if we live in an agricultural society).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Let us sum things up. We have seen that:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Heavenly things govern life here on earth.</li>
<li>Heavenly things do not abide by earthly laws.</li>
<li>Heavenly things are gods.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>It should be strongly emphasized that this view holds strongly as well in monotheistic cultures, and is in fact firmly embedded into classical Christianity, Judaism and Islam. Although they are no longer deemed to be actual gods, the heavenly bodies are still highly regarded in classical monotheistic religious philosophies, and are often looked upon as <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angels.html" title="Angels">angels</a> or some other instrument of the one god.</p>
<p>It is very easy to see how Astrology and Alchemy stem from this view. It would be only rational to try and consult the heavenly bodies - concerning almost everything – from the conception of babies to the signing of political and commercial treaties – hence Astrology. It would also be very tempting to utilize the forces governing the heavens down here. If you could “make” Mars work for you, you would be free from the confines of terrestrial physics – hence Alchemy.</p>
<p>It is also very easy to see why the Galilean views were so intimidating in the eyes of many renaissance scientists and policy-makers: Galileo’s observations were deadly to the dichotomy between earth and the heavens. He was showing that the stars were merely natural phenomena, rather then super-natural super-intelligent perpetually unchanging beings.</p>
<p>So, in the classical world, the case for astrology was almost trivial. The connections between heaven and earth are everywhere you look, and the heavens are clearly something supernatural. In the post Galilean world, however, advocates for Astrology face an excruciating task. The easy-to-observe influences of heaven are dealt with within the framework of sciences e.g. Meteorology and Solar Astronomy. Further influences are no longer deemed trivial, and are usually very hard to show.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The case against Astrology - Distance + life prediction</span></h2>
<p>I'm tempted to just delete the recent edits to the case against astrology, as both points are based on a misunderstanding of astrological practice, and I'm not sure that scientists make these criticisms. Before you accuse me of bias, I am not an astrologer, and I do not believe in astrological practice. That having been said, let me address the two points. The first point - distance is not taken into account - is invalid. While the typical chart has no indication of distance built in, the different aspects are given degrees of importance. For instance, many astrologers believe that the Sun is the most major aspect, and the moon is the second most major aspect. The second point - about a life predictive system - is also misguided. No astrologer makes the claim that the predictions of astrology are immutable. In fact, astrologers say that astrology describes influences, which if properly understood can help the person being analyzed change the future! These criticisms are strawmen, and I think it does the argument against astrology a disservice to keep them. I will be deleting them in a few days unless someone can convince me otherwise. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECardshark_8d08.html" title="User:Cardshark">Cardshark</a></p>

<dd>Hello. Some comments. Yes some specialists in paranormal stuff do this kind of comments. (See French book <i><a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Zetetic_Challenge_572f.html" title="International Zetetic Challenge">Henri Broch</a> - Au coeur du paranormal</i>). About distances. Indeed astrology mentiones <i>some</i> aspects related to distances. But, and that is the point, in such a case it means distances matters for astrologer and this criteria must be mentioned for all objects officially considered in astrology (it is not the case) but also... plainly all objects in universe. Mentionning one or two (or 10000) distances is not enough. To be precise all the <i>signes</i> would have to be charted in terms of distances for each of the stars making them up. In other word this point is a consistency one. About life predictive system: <i>No astrologer makes the claim that the predictions of astrology are immutable.</i> The very point. Either your are predicting something whatsoever and it has to be observable as predicted, or your are just speculating and you can be ignored. Actually the problem is mixed up in your comment: the concept of prediction is <i>misunderstood</i> in astrology (and many other domains). Astrologer hides behind a smoke screen the fact that their predictions (whatsoever: facts or <i>influence</i> which is wordable as probability) are not observable, therefore even less "verifiable" and utlimately are not prediction at all. I think those two points are rather informative because they are true, verifiable, and unlike for example <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precession_of_the_equinoxes.html" title="Precession of the equinoxes">precession of the equinoxes</a>, any one can understand them. So no: certainly not delete! Rewrite if you please for sure. <a href="../../../g/t/a/User%7EGtabary_85f8.html" title="User:Gtabary">Gtabary</a> 11:33, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You said - " The very point. Either your are predicting something whatsoever and it has to be observable as predicted, or your are just speculating and you can be ignored. " I'm sorry, but with all due respect, this is a ridiculous argument. For example, a geneticist may be able to tell you that you have a 10% chance of dying of a heart attack based on your genetic makeup, but that by changing your eating habits, you can lower your risk of that heart attack. Is the prediction useless because it is not immutable? Obviously not. The prediction is very helpful because by altering your lifestyle, you can affect your life in a positive way. Furthermore, the argument is a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> defense because it argues against a position that astrologers do not advocate. It doesn't help the argument against astrology at all, rather it weakens it. Unless you can demonstrate that astrologers hold this view, and that some sort of qualified person such as a scientist argues against astrology based on this view, it has no place in the article. I'll give it a couple more days for further discussion, and then I will remove it from the article. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECardshark_8d08.html" title="User:Cardshark">Cardshark</a></dd>

<dd>I am going to prove you incorrect, will you feel <i>ridiculous</i>&#160;? (Ok just teasing there&#160;:-) . Probably better not to use <i>ridiculous</i>.) A <i>geneticist may be able to tell you that you have a 10% chance of dying of a heart attack</i> and, that's the catch, those 10% are repetedly observable at the scale of a population, over a 50 years period, statisticaly . Summary: a probabilistic prediction is done AND the prediction is observable. That's where para-science life-prediction predictions fails: Even with long time and an important sample to analyse, none of the predictions are observable. Astrologer do pretend to have a kind of prediction system be it absolute or probabilistic. If it's neither absolute nor porbabilistic, that's not prediction but speculation. That is technically the answer to your question. Note the orginal point of the paragraph is still unchanged and valid: knowing the future is meaningless if you can't change it; knowing the future is meaningless if you can change it because then you don't know the future; not knowing the future is... not knowing the future. I don't understand the use of <i>straw man</i>: Please explain me what else astrology pretend to do but to kind of predict (even only probabilisticaly) the future&#160;? I'll suggest an other wording of the paragraph in some time. <a href="../../../g/t/a/User%7EGtabary_85f8.html" title="User:Gtabary">Gtabary</a> 11:42, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, saying "If they believe this, they're wrong because.... and if they believe that, they're wrong because..." is the classic example of the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> argument. Click the link, and read the section labeled "rhetorical use", it gives a thorough definition. Furthermore, I stand by the analogy that I made to genetics. Your paragraph said that either there was no point of knowing the future because it was immutable, or the prediction was just speculation and therefore useless. If an astrologer said you have a tendency to be obese, and you should watch your diet, that is not a useless prediction. If your argument is that astrology is not a science, and therefore it's predictions are wrong (and therefore useless), that topic is very well covered elsewhere in the article, and your paragraph was redundant (and less well-reasoned than others on the page). Furthermore, since astrologers do not claim to make immutable predictions, at least half your argument was a straw man. <small>(sign please)</small></dd>

<p>(Reset indent). Hi again. I read the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> article. Interesting. Though unlike what you think orginial paragraph do not qualify as a straw man argument. Here is why.</p>
<p>What orginal paragraph does is quite different: It takes what astrology is reported to be - <i>Many of those who practice astrology believe that the positions of certain celestial bodies either influence, or correlate with but do not influence, people's personality traits, important events in their lives, and even physical characteristics.</i> which the single point for strology to be - and refutes it. Name it future prediction, probablities, influences it boils down to the same: predict somehow, something. There is no presenting whith (cf straw man) <i>distortion</i>, <i>portion</i>, <i>fiction</i>. Therefore there is no straw man stuff. End of story.</p>
<p>Now about the <i>if a then wrong, or b then wrong and a = non b; then all wrong</i> invalidity and "classicality". Sory but if <i>a</i> <u>is</u> wrong as well as <i>b</i> <u>is</u>, well, all is wrong. And in our case indeed both are wrong.</p>
<p>The analogy with genetics do not stand because... The geneticist do not have to observe his 10%, because the 10% are the result of observations. In other word the geneticist do not have to prove existance of facts for the facts are the base of the affirmations. Astrology still have to exibit even only some facts to back up affirmations, or to be observable after affirmations. Shorthand: no need to prove what's already proven, plenty of need for what's never been.</p>
<p>It is very possible that other paragraphs cover better than my contrib, some aspect of this. Though I did not read this interesting paradox elsewhere, which stimulate thinking on a fairly correct ground.</p>
<p>I was thanking about a milder wording like: <i>A paradox seams to arise in life predictive system: if one's able to know the future, it's thanks a degree of immutability. Depending on this degree one can wonder what is the point in knowing such future if it's not changable. In the extreme, a completly knowable future would leave us with no interest in knowing it at all.</i></p>

<p>Okay, just had an edit reverted. I think we should combine these two sections or subsections, and do the same for "Astrologers View..." and "Case For..." sections as well.</p>
<p>This should make it easier for scientists here to make a short and convincing argument against astology without having to get into an edit war with people who disagree.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removed strange accusation of astronomers</span></h2>
<p>I removed the suggestion that the constellations were redrawn to discredit astrologers. The 1930 convention had two main purposes: 1. Establishing one set of commonly agreed upon constellations. 2. Eliminating 'blank spaces' between constellations. This was done to facilitate astronomy, enabling astronomers to easily indicate a given sector of the sky. If there is any credible sources claiming otherwise, please link to them.</p>
<p>If the astronomers of 1930 wanted to discredit astrology that badly, they may have selected the far simpler course of merely pointing out that the signs of astrology bear little resemblance to the actual positions of heavenly bodies. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpazzm_3ce2.html" title="User:Spazzm">Spazzm</a> 00:47, 2005 Feb 24 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm going to remove the notion that the ecliptic didn't cross Ophiuchus before 1930, since it is clearly contradicted by this: <a href="../../../o/p/h/Ophiuchus.html" title="Ophiuchus">Ophiuchus</a></p>
<p>The story seems to be that before 1930, the area that now only belongs to Ophiuchus belonged to two or more constellations. In order to formalize it, astronomers had to choose one. If they choose one of the astrological signs, they would avoid angering astrologers. If they choose Ophiuchus, one of the most important documents in astronomy, Kepler's "De stella nova in pede Serpentarii" (On the New Star in Ophiuchus's Foot) would still be meaningful to future astronomers. They would also honor Kepler and <a href="../../../p/t/o/Ptolemy.html" title="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> who first described the constellation over 1700 years earlier. It comes as no surprise that they acted as they did. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpazzm_3ce2.html" title="User:Spazzm">Spazzm</a> 01:18, 2005 Feb 24 (UTC)</p>
<p>I removed some of the more blatant misrepresentations as well: Ophiuchus was intersected by the ecliptic before 1930. It is not a 'very small part' of Ophiuchus that lies across the ecliptic - the Sun is in Ophiuchus from 2005-11-30 to 2005-12-18, ca. 19 days. As a comparision it is in Cancer from 2005-07-21 to 2005-08-11, ca. 22 days. (According to <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celestia.html" title="Celestia">Celestia</a>). The constellations were not clear and agreed upon before 1930 - the area in question, that now belongs to the foot of Ophiuchus, belonged to more than one constellation. Ophiuchus was not extended, it was Scorpius that was diminished. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpazzm_3ce2.html" title="User:Spazzm">Spazzm</a> 01:45, 2005 Feb 24 (UTC)</p>

<p>Many Jewish authorities had views on astrology, especially <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maimonides.html" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a>, but there is no systematic discussion on this issue. I thus am working on a new article, <i>Jewish views on Astrology</i>. My current sources include the Talmud (I own the Soncino version); the Jewish Encyclopedia, The Encyclopedia Judaica, the collected works of Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, as well as other sources. I have now written text that includes the basis of Jewish views of astrology, based on mitzvot in the Torah, and it discusses the various ways in which these mitzvot have been interpreted. I then summarize the views of Nahmanides, Maimonides and Gersonides, and offer brief views from Reform and Conservative Jews, and from two Orthodox rabbis who have written on this issue, Rabbis Barry Freundel and Nachum Amsel. I will create the new article later tonight, and I hope we can bring in more sourced material and discussions. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></p>
<p>We should begin a stub on Christian views of astrology, and Muslim views of Astrology.

<p>Andrew Homer (StarHeart): A legitimate "Christian view of Astrology" would divulge that "Christianity" sourced from the Persian Mithraic religion brought back to the Mediterranean world by Roman businessmen and legionnaires. From hindsight, the Mithraic religion was half Christianity and half Astrology. December 25th was the Celebration of Mithras since at least 70 BC. The Roman emperor renamed Mithras "Sol Invictus".</p>

<p>I see that over time many proponents of astrology have added their views here, but I am truly puzzled by the section on the <b>Case for astrology</b>. It contains absolutely zero data for astrology, in any shape or form. The fact that tides affect many living organisms has nothing to do with astrology, stars, or anything supernatural. If there are actually people who use this as evidence for astrology, then they are using the word "astrology" in a way that has <i>nothing</i> to do with the contents of this article.

<dd>The section needs a better topic sentence to the effect that the gravitational influence of celestial bodies on the Earth may affect our perception of tides and theoretically our character. This is quite tenuous obviously. The only bodies that produce a tidal effect on the Earth are the Moon and Sun and of course astrology isn't limited to these two. Even if we accept tidal influence from other bodies you still have to make the leap and accept that this correlates to personality and life probabilities. I have read that statistically significant differences in life outcomes occur in people born at different times of year (likelihood of being in accident, obesity etc.) but this is much better explained by seasonal variation than astrology. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 14:15, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Andrew Homer (StarHeart): As the saying goes, "the taste is in the pudding." Experiential evidence and emperial experiences are completely valid concepts and considerations. Year after year, one of America's top stock market analysts uses astrology. A lot of research has been used by Michel &amp; Francoise Guaquelin regardings folk EXCEPTIONAL in their career field.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Categorization</span></h2>
<p>There seems to be a serious disagreement (a.k.a. edit war) over categorisation of this article. The categorisations proposed range between two extremes:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Astrology</i></li>
<li><i>Astrology; Abstraction; Astrologers; Astrological factors; Belief; Divination; Mysticism; New Age; Occult; Occultists; Philosophy; Prediction; Prophecy; Protoscience; Pseudoscience; Religion; Religious behaviour and experience; Solar system; Spirituality</i></li>
</ul>
<p>The relevant parts of the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_style_f2a6.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of style">Wikipedia:Manual of style</a> appear under <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">Wikipedia:Categorization</a>, from which I'll quote here. First off, one should decide whether or not an article belong under a given category:</p>
<dl>
<dd>* Is it possible to write a few paragraphs or more on the subject of a category, explaining it?</dd>
<dd>* If you go to the article from the category, will it be obvious why it's there? Is the category subject prominently discussed in the article?</dd>
<dd>If the answer to either of these questions is no, then a category is probably inappropriate.</dd>
<dd>Unless it is self-evident and uncontroversial that something belongs in a category, it should not be put into a category.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Second, the issue of multiple categorisation (emphasis mine):</p>
<dl>
<dd>An article will often be in several categories. Restraint should be used, however —<b>categories become less effective the more there are on a given article</b>.</dd>
<dd><b>An article should not be in both a category and its subcategory</b>, for example Microsoft Office is in Category:Microsoft software, so should not also be in Category:Software. <b>An article with the same name as a category should usually belong <i>only</i> to that category</b>, for instance, Deism belongs only in Category:Deism.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Applying the multiple sub-classing rule (an article should not be in both a category and its subcategory), we note that:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Category:Astrology</i> is itself categorized under <i>Divination, Solar system, New Age, Protoscience,</i> and <i>Pseudoscience</i></li>
<li><i>Category:Astrology</i> is also categorized under <i>Occult</i> and <i>Prediction</i> by way of <i>Divination</i></li>
<li><i>Category:Mysticism</i> is itself categorized under <i>Religious behaviour and experience,</i> and <i>Spirituality</i></li>
<li><i>Category:Philosophy</i> is itself categorized under <i>Abstraction, Belief, Culture,</i> and <i>Science</i></li>
<li><i>Category:Prophecy</i> is itself categorized under <i>Prediction,</i> and <i>Religious behaviour and experience</i></li>
<li><i>Category:Religion</i> is itself categorized under <i>Culture, Belief,</i> and <i>Human societies</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Applying this to the long list of categories, it shrinks thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Astrology; <s>Abstraction;</s> Astrologers; Astrological factors; <s>Belief; Divination;</s> Mysticism; <s>New Age; Occult;</s> Occultists; Philosophy; <s>Prediction; Prophecy; Protoscience; Pseudoscience;</s> Religion; <s>Religious behaviour and experience; Solar system; Spirituality</s></li>
</ul>
<p>Note also that <i>Astrological factors</i> is itself categorised under <i>Astrology</i>, so one could drop <i>Astrology</i> in its favour. However, since «&#160;an article with the same name as a category should usually belong only to that category&#160;», that seems silly (to me, anyway). Second, the category <i>Astrologers</i> seems destined to collect articles on people who practiced astrology (like the <i>Astronomers</i> category groups articles on people who practice astronomy), so it seems irrelevant to categorise Astrology under it. A link to the Astrology article could easily be added in the Astrologers category page's comment line (something like «&#160;This category concerns practitioners of [[Astrology]]&#160;»). The same argument applies to the <i>Occultists</i> category, which <i>Astrologers</i> are categorised under in any case. Hence:</p>

<p>This leaves the question as to whether Astrology (the article) belongs under <i>Mysticism, Philosophy,</i> and <i>Religion</i>. I do not think anyone really believes Astrology to be a religion --there is no worship involved. Is it a form of mysticism? I'm not so sure, since the only "mystery" involved is the purported mechanism of action. The movement of celestial bodies and their assignations in the zodiac houses (and so on) is not mysterious, but rather mechanical. Finally, I also find the <i>Philosophy</i> connection rather weak. Philosophy is «&#160;the critical study of the most fundamental questions that humankind has been able to ask&#160;». Which of those questions (listed under <a href="../../../p/h/i/Category%7EPhilosophy_87d4.html" title="Category:Philosophy">Category:Philosophy</a>) does Astrology critically study? I could not identify a single one.</p>
<p>It seems clear, in light of the foregoing, that the Astrology article belongs in the Astrology category and only in that category, as per the Manual of style. Disagreements should be voiced here.</p>

<li>This article is needed to be under "Esotericism" new re-categorization (which contains "Occult" and "Mysticism" articles, among others) since Astrology always had a key role in majority of systems based on <a href="../../../e/s/o/Esoteric_knowledge.html" title="Esoteric knowledge">esoteric knowledge</a> (of past civilizations and of the current-day global society). Please give your feedback. --<a href="../../../g/a/l/User%7EGalaazV_bd81.html" title="User:GalaazV">GalaazV</a> 18:47, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Andrew Homer (StarHeart): I have fun irritating my fellow Astrologers by referring to Astrology as the most "muscle-bound" religion on the planet. My fellow (insecure) Astrologers are intent on needing to prove Astrology as a science. From empericism and experience since 1969, I know Astrology works. I don't lose sleep over others' opinions regarding the validity of Astrology. Try to find ANY other religion with as much emperical validation as Astrology. Besides, since the U.S. Constitution ensures "religious freedom", I have more constitutional protection practicing Astrology as a "religion" than I do practicing Astrology as a "science."</p>
