<h2><span class="mw-headline">Astrology Page Edits</span></h2>
<p>The reason your large edit is always being reversed are:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s a major rewrite of the article done without any prior consultation</li>
<li>It ignores and deletes work done by many others over months</li>
<li>It censors the scientific view of astrology completely</li>
<li>It is an unusual view of astrology not held by most astrologers</li>
<li>Its also poorly written with grammatical errors.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please scale down your edits and try to build in small steps on the work of others. <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumos3_fc96.html" title="User:Lumos3">Lumos3</a> 11:19, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Suggest you name the "errors" and explain what "censoring the scientific view" of non-astrologers means?</p>
<p>I'm going to have to disagree with you on reasons 1 and 2. Nobody needs prior consultation to rewrite an article (see <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a>). As long as it's better, it should be kept. And it doesn't matter if it "ignores or deletes" the work of others. If it's better, it stays. Wikipedia does not run on inertia and you shouldn't expect that your words will be around for awhile and that others will only make small incremental changes. Large and entire rewrites can and do happen, throwing everything out written by previous authors. And if the newer rewrite is better, it should stay. Now of course, you can edit it to try and make it even better, but reverting to a previous crappier version merely because that was "consensus" for awhile is wrong.</p>
<p>Now as for this specific edit, I believe your reasons 3, 4, and 5 were correct, but in the future, please don't use reasons 1 and 2 again. Remember, everything on here is subject to being <i>mercilessly edited</i>. Thank you for understanding. --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde Weys</a></b> <sub><a href="../../../t/w/o/Wikipedia%7ETwo-millionth_topic_pool_6995.html" title="Wikipedia:Two-millionth topic pool">vote</a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left: -16px; margin-right: -16px;"><a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECyde_0e22.html" title="User talk:Cyde">talk</a></span></sup> 14:16, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree that anyone can edit mercilessly and we do. But we are also cautioned not to be reckless. Be_bold_in_updating_pages#...but_don't_be_reckless. If you don’t want a major change to be edited back out mercilessly then you need to establish why you think its better rather than just replacing a consensus with your own pet view. <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumos3_fc96.html" title="User:Lumos3">Lumos3</a> 15:47, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Suggest you please stop making assumptions on this subject - especially on my edits. Ask first. Also, it is being established here that the Astrology page is not a forum for some to discuss their objection on astrology on the subject. The article is on the subject <i>itself</i> - ASTROLOGY - which has a history thousands of years old. There is no one "pet view" as you would put it, on this subject; however, the encyclopedic version I have been editing is much more balanced, and leaves open much more room for additional materials Lumos. So, rather than playing critic on everyone else's edit - try joining us to add clear and expanded knowledge on this subject. I do not see your additions as being particularly "perfect" and there are plenty of grammatical errors to go around. These are handled by minor edits. However, the historical additions are correct and the "claims" by "scientists" who do not practice astrology is not exactly what I would call balanced whatsoever but clear POV that restrict expansion of knowledge on the subject - not expanding that knowledge. That is the purpose of an encyclopedia.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheodore7_f3d4.html" title="User:Theodore7">Theo</a> 08:38, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Several things. 1. You don't hold reasonable discussions on any topics Theo, whether it be astrology, <a href="../../../i/s/s/Issac_Newton_e50b.html" title="Issac Newton">Issac Newton</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/s/Nostradamus.html" title="Nostradamus">Nostradamus</a>, etc. You always resort to wild assertions and slander, especially when your sources are proven to be lacking or faulty. Stop pretending. 2. The little essay that you keep trying to post as the astrology article is seriously not balanced. It is clearly writen by a modern western astrologer and has a focus only on modern western astrology, which completely leaves out the vast scope of what the article needs to cover in its broad overview of the subject matter. 3. Your historical additions are not "correct", as I have already shown in the above discussions on this talk page. Yet you still keep trying to post this article over and over again even though you it has been shown to be mistaken in several of its assertions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't really care if someone wants to rewrite this article, but the rewrite should at least be better than what it is trying to replace, and most of all- it should be accurate. I would support anything that worked toward these ends, but so far that is not what your article is doing. Scale it down, and improve it.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Response:</b> I would suggest that if you desire to actually hold "reasonable discussions" on any topic, that you refrain from accusations designed to cover up what is clearly your Hellenistic astrological view of astrology - making it into one monolethic body. I also suggest that if you are to show your astrological knowledge, that you do so with a view not solely based on your "opinion" which seems to cover a lack of knowledge on the subject. As for posting: as a Wikipedian, I have that right. If you are to point out "mistakes" I suggest you do so to IMPROVE the article and not REDUCE it to your own POV. Lastly, if you are to claim "wild assertions" - I suggest you also go out of your way to prove that they are so based on knowledge and facts rather than your POV. Adding to the Astrology article is done to expand on the subject - which is quite considerable considering its history, and not restrict, or fill it with POV designed to take away from the subject. The reader can think for themselves. This is an encyclopedic version with many links that improves the body of knowledge of Astrology. Editors who add to the article in this manner should be welcomed; especially those with extensive knowledge on the subject and not a retrictive POV.

<dd>An article on Astrology must contain the view of science on the subject, and at an early point in the article. A Wikipedia article needs to give the reader all views and not just a " correct" astrological one. Whatever that is. That is what NPOV means. <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumos3_fc96.html" title="User:Lumos3">Lumos3</a> 09:58, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>First, there is nothing that says that any view of "science", as it is being termed by you, must be stated at an early point in the article. These "entries" are written to debunk astrology from the OUTSET - not to enlighten the reader. Moreover, I find it amazing that astrologers who practice astrology: who invented mathematics - would be considered NOT a science? Astrologers today use mathematics, and observe influences of the celestial bodies relative to the Earth in their forecasting. So, what does this statement "view of science on the subject" mean? You must mean conventional material science that claims that astrology has no value and that ALL views of "science" must be MONOLETHIC and politically-correct to be accepted? This is not science but POV. Where does it say that this "view" must be contained in the primary subject matter? That is NOT what NPOV means - rather, in the manner you seem to be stating this Lumos, it is the exact opposite - POV - that is neither neutral, nor informative. Peer review would on this subject would have to be done by "peers" - practicing astrologers, and not "scientists" that continue to maintain that ONLY their version of "science" be stated. Science is NOT a monolethic subject.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheodore7_f3d4.html" title="User:Theodore7">Theo</a> 07:18, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wikipedia’s encyclopaedia policy is to give all views on a subject a fair hearing, not just one sympathetic to its proponents. A reader of the wikipedia astrology article should be enlightened in every view of astrology, including the widely held scientific view, and be able to make up their own minds about it.</dd>

<p>There is no need for me to go anywhere Lumos. I am a Wikipedian. Also, the article is on the SUBJECT of astrology, and not written from a "sympathetic" point of view. It is not "pro" but states the facts of the history, and practice of astrology - by a professional astrologer. I do not treat astrology with sympathy. It is a science and has been one for <i>thousands of years</i>. The mention of this word by you - sympathetic - suggests that you feel that a detracting view of astrology is therefore balanced? I think not. Moreover, I agree that all views are important, but many writing on this specific subject have little knowledge, yet find it pleasing to them to be critical - then to call it NPOV. This insults the intelligence of those with knowledge on the subject of astrology and rightly so. If you must add your "views on astrology" then do so from knowledge of the subject, rather than a negative point of view that is not balanced, nor neutral. This is one of the major problems with those seeking to be critical of astrology, i.e., in that they do not practice the science, but hold very definite views on it. How is this possible? Then, adding detracting comments based on a lack of knowledge, but then stating that knowledgable views are POV? Try not defining knowledge of astrology as "pro-astrology" as by this terming mechanism then non-knowledge of astrology is anti-astrology and should be stated as such. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheodore7_f3d4.html" title="User:Theodore7">Theo</a> 08:29, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's a terrible argument against astrology; "scientific process" has changed drastically over the centuries. There was a time when astrology was just as much of a science as astronomy or physics. It is not a science anymore because it has been wholly rejected by the scientific community (because, to way way oversimplify, it has been falsified). But I've been tracking through Theodore7's edits, and he's been making drastic or subtle changes to a whole range of astrology-related articles, and usually calling them minor edits, with no discussion. I found him because he changed almost every instance of "astronomer" to "astrologer" in <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johannes_Kepler_c2ce.html" title="Johannes Kepler">Kepler</a>. Theo, please realize that your strategy of replacing information is making other editors very frustrated. Instead, you should add sections, wholly in your own words and explicitly referenced, about your positions in each article you are interested in (preferably on the talk pages, first). Then we can discuss your work and sort what is accepted by consensus from what the majority considers to violate NPOV.--<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagesoss_e992.html" title="User:Ragesoss">ragesoss</a> 15:22, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I suggest that known astrologers be termed ASTROLOGERS first - since what is really going on here is that conventional scientific thinkers place ASTRONOMY first - when astrology is clearly primary here and comes first in spelling when referring to known astrologers such as Brahe, Copernicus, Kepler, etc. Also, the science of astrology gave birth to astronomy and a whole range of other sciences. This is a historical fact - not POV. Because of this, astrology has many links to many other subjects that cover biographies, astronomy, science, natural history, cultural history, theology, etc. Many of my edits are minor - however, they perturb some who continue to claim in error that astrology is not a science. I strongly disagree and will continue my edits. I am not adverse to discussion whatsoever, in fact, I welcome discussion, but not when it begins with accusations that I cannot edit because I am not supportive of preconceived belief systems that claim that astrology is not a science. I practice it professionally - AS A SCIENCE - and know others who do as well. So, if you must try to claim that well-known scientists are NOT astrologers - when they clearly are by historical fact - I will have a problem with that. Wikipedia is an encyclopedic resource. Astrology uses mathematics, in fact, astrologers invented math. Astrology is an observational science with a database of thousands of years of observations. We chart the motions and positions of planets and stars using mathematics and correlate their influences relative to the Earth. It is a science and to claim otherwise clearly shows ignorance of the subject itself and confusion of serious astrology with sun-sign astrology - which continues to be the definition of astrology in the minds of those who will not study astrology seriously - but who have strong negative point-of-view against astrology; even to the point of placing it secondary to the lives of those well-known astrologers who practiced astrology and astronomy as their primary scientific exploration of the cosmos and the correlations to the natural world.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheodore7_f3d4.html" title="User:Theodore7">Theo</a> 03:49, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is not argument pro or against anything but simply a very basic classification. And note the tempus. According to contemporary views, astrology is not science, as it doesn't follow the scientific process as defined today. Older POVs may earn it an additional classification in <a href="../../../o/b/s/Category%7EObsolete_scientific_theories_9145.html" title="Category:Obsolete scientific theories">Category:Obsolete scientific theories</a>. --15:34, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>When you put it that way, I mostly concur. I'll go with the contemporary views part, but I don't find adherence to scientific process to be a useful criterion; scientific processes vary too widely, even in legitimate sciences, to be a good way to tell science from non-science, except for rhetorical purposes. There is no <i>one</i> scientific method (at least one that matches up to the ways science is actually practiced).--<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagesoss_e992.html" title="User:Ragesoss">ragesoss</a> 20:15, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>These criteria may seem arbitrary to you, but there are some very plain ones for being a contemporary science: Like being taught at universities. --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 21:55, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do not know what a science is if it is not following a method that is scientific. The subject matter of astronomy and astrology are somewhat overlapping, what seperates them (in the overlapping sections) is the method used. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELundse_a2f1.html" title="User:Lundse">Lundse</a> 15:48, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The first subject taught at the original universities was astrology. This is a historical fact. What do you think the term "university" came from? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheodore7_f3d4.html" title="User:Theodore7">Theo</a> 03:52, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Being a pagan magician myself (and admittedly, a dabbler in astrology), I have no problem with the article as currently written. For the most part, it has a neutral tone. That being said, I certainly don't expect an encyclopedia to have a "this is a science" tone for Astrology, or any sort of magic. The results are just not easily verifiable enough for the scientific method and statistics. Whatever shortcomings that may result in, I certainly don't expect Wikipedia to be trying to convince people that astrology is either true or false. I feel that Theodore7 does want a "convincing" article.166.50.201.13 15:19, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I am sorry, but that university-astrology thing is not a fact. The origin of universities are Church schools, and the first subject was theology (which you studied for 5 years, and then maybe you studied something else - no choosing your subject until you knew your bible).<a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELundse_a2f1.html" title="User:Lundse">Lundse</a> 15:48, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Peer Review</span></h2>
<p>Weighing in here. I think the article as it stands has admirable brevity and structure in terms of the text itself. The length may be attributed to the many links, which can hardly be a bar to readability. As for neutrality, it seems to bend over backwards to be fair. The use of defamatory language and unattributed POV statements has been accepted, and frankly, it is highly biased. What sort of statement is: "The generally established opinion of the scientific community is that astrology is superstition, with no actual predictive ability." It's weasely ("The generally established opinion of the scientific community....") and slanderously derogatory ("superstition.") If we can sharpen axes in this way, there must be a similary brief response from MY point of view. Let's all go to the mat here, what the heck.</p>
<p>I would be quite content with this statement if the language were less scurrilous and there were some sort of support to the generalities. A footnote. Anything. Bart Bok, if you must. Footnote the 1975 petition by Bok and colleagues. <i>Something</i> to make it appear less petulant, and more professional. And I take hearty exception to the notion that there is some sort of monolithic scientific "community" out there. There is not. A majority of scientists perhaps. Many have their own slants. You cannot speak for science, although there seems to be an increasingly desperate need to do so. But most of all, I think there is no place in a balanced wiki article to call astrology a "superstition." Will you call an established religion a "superstition"? What is the difference? (from the POV of "the scientific <i>community</i>" of course!) Will you not find committed Christians among your scientists? Committed Buddhists, come to that! There is no claim in this article that astrology is some sort of science. Perhaps it might have been so regarded centuries ago, but the meaning of "science" has certainly evolved, and in this post-Koch age, it would be ludricrous to do that now. If you will live or die on your "scientific" stance, then you will kindly refrain from he sort of defamatory name-calling more appropriate to the schoolyard than Wikipedia, and content yourself with saying, quite accurately, that there has been little proof (Gauquelin notwithstanding) of actual predictive ability. Otherwise, I demand that you go to the "Judaism" article and say that the scientific community believes Judaism to be a superstition (and surely, many do?)</p>
<p>Having gotten THAT off my chest (and it feels good), I'd like to suggest, returning to the cultivisation de notre jardin, that a companion article be written on Hellenistic astrology (or as my pal Joseph Crane prefers to call it, Ancient Western Astrology) and a link be given in the article, in the same fashion. I know there is a good History article available, but perhaps some of the disagreement here may be mollified by magnetising all the little bits into their own camps and attributing methods neatly with hyperlinks for further elaboration. I volunteer! A similar article needs perhaps to be done for Medieval methods through Lilly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, neither Uranian astrology nor Cosmobiology are mentioned in the list of various astrologies, although articles for them exist, and they are at least as mainstream as "Meso-american astrology" (and by the way, if Bruce Scofield doesn't Wikify, who in heck would write such an article? Not moi.) Surely if there is one method generally recognized with little argument to be THE modern contribution to technique, it would be Witte and Ebertin. It deserves more recognition than merely a link, among many, at the end of the article.</p>
<p>Personally, I would like to see "Kabbalistic astrology" co-labeled as "traditional Jewish astrology" (or something of the sort) to differentiate it from the mishmash of hermetic bits and pieces cribbed from here and there that is sometimes lectured on as "Qabalistic Astrology" here in New England.</p>
<p>I think Cornelius' views--which have become very influential in today's astrology--should at least be mentioned, as well as Damiani and Gauquelin. The article seems "Seymour-heavy" to me. Several decades ago, it would have been buttressed with John Nelson's RCA stuff, and maybe Addey. There are perhaps fashions in these things. But these are today's.</p>
<p>I think there should be two or three of the very finest books referred to as well. One thing the reader desiring more info on astrology will want, most of all, is a book or two to start with. Do we want them to go to Isobel Hickey? or [gasp] Linda Goodman? If there must be ONE book, I imagine we might ALL agree it should be Robert Hand's "Horoscope Symbols." I would also like to add Cornelius' MoA. Ebertin's COSI is referred by almost every astrologer I know when actually working, but this would certainly be an advanced text, inappropriate for a beginner.</p>
<p>Please do not take these remarks critically. I am trying to make an evaluation to be of help, and I can only do that by making observations from my own standpoint. I will do some of the work, if it is felt to be useful. --N. Harris <a href="../../../n/a/y/User_talk%7ENaySay_31c5.html" title="User talk:NaySay">NaySay</a> 1/7/06 21:09 UTC</p>
<p>PS: I think another fine book to add here which would be interesting to both the skeptics and the astrologers would be Garry Phillipson's excellent "Astrology in the Year Zero." --<a href="../../../n/a/y/User_talk%7ENaySay_31c5.html" title="User talk:NaySay">NaySay</a> 1/7/06 21:33 UTC</p>
<p>Okay, here is an unsupported statement from the "Validity of astrology" section: "Some astrologers argue that astrology works by a mechanism that is (yet) unknown to science." I have spent some time hunting for a reference for this statement among the astrological literature, but thus far, I can find none. Perhaps there is a quote from an astrologer something in the considerable "skeptic" literature which can be brought to bear here? If not, the statement does not seem to belong in the article as it stands. It's highly POV and belongs, rather, in the "Validity of Astrology" article, perhaps, which is, I gather, more of a slugfest of opinions.

<p>I spotted this page on RfC yesterday, so here are my thoughts.</p>
<p>The version to which Theo keeps reverting is far too pro-Astrology, and doesn't give the skeptical views on Astrology enough space. egs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Claiming that 'Astrology and astronomy were once the same discipline' is misleading. The neolithic people who built various stone circles clearly observed and measured the movements of celestial bodies, (ie practiced astronomy) and we simply don't know why they did so. Assuming that the reasons were astrological is a leap of faith. Similarly, all through history, astronomical measurements and observations have been used for navigation, rather than prediction, which makes that practice astronomy not astrology. It's fair to say that many people practiced both in the past, and it's also fair to say that very few (if any) practice both today.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I am an avid proponent of both astrology and astronomy, and I know others who are as well. So this &lt;&lt; (if any) &gt;&gt; is quite wrong. --<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.12.117.8.html" title="User:64.12.117.8">64.12.117.8</a> 00:21, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Response</b>: The subject title is Astrology - and is not a page for "pro" or "con" views of astrology. This seems to be the main confusion in your statement above. Nearly every culture on earth practice astrology and to claim that "neolethic people" were the only ones is not valid. Moreover, there exists millions of documents, treaties, texts, books, art, architecture, etc., throughout all the nations of the earth that clearly are astrological. Suggest you review them since it is obvious that astrology is as old as human history.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheodore7_f3d4.html" title="User:Theodore7">Theo</a> 10:06, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>The claim that astrologers invented algebra, geometry, and trig. Since the invention of these techniques is lost in the mists of time (we don't know the named individuals who invented them), this claim is unsourced (unsourceable) speculation.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Response:</b> This is not true. To claim that these "techniques is lost in the mists of time" is also not true. Suggest you read the thousands upon thousands of ancient astrological texts that exist. Try starting with The Secrets of the Book of Enoch - this book survived the Great Flood and there are many copies easily obtained through a simple Internet search. Also suggest you read any number of astrological Hindu and Arabic texts on algebra, geometry, etc., translated into Latin, German, Spanish, and English.

<dd>Theo, there's not even any proof that there was a "Great Flood", so claiming that a book (or even knowledge passed down unchanged from that time) can't be seriously claimed. 166.50.201.13 15:25, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>What does this mean? Because the books exist that make the claim that Astrology was the basis for math, it must be? Sourcing a claim is not just finding some astrologer who believes it, it is finding a historical source for it - this Secrets... sounds like a candidate, though. Does it show how astrologers invented math? <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELundse_a2f1.html" title="User:Lundse">Lundse</a> 15:48, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>'Free will is a given in true astrological practice' Are there no deterministic astrologers? Who says? 'but destiny is within the principles of universal laws - and not outside of it.' This is random speculation on the highly nebulous concept of destiny. This is unencyclopedic language.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Response:</b> Of course there are. Just as there are "deterministic" individuals in life. If you practiced astrology you would know that free will is a given.

Theo, perhaps if you introduced changes piece-by-piece, with discussion, this pointless revertery could be avoided.

<dd>Agreeing with most of the above. There may be some things about the popular reception of astrology in the twentieth century that would be worth discussion in the article.

What makes the debate so 'great', and it is as significant as the author paints it? <i>Free will is a given in true astrological practice</i>, not only am I curious if this is sourced, but does it consist of a true Scotsman fallacy? Again, <i>Serious astrologers maintain that those who practice astrology without years of experience are not astrologers - but merely students.</i> does not seem neutral to me. The section on 'Astrology &amp; 20th Century North American Expansion' reads to me like a page on general Christianity from a Catholic POV. Seems like this information should be put in a more specialized page, not the generalized topical page. Additionally, I see no problem in including the skeptical viewpoint, perhaps in its own smaller section, as long as the article remains neutral and on topic. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 18:17, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, I think that is an excellent idea Durova. I think a good rewrite by all interested editors with less U.S. centrism and adding sources is a good idea. If there are claims of "POV pushing" then suggest that sourcing is one of the best ways to proceed. The article I've edited has a source page, and more sources will be added. Would prefer this to avoid anyon's POV.

<p>Yes, agreed. One of the things that remains sad is that detractors of "astrology" often have no idea what it is that they are talking about when the - "A-word" as they refer to astrology - is applied. Wikipedia is an encyclopedica resource, and yet, some continue to base their "knowledge" of astrology with their belief system. Moreover, astrology has a very, very long history - with many cultures practicing it in the real world. Some detractors fail to even see this, and many, have never read a serious astrological text, or textbook. Rather, they allow their "belief system" to interfere with scientific investigation and practice science as a noun, and not a verb. They set barriers for themselves by pushing a POV then state others are doing this - so, sourcing is the best way to continue since there are thousands upon thousands of serious astrological books, and texts that are very scientific on the subject as a science - an applied science.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheodore7_f3d4.html" title="User:Theodore7">Theo</a> 04:23, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Providing Sources &amp; References for Wiki-Astrology Page</span></h2>
<p>The version that keeps being reverted continues as the only version that contains sources. As old as astrology is, there are many sources that can be cited that would end the so-called "revert wars" that I want no part of, and never did. I do not consider my additions, or edits to be a "final version" - however, I would prefer a balanced, version that is encyclopedic, informative, and allows the reader to obtain more than just website links. I have added published books, textbooks, etc., also as sources to back up the material on the Astrology Page. I will continue to cite sources, and to reference them in the article subject. It would help that others join in and help to improve the article, rather than engaging in personal accusations, attacks, revert wars, etc., but who have not sourced one book in the so-called "consensus" version. This is not a consensus, but POV, and I suggest sourcing as one fine example of following Wikipedia policy &amp; standards to achieve the best NPOV possible for the subject matter. So, I will continue to cite published source material.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheodore7_f3d4.html" title="User:Theodore7">Theo</a> 17:39, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All of the "sources" that you cited are out of date, not to mention the fact that none of them back up your assertions. Sources aren't just random books that you pulled out of your library Theo. They are supposed to support the arguments that you are trying to make. Unfortunately none of the "sources" that you cited do that, so basically you just have a few random book references added to your essay with no quotations. For example, in your essay you are still trying to attribute sayings to Ptolemy that he did not say. I have already proven this, yet you sill keep trying to post it anyways.

<p>For someone who says he is involved in Project Hindsight, and studying Hellensitic astrological texts - this is a contradictory statement. Most sources are dated, Chris, and are not "ramdom" books pulled out of my library. Jeez, you can find them in the Library of Congress for crying out loud. Suggest that if you are to maintain that people are "wrong" about their arguements Chris, as you state, then you back it up yourself with sources - and cite them - which is not done at all in the version of the Astrology Page you say you support. As for Ptolemy, suggest that as a 21-year-old student of astrology that you continue your studies since you continue to write, and act out childishly, and not as a professional astrologer, or historian, or scholar of astrology. Again, cite sources, and know this Chris, if you are to state that they are "out of date" then I suggest you review the "dates" of the Greeks texts you talk about yourself.

<p>Marskell: I stated my opinions; presented my intentions, and asked for differing points of view. Since no objection was forthcoming; I made my changes. Where were you?</p>
<p>As I said in that statement, to which you never responded, you cannot speak for the entire scientific community--you could not, even if you were a scientist. The only professional and scholarly option is to carefully quote the most representative source of the opinion you believe to be widely held, which is why I laboriously looked up the 1975 Humanist manifesto, typed it into a Wiki article I created for it, made links to it, footnoted the quotes, and and footnoted every other opinion made in this controversial area. If you can find a more representative or a more historically resonant pronouncement than this one, by all means, quote that instead. I don't personally believe there is one, but I'm a historian, not a scientist. No one can speak for all of science; there are scientists who don't agree with you. Perhaps not a lot, but nonetheless there is no monolith called "science" out there when it comes to opinions about fields, such as religion, which have nothing to do with it. The best you can do, if we have any hope of ever stopping this war, is to opt for the majority of them, because that's all you've got. And that's what we were all inching toward by honestly and fairly quoting Bok <i>et alii.</i></p>
<p>As for religion, which would you like to speak for? science? or religion? It's an odd duck who can speak for both in the twenty-first century. What source can you quote for the unilateral opposition of "religion" -- whatever homogeneous entity THAT is! -- to astrology? You're on weak ground there-- and the ground's centered in Europe. Do you believe that "religion" is the church around your corner? Or the mosque? On the contrary, astrology is a very deeply established tenet of several non-Western religions--Hinduism, very notably--as well as several forms of Buddhism, including that of the Dalai Lama. It continues to be practiced in traditional Jewish sects, and by Moslems all over India. Furthermore, your definition of "religion" as an organized cost-center with its own IRS employer-ID number is fine for your accountant, but doesn't hold up as an intellectual concept. -- <a href="../../../n/a/y/User_talk%7ENaySay_31c5.html" title="User talk:NaySay">NaySay</a> N.Harris 1/14/06 20:49 UTC--</p>

<dd>The absence of peer-reviewed work (and I'm not talking about pop-sci books for a buck) itself speaks volumes. I'm not asking for "astrology is wrong" as a lead I'm asking that we present its current status in terms of mainstream epistemology--and as such its incumbent that we make a caveat as to its non-acceptance amongst "most" (again pick your adverb) scientists. The need for citation does not dictate equivocation or silence in the absence of citation. And what's happening here is that we're getting a lot of disambiguous crap about how its an "art" or "process" or whatever and not stating the obvious: that it's not a mainstream scholarly pursuit.</dd>
<dd>As an example with another page I've worked on, fully one third (or one hundred million) Americans purportedly believe aliens regularly visit Earth. But we don't lead with that. We lead with the following: "Its existence is currently hypothetical: there is as yet no evidence of extraterrestrial life that has been widely accepted by scientists." And that's as it should be. How about: "There is as yet no evidence that astrology has a falsifiable, scientific basis."</dd>
<dd>As for religion: add don't delete. Hinduism incorporates astrology--add that. I added that Islamic and Christian teaching speaks against astrology. That's not untrue. And please spare me the "so-and-so believed in it" business. We don't focus on Newton's religious tracts at the expense of gravity and calculus.</dd>
<dd>Finally, I must ask: what's up with "insulting," "defamatory," etc. etc. as descriptions of the edit in question? We're not talking about a person. I'd suggest adopting a disinterested stance here and not treating criticism as some terrible attempt to insult. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 21:42, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perhaps an encyclopedia is a poor place to argue whether a subject is superstition or fact. Astrology is a body of {knowledge, religion, superstition, lore, myth, learning, realization} - pick one, and it can be described and explained clearly so that viewers can understand what its tenants are. Astrology has been with us a very long time and deserves a good write up. I would recommend the deletion of this section as not helpful in clarifying the subject. --Beanmf 04:02, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Beanmf: I agree with you, but then I <i>would</i>. Everyone doesn't see it that way, and I am trying to help find a statement we can all live with. I have a good friend, a Buddhist who is deeply attracted to Platonic philosophy, who feels that the fundamentalist right have co-opted the expression "intelligent design" for their crude purposes, for example. He'd love to set that record straight, and "rescue" the concept from the holy rollers. I myself am committed to natural selection, and I feel my blood boil whenever someone claims it's "just a theory" and that there are other ones which should get equal time--like a Presidental debate. If I didn't have a thousand things that had greater priority, I'd want "equal time" on that one, I suppose. The EB describes astrology as a "superstition" and the 1911 version was far more derogatory (see, for example, what was said about <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Lilly_5814.html" title="William Lilly">William Lilly</a> in the article Wiki took from it.) The farther we get from it, the more POV many "objectively-stated" arguments may seem to be. One of the strengths of a standard encyclopedia is that each article is assigned to one expert and a cohesive article from one point-of-view results (hopefully stated in a fair way.) But it's in the very nature of a Wiki sort of enterprise that coherence of that sort is not an option. We have to try to find its strengths, I guess. And I imagine this is an intellectual area--like it or not--which is in ferment now. But yes, wearily, I think you're right. --N.

<p>The aditional link to the Humanist article is, I think, an example of POV forking, which is not really allowed in Wikipedia, although it is usually done to suppress information, I imagine the policy is the same for trying to push a negative POV (neg toward the subject, not in general). The source is already cited at the end of the article, and the introduction isn't really the place for in-depth anything...it is just an introduction. It should describe briefly what the subject is, and, if applicable (which it is in this article) briefly mention if there are any detractors, who they are, and, if it can be kept brief, a general reason. In any case, the introduction to the astrology article isn't the place to debate whether it's a useful practice or not.

<p>Yes, there's a vast difference between the Astrologies developed in greatly different cultures. I've been amazed by Chinese Astrology, but I have yet to see anything to get excited about regarding Indian Astroogy. I do think that each of the culturally different Astrologies be presented separtately.

I believe these should be better placed as sub sections of the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_astrology.html" title="Western astrology">Western astrology</a> article.

<dd>I agree, although there are many crossovers between the 'western' traditions (Hellenistic, Medieval, Renaissance, Modern, etc.) and Vedic, since they all developed largely from the Hellenistic construct. Also, all of the above stated traditions, including several other asian astrological traditions (Chinese and Tibetan) were developed directly or indirectly out of the Babylonian tradition, so there will be crossovers there as well. So, whatever we do will have to account for these interrelations. I think that we are going to have to search out some wikipedians who have an intimate knowledge of the some of these traditions and I think that that may be difficult. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Brennan_4621.html" title="User:Chris Brennan">Chris Brennan</a> 21:37, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would add (ducking behind my desk) that's it's very clear that Jyotish too is a product of the Mesopotamian/Egyptian/Persian/Greek tradition all developed in the Mediterranean. Nothing like the Jyotish system existed in India until the Greeks invaded northern India with Alexander the Great. At that point in time, the whole thing exploded in Sanskrit, beginning with the <i>Yavana Jataka</i> of Sphujidhvaja. The "Yavana" of the title was Greek. The Central Asian and Bactrian Greeks were called "Yavanas" or linguistically-related names until they disappeared a millennium and a half later. The Sanskrit names for the signs derive from the Babylonian names. Although the Indians had a marvelous system of astronomy, including the constellations we now call the Nakshatras, outstanding mathematics, and possibly a native system of sky-omens or even what we might call astrology, the system they have now is a better-preserved version (with many further developments) of the same Hellenistic system that originated the techniques in this article. There's a very convincing body of evidence for ancient Western astrology being the "Ur-astrology" of all these systems we see today. And for that reason, this is not just a question of Eurocentrism; this tradition spread from Europe and the Middle East, and major tenets of that system are still present in all modern descendants. -N. Harris NaySay|NaySay 1/22/06 22:17 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS: I know nothing about the Meso-American version of astrology, but hardly anyone does. It may have different origins. Or not. But in any case, no one practices it today. It's at best a footnote. If you can find someone who can say more than one sentence about it, get out your semaphore flags and give them a hail. I have one sentence: it depended heavily on the six-year cycle of Venus. -- N.

<p>I don't see why Clark's "Sibling" book or Houck's "death" book belong on further reading. They are both minor books about extremely specialized topics. I don't think Clark's book is even in print anymore, and it's not an important work. What is the point of giving these books in a section for people looking for a book to learn something about astrology? Especially if it isn't in print? These are second-tier books at best, and they for those who <i>already</i> are familiar with astrology. This is not the place for them. I think they should be removed. If not, I'd list at least 50 more books that are better and more relevant to "Further Reading." Any comment?</p>
<p>Also--the Society of the Golden Dawn doesn't belong in the same list of schools that contains Kepler College and the Sophia Center. I don't even know if they teach astrology, but they're just a Theosophical offshoot, hardly astrological. If you include them, you need to include a dozen others in the States which are a great deal better than they are and more up to date. I think it should be removed. Any comments?</p>
<p>Lastly, why is Cornelius a "reference" and removed from "Further Reading"? They are all references, if you want to be strict about it. A "Reference" section doesn't mean much when the book is listed right above it in several footnotes. I think it should go back to "Further Reading." Any comments?

<p>I've just been reading the page. I find the continual comparisons to medicine deliberately deceptive. Astrology is not a science and the constant allusions to it's supposed similarity to medicine are, to my eye, an attempt to foist credibility upon the reader. I've edited accordingly, so that the text no longer directly alludes between the two fields.</p>
<p>There's a section which says "many new schools...under responsible leadership" followed by "passing an exam does not necessarily mean a student is competent". If the school is reasonable, passing an exam INHERENTLY means the candidate is competent. Accordingly, I've removed those because they form a non-sequitur.</p>
<p>I learned the basics of astrology in about six months, when I was much younger. The comments about "it takes years to learn the most basic principles" are simply inaccurate; the author has I aver lapsed into romanticism. I've removed them.</p>

<p>Hi...newcomer here&#160;:). I agree that one can learn the basics of astrology (what the terms mean, what the planets, signs and houses mean) and maybe the triplicities and quardaplicities within the span of a few months if they have a good memory. Learning how they all interact together, aspects, and what all this indicates, though, takes much longer.</p>
<p>One note, children actually learn faster than adults in most cases (in terms of language, the average child learns hundreds of new words per year, whereas the average adult usually learns a dozen at most), of course this is merely a case of the tendancy humans have to think they have less to learn the older they get, and has nothing to do with actual ability. In summary, an adult <i>can</i> learn as fast as a child, but many choose not to. It doesn't really take children several years to learn the alphabet, as we don't really start teaching them the alphabet until they are 4 or 5 years old, and most grasp it within several months or less. Lets please not be <a href="../../../a/g/e/Ageism.html" title="Ageism">ageist</a>...not against children and not against young adults...ok? And can we all try to be nice?

Having worked on it, including tracking down a source for the religious opposition, I'll only say that there is absolutely no way we are going to leave criticism in the intro as merely: "Detractors say there is no evidence for the claims that astrologers can predict the future and maintain that astrology is a "pseudo-science" at best." <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 13:09, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Intro length</span></h2>
<p>Is it just me, or is that the longest introduction to an article ever?!?!</p>
<p>Surely this should be more summarized? I'm quite sure most of that info can go into sections easily...am I wrong about this? Here's what I suggest:</p>
<p>Astrology (from Greek: αστρολογία = άστρον, astron, "star" + λόγος, logos, "word") refers to any of several traditions or beliefs in which knowledge of the apparent positions of celestial bodies is held to be useful in understanding, interpreting, and organizing knowledge about reality and human existence on earth.</p>
<p>(Maybe): <i>All such traditions are based on the relative positions and movements of various real and construed celestial bodies as seen at the time and place of the birth or other event being studied. These are chiefly the Sun, Moon, planets, Ascendant &amp; Midheaven axes, and the lunar nodes.</i></p>
<p>A practitioner of astrology is called an astrologer or an astrologist. Astromancy, the prediction of the future by the stars, is a slightly archaic synonym for astrology. An astrologer may sometimes be called or an astromancer (or the rather rarely used astromancist). The term astromancy is most often used when listing astrology among other, different forms of divination such as geomancy and necromancy.</p>
<p>Astrology is not considered to be a science, but is more appropriately an art, and is separate from astronomy, the scientific study of outer space. (maybe)<i>There is as yet no accepted evidence that astrology has a falsifiable, scientific basis.</i> Astrology has also been rejected on a religious basis by most Christian and Islamic groups, although it continues to be a tenet of others, such as Hinduism and forms of Buddhism.</p>
<p>Andrew Homer (StarHeart): People show me where in the Gospel of Thomas (the ONLY gospel written when Jesus was breathing) that there's ANY criticism of Astrology. Just because someone calls themself a Christian doesn't mean that they are. How do you explain that it was the Arab world which maintained Astrology duting Europe's "dark ages"? Why are you sweeping under the carpet the MANY astrological references in BOTH the Old Testament and the New Testament?</p>
<p>Note: the italicized parts aren't proposed to be italicized in the article, just to show what parts I'm not sure whether I think should be in the intro or within the following sections. I think the problem is that since this is a controversial article, both (or all if there's more than two) sides want to make sure the debate is done up front. I think the standard practice for the intro of any article is to briefly describe what the subject is, and then, if it is a subject that involves different views, put a brief introduction to any major detractors (and their reasons if it can be kept brief) and put the rest within the sections of the article. <a href="../../../b/c/a/User%7EBcatt_84c6.html" title="User:Bcatt">bcatt</a> 10:43, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Fifth paragraph: removed first sentence, as it is considered a science by those who support it and not considered a science by those who criticize it, so it's not accurate to apply a blanket statement that it isn't considered a science, as it actually does use scientific principles as defined by dictionaries and wikipedia itself; and also removed the last part claiming that astrologers don't require causal or scientific basis for their interpretations of a chart, as I don't see this as being true...likewise with it being dependant on intuition. If necessary, comments regarding these claims can be added to the criticism section. The remaining portion was moved to the description section.</li>
<li>Neutralized the scientific opinion of astrology, providing both it's criticism and support</li>
<li>Clarified religious criticism and support</li>
<li>Moved paragraphs 8 and 9 into description section</li>
<li>Used solar system image proposed above as a more generally encompassing illustration of astrology, as there were no written objections to it, though I am looking at creating a new image depicting the planets and sun seen from earth; and moved coloured western chart image further down the page, removing the y2k one...this was a tough choice, as I think the y2k one is more general and therefore more appropriate for the article, but the coloured birth chart is easier to look at and has a good description on it's page.</li>
<li>Generally joggled images around to try to make them fit better within the article</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Astrology: Threat or Menace?</span></h2>
<p>I think it's relevant to take a moment to consider the overall purpose of this article. Astrology is, in fact, one of the oldest and most universal of the esoteric practices humanity has ever conceived. Whether it is "real" or not is not a relevant topic for this article. It has a history, which is definitely worth respecting. While I understand the desire for science advocates to want to steer curious minds toward the contemporary foci of astronomical studies, there is scholarly legitimacy in the study of astrology's history and methods, both anthropologically and as a part of the evolution of scientific thought.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the arguments about whether astrology is a legitimate practice has no place here. It fits in the realm of faith and philosophy, whose threads of insight wove the beginnings of astronomy and influenced other sciences. No historian of science would deny that anymore than one would deny Isaac Newton's near-obsession with alchemy.</p>
<p>I've heard many arguments against practices such as astrology, some well-intended and some just angry. The fact remains that the vast majority of humanity believes in the supernatural in one form or another. Attacking a person's faith will <b>never</b> convince them of the rightness of your point, or enlighten them to science. It has the exactly opposite effect. If the concern of the skeptic is that of "consumer protection" consider that people are not quite so stupid as you assume. If they choose to exchange money for a service they subjectively consider valuable to them, that is a <b>legitimate</b> transaction in a capitalist system. Attempting to make a moral issue of it (tossing around words like charlatan, for instance) is a very slippery slope.</p>
<p>If a person is here on Wikipedia, they are not without a questioning mind. Most casual readers who explore astrology are not seeking to become astrologers or to spend thousands of dollars on a professional to the detriment of their wellbeing. They are curious. They'd like to know more. Astrology does in fact open the door to astronomy. If you are truly interested in guiding people in that direction, utilize more positive language. Discuss the connection between the two schools.</p>
<p>Astrology is not responsible for starvation in the third world, war or disease. It does not cause the brain to come oozing out of one's cranium. Creating a battle where it is not asked is the very reason that science and religion have become so woefully divorced in the eyes of the vast majority of people. Granted, the battle was started by religion, but it need not be perpetuated, and by doing so you are alienating the very minds you seek to enlighten just so that you can reassure yourself that you are smarter than most people, thinly and cheaply masked with this banner of the public interest.</p>
<p>I agree that balance is important in any article, but a mere glance at this discussion page demonstrates that balance is not as important to some of the individuals participating as being "right". Try to look at this page instead as a reference for a field of human pursuit that, though it is certainly no longer part of the body of modern science, had a long and venerable history that undoubtedly influenced a many aspects of our greatest achievements. If we had never been compelled to look at the stars in wonder and seek to make them part of our existence, how much of what we know now would have been lost? <i>"The contemplation of celestial things will make a man both speak and think more sublimely and magnificently when he descends to human affairs."</i> - Cicero</p>
<p>It's something to consider, since none of our presumptions here will have our names remembered so long as his.... || <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadow_Magi_becc.html" title="User:Shadow Magi">Shadow Magi</a> 10:06, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi, thanks for your comments. I'm currently trying to rework the intro, due to it's length, accuracy and the attack page that is practically thrown in the reader's face (which, btw, I've nominated for speedy deletion). I'm looking at the fact that astronomy is misrepresented as never having been connected to astrology (when, in fact, astronomy was <i>born out of</i> astrology), and the fact that many astronomers still support astrology as a science. Also looking at clearing up the religion part (if you don't know the significance that astrology has in religion, just look up the three wise men...they were astrologers). In the interest of NPOV, the opposition does need to be properly represented, but I think that can be done without the article having the "astrology is a crock" tone that it's currently leaning towards. I'm also reworking the part where <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astromancy.html" title="Astromancy">astromancy</a> is mentioned, and wrote an article for it, since it used to redirect here. Hope this makes sense...I'm very tired lol. Anyway, I'm trying to work on it and look forward to any suggestions. <a href="../../../b/c/a/User%7EBcatt_84c6.html" title="User:Bcatt">bcatt</a> 12:33, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Although I agree that "astromancy" is not synonymous with astrology, I don't think that the distinction between predicting exact events as opposed to generalities is the difference between the two. I'm going to do a little reasearch on the subject, but my current understanding is that astromancy is merely a derogatory term that is sometimes used in reference to astrology. I'm not really sure that it belongs in the intro at this point though. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Brennan_4621.html" title="User:Chris Brennan">Chris Brennan</a> 21:51, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From my understanding, astromancy is an actual practice, not a specifically derogatory term (although I'm sure that many like to use it as a derogator term for astrology)...how I understand it is that although a very similar, or even the same, process is used, the end result is where the difference lies. For example, where an astrologer would see a charismatic character, an astromancer would assert that the subject "is going to be" some sort of public figure. It's probably bad example, but it illustrates what I was attempting to convey in the article. Hopefuly you can find something to clear this up, I'll look around too. <a href="../../../b/c/a/User%7EBcatt_84c6.html" title="User:Bcatt">bcatt</a> 01:53, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Right. The problem with that though is that there are still many astrologers who do make concrete predictions about people and events. Even though much of modern western astrology has been directed towards character interpretation since Alan Leo in the early 20th century, this is not how it has always been traditionally, or how it is outside of the new age and psychological astrological circles. For example, Vedic astrologers in India are all about telling you very specific things pertaining to your life and what will happen based upon your birth chart and your dashas. This doesn't mean that they are practicing "astromancy" though, because they are in fact using horoscopic astrology and a very definite set of rules in order to arive at specific conclusions. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Brennan_4621.html" title="User:Chris Brennan">Chris Brennan</a> 02:24, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Couldn't agree more, Chris. Also I really and truly dsilike that picture of Saturn and some other planets. It's not attractive and I don't see anything astrological about it. Can't it be moved? Also, I don't like all the pictures on one side. It's a bit Adrian Monk-like, don't you think? Hard on the eyes. Also, I don't see a reason for having Percy Seymour in paragraph one. I personally think he's off in the ether somewhere and he certainly is not main line astrology. Also, in my opinion, who cares if astrology adheres to some scientific protocol? I think it's about time we stopped worrying about the scientists. They have their own religion. Also, paragraph 2, we start off with the being defensive again. I wish all this defensiveness would stop. The heck with it. The article should be about astrology, not about some astronomers' view of what we do. Especially in second paragraph. You're jumping right up, with your dukes in front of your eyes. NaySay 03:19, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I haven't really made any major edits to the main astrology article because I was waiting until there was enough actual astrologers frequenting wikipedia to be able to come to a concensus about it. Astrology should be defined in its own right before it is contrasted with opposing viewpoints. This seems to be the way that other articles are done, especially ones which carry theological connontations. So yeah, I think that we should start a major overhaul of the article. This has already been started by Bcatt, but we still have a long way to go. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Brennan_4621.html" title="User:Chris Brennan">Chris Brennan</a> 03:27, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The more I research this astromancy thing, the more it just looks like an obsolete 17th century English term. It appears that most of the sources that I have at my disposal for the history of astrology don't even refer to it because it was only used mainly in 17th century England as astrology was falling out of favor. Saying that it is just divination by the stars doesn't quite make sense either because there is a large contention of people who believe that that is the mechanism behind astrology in the first place. So I'm not really sure where to go with this. I would say that we should just drop it from the intro at this point, add the inter-wiki link to the see also section, and move on. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Brennan_4621.html" title="User:Chris Brennan">Chris Brennan</a> 03:33, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agree on the "astromancy" term. Agree on the major overhaul, and seeing as I'm giving a presentation before an astrology group tomorrow for which I'm getting paid, I qualify as a professional. I've been a bit unwilling to do much with this article, as it seemed a waste of my time, but if it's finally going somewhere useful I'd be overjoyed to help out! <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoovinator_deb5.html" title="User:Doovinator">Doovinator</a> 04:18, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Are we not going to run into some trouble from those who show up and start going in on the "astrology isn't a science" bit? There is an NPOV policy that all views on a subject must be represented, though I <i>would</i> like to put emphasis on the fact that astronomy exists <i>because</i> astrology needed more accurate tracking of the planets...rather than how it is represented as astrology <i>borrowing</i> or <i>taking advantage</i> of astronomers' hard work (as this is how it reads to me right now)...and I was writing the following when I stopped to check my watchlist:
<dl>
<dd>I am wondering if anyone has any information on whether the scientists who reject astrology ever actually examined it first before discarding it? Are there any empirical studies which have shown astrology to have no basis? I have not yet read a critical "report" of astrology that did not include a falsely attributed practice (such as being based on the stars, etc). If it has not been seriously studied (other than by faithful astrologers), then this debate is clearly a case of scientific tunnel vision.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I would like nothing more than to just discuss astrology in this article, as the criticism seems to have very little validity in it's logic (not to mention in my own experience, which shows that astrology is indeed quite valid)...but, I can't very well insist on NPOV over at Joseph Smith, but turn a blind eye to it here&#160;;).</dd>
<dd>Chris, would you mind updating the astromancy article with what you've found?</dd>
<dd>NaySay...sorry you hate the solar sys image...I was trying to come up with something neutral to all the different types of astrology, as I had noticed someone's comment way up there about a heavy leaning toward Western astrology...I asked for ideas but got no response, so I just put it up. Any ideas for what would work for an "all-encompassing" image? <a href="../../../b/c/a/User%7EBcatt_84c6.html" title="User:Bcatt">bcatt</a> 08:12, 16 February 2006 (UTC) (ummmm, yeah...sorry if none of that made sense...I'm going to bed now)</dd>
