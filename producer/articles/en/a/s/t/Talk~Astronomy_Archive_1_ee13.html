<dd>Most (if not all) astronomers now have a strong background in physics, and observations are always put in an astrophysical context, so the distinction between astronomy and astrophysics almost doesn't exist anymore.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Is this true for planetary scientists and exobiologists, though? For an astrophysicist I imagine there's no significant difference, but what about the other specializations within astronomy? --<a href="../../../l/m/s/LMS_66a8.html" title="LMS">LMS</a></p>
<ul>
<li>I imagine a background in chemistry might also be uselful--<a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHello_fromSPACE_2525.html" title="User:Hello fromSPACE"><b><font color="blue">Hello</font></b></a><small>'<b>from</b></small><sup>'<b><small>SPACE</small></b></sup><font color="green"><sup><span style="background-color: blue"><span><sup><font>00:10, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</font></sup></span></span></sup></font></li>
</ul>
<p>I've been thinking about that. The truth is, I didn't think of exobiologist as astronomers...but according to my own definition, they are. Maybe I should think of moving this back to astronomy, and giving exobiology a place there. In the case of planetary scientists, i'm pretty sure that their physics background must be good, though they could be strongers in other areas of <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth_science.html" title="Earth science">earth sciences</a>. I think we need more astronomers around here. -- <a href="../../../a/n/_/AN_d968.html" title="AN">AN</a></p>
<p>In some countries other than the US, astronomers and astrophysicists are distinctly separate categories. I'm a <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grad_student.html" title="Grad student">grad student</a> in astronomy and my <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavian</a> classmates assure me these are very separate there, that astronomers only measure things and only get a Master's degree while astronomers do only theory and get a PhD.

<p>Has anyone considered pilfering NASA site for materials to add? I've just gone there and not found a general copyright notice, stating that it covers materials on the entire site, but it seems to be under the typical U.S. gov't terms; the notices I have found all say not to use pictures including recognizable people for any commercial purpose w/o written permission, and say the materials must not be used to imply endorsement by NASA, etc. No explicit word on whether the materials are in the public domain (I expect that they are). --KQ</p>
<p>Actually, just on mon I emailed the webmaster of image.gspc.nasa.gov about their copyrights, because of the article <a href="../../../x/-/r/X-ray_astronomy.html" title="X-ray astronomy">x-ray astronomy</a> that I found out was copied from there. The head e-mailed me back telling aprox "we are a federal gov. site so our material is in the public domain, we appreciate, though, that credit is given"...so, i put the article back, with a link to the website saying it was from them. That opens lots of new oportunities. <a href="../../../a/n/_/AN_d968.html" title="AN">AN</a></p>
<p>I recently researched this for a presentation I was giving, and got the following info/pages. NASA images are not quite public domain, but are free for use with only a credit to NASA. Check out <a href="http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/" class="external autonumber" title="http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> for their image server, and <a href="http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/copyright.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/copyright.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> for the copyright info. -- <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZandperl_547d.html" title="User:Zandperl">zandperl</a> 04:40, 25 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I really hate what they did to this page. From a page that actually contained some information, it became a list of links. Don't anybody thinks the same!</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. The recent changes suck. AstroNomer, you know this page better than me. Would you like to revert? -- <a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECYD_b425.html" title="User:CYD">CYD</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I tend to agree also - I think it had a lot of useful info before which has now disappeared. Judging from Lir's comments at the bottom of <a href="../../../m/a/i/Talk%7EMain_Page_649b.html" title="Talk:Main Page">Talk:Main Page</a>, she thinks this is a great improvement. I can see what she's getting at: there is, I think, some value in a plain list of links on a particular complex subject - an index page, if you like - but I'd rather it was on a separate page, like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_astronomy_topics.html" title="List of astronomy topics">List of astronomy topics</a> or something. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Has this information actually disappeared? My understanding is that it is all enclosed behind the appropriate links. Now if you want...we could have an explanation of positional astronomy and an explanation of radio telescopes etc. etc. but that isn't going to be very useful to the reader. If the reader wants to read that explanation, they want to go to the full page, not get a brief synposis of it.</p>
<p>Not that no information should be presented here, Id like to see more information here, but a discussion of what is already on another page is pointless. <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lir</a> 16:17 Nov 3, 2002 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure it would be <i>entirely</i> pointless to have some duplication here. I agree that the page shouldn't go into too much depth, but I think a brief overview of all the main areas (and some of the minor areas also) is useful, with a more in depth treatment on the individual pages. I also think that in some cases, it is useful to have a brief note next to links; it probably isn't obvious to an average reader what <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precession.html" title="Precession">precession</a> is, for instance, and a note would give them the briefest possible explanation of it, so they know whether they want to read more. People who know what it means are probably going to use the search function anyway. That said, this isn't a subject I know much about, so I'll let those who know more get on with it.--<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't know if a brief cliff's note describing precession would be of any use to the reader either. The physics page doesn't have that sort of format. Ie</p>
<p>Astronomy</p>
<p>Bla blah blah</p>
<p>Position astronomy-astronomy observing positions of the stars blah blah Radio astronomy- astronomy using big radio waves blah blah blah X-Ray astronomy- astronomy using X-Rays blah blah blah Planetology-a study of planets blah blah blah</p>
<p><a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lir</a> 16:55 Nov 4, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree. The page is now <i>merely</i> a laundry list of links to other pages, whereas before it was actually a readable <b>article</b>! Imagine you know nothing about astronomy. Reading through the article, you see a bunch of links with incomprehensible names. Why should you click on any of them? Which should you click on? It's unusable.</p>
<p>It IS still a <b>readable article</b>. There are several paragraphs at the top. Imagine you know nothing about astronomy...where to start? I advise you make Astronomy for Beginners. This page did not serve the function you suggest before it was edited to this format. Such a page would probably refer the reader to <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_Astronomy_0c33.html" title="Amateur Astronomy">Amateur Astronomy</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/s/Positional_astronomy.html" title="Positional astronomy">positional astronomy</a>.</p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with duplicating information. Ideally, we want a short discussion of each important topic in the astronomy article, with the topic examined in greater depth in the full page. See, for example, the <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">Physics</a> article, which contains a short history of physics with a more detailed history in the works in a separate page. It isn't perfect, but I think it's more motivating than a laundry list.</p>
<p>Lir, could you please put the removed information back on this page? -- <a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECYD_b425.html" title="User:CYD">CYD</a></p>
<p>The only difference I can see between this and the physics page is that we have moved the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_astronomy.html" title="History of astronomy">history of astronomy</a> to it's own page. You say you want a brief discussion of each "important topic" but what is important? What good will it do to cut and paste the first paragraph from each subject page onto this page? <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lir</a> 16:50 Nov 4, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>well, maybe not the first paragraph, but bare lists are not terribly good content. -- <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarquin_cdb6.html" title="User:Tarquin">Tarquin</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>i restored some but it looks <b>way</b> messy to me. The list without comment is much more useful. <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lir</a> 17:19 Nov 4, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I have changed the article to a form that is closer to its former self. In particular</p>
<ul>
<li>I put back the explanation of the different subfields of study</li>
<li>I eliminated the list of isolated topics, after verifying they are listed in "list of astronomy topics".</li>
<li>I put back the short history. It is my belief that a short story of the subject is adequate in this page, and a long history deserves its own article. I consider this to be subject to discussion.--<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstroNomer_6120.html" title="User:AstroNomer">AN</a> 01:58 Nov 6, 2002 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your revert erased subfields. <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lir</a> 15:40 Nov 6, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your brief history was pointless. It's all in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_astronomy.html" title="History of astronomy">history of astronomy</a> and it is meaningless to those who know nothing and redundant to those who do know the history. I believe the only question here is whether there should be a paragraph explaining the difference between <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_astronomy.html" title="Radio astronomy">radio astronomy</a> and <a href="../../../x/-/r/X-Ray_astronomy_f75a.html" title="X-Ray astronomy">X-Ray astronomy</a> and <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optical_astronomy.html" title="Optical astronomy">optical astronomy</a>. I see no reason for such madness. If somebody wants to read about <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optical_astronomy.html" title="Optical astronomy">optical astronomy</a> they can click on the link. That's what it is there for.</p>
<p>I mean</p>
<p>Infrared astronomy deals with using infrared radiation</p>
<p>is about as pointless as</p>
<p>Radio astronomy deals with using radio telescopes</p>

<hr />
<p>Once again the revert is losing a lot of data by going back so far and since it doesnt add anything that isnt on another page... rerevert <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lir</a> 22:00 Nov 6, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<p>It was you modifications that lost a lot of information. And the previous edit back was not a simple revert, but I tried to incorporate several of the changes you had made. You, instead, simply put back your last copy, that doesn't read like an article, and misses information.--<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstroNomer_6120.html" title="User:AstroNomer">AN</a></p>
<p>Now look. As the page says, Astronomy is a big topic. Thus, Astronomy needs some disambiguation. Go look at a disambiguation page-see how they have a big list that is clearly visible? You have all this history of astronomy stuff clogging the top of the page-there is a page for <b>history of astronomy</b> its all there. <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lir</a> 22:49 Nov 6, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No one is disputing that all of astronomy cannot fit onto one page, but it does not follow that the astronomy article should be little more than a list of topics. People click on a link to "astronomy" expecting to see a cohesive and articulate article on astronomy, so there is nothing wrong with having a brief history of astronomy on this page - just as there is nothing wrong with having a list of links of further topics co-existing with it. -- <a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECYD_b425.html" title="User:CYD">CYD</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>I am not disputing that information should not be on this page, I am only disputing the type and location of it. To be honest, I really don't care what you put below the links-but those links need to be high up on the page so they are easily used by someone. <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lir</a> 23:51 Nov 6, 2002 (UTC)</p>

<p>In drafting the original section differentiating astronomy and astrology, I deliberately avoided calling astrology a <b>pseudoscience</b> in an attempt to maintain the NPOV. Calling it a pseudoscience (although of course I believe it is, at best) is kind of a slap in the face, and that's not neutral. What's the consensus? Should this be reworded? If we call it a pseudoscience here, what's to keep someone from using loaded language on the astrology page to denigrate astronomy?</p>
<p>That said, I'll be content to abide with whatever the consensus on this is. Tally ho! <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStormwriter_5c54.html" title="User:Stormwriter">Stormwriter</a></p>
<p>Do astrologists claim that its a science? Yes, I guess they do...</p>
<p>The study of the positions and aspects of celestial bodies in the belief that they have an influence on the course of natural earthly occurrences and human affairs.</p>
<p>I would word it that astrologers argue that they are conducting science BUT the key tenent of the scientific process is that a scientific hypothesis leads to predictions which can be proven as correct. This argument is ignored on most "astrology IS a science" websites. So the question then is, "Do any astrologers have any predictions that we can test for validity?" and wait to see if anyone offers up a prediction. <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lir</a> 04:41 Nov 7, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sure Astrologers have made and do make testable predictions, and they often then attempt to test them, they've tried biographical studies etc. Heck some astrological predictions are verifiable and intertranslatable with predictions in other fields, Farmer's almanacs often phrase predictions about harvest times in astrological terms for instance. And the whole notion of <i>the key tenet of the scientific process</i> is a thornier issue mired in POV, see <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_method.html" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a> <a href="../../../b/m/o/User%7EBmorton3_53a2.html" title="User:Bmorton3">Bmorton3</a> 21:20, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

You could word it "mainstream/academic scientists call astrology a science." I would also take care to mention in the history section that astronomy and astrology were once the same field of study. -- <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZandperl_547d.html" title="User:Zandperl">zandperl</a> 02:28, 28 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Definition of "Astronomy" using etymology</span></h2>
<p>It would be best not to give the etymological derivation of "astronomy" because etymology is often unhelpful. "Meteorology" for instance means literally "the study of meteors". This is because the ancient Greeks thought meteors were portents of storms etc, and so could be used to predict weather. "Meteorology" today just means the study of all aspects of weather. Similarly "astronomy" does not refer to the study of stars, but of all objects and phenomena to be seen (or even NOT seen!) in the heavens. So I'd omit the etymology and go straight to a modern definition of "astronomy".</p>

<p><strike>Rmhermen</strike>ChrisO, let me start by saying I think you did some good work on the astronomy page trying to observe NPOV while inserting relevant detail. But can we please remove the word "scientists"? <b>I feel</b> astrology is considered by everyone as a pseudoscience (reference to their lack of scientific method pretty much seals the case). One thing to keep in mind is this is about astronomy, not a rebuttal of astrology, honestly I think pointing out that contemporary astrologers (do we really know about the ancient past?) do not follow the scientific method is enough, saying this makes it a pseudoscience is redundant and hinting that this belief is shared by elitist "scientists" while the rest of us fall for that bunk is kind of insulting to me (and might be to other casual readers). - <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlautus_satire_98f1.html" title="User:Plautus satire">Plautus satire</a> 16:37, 26 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I feel there is plenty of evidence that astrologers in the past did attempt to follow the scientific method as it was understood then, further some astrologers in the present do attempt to follow the scientific method as they understand it. For every "astrologers don't follow the scientific method" cite you can come up with I can come up with an astrologer claiming to follow the scientific method, and a philosopher arguing about exactly what the scientific method is. The <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">astrology</a> page has a reference for an astrologer claiming to follow the scientific method. I suspect there is a near consensus among astronomers that astrology does not follow the scientific method, but that doesn't make it NPOV. <a href="../../../b/m/o/User%7EBmorton3_53a2.html" title="User:Bmorton3">Bmorton3</a> 21:20, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Totally agree. As someone a lot more interested in astronomy than astrology, I think it is important to remember that, though astrology may, in today's Occident, have been turned into a big joke or make-money-quick scheme, it was traditionally considered a serious attempt at science (regardless of its accuracy or lack thereof). <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeblakesley_e5fc.html" title="User:Joeblakesley">Joe Llywelyn Griffith Blakesley</a> <a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeblakesley_9cc6.html" title="User talk:Joeblakesley"><sub>talk</sub></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_joeblakesley_3961.html" title="Special:Contributions/joeblakesley"><sub>contrib</sub></a> 00:50, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From my experience, the content of that paragraph is true. In the Western world today, astronomy and astrophysics are mostly synonymous, and students are encouraged to learn theory (astrophysics) as well as observation techniques (astrometry). Within the modern astronomy/astrophysics community, I have definitely observed a rivalry between those specializing in theory and observation. However, in less industrialized countries they are sometimes different departments, or different concentrations within one department, with the highest astronomy degree being a <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master%27s.html" title="Master's">Master's</a> (or equivalent), and the highest in astrophyiscs being <a href="../../../p/h/d/PhD_8f5b.html" title="PhD">PhD</a>.

<p>No, astrometry and celestial mechanics are different. Astrometry was about accurately mapping the positions of the "fixed" stars and recording the motions of the planets. It was most of what early astronomers did, including the ancient Greeks, long before Kepler and Newton. It still lives on with the <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hipparcos.html" title="Hipparcos">Hipparcos</a> satellite. Celestial mechanics is about calculating orbital elements for planets and such and predicting their future positions, calculating perturbations, etc.</p>
<p>I have seen this traditional division of astronomy into astrometry, celestial mechanics and astrophysics mentioned before in other sources. Today, of course, it has much less significance since photography and CCDs have automated the mapping of positions and computers have automated calculating orbits, and much of the science of astronomy is astrophysics. <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 01:13, 6 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I do think having a discussion of this breakdown is useful, but I disagree with its placement as paragraphs 2 and 3 in the introduction section.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Astrology</span></h2>
<p>A preëmptive note here, which I&#160;hope will head off a lot of pointless squabbling. Astrology properly wouldn't belong on this page at all, were it not for the facts that (a)&#160;astronomy and astrology share some common history; (b)&#160;a lot of people do confuse astrology with astronomy. It would be sufficient, I&#160;think, merely to mark, as has been done, the shared history and that they should not be confused, sending people who land here by accident off to the article they're looking for: no need to give astrology undue prominence. Therefore I've toned down the POV attack on astrology, which doesn't belong here at all: it's enough to state, as has been done quite properly, that the two disciplines differ in method, and to link astronomy to <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_method.html" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a>; links to <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a> are just inflammatory. People interested in astronomy by and large couldn't care less about astrology, and the great majority of people interested in astrology are blind partisans of it, and "<a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a>", an intrinsically POV article, is just waving a red rag in front of a bull.... — <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 13:27, 27 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Someone reverted "<a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a>". First, it's an inherently POV statement: very few of us would call Islam a pseudo-religion, or rock music a pseudo-art. But more to the point in the article Astronomy, there's no need to drag more astrology in here than necessary. It is amply stated, quite correctly, that astronomy is a science, and that astrology is something different. This article is about astronomy, not astrology. It should not be up to the article <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronomy.html" title="Astronomy">Astronomy</a> to define or judge the merits of astrology: that should be done in the article <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">Astrology</a>. Much of what goes on in that article — listing of curious claims, famous people purported to have practiced it (who did not) — merely reflects the insecurity of certain proponents of astrology; similarly, vengeful pursuing of astrology in an article on astronomy has a flavor of insecurity about it too. Why should astronomers care whether astrology is a science, an art, a pseudoscience, or a religion? If you care about this, do it on the article <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">Astrology</a>. — <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 00:09, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Describing astrology/astromancy as a pseudoscience is factual, not inflammatory. Stating that «&#160;astrologers do not [embrace the scientific method]&#160;» is nearly synonymous with labeling it as a pseudoscience, so why should it be considered "more neutral"? Use of the term pseudoscience is not subjective (i.e. a POV matter): the pseudoscience article's "Classifying pseudoscience" section gives the criteria that must be met for a discipline to be recognised as pseudoscience —these are all objective. Still, relegating the debate to the Astrology page is indeed the way to go.&#160;:-)</dd>

<dd>Describing astrology as <i>not embracing the scientific method</i> is partisan and POV. Some astrologers do, some don't. Nor is it clear that Astrology fits the <i>objective criteria</i> of the term pseudoscience, after all criterion #1 is "has presented itself as scientific" and again its pretty clear that astrology is internally conflicted on whether it presents itself as scientific or not. Put these fights on the <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">astrology</a> page, not the astronomy page. If I phrased it "Although the two feilds share a common origin, most people on both sides now consider them to be distinct fields.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Function of space telescopes</span></h2>
<p>The article currently contains this sentence:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Space telescopes are also used to eliminate noise (electromagnetic interference) from the atmosphere.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>To the best of my knowledge this is usually not true, but before I go change it I'd like to give others a chance to explain what I'm missing. To my understanding, space telescopes are used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>avoid atmospheric opacity at certain wavelengths</li>
<li>avoid atmospheric emission at certain wavelengths</li>
<li>avoid the effects of <a href="../../../s/e/e/Seeing_disk.html" title="Seeing disk">astronomical seeing</a> in the optical band</li>
</ul>
<p>The quoted sentence occurs in a discussion of infrared telescopes. If thermal infrared is meant, then I reckon the statement is true; see <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spitzer_Space_Telescope_a96d.html" title="Spitzer Space Telescope">Spitzer Space Telescope</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/a/IRAS_6da0.html" title="IRAS">IRAS</a> for examples of instruments that do not suffer from atmospheric thermal emission (which I suppose is a form of EMI in this context) as a result of being space-borne. However there is also the near infrared, a band in which the <a href="../../../h/u/b/Hubble_Space_Telescope_566f.html" title="Hubble Space Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> is active, and being spaced-based in this band has nothing to do with avoiding EMI since there are plenty of ground-based near-IR astronomical instruments.</p>
<p>So my question is: Is this just a matter of not distinguishing between near-infrared and thermal-infrared applications? Or is the statement meant to apply to all space telescopes working in either infrared band? In either case, I think the statement needs to be clarified. Look forward to hearing your thoughts about this. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffmedkeff_1c62.html" title="User:Jeffmedkeff">Jeff Medkeff</a> | <a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffmedkeff_7798.html" title="User talk:Jeffmedkeff">Talk</a> 08:44, Jan 27, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, there is a content dispute at <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodological_naturalism.html" title="Methodological naturalism">Methodological naturalism</a> that I've filed an article RFC for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Methodological_naturalism#Article_RFC:_does_the_scientific_method_use_supernatural_methodologies" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Methodological_naturalism#Article_RFC:_does_the_scientific_method_use_supernatural_methodologies" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>The original question is whether or not the scientific method is a natural method or a supernatural method of scientific investigation. One editor (Markus Schmaus) refuses to allow the scientific method be listed as a natural method unless a link can be provided to support the claim. I assume he is a proponent of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_Design_39cd.html" title="Intelligent Design">Intelligent Design</a> which pushes the view that ID is "scientific" even though it investigates supernatural causes such as how God must have creaeted life on earth. I assume it is this POV that is getting pushed, and Schmaus will not allow the scientific method be listed as an example of MN because then ID would not fit in the scientific method.</p>

<p>In an attempt to resolve the dispute until some sort of consensus was reached, I removed the mention of the Scientific Method as an example of methodolgical naturalism and instead inserted "astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, and physics" are examples of methodological naturalism. Schmaus is now disputing that these are examples of MN and insists on a URL to prove that they are natural methods rather than supernatural methods of scientific investigation.</p>
<p>Since <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodological_naturalism.html" title="Methodological naturalism">methodological naturalism</a> is a minor article with only a few editors, the dispute has remained unresolved for lack of any sort of consensus.

<dd>I disagree, super-nature refers to phenomena beyond the realm of "nature" (whatever that means) whether they are measurable or not, or measurable in ordinary ways or not. So this doesn't settle the fights on the scientific method, again see the extensive work at <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_method.html" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a>. For that matter numbers and geometeric forms have been considered outstanding examples of supernatural entities in some time periods, and the modern scientific method relies rather heavily on them.
