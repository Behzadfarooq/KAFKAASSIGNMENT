<p>Since your name has been dragged into this (not by me), it seems only fair to ask if you would like to comment on this; and you have a pretty good idea of the background. As you and I are not exactly bosum buddies, you may be able to apply a more objective perspective to this ugly situation:</p>

<li>I am not keen on being quoted there, as I have never called for you to be banned or blocked. The quote is taken out of context. It also seems that the topic has diverted off the 3RR breach that was reported. It is unfortuante that some users are hijacking the 3RR process to attack you though- and the other users who have responded to this trolling should really know better. I am also experiencing problems with an abusive editor (also with his own proven sockpuppet)- and have a false 3RR report against me just below your one. I would advise to not respond to the baiting on that page and hope that admin action is taken the Orcadian IPs- such an IP posted on here a while ago to rant- but he/she/they did not seem to take my advice. Although we have had editing differences in the past (and probably will do again no doubt!), I am not willing to be part of any vendetta. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 18:12, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thank you. I have noticed that our encounters have been more constructive of late.</dd>
<dd>It is all pretty academic now, as that IP address has been blocked anyway; although it is typical of the pattern that within an hour he just switches to a new IP address, to comment at the 3RR!?! Ah, the rich irony...</dd>
<dd>I'll eat my hat if we see any timely, constructive Admin action out of this frankly surreal farce. I am not aware of any similar tolerance of rampant IP abuse anywhere else on Wikipedia.

<dd>Actually, I've blocked Astrotrain 48 hours for this. Astrotrain, if you wish to continue editing here, you're going to have to start following Wikipedia's policies a lot more closely than you have been. Incidentally, this is your fourth block, which is why I went for 48h instead of 24h. I'm hoping that you take this time to cool down, and that when you return, you mind <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> as well as <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a>. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 05:08, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think Astrotrain will be surprised by this block which was IMHO an excessive unexpected response without warning. The warning WAS appropriate. The way I read it, Astrotrain was trying to reduce the temperature which was being raise by the persistent boring relentlessness of another editor. I think the block should be revoked. - <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittybrewster_2ff5.html" title="User:Kittybrewster">Kittybrewster</a> 10:10, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Blocks are preventative, not punative. The purpose of a block is not to punish you for using an inappropriate edit summary or engaging in incivil behavior, but to correct the issue. If you are asking that a preventative block be removed, then I would think there would at least need to be some recognition that your edit summary was wrong and a willingness to discuss the issue rather than to declare that those with whom you disagree are vandals. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 14:11, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Removal of referenced material to suit an agenda is vandalism in my opinion. If trolling and harrassment are to be tolerated in this case then I am not going to bother. It is a shame that good editors are being hounded off Wikipedia by POV vandals and their admin allies. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 14:23, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Its pathetic the way Darcy and Tyrenius are behaving. They should really be stripped of their admin status for the mess they are creating.

<dd>I came here because I was going through <a href="../../../r/e/q/Category%7ERequests_for_unblock_4c8c.html" title="Category:Requests for unblock">Category:Requests for unblock</a>. I have no interest in the matter and, that I can recall, have never edited any article on this subject, nor interacted with any of those involved in this issue. I took a look at the diffs provided and upheld the block. Regardless of motivation, calling someone a vandal who is editing in good faith - even if you believe them to be in error - is not being civil. It is important to discuss contentious issues on the talk page, rather than reverting and holding the discussion in edit summaries. If there is an issue that is not going to be resolved, you can make a request on <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFP_c43d.html" title="WP:RFP">WP:RFP</a> for the page to be protected in order that discussion may be facilitated. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 19:36, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There has been no reason given for the block- archiving talk pages is within my discretion and I am not obliged to respond to trolling and harrasment by a user with a history of vandalism and sockpuppet actions. Darcy only blocked me because he has been harrassing me for weeks, supported by Tyrenius, and couldn't wait for the chance. Blocking me for 48 hours is a complete disgrace.

<p>You seem to be having some trouble with our policy on bios of living people. The policy states that all claims regarding living people (with particular attention to contentious or controversial claims) must be properly sourced. It does not require that those sources be available online, although I think given the choice of two sources we'd take the online one over the other, all else being equal. If you encounter a dead link that has other relevant information on the source as it appeared in print, the best course of action is to de-link the text and add a note on the talk page that the link was dead on such-and-such date. Let me know if you have any questions. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 23:18, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Understood; thanks for the feedback. Have tried to enhance center-alignment as described in recent edit summary (and move template's apparent center-of-gravity nearer to its vertical center).

<p>I have seen your citation of Vintagekits about British people making his skin crawl, and Scottish monarchists, which must breach just about every Wikipedia convention. My suggestion is that you lift that paragraph and place it on the Administrator's Noticeboard. It is clear from other things he so often says that these comments are sincerely held by him.

<dd>It is a very unfortunate remark to make- it is clearly offensive to all British editors on Wikipedia. I placed it on Tyrenius' talk page for him to review first- he has warned him in the past for offensive remarks and NPA violations and I thought it more appropiate to raise here.

<dd>OK. That's just saying he doesn't like the term in relation to Celtic. It may or may not relate to his feelings about British people, but you can't get that information from that sentence.

<p>You may not be insulted by this business, and poo poo it, but I am prepared to take it much further if necessary. What he said, exactly, is this: <b>"Aside from the fact that term British actually makes my skin crawl"</b>. Whateve context you may think he was using such a statement does not excuse the severity of it. The man clearly has a serious chip on his shoulder against the British. It and other remarks he has made about monarchists and the aristocracy questions his ability to be a constructive and unbiased editor who others feel they can work with. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Lauder_8521.html" title="User:David Lauder">David Lauder</a> 23:46, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, he's from either northern Ireland or Rep. Ireland; the relationship with "British" is not one of one people versus another, but of a person rejecting a term of identity. He's perfectly entitled to do that without being labled "racist"; I've heard, for instance, lots of Scots express revulsion at the concept of "Britishness", and it's never occurred to me that this might be racism. Identities are sensitive matters, and people will react if you try to impose one on them they don't want. <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalgacus_321f.html" title="User talk:Calgacus">ÎšÎ‘Î›Î“Î‘ÎšÎŸÎ£</a></i>)</b> 00:32, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Astrotrain, the Monument is surrounded on all sides by very narrow single lane streets and high buildings, it is impossible to get a brighter picture of the entire monument, as the street is in shadow all the time.--<a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPadraig3uk_dbac.html" title="User:Padraig3uk">padraig3uk</a> 19:06, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I am not about to violate it. Padraig refuses to discuss on the talk page. He inserted the images in question in the middle of a debate on the flags in an attempt to delete them from the infobox without consensus. As there is no consensus to remove the flags from the infobox, they should not be in the history section. Padraig should read <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>.
<ul>
<li>Technically, you are. Last I checked, there were not exceptions in <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> for cases stated above. If there are, please feel free to point them out to me. Thanks. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 12:59, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I am not about to violate it- I would only violate it if I posted 4 reverts, which I havn't and am not going to. Saying "you are about to" makes a presumption that I was going to keep reverting. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 13:07, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>No, it is meant as a friendly warning. Perhaps, edits were in good faith and a user is unaware of the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. Should the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> be violated, if the user has not been warned, many admin may not block said users. It is the proper procedure, when in a possible edit war and the third reversion has been reached. It is nothing personal, I am sure. There is actually a template for said warning (although I dont know its name of the top of my head). <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 13:30, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
