<p>I have re-opened the issue of the royal stub at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Stub_sorting/Criteria#.7B.7Broyal-stub.7D.7D" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Stub_sorting/Criteria#.7B.7Broyal-stub.7D.7D" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. I think having it produce a <i>noble</i> link is farcical. Those who did it originally were no doubt well meaning but I don't think they really understood what they were doing. Nobility and royalty are not the same. Your opinions would be welcomed.</p>

<p>You might want to keep an eye on User:71.36.220.38. He or she has attempted to remove the Princess of Wales template from Princesses of Wales and insert that damn succession box again. Hell, I've spent all of tonight just dealing with vandalism to royal articles. I've barely been able to do any real work.

<p>That is very aggressive behaviour. You know that the issue of putting the Commonwealth Realms template on the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> page has already been discussed on the talk page, so why would you arbitrarily put it back up their without consulting other editors by re-opening the discussion on the talk page? Are you trying to incite a revert war? Especially after you repeatedly reverted changes to another template on that page that were supported by three other editors while you were the only one opposed to them. Revert wars are a waste of everyone's time, and will lead to action being taken against you. Please review the guidelines on wikipedia etiqutte, and particularly the page on <a href="../../../r/e/v/Wikipedia%7ERevert_war_0c13.html" title="Wikipedia:Revert war">revert wars</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 19:18, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>(Removed from my user page)</p>
<p>Thanks for your comments. Of course edit wars can only occur if TWO people are reverting. So that includes you. Stop telling people what they can and can't do. I don't need to discuss on a talk page before I edit an article. You have already started edited wars against other editors for adding templates to the Canada page, which you seem to treat as your own personal page. Wikipedia is free to edit for a reason. And I am not adding false or contestable information here, so your reversions are just being childish and selfish. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 19:23, July 15, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please do not edit my user page. if you want to leave a message for me, you can do so on my talk page like everybody else. Thank you.</p>
<p>I have removed templates from the Canada page before, and have always posted my reasons for doing so on the article's talk page. Issues such as these should be resolved there, and not through revert wars. You and a couple of other editors keep posted templates without providing explanations, and that's when we get into a revert war. I am not the only one who thinks that the Canada page should not be junked up with a bunch of cluttery templates, and you know that, so don't try to turn this into a personal thing. The Talk page and the edit history make it clear that I am not acting alone. I am also aware of the long-running dispute that you had with <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">User:SimonP</a> over the Commmonwealth template.</p>
<p>Of course Wikipedia is free to edit. The policy on revert wars is there to stop people from wasting time on storage space on futile exercises like revert wars. Again, that is why these things should be discussed. If you feel you are free to edit however you want, then you will have to expect that other people will just revert your edits. If that's the way you want it, then that is the way it will be. I think there is a better way, and that is resolving it on the Talk page.</p>
<p>The edit history of the Canada page shows clearly that it gets a lot of traffic from a lot of editors, including a lot of regular editors. That is proff that I do not "treat [it] as your own personal page". Please withdraw that remark. As you are aware, Wikipedia policy prohibits <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>. Also for "your reversions are just being childish and selfish." Out of respect for other editors, I have taken the time to explain why I have made the changes. I wish you would do the same. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 19:38, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I note that over the weekend you made the same edits to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> twice, and to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Template%7ECanada_811e.html" title="Template:Canada">Template:Canada</a> once. In neither case did you provide any argument on the respective talk pages to convince other editors why your edits should be accepted. This, as I have pointed out, is contrary to Wikipedia policies and guidelines. (This is not just me telling you what to do.) I encourage you for everyone's benefit -- and yours -- to review the Wikipedia articles on revert wars, editing etiquette and so on.

<p>This flag comes from Graham Bartram's site. He does not allow commercial usage of his work. From his site, "Flag Drawings Â© Graham Bartram, portions Â© The Flag Institute &amp; Mario Fabretto". You have uploaded a great deal of his material before and I believe I have asked you not do to so. If I have not please consider this a request to stop doing it. You are violating his copyright over the images by uploading them, as well as possibly the copyrights of the Flag Institute and Mario Fabretto. If you want a flag of that type, I would suggest you draw it yourself if at all possible. That's what I've done with things like the White Ensign and the RAF Ensign. It is perfectly possible to do things like that in a vector graphics program. I also know for a fact that there is a copyright-free vector version of the Canadian maple leaf out there on the internet at the Sodipoli clip art archive, so that isn't a problem. Once you've got the vector version export a bitmap. After that's done you then have a copyright OK file. It takes a bit of work, but it can be done. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Newton_8a3b.html" title="User:David Newton">David Newton</a> 18:57, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem is that Wikipedia images uploaded now MUST allow commercial usage if they are to be licensed. Otherwise the rather risky ground of fair use must be entered into. That's been the case for getting on for a year now. That's why I put it up as a copyvio, and that's why you should stop using the images.

<p>Given the endless debate/rows etc over styles I've been thinking as to what is the best way to come up with a consensus solution. Styles <i>have</i> to be in an article, but using them upfront is, I think, a mistake and highly controversial. I've designed a series of templates which I think might solve the problem. There are specific templates for UK monarchs, Austrian monarchs, popes, presidents, Scottish monarchs and HRHs. (I've protected them all, temporarily, because I want people to discuss them <i>in principle</i> rather than battle over content and design right now.) I've used a purple banner because it is a suitable royal colour and is also distinctive. They are eyecatching enough to keep some of the pro-styles people happy; one of their fears seemed to be that styles would be buried. But by not being used they are neutral enough to be factual without appearing to be promotional. I'd very much like your views. I'm going to put them on a couple of user pages and ask for a reaction. There needs to be a calm debate on them this time. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÃIREANN</b></i></font></font></a><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Ireland coa.png">Image:Ireland coa.png</a>\<sup><font color="blue"><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(caint)</a> 02:49, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</font></sup></p>

<p>As I said in the Talk page I had removed the section <i>for now</i> - meaning I sat it to the side to open a debate on it. Perhaps I should have have opened the debate on it first rather than remove it, as I still believe it rather irrelevant for the article. And at that it was poorly written with only a small amount of trivial detail rather than a full explanation of what the situation was (sympathy walk out rather than BA dispute). That's neither here nor there, however, as it could and was easliy brought back and I'm happy if that's what everyone else thinks. But must you be so aggressive in your tone?? I was simply setting out my point of view, using language where I could to state what I <i>thought</i> rather than being dictatorial. However, your spiel is entirely dictatorial and stomps over any personal point of view with "this is right and that's final", with a good dose of firm language. I don't care for being talked to like a school pupil, so please don't do so in future. --<a href="../../../a/y/r/User%7EAyrshire--77_4323.html" title="User:Ayrshire--77">Ayrshire--77</a> 07:50, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am curious: on <a href="../../../c/a/n/Template%7ECanada_811e.html" title="Template:Canada">Template:Canada</a>, you have put the provincial flags back on the template, even though in the discussion, ten editors stated their opposition to the flags, and only you were in favour.

<p>I noticed your decision to revert the template back to the flag format, but to be honest I can't agree with you on the choice. I changed the design from the flags to the emblems after seeing your Military of New Zealand template (which looked a lot nicer), and after I realised the flags themselves (especially the SA Army flag) did not quite render nicely at such small scales. It is mostly because of this that I'm curious as to your statement that the flags are clearer - to me the emblem format seems both clearer and more asthetic. In any case, I have modified it slightly to replace the SA Navy flag with an emblem in the same style as the others. Please tell me what you think, and what specific problems you have with this format. <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpi_7672.html" title="User:Impi">Impi</a> 14:50, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Great! Glad we could reach agreement. I agree that it didn't quite look that great with the mix, and I'm actually slightly embarrassed at the fact that I initially forgot about the SA Navy emblem (despite being the person who uploaded it). Nice work on creating the template in the first place, btw. <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpi_7672.html" title="User:Impi">Impi</a> 14:59, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can you make out how these duplicate articles came to be in existence. I found the former at <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28German_Empress%29_d5ff.html" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom (German Empress)">Victoria of the United Kingdom (German Empress)</a> which was clearly wrong, so I restored it to a page where it appeared to have come from, pending discussion. However, on further investigation I saw that the latter article also seems to have been at the former title at some stage, and again to have been moved without any consensus. Furthermore, when I moved the article back, the talk page that had alerted me to the problem did not move to <a href="../../../p/r/i/Talk%7EPrincess_Victoria%2C_Princess_Royal_5cd5.html" title="Talk:Princess Victoria, Princess Royal">Talk:Princess Victoria, Princess Royal</a> as it should have done.

<dd>Thank you for your comments on my talk page. As you can probably guess, I disagree with your assessment. The amount of time I have been an admin is not particularly germane. The issue at hand was your constant and aggressive reversion of the image of the coat of arms. The fact that you sprinkled some other edits in with that revert is completely immaterial. Please review <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>, and note that it contains no exceptions for "but I was right" or "but my changes were very high quality."

<dd>The fact that you believe I abused my admin powers in blocking you for your violation of <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> is noted. I publically announced the fact that I blocked you on <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_3RR_dc8f.html#User:Astrotrain" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR#User:Astrotrain</a>. So far, no one there has questioned my interpretation. <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> says:
<blockquote>
<p>Note that historically, public denunciation of the blocking admin has tended not to gain sympathy. You can, however, report cases of egregious misapplication of this rule to Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR; for more serious cases, to the "use of administrator privileges" section in Wikipedia:Requests for comment.</p>
</blockquote>
Feel free to avail yourself of these remedies if you believe that my reading of your edits as violating the three revert rule was an abuse of admin powers. Good day, <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 15:54, 19 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Good day indeed. LMFAO. You got nuked by the BFH #2 Nandenuker. LMFAO, she tries to sound so polite with weasely departures, but is in fact one of the most caustic, arrogant and rude admins around. The newly found powers have clearly taken hold of her behaviour.

<p>I moved the Electress Sophia information to 'History of British nationality law' and to the section on 'other categories of British nationality' in the main British nationality law page.

<li>Great minds indeed! Well one of the two images needs to get deleted. Sorry, but yours will have to get deleted! Before reciving your message I had already added my image to two other articles, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Heraldic_Authority_f96f.html" title="Canadian Heraldic Authority">Canadian Heraldic Authority</a>, and <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor_General_of_Canada_3270.html" title="Governor General of Canada">Governor General of Canada</a>, so It would take time to replace and why bother?. To make things simpler I also replaced your image with mine on the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micha%C3%ABlle_Jean_5dae.html" title="MichaÃ«lle Jean">MichaÃ«lle Jean</a> page. So now my image links to three pages, while your image doesen't link anywhere.

<dd>Hi. A Toronto-based magazine asked about using one of the images you posted (Fort Belvedere). I responded to them that it is a copyrighted image, which we are using as fair use, and they asked if we could provide them with the source, so that they can contact the copyright owner and include it in its publication. Please let me know if you have that information. Thanks. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> 21:55, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Fort Belvedere.jpg</b>. I notice the image page currently doesn't specify who created the image, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is therefore unclear. If you have not created the image yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the image on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the image yourself then you should also specify where you found it, ie in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the image also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture then you can use {{gfdl}} to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you can claim <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a> use {{fairuse}}.)

<dd>I'm sorry we both feel differently on this issue, but if your main reason is because you want to stick with peerage and succession boxes only, then I suggest you moot through the hundreds of other peers who held governmental and parliamentary offices that are shown by way of the succession box and remove those as well. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraigy144_38a9.html" title="User:Craigy144">Craigy</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/15px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="15" height="8" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> (<a href="../../../c/r/a/User_talk%7ECraigy144_080f.html" title="User talk:Craigy144">talk</a>) 09:37, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Stop Changing it</b>, what you have said about it being in order of precedence not generation is true and untrue. The other Royal templates are also indented, and with one as large as the British one it makes it much easier to read. And in the context as the British one, when it was indented it was still correctly in order of precedence and showed who was descended from who. Please leave it, as I understand what you are saying, but most people who see it will not be as knowlidgeable on the subject as you or I.

The first article deals the nature of myths and legends surrounding royalty. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> is peed off that it dares to touch on his own beloved Jack the Ripper article. So he continually deletes links to the royalty article in the Prince Albert Victor article. He also put a merge link in, which sat there for months and was completely ignored by everyone, much to his annoyance.</p>
<p>I removed the merge notice as it has been there, unheeded by anyone, for months and reinserted the link to <i>both</i> articles. He is going ballistic over it and keeps reinserting his unused merge notice and deleting any mention of the royalty article in pages to do with Albert Victor. As an expert writer on royal affairs I'd welcome your observations.</p>
<p>BTW I agree 100% that deceased consorts should be at maiden name. But every time I have tried to get that through the same group of individuals go beserck over it. I agree too that it is wrong to call Camilla <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camilla%2C_Duchess_of_Cornwall_6bfc.html" title="Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall">Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall</a>. It has bugged me for months, but after the mauling for daring to suggest the use of maiden name (getting Princess Grace to Grace Kelly and the Queen Mum to Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon was enough hassle to be getting on with) dared not propose it. <i>SlÃ¡n</i> <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÃIREANN</a> 20:43, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You wrote "<i>I am not sure of the details of the court case you mention, but I doubt it was about displaying the flag and expect there must be some sort of commerical element involved. The question of copyright over a flag rests on it usage. If this Aboriginal Flag is used as a national flag, and is widely flown in Australia, then it is doubtful that any copyright is enforceable (at least for display purposes). Making a flag subject to copyright defeats the purpose of having a flag.</i>" The court case was not merely about commercial elements, though these certainly come into it (see <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Aboriginal_flag_6c73.html" title="Australian Aboriginal flag">Australian Aboriginal flag</a> for some info and links to court case reports<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/federal_ct/1997/215.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/federal_ct/1997/215.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>). The flag is not used as a national flag, but a specific purpose flag recognised in Australian law. The copyright is enforceable for the design and I understand that only fair use provisions can be applied in having its image on wikipedia. Under wikipedia guidelines, fair use means using the image in the article discussing the image and not elsewhere, specifically not in templates. --<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> 22:23, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
