<p>I would like to know what you think of the new planetary system. Feel free to write whatever you like!<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAsteroidz_R_not_planetz_6f88.html" title="User:Asteroidz R not planetz">Asteroidz R not planetz</a> 21:09, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it is an absoloute, complete waste of time and money. The scientists are just trying to get extra credit for "discovering new planets" when they're only claiming asteroids that they've known about for years are planets! It's an outrage! For instance; they've known about Ceres for over 200 years, as an asteroid. Funny how it suddenly became a planet.<a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELoopyllama_5b4e.html" title="User:Loopyllama">Loopyllama</a> 21:20, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You seem to have a slight misunderstanding of the IAU decision. While Resolution 5A passed, making Ceres, Pluto, etc. "Dwarf Planets", resolution 5B, which would have renamed the other planets "Classical Planets" failed. This means Ceres and the other Dwarf Planets do not count as planets. It's a slightly odd way of naming them, but that's what you get for deciding these things by voting on lots of little resolutions - it's all inconsistent. However, the facts of the matter are that there are 8 planets in this solar system. Ceres is not a planet, Pluto is not a planet, Xena (or whatever they call it these days) is not a planet. Dwarf planets are not a type of planet, they are a completely separate category. (The <a href="../../../d/w/a/Dwarf_planet.html" title="Dwarf planet">Dwarf planet</a> article has a diagram near the bottom explaining this graphically.) --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 22:01, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thankyou for telling me this. It's so much simpler now! Still, scientists are only doing it so they can say they've discovered new planets.

<p>I've moved your comment over here so we can keep everything in one place (I'll get confused otherwise). I'm watching your talk page, so you can just reply here and I'll know. I'd be happy to discuss the matter more with you - I watched the live web feed of the meeting where they had the final votes, so I know quite a bit about what happened. The definition isn't very popular, but I don't think it's really so scientists can claim to have discovered more planets. In fact, it's quite the opposite - before this defintion, every time someone found a new fairly large object out beyond Pluto, the media all started announcing "New Planet Found!!!", now we have a fixed definition of a planet they can't do that. Scientists are now discovering lots of new dwarf planets, but at least now they aren't discovering new planets. If you have any questions about the definition, please ask here and I'll try and find an answer for you. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 22:14, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>2003 UB313 is Xena’s scientific name. The nickname Xena came from the warrior princess played by Lucy Lawless, on television.<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAsteroidz_R_not_planetz_6f88.html" title="User:Asteroidz R not planetz">Asteroidz R not planetz</a> 12:49, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know. People just assume that if there are aliens, they’ll be a more intelligent race than us.<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAsteroidz_R_not_planetz_6f88.html" title="User:Asteroidz R not planetz">Asteroidz R not planetz</a> 12:53, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Probably. People say it’s human nature, but I think aliens will be just the same.<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAsteroidz_R_not_planetz_6f88.html" title="User:Asteroidz R not planetz">Asteroidz R not planetz</a> 13:15, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Aliens don’t exist everyone knows that, we’re alone in this universe so deal with it! There is absolutely no proof that there are aliens out there.<a href="../../../d/i/z/User%7EDizagreeeabal_9faa.html" title="User:Dizagreeeabal">Dizagreeeabal</a> 13:17, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I can’t offer you any proof that aliens exist, but I can say that there is no proof that aliens don’t exist. Plus, there are over a hundred billion galaxies in the known Universe. Each galaxy has over a hundred billion stars in it. Some stars won’t have planets to them because they’ll orbit other stars, but about 8 out of 10 of them will have planets, at least five of them. What are the chances of there not being aliens somewhere?<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAsteroidz_R_not_planetz_6f88.html" title="User:Asteroidz R not planetz">Asteroidz R not planetz</a> 13:19, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, it’s not like we’re ever going to meet any, is it?<a href="../../../d/i/z/User%7EDizagreeeabal_9faa.html" title="User:Dizagreeeabal">Dizagreeeabal</a> 13:19, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No. It looks to me like the human race won’t survive another millennia. Due to global warming, we will have to move planets in the next hundred years. If we don’t the world will flood and only people on mountain tops will survive.<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAsteroidz_R_not_planetz_6f88.html" title="User:Asteroidz R not planetz">Asteroidz R not planetz</a> 13:20, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the reason aliens are often portrayed as more intelligent that us is because for us to meet aliens, either we or they need interstellar travel. We don't have anything even approaching that at the moment, so if the alien race in question does, they must be more intelligent. Or at least more technologically advanced - that's not quiet the same thing as more intelligent.</dd>
<dd>Remember, humans have only been polluting since the industrial revolution, and will probably stop being polluting quite soon (once the fossil fuels run out, we have little choice). So we have maybe 200 years total of polluting, and we've been on this planet about 10,000 years, and will hopefully still be here in another 10,000 years. It's a bit unfair to class our race as polluting when actually it's just at the moment that we're polluting. The use of fossil fuels has increased out development significantly - if an alien race doesn't have, or chooses not to use, fossil fuels, they might develop much slower. Or, they might discover something else that we can't even imagine, and develop faster and be making the same arguments about us.</dd>
<dd>I think it's far more likely that there are aliens out there somewhere than it is that we're alone. We know life is possible, because we're here, so we don't need to come up with any arguments in favour of life existing, because we have observational evidence that it does. For life not to evolve elsewhere, there needs to be an explanation. The best theory to base predictions on is usually the one with the least bits we can't explain it in (see <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occam%27s_razor.html" title="Occam's razor">Occam's razor</a>). --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 13:22, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Tango. Just trying to be organised.</p>
<p>Hi, Tango! I haven't actually been to University yet. I'm much younger than all the other editors here. I'm just hoping to learn a lot, and carry some responsibility. You clearly know a lot more about this sort of thing than I do. When I get a career I want to be an astrophysicist. Are you one?<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAsteroidz_R_not_planetz_6f88.html" title="User:Asteroidz R not planetz">Asteroidz R not planetz</a> 13:42, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>Regarding the "what is a planet" debate, I share some of your concerns about issues regarding the naming conventions – but at the same time, please bear in mind that the names we put on astronomical objects are just human conventions: they aren't the objects themselves, and they aren't the primary focus of study. Mercury or Ceres or Pluto or anything else isn't interesting because of what a group of people vote to call it: they are interesting because of what they are and where they are, in and of themselves. So while I find the name debates fascinating myself, they shouldn't replace the actual astronomy as what you primarily focus on.</p>
<p>And finally, because it looks like no one else has done this yet.</p>
<p>Hi, again. I think I'll not edit much on wikipedia, apart from my own page of course, and just try and remember my password until I'm older and more experienced.

<dd>Yes I was being a bit naughty before, but I don't think I did anything this time. I will stop writing silly things. Thanx for warning me.

<p>The Wikicook book was fine. What was not fine was your making articles, re-directs, and templates which are wordy, inaccurate, and outmoded by previous articles. Also not fine is adding blatant nonsense to articles, which you have done once since setting up your present account. Please review <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_bad_article_ideas_6658.html" title="Wikipedia:List of bad article ideas">Wikipedia:List of bad article ideas</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/y/Wikipedia%7EStyle_6ee5.html" title="Wikipedia:Style">Wikipedia:Style</a>. Note: I have nominated a template you created, Template:Peeerreview, for deletion. You are mis-using the template feature, which is designed to add text to a large number of articles. Also, its title&#160;!= its subject. This may also be considered a repost of deleted content. Final note: above you say 'I'll not edit much on Wikipedia, apart from my own page'. Please read and understand <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUser_page_1e96.html" title="Wikipedia:User page">Wikipedia:User page</a>.
