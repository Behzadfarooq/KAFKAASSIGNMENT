The asteroid belt (showing inclinations), with the main belt in red and blue ("core" region in red)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The currently accepted theory of <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planetary_formation.html" title="Planetary formation">planetary formation</a> is the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_nebula.html" title="Solar nebula">nebular hypothesis</a>. During the first few million years of the solar system's history, planets formed by the <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accretion_%28astrophysics%29.html" title="Accretion (astrophysics)">accretion</a> of smaller <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planetesimal.html" title="Planetesimal">planetesimals</a>. Low energy collisions allowed these planetismals to adhere to each other through mutual gravitational attraction. Repeated collisions led to the familiar rocky planets and to the <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gas_giant.html" title="Gas giant">gas giants</a>.</p>
<p>In regions where the average velocity of the collisions is too high, the shattering of planetesimals tends to dominate over accretion, preventing the formation of planet-sized bodies. The region lying between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter contains many strong <a href="../../../o/r/b/Orbital_resonance.html" title="Orbital resonance">orbital resonances</a> with Jupiter, and planetesimals in this region were (and continue to be) too strongly <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perturbation_%28astronomy%29.html" title="Perturbation (astronomy)">perturbed</a> to form a planet. Instead the planetesimals continue to orbit the Sun as before. The inner border of the main belt, at a radius 2.06&#160;AU, is determined by the 4:1 <a href="../../../o/r/b/Orbital_resonance.html" title="Orbital resonance">orbital resonance</a> with Jupiter, which sends any bodies straying there onto unstable orbits. Most bodies formed inside the radius of this gap were swept up by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mars.html" title="Mars">Mars</a> (which has an <a href="../../../a/p/h/Aphelion.html" title="Aphelion">aphelion</a> out at 1.67&#160;AU) or ejected by its gravitational perturbations in the early history of the Solar System.</p>
<p>The asteroid belt can be considered a relic of the primitive Solar System. However, it has also been affected by many subsequent processes, such as internal heating, impact melting, and <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_weathering.html" title="Space weathering">space weathering</a>. Hence, the asteroids themselves are not pristine. By contrast, the objects in the outer <a href="../../../k/u/i/Kuiper_belt.html" title="Kuiper belt">Kuiper belt</a> are believed to have experienced much less change since the Solar System's formation.</p>
<p>The current asteroid belt is believed to be only a small fraction (by mass) of the primordial asteroid belt. Based on computer simulations, the original asteroid belt may have contained the equivalent of an Earth mass. Primarily because of gravitational perturbations, most of this material was ejected from the belt within a period of a million years of formation, leaving behind less than 0.1% of the original mass.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>An early hypothesis, which has since fallen into disfavor, was that the asteroids in the asteroid belt are the remnants of a destroyed planet called <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phaeton_%28planet%29.html" title="Phaeton (planet)">Phaeton</a>. There are two key problems with this hypothesis. One is the large amount of energy which would be required to achieve this kind of effect. The other is the low combined mass of the current asteroid belt, which has less mass than Earth's moon.</p>
<p>The region of the asteroid belt also contains some <a href="../../../m/a/i/Main-belt_comets.html" title="Main-belt comets">main-belt comets</a>. Similar comets may have been the source of much of the Earth's oceans.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

The asteroid belt (showing eccentricities), with the main belt in red and blue ("core" region in red)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Despite popular imagery, the asteroid belt is mostly empty. The asteroids are spread over such a large volume that it would be highly improbable to reach an asteroid without aiming carefully. Nonetheless, hundreds of thousands of asteroids are currently known, and the total number ranges in the millions or more, depending on the lower size cutoff that is assumed.</p>
<p>About 220 of the asteroids in the belt are larger than 100 <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilometre.html" title="Kilometre">km</a>. The biggest asteroid belt member, and the only <a href="../../../d/w/a/Dwarf_planet.html" title="Dwarf planet">dwarf planet</a> found there, is <a href="../../../c/e/r/Ceres_%28dwarf_planet%29.html" title="Ceres (dwarf planet)">Ceres</a>, which is about 1000 km across. The total mass of the Asteroid belt is estimated to be 3.0-3.6×10<sup>21</sup> kilograms,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup> which is 4% of the Earth's <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon.html" title="Moon">Moon</a>. Of that total mass, one-third is accounted for by Ceres alone.</p>
<p>The belt consists primarily of two categories of asteroids. In the middle and outer belt, carbon-rich asteroids predominate.<sup id="_ref-ApJ133_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ApJ133" title="">[6]</a></sup> These <a href="../../../c/-/t/C-type_asteroid.html" title="C-type asteroid">C-type</a> (carbonaceous) asteroids include over 75% of the visible asteroids. They are redder in hue and have a very low albedo. Their surface composition is similar to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Chemically, their spectra indicate a match with the primordial composition of the early Solar System, with the lighter elements and volatiles (e.g. ices) removed.</p>
<p>Toward the inner portion of the belt nearer Mars, within 2.5 A.U. of the Sun, <a href="../../../s/-/t/S-type_asteroid.html" title="S-type asteroid">S-type</a> (silicate) chondrite asteroids are more common.<sup id="_ref-ApJ133_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ApJ133" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[7]</a></sup> The spectra of their surfaces reveal the presence of <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silicates.html" title="Silicates">silicates</a> as well as some metal, but no significant carbonaceous compounds. This indicates that they are made of materials that have been significantly modified from the primordial solar system composition. The expected mechanism was melting early in their history, which caused mass differentiation. They have a relatively high albedo, and form about 17% of the total asteroid population.</p>

Distribution of asteroid <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semi-major_axis.html" title="Semi-major axis">semi-major axes</a> in the "core" of the main belt. Cyan arrows point to the <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirkwood_gap.html" title="Kirkwood gap">Kirkwood gaps</a>, where <a href="../../../o/r/b/Orbital_resonance.html" title="Orbital resonance">orbital resonances</a> with <a href="../../../j/u/p/Jupiter.html" title="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> destabilize orbits.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>At certain radii from the Sun, the main belt contains gaps where relatively few asteroids are to be found. At these radii, the mean orbital period of an asteroid forms an integer fraction with the orbital period of Jupiter. This results in mean-motion resonance with the <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gas_giant.html" title="Gas giant">gas giant</a> that is sufficient to perturb an asteroid to new <a href="../../../o/r/b/Orbital_element.html" title="Orbital element">orbital elements</a>. In effect, the asteroids in these gaps are randomly nudged into different orbits.</p>
<p>These empty rings in the asteroid belt are known as <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirkwood_gap.html" title="Kirkwood gap">Kirkwood gaps</a>. The main ones occur at the 3:1, 5:2, 7:3 and 2:1 mean-motion resonances with Jupiter. Thus an asteroid in the 3:1 Kirkwood gap would orbit the Sun three times for each Jovian orbit. Weaker resonances occur at other locations, producing narrow gaps at those points. (For example, a 8:3 resonance for asteroids with a semi-major axis of 2.71 A.U.)<sup id="_ref-iau160_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-iau160" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Approximately a third of the asteroids in the main belt are members of an <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asteroid_family.html" title="Asteroid family">asteroid family</a>. These are asteroids that share similar <a href="../../../o/r/b/Orbital_elements.html" title="Orbital elements">orbital elements</a>, such as <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semimajor_axis.html" title="Semimajor axis">semimajor axis</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/b/Orbital_eccentricity.html" title="Orbital eccentricity">eccentricity</a>, and orbital <a href="../../../i/n/c/Inclination.html" title="Inclination">inclination</a> as well as similar spectral features, all of which indicate a common origin in the breakup of a larger body. Graphical displays of these elements, for members of the main belt, show concentrations indicating the presence of an asteroid family. There are about 20–30 associations that are almost certainly asteroid families, and likely have a common origin. Additional groupings have been found but these are less certain. Asteroid families can be confirmed when the members display common spectral features.</p>
<p>The high population of the main belt makes for a very active environment, where collisions between asteroids occur frequently (on astronomical time scales). A collision may fragment an asteroid in numerous small pieces (leading to the formation of a new <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asteroid_family.html" title="Asteroid family">asteroid family</a>), or may glue two asteroids together if it occurs at low relative speeds. After five billion years, the current Asteroid belt population bears little resemblance to the original one.</p>

<p>Asteroid belts are a staple of <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> stories less concerned with realism than with drama, since they are frequently portrayed as being so dense that adventurous measures must be taken to avoid an impact. One of the best-known examples of this is the <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hoth.html" title="Hoth">Hoth</a> system in <i>Star Wars: <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Empire_Strikes_Back_1636.html" title="The Empire Strikes Back">The Empire Strikes Back</a></i>. Proto-planets in the process of formation and planetary rings may look like that, but the Sun's asteroid belt does not. (The asteroid belt in the <a href="../../../h/d/_/HD_69830_4b19.html" title="HD 69830">HD 69830</a> system may, however.) In reality, the asteroids are spread over such a high volume that it would be highly improbable even to pass close to a random asteroid. For example, the numerous <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_probe.html" title="Space probe">space probes</a> sent to the outer solar system, just across the main asteroid belt, have never had any problems, and asteroid rendez-vous missions have elaborate targeting procedures.</p>
<p>The inaccurate image of an overcrowded Asteroid Belt is especially frequent in science fiction films, apparently because it makes for dramatic visual images which the true nearly empty space does not provide. (The movie <i><a href="../../../a/_/s/2001%7E_A_Space_Odyssey_%28film%29_dbd6.html" title="2001: A Space Odyssey (film)">2001: A Space Odyssey</a></i> is unusual in that it does portray realistically the ship's "encounter" with a lone asteroid pair).</p>
<p>On the other hand, written depictions of human encounters with asteroids, their mining and their colonization - an increasingly frequent science fiction theme since the late <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940s</a>—are more often scientifically accurate. In <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Bova_78f1.html" title="Ben Bova">Ben Bova</a>'s <i><a href="../../../a/s/t/Asteroid_Wars_42bf.html" title="Asteroid Wars">Asteroid Wars</a></i> series, for example, men live in the asteroid belt and mine the asteroids for metals.</p>
