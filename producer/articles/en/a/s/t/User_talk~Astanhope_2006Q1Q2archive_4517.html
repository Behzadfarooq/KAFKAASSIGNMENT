<dd>Yeah, tell me about it. My first RFA went down in flames too. But my second one succeeded just recently&#160;:) Hang on a couple of more months, rack up 2000 edits or so and then get someone to nominate you again (you can ask me to do it and I will if you contributions look good to me). The best thing to do now is to pull your current nomination - it's a tough crowd to please. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 23:31, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The reference was listed. It is from Mohr's autobiography and it helps frame why Franken was never elevated above feature player status, which is relevant to his <i>career</i>.<a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilemma_3c64.html" title="User:Trilemma">Trilemma</a> 03:02, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The fact that he spent more seasons than anyone else on the show but was never promoted to full castmember status is an interesting and notable piece of trivia. The fact that Jay Mohr mentions a castmember giving a reason why in his book adds more weight to it.

<p>Thanks a lot for the cleanup of Hungary-related articles! <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam78_1062.html" title="User:Adam78">Adam78</a> 12:51, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi again, Adam,</p>
<p>Thanks for your offering and for the other cleanup works. I've been thinking about which articles I should ask you to look through but I could only have made a link to <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam78_1062.html" title="User:Adam78">my user page</a> where my more or less significant contributions are listed – and I'm glad to see the improvement of any of them. My favorite is <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungarian_grammar.html" title="Hungarian grammar">Hungarian grammar</a> (written in <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_and_British_English_differences_6ac2.html" title="American and British English differences">UK spelling</a>, because one of its main contributors was <a href="../../../g/a/i/User%7EGailtb_f4c4.html" title="User:Gailtb">an Englishman</a>) but it may be out of your interest. I'm happy to see whichever article you feel like cleaning up.</p>
<p>I have three questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why did you remove two links from <a href="../../../s/z/i/Sziget.html" title="Sziget">Sziget</a>? They seemed to be functioning and quite relevant, although their descriptions were not the best.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I think you are talking about <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungarian_language.html" title="Hungarian language">Hungarian language</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/b/Table_football.html" title="Table football">Table football</a>, no? I felt like <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungarian_language.html" title="Hungarian language">Hungarian language</a> was self-explanatory there, and I switched <a href="../../../t/a/b/Table_football.html" title="Table football">table football</a> to <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foosball.html" title="Foosball">foosball</a> to eliminate the American English vs. the rest of the world as to what exactly <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a> means (as opposed to <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">American football</a> or <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">soccer</a>).</li>
</ul>
<dl>

<li>No; I meant these two links: <a href="http://www.szigetfestival.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.szigetfestival.com/" rel="nofollow">Another website</a> <a href="http://www.sziget.hu/festival_english/news/59615.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sziget.hu/festival_english/news/59615.html" rel="nofollow">Detailed introduction</a>.

<li>In the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_Park_%28Budapest%29_6b5d.html" title="City Park (Budapest)">City Park</a> article, there is a bit of misunderstanding: the whole park is not part of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_World_Heritage_Sites_in_Europe_e3fb.html#Hungary" title="List of World Heritage Sites in Europe">World Heritage</a>, only <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andr%C3%A1ssy_Avenue_7556.html" title="Andrássy Avenue">Andrássy Avenue</a>, which leads to it, and <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heroes%27_Square_%28Budapest%29_1b84.html" title="Heroes' Square (Budapest)">Heroes' Square</a>, which is only a little part of the park itself. Would you please correct these in the article?</li>
<li>In the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_Park_%28Budapest%29_6b5d.html" title="City Park (Budapest)">City Park</a> article: it was written "easily available from the centre" because the <a href="../../../b/u/d/Budapest_Metro_b9ba.html" title="Budapest Metro">Budapest Metro</a> takes you there quickly. I don't know if "close to the city center" is also true because it's about one mile away (some may find it more than walking distance).</li>

<p>Hi, I'd like to ask for your opinion in an ESL question. There is an organization named <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_and_Suburban_Transit_Association_c3de.html" title="Urban and Suburban Transit Association">Urban and Suburban Transit Association</a> and I wonder if it should be named "Urban and Suburban Transport Association" instead. Do you think the current version is all right in English or not? It seems that the Hungarian representatives use the existing name in English but newspapers like The Budapest Sun and The Budapest Times (which are partly written by native speakers of English) use "transport" in the name (see <a href="../../../u/r/b/Talk%7EUrban_and_Suburban_Transit_Association_b618.html" title="Talk:Urban and Suburban Transit Association">its talk page</a>, if you're interested in the links). Thanks in advance. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam78_1062.html" title="User:Adam78">Adam78</a> 18:13, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you! If both are correct, the ultimate question is which is "<a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28use_English%29_65c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)">the most commonly used English version of the name</a>" but I see that both have very few hits in Google so it can remain as it is for me. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam78_1062.html" title="User:Adam78">Adam78</a> 18:48, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Astanhope/2006Q1Q2archive, thanks for participating in my <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Proto_17cb.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Proto">RfA</a> discussion. Unfortunately, my fellow Wikipedians have decided at this time that I am not suitable to take on this additional responsibility, as the RfA failed with a result of 66/27/5 (71.0% support). If you voted in support of my request, <b>thank you</b>! If you decided to oppose me at this time, then I hope that if I do choose to reapply in the future, the effort I will make in the meantime to improve and expand my contributions to Wikipedia may persuade you to reconsider your position.

<p>The answer is "yes" as to both!&#160;:-) I have some contacts with USCA management &amp; alumni association, and hope to get permission to use some old photos.</p>
<p>I saw <a href="../../../l/e/_/Le_Polidor_858c.html" title="Le Polidor">Le Polidor</a> as a redlink in the <a href="../../../v/i/e/VIe_arrondissement_c95f.html" title="VIe arrondissement">VIe_arrondissement</a>, and am working on an article right now.

<dd>Actually, I ended up getting busy with some other projects that have to be completed before I leave on a trip tomorrow, so I did not get the Polidor article together. It sounds like you are probably more familiar with the place, so please feel free to start the article. I was going to title it <a href="../../../c/r/%C3%A9/Cr%C3%A9merie-Restaurant_Polidor_7e97.html" title="Crémerie-Restaurant Polidor">Crémerie-Restaurant Polidor</a> since that is its full formal name, with "Polidor" and "Le Polidor" as redirects for common searches. I think that is what <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a> encourages, but I don't have a strong opinion. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 19:34, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm wondering about your recent additions...do you have a source? I was unable to find any stuff online, and I'd never heard that in my years at the school, and the list of alumni is pretty regularly vandalized by andover students (as well as other prep school students) to include themselves, chuck norris, or anyone else the feel would be funny. As a result, I quickly reverted the edit. I didn't touch the Larry the Cable Guy article, but I would be interested in seeing a source. --<a href="../../../j/f/g/User%7EJfg284_447f.html" title="User:Jfg284">jfg284</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/f/g/User_talk%7EJfg284_403e.html" title="User talk:Jfg284">you were saying?</a></sup> 11:49, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello there. I was the one who originally changed deaf to mute. I read the article right after seeing the film, and the main character is certainly not deaf. I'm not sure she's a mute either, but that's what I read on IMDB, so I guessed her speech disorder was covered by mute. I've changed it just now to read "a photographer with a speech disorder" I've written a little about it on the talk page. Just to let you know, if you eant to say why you think she's deaf.</p>
<p><br />
She is not a mute, I originally wrote mute, since that's what I had read on IMDB. But I since read that a mute is one totally unable to speak. The changes I have now made is that she has a speech disorder. As I recall it, there was no indication that she had any hearing problems at all. But maybe I don't remember the movie that good, if you really feel this is so, please change it back, I won't change it again.</p>
<p>Your'e right, forgot about the sign language, I guess I must have thought it was because that was what she knew. I'll change it back to deaf, and add speech problem.</p>
<p>Hehe, thanks. You too.</p>

<p>I'm a DMOZ editor and a moderator on several online forums, and I understand that you have to be vigilant against spam. The site that you deleted provides destination photos organized by area and category with satellite maps. Yes, it contains ads and links to hotel reservations. In case you live in a real world and you've picked up a newspaper lately, you should understand that this is how companies that provide free information of any value can afford to do so. I'd like to ask you to check other links in the same article and count the advertisements. The value of content, which you chose to ignore, not whether the site contains advertisements should be the deciding factor.</p>

<p>Hi. We've both just edited the description of MalkinWatch in the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michelle_Malkin_6e09.html" title="Michelle Malkin">Michelle Malkin</a> article. The last few descriptions we've had were:</p>
<ol>
<li>"a blog which comments on Malkin established by 'Auguste' in December 2004"</li>
<li>"an anti-Malkin blog"</li>
<li>"a blog providing critical analysis of Malkin's work"</li>
<li>"a blog devoted to criticising Malkin"</li>
</ol>
<p>I contend that description #1 leaves out the important aspect of the blog while giving irrelevant details, #2 (mine) is true but overly terse, and #4 (also mine) is accurate but still a bit too terse.</p>
<p>I've looked for some "critical <i>analysis</i> of Malkin's work" at MalkinWatch but all I found were hostile <i>arguments</i> and snark; hence my change to #4. Can you point me to any <a href="../../../c/r/i/Critic.html" title="Critic">critical</a> analysis on the blog? Comments welcome (here will do, I've autowatched this page), as are edits.

<li>Thanks for writing Chris. I would be happy with your #4 description above - "a blog devoted to criticising Malkin." "anti-Malkin" really is simply too terse. The site in question maintains a standard of decency, as far as I can tell, that trancends simply shitting on Malkin or calling her "slant-eyed," or "cunt." I have seen instances, in fact, where commenters have been warned or banned there for simply making fun of her maiden name. If you are happy with describing it as #4 then we're all set. If you poke around that blog long enough, you'll even see occasional praise for or at a minimum, concurrence with Malkin. --<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstanhope_1188.html" title="User:Astanhope">AStanhope</a> 19:33, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually, I've spent quite a bit of time over the last decade or so trying to understand American politics — not just in obvious things like foreign policy, but also in areas like intellectual property laws, corporate law reform, farm policy, etc. Short summary of my results so far: American politics works poorly, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliamentary_democracy.html" title="Parliamentary democracy">parliamentary democracy</a> is far better. Is that POV enough?&#160;;-)</dd>
<dd>More seriously, the U.S. system is a form of <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attention_economy.html" title="Attention economy">attention economy</a>: legislative issues that don't attract public attention are often overly influenced by lobbyists. Bloggers such as Malkin, Kos, etc frequently attempt to increase public awareness of specific issues in order to overcome lobbyist pressure. (You could even argue that Kos is a kind of lobbyist himself.) My favourite examples: <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porkbusters.html" title="Porkbusters">Porkbusters</a> (a conscious effort to change the way politics is practiced), and the bipartisan blogosphere action which prevented blogs counting as campaign contributions.</dd>
<dd>So I think (hope?) blogs <i>are</i> important. They could/should be the solution to a significant problem of non-transparency in U.S. political practice.</dd>

<dd>PS: Even when you're right you still shouldn't revert more than 3 times in a day. Please discuss this on the article talk page. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 23:11, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am puzzled as to why you renominated <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah_Is_in_the_House_6fb2.html" title="Allah Is in the House">Allah Is in the House</a> for deletion at this point. The article has hardly been touched since the result of the first debate was <b>keep</b>, and Allahpundit (the author) has only risen in notability since the debate as the main blogger at Michelle Malkin's Hot Air. As stated in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion_policy</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>If and when you do renominate, be careful to say why you think the reasons proffered for keeping the article are poor, and why you think the article must be deleted.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So far, this has not been done. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalbaer_c1bc.html" title="User:Calbaer">Calbaer</a> 21:38, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My bad - a mistake on my part. I *did* nominate it - and then I saw that it had just finished a cycle with a KEEP result. I intended to go back and remove the nomination tag and forgot to do so. You are absolutely correct - there is no reason to renominate once it passed muster through that process. Sloppiness on my part for not cleaning up after myself. I'll fix it now if nobody has already fixed it. Thanks for pointing it out to me! --<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstanhope_1188.html" title="User:Astanhope">AStanhope</a> 21:41, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just to let you know, I created a tool to reduce unnecessary date links. You are welcome to use it. Simply copy the entire contents of <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_monobook.js_ee81.html" title="User:Bobblewik/monobook.js">User:Bobblewik/monobook.js</a> to <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstanhope_monobook.js_837f.html" title="User:Astanhope/monobook.js">User:Astanhope/monobook.js</a>. Then follow the instructions in your monobook to clear the cache (i.e. press Ctrl-Shift-R in Firefox, or Ctrl-F5 in IE) before it will work. This will give you a 'Dates' tab to press in edit mode.

<dd>Ok, well the main thing that hits me looking through your contributions is not the relatively low number of edits (I have far lower standards on that count than AA below), but rather the lack of edits in the 'admin things'. Before submitting an <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a> you need to show that you have more experience in the sort of areas admins work in. That includes links like <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">articles for deletion</a>, <a href="../../../r/c/p/WP%7ERCP_b874.html" title="WP:RCP">recent changes patrol</a>, and lots of other maintenance type things. These are generally pages that start with Wikipedia: (the Wikipedia namespace). People also look for talk (both article and user) page interaction, knowledge of <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_policies_92b2.html" title="Wikipedia:List of policies">policy</a> as well as many other things. You can take a look at my personal <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_RfA_criteria_f151.html" title="User:Petros471/RfA criteria">RfA criteria</a> for a guide, as well as other people's at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Standards_ce02.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Standards">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Standards</a> (please note that a lot of people seem to type lower edit counts on that page then they actually keep to, i.e generally 2000+ is more realistic than some the lower numbers on that page). Personally I dislike high edit count requirements, especially as people in work tend to have less free time for things like Wikipedia. However, you still need to show a wide experience of different areas of the site and admin type things. Hope that helps, feel free to ask me any other questions. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 21:17, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I acknowledged your apology on my page, then went back and looked - it wasn't even you who took them out. It was an administrator whose only contribution to the article was to remove the links. Weird. So ....You're still great!<a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJuneappal_67b5.html" title="User:Juneappal">Juneappal</a> 20:57, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>4500 is the total edit minimum. While 350 is the minimum for edits to pages in the Wikipedia Namespace. I'm sorry for the confusion I caused.
