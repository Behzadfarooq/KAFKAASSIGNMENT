Over the last few hundred years, the number of identified astronomical objects has risen from hundreds to over a billion, and more are discovered every year. Astronomers need to be able to assign systematic designations to unambiguously identify all of these objects, and at the same time give names to the most interesting objects and, where relevant, features of those objects.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Astronomical_Union_54bc.html" title="International Astronomical Union">International Astronomical Union</a> (IAU) is the major body recognized by <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronomy.html" title="Astronomy">astronomers</a> worldwide, and perhaps by other scientists, as the naming authority for astronomical bodies. In response to the need for unambiguous names for astronomical objects, it has created a number of <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systematic_name.html" title="Systematic name">systematic naming</a> systems for bodies of various sorts.</p>
<p>A few star-naming companies sell the right to list stars in their private registries under whatever name the buyer so chooses. However, the IAU (and, therefore, most astronomers) do not recognize those names as "official" (although the companies themselves do). Some websites (especially those speaking for astronomers) say that the IAU is the only body allowed to officially name heavenly objects. The star-naming companies, naturally, disagree.</p>

<p>According to the IAU, apart from a limited number of bright stars with historic names, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star.html" title="Star">stars</a> do not have <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proper_name.html" title="Proper name">proper names</a>. Where historic names exist, these names are, with a few exceptions, taken from the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_language.html" title="Arabic language">Arabic language</a>: this reflects the leading role of Arab culture in astronomy while Europe was experiencing the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>. See <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_traditional_star_names.html" title="List of traditional star names">List of traditional star names</a> for a list of some of these names.</p>
<p>There are no more than a few thousand stars that appear sufficiently bright in the Earth's sky to be visible to the naked eye, so this represents the limit of the possible number of stars available to be named by ancient cultures. This limit is approximate, as it varies by the acuity of any given observer's eyes, but ten thousand stars (the naked-eye stars to <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visual_magnitude.html" title="Visual magnitude">visual magnitude</a> six) seems to be an upper bound to what is physiologically possible.</p>
<p>Estimates of the number of stars with recognised proper names range from 300 to 350 different stars. These tend to be the brightest stars, or stars that form part of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constellation.html" title="Constellation">constellation</a> patterns with the brightest stars. The number of proper names for stars is greater than the number of stars with proper names, as many different cultures named stars independently. For example, the star known as <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polaris.html" title="Polaris">Polaris</a> has also at various times and places been known by the names Alruccabah, Angel Stern, Cynosura, the Lodestar, Mismar, Navigatoria, Phoenice, the Pole Star, the Star of Arcady, Tramontana and Yilduz.</p>
<p>With the advent of the increased light-gathering abilities of the telescope, many more stars became visible, far too many to all be given names. Instead, they have designations assigned to them by a variety of different <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_catalogue.html" title="Star catalogue">star catalogues</a>. Older catalogues either assigned an arbitrary number to each object, or used a simple systematic naming scheme such as combining <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constellation.html" title="Constellation">constellation</a> names with <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_letter.html" title="Greek letter">Greek letters</a>. Multiple sky catalogues meant that some stars had more than one designation. For example, the star with the Arabic name of <a href="../../../r/i/g/Rigil_Kentaurus_f5f8.html" title="Rigil Kentaurus">Rigil Kentaurus</a> also has the <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayer_designation.html" title="Bayer designation">Bayer designation</a> of <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Centauri_51c3.html" title="Alpha Centauri">Alpha Centauri</a>.</p>
<p>As the resolving power of telescopes increased, numerous objects that were thought to be a single object were found to be <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiple_star_system.html" title="Multiple star system">multiple star systems</a> that were too closely spaced in the sky to be discriminated by the human eye. These and other confusions make it essential that great care is taken in using designations. For example, Rigil Kentaurus contains three stars in a triple star system, labelled Rigil Kentaurus A, B and C respectively.</p>
<p>Most modern catalogues are generated by computers, using high-resolution, high-sensitivity telescopes, and as a result describe very large numbers of objects. For example, the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guide_Star_Catalog_II_0cbf.html" title="Guide Star Catalog II">Guide Star Catalog II</a> has entries on over 998 million distinct astronomical objects. Objects in these catalogs are typically located with very high resolution, and assign designations to these objects based on their position in the sky. An example of such a designation is <i>SDSSp J153259.96-003944.1</i>, where the initialism <i>SDSSp</i> indicates that the designation is from the "<a href="../../../s/l/o/Sloan_Digital_Sky_Survey_aaa8.html" title="Sloan Digital Sky Survey">Sloan Digital Sky Survey</a> preliminary objects", and the other characters indicate <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celestial_coordinates.html" title="Celestial coordinates">celestial coordinates</a>.</p>
<p>The star nearest to Earth, our <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun.html" title="Sun">Sun</a>, is typically referred to simply as "the Sun" or its equivalent in the language being used (for instance, if two astronomers were speaking <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a>, they would call it <i>le Soleil</i>). However, it is sometimes called by its <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> name, <a href="../../../s/o/l/Sol.html" title="Sol">Sol</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, there are a very few <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_stars_named_after_people.html" title="List of stars named after people">stars named after people</a>.</p>

<p>The IAU is the ultimate maintainer of the <a href="../../../n/a/m/Namespace.html" title="Namespace">namespace</a> of astronomical designations in catalogues of astronomical objects. The purpose of this is to ensure that names assigned by these catalogues are unambiguous. There have been many historical star catalogues, and new star catalogues are set up on a regular basis as new sky surveys are performed. All designations of objects in recent star catalogues start with an "initialism", which is kept globally unique by the IAU. Different star catalogues then have different naming conventions for what goes after the initialism, but modern catalogues tend to follow a set of generic rules for the data formats used.</p>

<p>The sky was arbitrarily divided into <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constellation.html" title="Constellation">constellations</a> by historic astronomers, according to perceived patterns in the sky. At first, only the shapes of the patterns were defined, and the names and numbers of constellations varied from one star map to another. Even though the constellations are scientifically meaningless, they still provide useful reference points in the sky for human beings, including astronomers. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930.html" title="1930">1930</a>, the boundaries of these constellations were fixed by <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eug%C3%A8ne_Joseph_Delporte_1097.html" title="Eugène Joseph Delporte">Eugène Joseph Delporte</a> and adopted by the IAU, so that now every point on the <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celestial_sphere.html" title="Celestial sphere">celestial sphere</a> belongs to a particular constellation.</p>

The name is formed by the year of discovery, immediately followed by a one- or two-letter designation. The first 26 supernovae of the year get an upper case letter from <b><a href="../../../a/_/_/A.html" title="A">A</a></b> to <b><a href="../../../z/_/_/Z.html" title="Z">Z</a></b>. Afterward, pairs of lower-case letters are used, starting with <b>aa</b>, <b>ab</b>, and so on. Four historical supernovae are known simply by the year they occurred (<a href="../../../s/n/_/SN_1006_7771.html" title="SN 1006">SN 1006</a>, <a href="../../../s/n/_/SN_1054_7499.html" title="SN 1054">1054</a>, <a href="../../../s/n/_/SN_1572_cb44.html" title="SN 1572">1572</a> (Tycho's Nova), and <a href="../../../s/n/_/SN_1604_bef9.html" title="SN 1604">1604</a> (Kepler's Star)); starting with <a href="../../../1/8/8/1885.html" title="1885">1885</a>, the letters are used, even if there was only one supernova that year (e.g. SN 1885A, 1907A, etc.) —this last happened with SN 1947A. The standard abbreviation "SN" is an optional prefix. Professional and amateur astronomers currently find at least 500 supernovae a year. For example, the last supernova of 2006 was SN 2006ue, indicating that it was the 551<sup>st</sup> supernova found in 2006 (a record year, in fact).</p>

<p>In the 19th century, the exact nature of galaxies was not yet understood, and the early catalogs such as the <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messier_catalog.html" title="Messier catalog">Messier catalog</a> simply grouped together <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_cluster.html" title="Open cluster">open clusters</a>, <a href="../../../g/l/o/Globular_cluster.html" title="Globular cluster">globular clusters</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/b/Nebula.html" title="Nebula">nebulas</a>, and galaxies, 110 in total.

<p>The brightest planets in the sky have been named from ancient times. The scientific names are taken from the names given by the Romans; <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercury_%28planet%29.html" title="Mercury (planet)">Mercury</a>, <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venus_%28planet%29.html" title="Venus (planet)">Venus</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mars_%28planet%29.html" title="Mars (planet)">Mars</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/p/Jupiter_%28planet%29.html" title="Jupiter (planet)">Jupiter</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturn_%28planet%29.html" title="Saturn (planet)">Saturn</a>. Our own planet is usually named the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth_%28planet%29.html" title="Earth (planet)">Earth</a>, or the equivalent in the language being spoken (for instance, two astronomers speaking <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a> would call it <i>la Terre</i>). However, it is only recently in human history that it has been thought of as a planet. The Earth, when viewed as a planet, is sometimes also called by its Latin name <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terra.html" title="Terra">Terra</a>.</p>
<p>At least two more bodies were discovered later, and called planets:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../u/r/a/Uranus_%28planet%29.html" title="Uranus (planet)">Uranus</a>, discovered by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Herschel_149d.html" title="William Herschel">William Herschel</a> in <a href="../../../1/7/8/1781.html" title="1781">1781</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../n/e/p/Neptune_%28planet%29.html" title="Neptune (planet)">Neptune</a>, discovered by <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Gottfried_Galle_8941.html" title="Johann Gottfried Galle">Johann Gottfried Galle</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/4/1846.html" title="1846">1846</a> (based on predictions by <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urbain_Le_Verrier_4271.html" title="Urbain Le Verrier">Urbain Le Verrier</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Couch_Adams_2bd6.html" title="John Couch Adams">John Couch Adams</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these planets were given names from Greek or Roman myth, to match the ancient planet names. However, this was only after some controversy. For example, Sir <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Herschel_149d.html" title="William Herschel">William Herschel</a> discovered Uranus in 1781, and originally called it <i>Georgium Sidus</i> (George's Star) in honour of King <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom_cc72.html" title="George III of the United Kingdom">George III of the United Kingdom</a>. French astronomers began calling it Herschel before German <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Bode_7f2c.html" title="Johann Bode">Johann Bode</a> proposed the name Uranus, after the Greek and Roman god. The name "Uranus" did not come into common usage until around <a href="../../../1/8/5/1850.html" title="1850">1850</a>.</p>
<p>Starting in <a href="../../../1/8/0/1801.html" title="1801">1801</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asteroid.html" title="Asteroid">asteroids</a> were discovered between Mars and Jupiter. The first few (<a href="../../../1/_/c/1_Ceres_30f7.html" title="1 Ceres">Ceres</a>, <a href="../../../2/_/p/2_Pallas_ea64.html" title="2 Pallas">Pallas</a>, <a href="../../../3/_/j/3_Juno_9c36.html" title="3 Juno">Juno</a>, <a href="../../../4/_/v/4_Vesta_7803.html" title="4 Vesta">Vesta</a>) were initially considered <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_planet.html" title="Minor planet">minor planets</a> and joined the ranks of the planets. As more and more were discovered, they were soon stripped of their planetary status. On the other hand, <a href="../../../p/l/u/Pluto.html" title="Pluto">Pluto</a> was, at the time of its discovery in 1930 considered a planet, as it was found far beyond any then-known asteroid's greatest distance from the Sun.</p>
<p>Some sixty years after the discovery of Pluto, a large number of large <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trans-Neptunian_object_824e.html" title="Trans-Neptunian object">trans-Neptunian objects</a> began to be discovered. Under the criteria of classifying these <a href="../../../k/u/i/Kuiper_belt.html" title="Kuiper belt">Kuiper belt</a> objects (KBOs), it is dubious whether Pluto would have been called a planet were it discovered in the 1990s: its mass is now known to be much smaller than what was once thought and, with the discovery of <a href="../../../1/3/6/136199_Eris_b739.html" title="136199 Eris">Eris</a>, it may simply be the second largest member of the Kuiper belt. In 2006, Pluto was <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_definition_of_planet.html" title="2006 definition of planet">reclassified</a> to a different class of astronomical bodies known as <a href="../../../d/w/a/Dwarf_planet.html" title="Dwarf planet">dwarf planets</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronomical_naming_conventions.html" title="Edit section: Natural satellites of planets">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Natural satellites of planets</span></h2>
<p>The Earth's moon is simply known as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Moon_ebb1.html" title="The Moon">the Moon</a>, or the equivalent in the language being spoken (for instance, two astronomers speaking <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a> would call it <i>la Lune</i>). It is sometimes called <i>Luna</i> (which is simply Latin for "moon"). Natural satellites of other planets are generally named after mythological figures. Satellites of Uranus are named after characters from works by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> or <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Pope_8096.html" title="Alexander Pope">Alexander Pope</a>.</p>
<p>When satellites are first discovered, they are given provisional designations such as "<a href="../../../s/2F/2/S_2000_J_11_0422.html" title="S/2000 J 11">S/2000 J 11</a>" (the 11th new satellite of Jupiter discovered in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>) or "<a href="../../../s/2F/2/S_2003_S_1_ed2d.html" title="S/2003 S 1">S/2003 S 1</a>" (the 1st new satellite of Saturn discovered in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>). The initial "S/" stands for "satellite", and distinguishes from such prefixes as "D/", "C/", and "P/", used for <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comet.html" title="Comet">comets</a>. The designation "R/" is used for planetary rings. These designations are sometimes written like "S/2003 S1", dropping the second space. The letter following the category and year identifies the planet (<b>J</b>upiter, <b>S</b>aturn, <b>U</b>ranus, <b>N</b>eptune, <b>P</b>luto; although no occurrence of the other planets is expected, Mars and Mercury are disambiguated through the use of <b>H</b>ermes for the latter). When the object is found around a minor planet, the identifier used is the latter's number in parentheses. Thus, <a href="../../../d/a/c/Dactyl_%28asteroid%29.html" title="Dactyl (asteroid)">Dactyl</a>, the moon of <a href="../../../2/4/3/243_Ida_4c5c.html" title="243 Ida">243 Ida</a>, was at first designated "<a href="../../../s/2F/1/S_1993_%28243%29_1_87c3.html" title="S/1993 (243) 1">S/1993 (243) 1</a>".

<p>After a few months or years, when a newly discovered satellite's existence has been confirmed and its orbit computed, a permanent name is chosen, which replaces the "S/" provisional designation. However, in the past, some satellites remained unnamed for surprisingly long periods after their discovery. See <a href="../../../n/a/m/Naming_of_natural_satellites.html" title="Naming of natural satellites">Naming of natural satellites</a> for a history of how some of the major satellites got their current names.</p>
<p>The Roman numbering system arose with the very first discovery of natural satellites other than Earth's Moon: <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galileo.html" title="Galileo">Galileo</a> referred to the <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galilean_moons.html" title="Galilean moons">Galilean moons</a> as <b>I</b> through <b>IV</b> (counting from Jupiter outward), in part to spite his rival <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Marius_8b02.html" title="Simon Marius">Simon Marius</a>, who had proposed the names now adopted. Similar numbering schemes naturally arose with the discovery of moons around Saturn and Mars. Although the numbers initially designated the moons in orbital sequence, new discoveries soon failed to conform with this scheme (e.g. "Jupiter V" is <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amalthea_%28moon%29.html" title="Amalthea (moon)">Amalthea</a>, which orbits closer to Jupiter than does <a href="../../../i/o/_/Io_%28moon%29.html" title="Io (moon)">Io</a>). The unstated convention then became, at the close of the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a>, that the numbers more or less reflected the order of discovery, except for prior historical exceptions (see the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_discovery_of_Solar_System_planets_and_their_natural_satellites_e3c3.html" title="Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their natural satellites">Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their natural satellites</a>).</p>

</dl>
<p>In addition to naming planets and satellites themselves, the individual geological and geographical features (craters, mountains, volcanos and so forth) on those planets and satellites also need to be named.</p>
<p>In the early days, only a very limited number of features could be seen on other solar system bodies other than the <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon.html" title="Moon">Moon</a>. Craters on the <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon.html" title="Moon">Moon</a> could be observed with even some of the earliest telescopes, and 19th century telescopes could make out some features on Mars. Jupiter had its famous <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Red_Spot_7c9a.html" title="Great Red Spot">Great Red Spot</a>, also visible though early telescopes.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a> the IAU was formed, and it appointed a committee to regularize the chaotic lunar and Martian nomenclatures then current. Much of the work was done by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Adela_Blagg_fb9e.html" title="Mary Adela Blagg">Mary Adela Blagg</a>, and the report <i>Named Lunar Formations</i> by Blagg and Muller (1935), was the first systematic listing of lunar nomenclature. Later, "The System of Lunar Craters, quadrants I, II, III, IV" was published, under the direction of <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerard_P._Kuiper_f73a.html" title="Gerard P. Kuiper">Gerard P. Kuiper</a>. These works were adopted by the IAU and became the recognized sources for lunar nomenclature.</p>
<p>The Martian nomenclature was clarified in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a>, when a committee of the IAU recommended for adoption the names of 128 <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albedo_feature.html" title="Albedo feature">albedo features</a> (bright, dark, or colored) observed through ground-based telescopes (IAU, 1960). These names were based on a system of nomenclature developed in the late 19th century by the Italian astronomer <a href="../../../g/i/o/Giovanni_V._Schiaparelli_5be8.html" title="Giovanni V. Schiaparelli">Giovanni V. Schiaparelli</a> (1879) and expanded in the early 20th century by <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugene_M._Antoniadi_18cb.html" title="Eugene M. Antoniadi">Eugene M. Antoniadi</a> (1929), a Greek-born astronomer working at <a href="../../../m/e/u/Meudon%2C_France_55e0.html" title="Meudon, France">Meudon, France</a>.</p>
<p>However, the age of <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_probe.html" title="Space probe">space probes</a> brought high-resolution images of various solar system bodies, and it became necessary to propose naming standards for the features seen on them.</p>

<p>The main responsibility for designating and naming minor planets lies on the Committee for Small Body Nomenclature (CSBN).</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_planet.html" title="Minor planet">Minor planets</a> are initially assigned <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provisional_designation.html" title="Provisional designation">provisional designations</a> when observed, of the form "2001 KX<sub>76</sub>" (the first part is a year; the second part defines a sequential order of discovery within that year, see <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provisional_designation.html" title="Provisional designation">provisional designation</a> for details). If enough sightings are obtained of the same minor planet to calculate an orbit, the object is assigned a sequential number - its 'designation' - and it can then be cited as, for instance, <a href="../../../%28/2/8/%2828978%29_2001_KX76_9adc.html" title="(28978) 2001 KX76">(28978) 2001 KX<sub>76</sub></a>.</p>
<p>After the designation is assigned, the discoverer is given an opportunity to propose a name, which, if it is accepted by the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Astronomical_Union_54bc.html" title="International Astronomical Union">IAU</a>, replaces the provisional designation. Thus for instance, (28978) 2001 KX<sub>76</sub> was given the name Ixion and is now known as <a href="../../../%28/2/8/%2828978%29_Ixion_514d.html" title="(28978) Ixion">(28978) Ixion</a>, which is often abridged to <a href="../../../2/8/9/28978_Ixion_d0d8.html" title="28978 Ixion">28978 Ixion</a>. The name becomes official after its publication in the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Planet_Circular_1180.html" title="Minor Planet Circular">Minor Planet Circular</a> with a brief citation explaining its significance. This may be a few years after the initial sighting, or in the case of "lost" asteroids, it may take several decades before they are spotted again and finally assigned a designation. If a minor planet remains unnamed ten years after it has been given a designation, then the right to name it is given also to identifiers of the various apparitions of the object, to discoverers at apparitions other than the official one, to those whose observations contributed extensively to the orbit determination, or to representatives of the observatory at which the official discovery was made. The CSBN has the right to act on its own in naming a minor planet, which often happens when the number assigned to the body is an integral number of thousands.</p>
<p>In recent years automated search efforts such as <a href="../../../l/i/n/LINEAR_aac5.html" title="LINEAR">LINEAR</a> or <a href="../../../l/o/n/LONEOS_4fa5.html" title="LONEOS">LONEOS</a> have discovered so many thousands of new asteroids that the Center for Small Body Nomenclature has officially limited naming to a maximum of two names per discoverer every two months. Thus, the overwhelming majority of asteroids discovered from now on will never receive a name.</p>
<p>Under IAU rules, names must be pronouncable, preferably one word (such as Annefrank (<a href="../../../5/5/3/5535_Annefrank_b536.html" title="5535 Annefrank">5535 Annefrank</a>)), although exceptions are possible (such as James Bond (<a href="../../../9/0/0/9007_James_Bond_c377.html" title="9007 James Bond">9007 James Bond</a>)), and since 1982 limited to a maximum length of sixteen characters, including spaces and hyphens. Letters with <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diacritics.html" title="Diacritics">diacritics</a> are accepted, although the diacritical marks are usually omitted in everyday usage. 4090 Říšehvězd is an asteroid with the most diacritics (four). Military and political leaders are unsuitable until they are dead for 100 years. Nowadays, names of pet animals are discouraged, but there are some from the past. Names after people, companies or products known only for success in business are not accepted, as well as citations that resemble advertising.</p>
<p>Whimsical names can be used for relatively ordinary asteroids (such as <a href="../../../2/6/8/26858_Misterrogers_84bc.html" title="26858 Misterrogers">26858 Misterrogers</a>), but those belonging to certain dynamical groups are expected to follow more strictly defined naming schemes.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronomical_naming_conventions.html" title="Edit section: Comets">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Comets</span></h2>
<p>The names given to comets have followed several different conventions over the past two centuries. Before any systematic naming convention was adopted, comets were named in a variety of ways. The first one to be named was "<a href="../../../h/a/l/Halley%27s_Comet_5171.html" title="Halley's Comet">Halley's Comet</a>" (now officially known as Comet Halley), named after <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmund_Halley_c16f.html" title="Edmund Halley">Edmund Halley</a>, who had calculated its orbit. Similarly, the second known periodic comet, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comet_Encke_eb82.html" title="Comet Encke">Comet Encke</a>, was named after the astronomer who had calculated its orbit rather than the original discoverer of the comet. Other comets that bore the possessive include "Biela's Comet" (<a href="../../../3/d/2F/3D_Biela_2104.html" title="3D/Biela">3D/Biela</a>) and "Miss Herschel's Comet" (35P/Herschel-Rigollet, or Comet Herschel-Rigollet). Most bright (non-periodic) comets were referred to as 'The Great Comet Of...' the year in which they appeared.</p>
<p>In the early 20th century, the convention of naming comets after their discoverers became common, and this remains today. A comet is named after up to its first three independent discoverers. In recent years, many comets have been discovered by instruments operated by large teams of astronomers, and in this case, comets may be named for the instrument (for example, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comet_IRAS-Araki-Alcock_46bb.html" title="Comet IRAS-Araki-Alcock">Comet IRAS-Araki-Alcock</a> (C/1983 H1) was discovered independently by the <a href="../../../i/r/a/IRAS_6da0.html" title="IRAS">IRAS</a> satellite and amateur astronomers Genichi Araki and <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Alcock_b40e.html" title="George Alcock">George Alcock</a>).</p>
<p>Until <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, the systematic naming of comets (the "Old Style") involved first giving them a provisional designation of the year of their discovery followed by a lower case letter indicating its order of discovery in that year (e.g. the first <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comet_Bennett_3661.html" title="Comet Bennett">Comet Bennett</a> is 1969i, the 9th comet discovered in 1969). In 1987, more than 26 comets were discovered, so the alphabet was used again with a "1" subscript, very much like what is still done with asteroids (an example is <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comet_Skorichenko-George_91d6.html" title="Comet Skorichenko-George">Comet Skorichenko-George</a>, 1989e1). The record year was 1989, which went as high as 1989h1. Once an orbit had been established, the comet was given a permanent designation in order of time of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perihelion.html" title="Perihelion">perihelion</a> passage, consisting of the year followed by a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_numeral.html" title="Roman numeral">Roman numeral</a>. For example, Comet Bennett (1969i) became <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970_II_485f.html" title="1970 II">1970 II</a>.</p>
<p>Increasing numbers of comet discoveries made this procedure difficult to operate, and in 1994 the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Astronomical_Union_54bc.html" title="International Astronomical Union">International Astronomical Union</a> approved a new naming system (the "New Style"). Comets are now designated by the year of their discovery followed by a letter indicating the half-month of the discovery and a number indicating the order of discovery, so that the fourth comet discovered in the second half of February 2006 would be designated 2006 D4. Prefixes are also added to indicate the nature of the comet, with P/ indicating a periodic comet, C/ indicating a non-periodic comet, X/ indicating a comet for which no reliable orbit could be calculated, and D/ indicating a comet which has broken up or been lost. Periodic comets also have a number indicating the order of their discovery. Thus Bennett's comet has the systematic designation <a href="../../../c/2F/1/C_1969_Y1_7af2.html" title="C/1969 Y1">C/1969 Y1</a>. Halley's Comet, the first comet to be identified as periodic, has the systematic name <a href="../../../1/p/2F/1P_1682_Q1_350e.html" title="1P/1682 Q1">1P/1682 Q1</a>. <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comet_Hale-Bopp_db5b.html" title="Comet Hale-Bopp">Comet Hale-Bopp</a>'s systematic name is <a href="../../../c/2F/1/C_1995_O1_22f9.html" title="C/1995 O1">C/1995 O1</a>. The famous <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comet_Shoemaker-Levy_9_74eb.html" title="Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9">Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9</a> was the ninth periodic comet jointly discovered by <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carolyn_Shoemaker_9564.html" title="Carolyn Shoemaker">Carolyn Shoemaker</a>, <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugene_Shoemaker_f67f.html" title="Eugene Shoemaker">Eugene Shoemaker</a>, and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Levy_%28astronomer%29_c7ac.html" title="David Levy (astronomer)">David Levy</a> (the Shoemaker-Levy team has also discovered four non-periodic comets interspersed with the periodic ones), but its systematic name is <a href="../../../d/2F/1/D_1993_F2_f8f7.html" title="D/1993 F2">D/1993 F2</a> (it was discovered in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> and the prefix "D/" is applied, since it was observed to crash into <a href="../../../j/u/p/Jupiter_%28planet%29.html" title="Jupiter (planet)">Jupiter</a>).</p>

<p>At the moment, according to the IAU, there is no agreed system for designating planets orbiting around other stars, nor is there any plan to create a naming system for extra-solar planets <a href="http://www.iau.org/PLANETS_AROUND_OTHER_STARS.247.0.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iau.org/PLANETS_AROUND_OTHER_STARS.247.0.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.
