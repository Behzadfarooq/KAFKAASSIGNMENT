<p>Paste it if you think is better, if not, your wording is good enough for me.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulletproof_vest.html" title="Bulletproof vest">Bulletproof vest</a> is a bad, bad title, really. To avoid endless discussions about which term is more "popular" I suggest to preserve "Bulletproof" as a redirection page with a brief explanation about the history of the term (in the renaissance they really "proofed" metallic armour shooting at it, so the hump of the bullet in the cuirass showed you that the gear was "proofed") and why is incorrect applied to contemporary ballistic vests.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_armour.html" title="Body armour">Body armour</a> is also a very bad title for an article about Ballistic vests. For instance: A helmet, any military helmet, from Corinthian classic helmets to the PASGT helmet, is also "Body armour". <s>Nevertheles, <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_armor.html" title="Body armor">Body armor</a> (and <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_armour.html" title="Body armour">Body armour</a>) should also be created</s>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>S**t!!!!!</b>. They are already redirected!. Bad, bad, bad. I have on my desk a book named "Body armour" <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1574882937</a>, that covers from wooden shields to riot police gear. Please fix this mess, Asterion, because the current presentation is misleading to the reader.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Done: I redirected <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_armor.html" title="Body armor">Body armor</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_armour.html" title="Body armour">Body armour</a> to <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armour.html" title="Armour">Armour</a>, that is the correct article. Users groaned and moaned in the talk pages of both pages about the incorrect redirection to "Bulletoproof vest". "Body Armour" can NOT be the new title for "Bulletpooff vest", the existence of <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armour.html" title="Armour">Armour</a> is just another reason.</dd>

<p>I have seen now your message, I was not aware that it was not allowed; I apologize and thank you for you warning. I was trying to alert Administrators to abusive tagging by Wikipedia editors, who joined like a gang, which have been deleting for a long time good science articles at Wikipedia, and no one seems to care to stop them.

To try to do this manually is not possible, ever. So though lots of users wont like having such a notice at the top of their page, it will give Wikipedia more cred on the internet.</p>
<p>Alternatively could contact Google and suggest that pages beginning [[User:... are not include in their searches.</p>

<dd>Apologies but I am not familiar with any of these historical figures (aside Bjelica because I'm a Real Betis supporter). In all honesty, it looks as a content dispute and Aldux has not used any special admin buttons. Any editor can revert an edit if they think it is not verifiable. All I can say is that you could place a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">request for comments</a> for uninvolved editors to express their views.

<dd>Heh well the problem is I don't really know how to do that, even with the explnation it seems extremely complicated to me. The point is that this is really a minor problem. The person in question (Aldux) seems to removing valid content such as the names in Croatian for those people and cat's connected with them and even corrections to the link. For example in <a href="../../../g/i/o/Giovanni_Luppis_b85d.html" title="Giovanni Luppis">Giovanni Luppis</a> he keeps reverting <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austro-Hungarian_Navy_95f9.html" title="Austro-Hungarian Navy">Austro-Hungarian Navy</a> to non-existant Austrian Navy and putting construction 'Italian Officer' when the man was born, lived and died in Austria-Hungary so he could have been only Austro-Hungarian officer (that he was an ethnic Italian no one disputes). In Francesco Patrizi article he again removes his name in Croatia and Croatian cat while putting cat "Italians from Yugoslavia"?! The man was born in 16th century there was no Yugoslavia, same for Italy, he was Venetian (Republic of Venice) and if this designation is good for <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marco_Polo_5cb9.html" title="Marco Polo">Marco Polo</a> it's good for Patrizi as well. The same goes for Meldolla and Cotrugli. And Nenad Bjelica as a Serb is totally unreferenced, there is absolutly no proof or source given to this claim. Please mediate! --89.172.201.74 06:23, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hi Asterion. Actually, I don't see it as a content dispute, I mean on my part; there is obviously a content dispute among editors, but this doesn't involve me, as I'm agnostic regarding the nationalities of these guys, and really don't care much. To be clearer, if a legitimate editor inserted the same content I would have no reason to rollback, as I'm only interested here in preventing <a href="../../../a/f/r/User%7EAfrika_paprika_123c.html" title="User:Afrika paprika">Afrika paprika</a> (<a href="../../../a/f/r/User_talk%7EAfrika_paprika_bc8d.html" title="User talk:Afrika paprika">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Afrika_paprika_bcfc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Afrika paprika">contribs</a>) from attempting to evade his ban, and blocking his new socks. All the content Afrika/Factanista is speaking of regards edits made by others, and not by me; as far as I remember, I only copyedited Andrea Meldolla, that had been written in a very bad English. You may have noted that all the articles in question are semiprotected; this was because of Afrika's sockpuppeterring, that forced me to raise a chain of sp articles to make his activities more difficult. To circumvent this, he created <a href="../../../p/r/a/User%7EPraskaton_f9fc.html" title="User:Praskaton">Praskaton</a> (<a href="../../../p/r/a/User_talk%7EPraskaton_887d.html" title="User talk:Praskaton">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Praskaton_df25.html" title="Special:Contributions/Praskaton">contribs</a>), that, strangely, edited only the article that are sp because of Afrika, and restored Afrika/Factanista's previous edits. And a last note: the IP that sent this complaint is in the range of Afrika's ip accounts, see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Afrika_paprika_1ebb.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Afrika paprika">Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Afrika paprika</a>.

<p>I have been dealing with the article on adolesescence, namely the part on adolescent sexuality and neogitiating the removal of data of HIGHLY dubious viability and which is obviously opinionated (Lot's of the data is from a single book by leonard sax which is not easily accessible by the average person) And i have placed in more accurate and backed up Center for disease control data on adolescent rates of std transmission/pregnancy rates which have been CONSISTENTLY deleted along with the references DESPITE my asking for proof of sax's 'studies' and 'facts' to be given in an internet reference and for possible other sources on this controversial subject to be used that aren't obviously against it.</p>
<p>What concerns me the most is that it is FILLED with data from just ONE book by a supposed guru on adolescence who claims to have all the facts on teen sexuality and it's dangers and how while my attempts to make the article more nuetral and at least input data from both sides of the debate are overwritten...</p>
<p>There's the fact that some teen or parent might go to the article on adolesence and after reading a few paragraphs on the topic of teen sexuality (Which despite my best efforts is somehow constantly returned back to it's highly biased and non nuetral state by trolls) would declare it horribly dangerous and thus likely cause A LOT of worries, suppression, etc. etc. and EVEN MORE fear about the horrors of teen sex, WITHOUT even allowing for opinions to prove that STD transmission rates and pregnancies have gone down among teens in the last few years without being waaaayyy at the bottom behind the MASSES of Leonard Sax and exclusively right wing opninions, I'm requesting that the topic is locked until a consensus can be reached and if no proof of the dubious (at best) claims about teenage emotional shallowness can be brough out that someone helps me to stop this constant trolling....</p>
<p>The anti vandalism bot reverted my correction where i moved up the CDC data to the top and added teen sexuality based on country to the almost original super biased state...</p>
<p>I've decided to take this to an administrator and i think that you might be correct, currently I am about the only person to be against what i see as unnuetral, biased, and un wikified data on teen sexuality and I'm wondering if you could scan over the current version (It might have been reverted by someone again to it's old state which is what concerns me the most) And perhaps revert it to my version and lock it down until my concerns can be met.</p>
<p>Yours desperately,</p>

<p>Hi. I happened across some of LibearyGay's edits and I think Rainbowangie is just trying to revert some of their overzealous changes. I'm not really sure why Rainbowangie was blocked, but if you take a look at Libeary's edit history you will see they are going around adding speedy deletion templates all over the wiki for petty reasons on articles that if they were to be deleted should probably be taken to AfD. I'm not really familiar with wiki-stalking, but I think Rainbowangie's behavior is justified. Anyway, I'd appreciate another head being involved with the situation.

<dd>I agree with what you were saying about the single purpose account thing. I thought it was odd that two new users would have such an intricate knowledge of templates and stuff. I do have a comment about the speedy delete template. "If this page does not meet the criteria for speedy deletion, or you intend to fix it, please remove this notice, but do not remove this notice from pages that you have created yourself. If you created this page and you disagree with this page’s proposed speedy deletion, please add:" Rainbowangie was cited for removing the speedy delete template, but as evidenced by their edit history, did not create the article. What is the procedure behind removing inappropriate speedy delete templates? Should that wording be changed that only administrators should remove the template? Just curious what you thought.

<p>Thank you for the answer. Have you read my comments about the Racak incident? I would also like to know why we can not use the word massacre when all the sources use this word. Why can we use it here e.g <a href="../../../k/r/a/Kragujevac_massacre.html" title="Kragujevac massacre">Kragujevac massacre</a> --<a href="../../../n/o/a/User%7ENoah30_7da6.html" title="User:Noah30">Noah30</a> 20:30, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I will be reverting the title of the Podujevo article to Podujevo massacre. Generally massacre is used for "individual events of deliberate and direct mass killing, especially of noncombatant civilians or other innocents without any reasonable means of defense". As Racak is still unclear, this is why this is called "incident". Regarding Podujevo, I can not find anyone disputing the civilian nature of the victims, therefore I think that it is better to keep the original title.

All my reverts are already covered by very extensive discussion on the talk pages. The point is - I've removed pseudo-historical claims&#160;: a) Kingdom of Croatia did not exts after being conquered by Hungarians 1189 - ask about it a qualified historian of the medieval Europe b) Clovio's Croatian origins is forgery coming from today's Croatia. The message, as left on my talk page I could understand only as a grave ofense.--<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiorgioOrsini_2f95.html" title="User:GiorgioOrsini">Giorgio Orsini</a> 03:58, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks.

<dd>This is a mistake, I think. In Spanish, <i>to drown</i> is said <i>ahogar(se)</i>: "Pedro se ahogó". It can be used in non-reflexive meaning as well: "Pedro ahogó a la gata". I think that it would be the same in Italian but Aldux should be able to confirm this. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAsterion_ed2e.html" title="User:Asterion"><span style="color:#0000FF;font-weight:bold;"><b>Asterion</b></span></a><sup><strong class="selflink"><span style="color:#00EF00;"><b>talk</b></span></strong></sup> 20:00, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I was wondering- do you think this template should be made a bit more friendly? What do you think of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello <i>User:X</i>, thank you for your contributions. Wikipedia has a <a href="../../../u/n/_/WP%7EUN_1761.html" title="WP:UN">policy</a> on what usernames editors can use. Unfortunately, concerns have been raised that your username may be <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUsername_0c30.html#Inappropriate_usernames" title="Wikipedia:Username">incompatible</a> with that policy. You can contribute to the discussion about it <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_NAME_d5f0.html" title="WP:RFC/NAME">here</a>. Alternatively, if you agree that your username may be problematic and are willing to change it, it is possible for you to keep your present contributions under a new name. Simply request a new name <a href="../../../c/h/u/WP%7ECHU_759d.html" title="WP:CHU">here</a> following the guidelines on that page. Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems worth pointing out how easily names can be changed and that no one is necessarily accusing them of bad faith... <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a></span> 03:19, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Along the same line of thought, I've created a followup, {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsernameAllowed_1a93.html" title="Template:UsernameAllowed">UsernameAllowed</a>}}, to tell the user if the discussion was closed in his favor. Otherwise, the first notice would linger on, still saying the issue is in doubt, still pointing to a discussion that isn't there any more. Please consider this a "matching bookend": the two templates indicate the beginning and (favorable) end of the RFC/NAME.

<dd>And another new template, {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsernameConcern_47f1.html" title="Template:UsernameConcern">UsernameConcern</a>}}, to begin discussion directly with the user <b>before</b> going to RFC/NAME, for those of us too harried and/or tired to type up a long and diplomatic note by hand. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenedict_the_Moor_1d60.html" title="User:Benedict the Moor">Ben</a> 00:59, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On the WikiProject Countries talk page, you had either explictly declared a general interest in the project, or had participated at a discussion that appears related to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Countries_c1c1.html#Location_Maps_for_European_countries" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Countries">Location Maps for European countries</a>.<br />
New maps had been created by David Liuzzo, and are available for the countries of the <i>European continent</i>, and for countries of the <i>European Union</i> exist in two versions. From <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_16.html" title="November 16">November 16</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> till <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_31.html" title="January 31">January 31</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>, a poll had tried to find a consensus for usage of 'old' or of which and where 'new' version maps. At its closing, 25 people had spoken in favor of either of the two presented usages of new versions but neither version had reached a consensus (12 and 13), and 18 had preferred old maps.<br />
As this outcome cannot justify reverting of new maps that had become used for some countries, seconds before <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_5.html" title="February 5">February 5</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> a survey started that will be closed at <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_20.html" title="February 20">February 20</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> 23:59:59. It should establish whether the new style maps may be applied as soon as some might become available for countries outside the European continent (or such to depend on future discussions), and also which new version should be applied for which countries.<br />
Please note that since <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> all new maps became updated by David Liuzzo (including a world locator, enlarged cut-out for small countries) and as of <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_4.html" title="February 4">February 4</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> the restricted licence that had jeopardized their availability on Wikimedia Commons, became more free. The subsections on the talk page that had shown David Liuzzo's original maps, now show his most recent design.<br />

<p>I am wondering what can someone do to stop vandalising and propaganist revisionism on Wikipedia? Currently there are a number of Italian users (<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni_Giove_12a0.html" title="User:Giovanni Giove">User:Giovanni Giove</a> and <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiorgioOrsini_2f95.html" title="User:GiorgioOrsini">User:GiorgioOrsini</a>), among them even a moderator (<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">User:Aldux</a>), who constantly revert and have reverted and prevented others to remove their falsifictions with the help of the mentioned moderator. Their target: medieval, baroque and renaissance Croatian writers, philosophers, scientists, etc. from Venetian Dalmatia have been stripped of their Croatian notes and identities in Wiki articles. These people lived in bilingual society where one had two and somtimes even three or more versions of their name: Croatian, Venetian (Italian) and Latin most commonly. You can find examples of such reverts all over the place: <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedetto_Cotrugli_7c39.html" title="Benedetto Cotrugli">Benedetto Cotrugli</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francesco_Patrizi_7ce0.html" title="Francesco Patrizi">Francesco Patrizi</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/j/Stjepan_Gradi%C4%87_9f08.html" title="Stjepan Gradić">Stjepan Gradić</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joakim_Stulli_086b.html" title="Joakim Stulli">Joakim Stulli</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Ragusa_4b76.html" title="Republic of Ragusa">Republic of Ragusa</a>, <a href="../../../i/v/a/Ivan_Lu%C4%8Di%C4%87_2122.html" title="Ivan Lučić">Ivan Lučić</a>, <a href="../../../g/i/o/Giovanni_Luppis_b85d.html" title="Giovanni Luppis">Giovanni Luppis</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Croats_4dba.html" title="List of Croats">List of Croats</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrea_Meldolla_8e4c.html" title="Andrea Meldolla">Andrea Meldolla</a>, <a href="../../../i/v/a/Ivan_Duknovi%C4%87_4698.html" title="Ivan Duknović">Ivan Duknović</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/r/Juraj_Dalmatinac_aaed.html" title="Juraj Dalmatinac">Juraj Dalmatinac</a>, etc. , etc....it's getting ridiculous and no one is doing anything about it.

<dd>Just a quick answer. I will try to look into this later on. First, I do not think Aldux is doing anything else but enforcing the community ban. Second, I have warned <a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiorgioOrsini_2f95.html" title="User:GiorgioOrsini">User:GiorgioOrsini</a> in the past and will be keeping a close eye on him indeed. Third, I suggest you try to appeal your ban as it is wikipedia policy to revert any edits by banned users, independently of whether you think these are legit or not.

The questions I raised regarding the decision of the Kosovo arbcom were:</p>
<ul>
<li>why did the <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosovo.html" title="Kosovo">Kosovo</a> arbcom consider my misconduct on the <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_massacre.html" title="Srebrenica massacre">Srebrenica massacre</a> article? Nowehere is the Srebrenica massacre article names as a 'related article'. Nowhere is the reasoning for linking the two articles given.</li>
<li>it seems a rather harsh remedy to give me one years probation and revert parole for a 'crime' which I had already served time for (so to say).</li>
<li>is it possible to appeal the Kosovo arbcom's decision?</li>
</ul>

<p>Hi Asterion. I see you are both Andalusian and a civil wikipedian so I thought it was good to check this with you first: in the Spain main article, the Languages section has Andalusian dialect included. I feel like this doesn't belong <i>in that context</i>. So, don't get me wrong, not that I am denying that may be important for some but I think is overstating its importance to display it in the Spanish languages section. I'd go and remove it but, just in case you added it or just have a different opinion, I would like to hear it.

<dd>No problem at all with the delay. While not denying the differences, I just thought that it didn't belong in the main article, not even in the relevant section which, in my opinion, should be more focused in "proper" languages (if you asked me whether "Asturian" or "Aragonese" are proper languages...I'd better keep my mouth shut). There has been some cleaning up effort in the article lately and I think is a good idea try to reduce content there and redirect it to more relevant articles. Besides, I am guessin that "andaluz" in Almería is quite different from "andaluz" in Seville and the same say between Cádiz and Jaén, in other words, this info is best explained in detail in the relevant article, instead of presenting a bulk info in the main article. Anyway, it seems we are fine with this.

<dd>Yes, this seems to be a common problem with Spain-related articles. People just try to fit everything in the main one instead of starting individual ones and adding a link back. Hopefully if the Spain Wikiproject takes off the situation will improve.

<p>hello there,</p>
<p>there was a mediation offer quite a while ago concerning the issue of <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trentino-South_Tyrol_c812.html" title="Trentino-South Tyrol">Trentino-South Tyrol</a>. I am happy to announce that the issue has been discussed, voted upon and settled. However the mediation offer still needs to be officially closed. Please take a minute to visit the page <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2006-10-20_Trentino-South_Tyrol_6102.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-10-20 Trentino-South Tyrol">Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-10-20 Trentino-South Tyrol</a> and put your signature at the bottom if you agree with the decision, thank you. sincerely <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGryffindor_3473.html" title="User:Gryffindor"><font color="red">Gryffindor</font></a> 20:25, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>A very important note. This mediation offer concerned the greater overall naming convention to use in this region, not just the name of the region itself. We came up with a very good compromise for the regional name itself. I for one am still looking forward for <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a> to help us out.

<p>Hi Asterion. I was updating this table and have hit here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Catalonia" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Catalonia" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> the PSA. I know what's that, it is the Partido Socialista Andaluz, which in the first Catalan elections to the Catalan Parliament won a handful of seats.</p>
<p>Now, the question I have for you is: do you know if this is a defunct party? I suspect yes, but I don't know.</p>
<p>I think this is not to be confused to the latter Partido Socialista de Andalucía by Pedro Pacheco (la justicia es una cachondeo&#160;;) because the latter seems to be a Andalucía only and newer party, but I don't have a clue for the Partido Socialista Andaluz, which shares the acronym with...is it a refoundation?</p>
<p>The Partido Socialista Andaluz (the one which took a few seats in the Catalan election) does not have an article in the Spanish wikipedia either and the existing entry for the Pacheco party does not mention the former, so I am confused.</p>
<p>Anyway, you have a nice Easter and just let me know when possible, so that I can complete the updating of that table. <a href="../../../m/o/u/User%7EMountolive_175f.html" title="User:Mountolive">Mountolive</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/u/User_talk%7EMountolive_3eea.html" title="User talk:Mountolive">Talk</a> 05:27, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../m/o/u/User%7EMountolive_175f.html" title="User:Mountolive">Mountolive</a>, technically speaking, it is the Partido Andalucista (at the time, still including Pacheco in its ranks). The PSA was born in 1976 out of Alianza Socialista de Andalucía (ASA) and Reconstrucción Socialista de Andalucía (RSA). ASA was the main regionalist party and one of the most active members of the democratic opposition during the late Franco period. Shortly after, the first ever <i>mitin</i> since the Spanish Civil War was organised by ASA in February 1976 (it was also the first time the Andalusian flag was allowed to be waved in a public event. This <a href="http://www.andalucia.cc/adarve/andalucismoencatalunya/02.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.andalucia.cc/adarve/andalucismoencatalunya/02.pdf" rel="nofollow">article</a> is quite comprehensive. The PSA cannot be understood without considering the situation of the Andalusian immigrants in Catalonia. You could even say that at the time, it was more successful over there than in Andalusia, where it ran in coalition with Tierno Galván's Partido Socialista Popular, got a single MP in 1977, who later defected to PSOE, leaving them without parliamentary representation (got to love politics!&#160;;-)) <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAsterion_ed2e.html" title="User:Asterion"><span style="color:#0000FF;font-weight:bold;"><b>Asterion</b></span></a><sup><strong class="selflink"><span style="color:#00EF00;"><b>talk</b></span></strong></sup> 11:58, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Había que vernos, dando voces en andaluz por los pueblos de cinturón de Barcelona a favor de Jordi Pujol"...yes, really, you've got to love them!&#160;:D</dd>
<dd>That's an interesting paper indeed (thank you)...and not only because you got to see Federico Jiménez Losantos as the responsible of the PSA-Aragon branch.... in Catalonia, which sounds kinda humourous these days, don't you think?</dd>
<dd>Still, mhh... there's something I don't get: you say that the PSA is the immediate predecessor of the PA but, I seem to understand from that paper that they were not in the same structure (I mean PSA in Andalucía and PSA in Catalonia, Aragón and elsewhere) but they were autonomous cells, in other words, there was not any General Secretary in Seville or anywhere in Andalucía that the PSA Catalan branch reported to, they just freely coordinated policies, is this correct?</dd>
<dd>I need this info to list the PSA in that Catalan politics table either as a local party or Spain-wide.</dd>
<dd>What seems confirmed from that paper is that the PSA is definitely defunct, right? I will list it as defunct party there, then.</dd>
