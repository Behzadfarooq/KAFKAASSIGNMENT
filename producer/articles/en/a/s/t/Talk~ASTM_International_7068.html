I just looked at this article for the first time. As one interested in ASTM, it seems a bit thin. In writing articles that reference ASTM, I would expect anyone clicking the wikilink would get a rasonably detailed description of what the organization does. I'm immediately struck by the fact that the article and its links do not actually tell the reader what a Standard is. The ASTM definition of a standard, at least in paraphrase, would appear to be essential information. Rules on committee balance are also important information that is missing. I would normally jump straight in and do a major re-write, as I have done in other cases. However, looking through the history page, I notice a major chunk of stuff eliminated 19 Sept 2006, and I got cold feet. What's the problem? Shall I go ahead and add these features? Does someone else want to?</p>

<dd>It looks like that huge chunk removed by <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">User:Argyriou</a> was copied straight from ASTM's <a href="http://www.astm.org/ABOUT/" class="external text" title="http://www.astm.org/ABOUT/" rel="nofollow">website</a>. It also has a significant amount of self-touting weasel words and phrases such as "a trusted source for technical standards..." and "ASTM answered the call..." And speaks nothing of the criticisms of ASTM. It was probably easier to simply dump the sections rather than rewrite them at the time.<br />
You're welcome to dig in if you want; aside from using the standards in practice, I have very little familiarity with their organizational side. <b><i><a href="../../../z/u/e/User%7EZuejay_84ee.html" title="User:Zuejay"><font face="Times New Roman" color="darkblue">Zue</font></a></i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zuejay_251c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zuejay"><font face="Times New Roman" color="blue">Jay</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../z/u/e/User_talk%7EZuejay_2f5e.html" title="User talk:Zuejay">talk</a>)</small></b> 14:58, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some of these links seem very appropriate, such as the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_materials_properties.html" title="List of materials properties">List of materials properties</a> which references ASTM. <b><i><a href="../../../z/u/e/User%7EZuejay_84ee.html" title="User:Zuejay"><font face="Times New Roman" color="darkblue">Zue</font></a></i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zuejay_251c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zuejay"><font face="Times New Roman" color="blue">Jay</font></a><sup><a href="../../../z/u/e/User_talk%7EZuejay_2f5e.html" title="User talk:Zuejay">talk</a></sup></b> 05:30, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Instead, the reader should check <i>what links here</i>. ASTM has thousands of committees, and lists them all on its website. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_materials_properties.html" title="List of materials properties">List of materials properties</a> is borderline not allowed in wikipedia, being little more than a list. <a href="../../../u/n/a/User%7EUna_Smith_5169.html" title="User:Una Smith">Una Smith</a> 15:31, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The link to NFPA is also extraneous. NFPA is just one of thousands of other organizations that have some role in developing standards. But NFPA is not principally a standards developing organization; NFPA also adopts standards, and has other purposes. There are other, more relevant wikipedia pages to which this one should be linked, but that a job for someone who knows a lot about standards. <a href="../../../u/n/a/User%7EUna_Smith_5169.html" title="User:Una Smith">Una Smith</a> 15:55, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, so some of these links are definitely questionable. The <a href="../../../s/e/a/Search_and_rescue.html" title="Search and rescue">Search and rescue</a> one was way out there. I didn't feel right taking NFPA off the list until I looked further into it; it does serve more purposes than just standards issuing and thus might be, as you indicated, a stretch; I think we can ding it for now (until another editor goes <i>Hey!</i> anyway&#160;;) ).<br />
The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_materials_properties.html" title="List of materials properties">materials properties</a> is the type of thing I primarily use ASTM for; but ASTM issues many standards ranging from those to other, stranger, stuff (I think there's one involving a highchair). I'm walking the line on this one - probably because that's what I, and most other, <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_engineering.html" title="Civil engineering">civil engineers</a> utilize the standards for. We might need a third opinion on that. (And as to whether or not the list shoud exist - you might consider raising that question on the bugger's <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_materials_properties_8ed2.html" title="Talk:List of materials properties">talk</a> page; its a valid one.)<br />
However, I would like to include <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration_2163.html" title="Occupational Safety and Health Administration">OSHA</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Association_of_State_Highway_and_Transportation_Officials_ea71.html" title="American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials">AASHTO</a> whose primary goals are to develop standards (and enforce, in the case of OSHA).

All the individual orgs and agencies should be listed on <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standards_organizations.html" title="Standards organizations">Standards organizations</a> page.

It has been my experience that people who are interested in standards but are not members of ASTM do not understand that anyone who wants to pay $75/year can be a member. And that any member can vote on any standard (although as a rule most don't exercise that right). <a href="../../../u/n/a/User%7EUna_Smith_5169.html" title="User:Una Smith">Una Smith</a> 18:38, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I added (under Membership) a sentence defining the the categories of members. This was necessary in order to define the balance and voting rules. This rendered the sentence in the preamble redundant. Multiple votes (as I pointed out) are not allowed. I was for years the voting member for a company that had over twenty ASTM members. None of the others could vote. Failure to vote on ballots results in expulsion from committees, so voting members had better exercise their right. Anyone can vote in Task Groups, but these do not make standards. I guess I can dig out the references from the rule book if you're not convinced by this. . . .<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinguisticDemographer_342e.html" title="User:LinguisticDemographer">LinguisticDemographer</a> 19:49, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>You were an organizational representative, casting the organization's vote. In some ASTM committees it is common practice for all members to be individual members, each one with an individual vote. To be really technical about it, if task groups do not make standards then subcommittees and committees also do not make them, because there is yet another level of review: society review. ASTM's rule book is online, BTW, and I have a copy.</p>
<p>I just want the intro to state that ASTM has a significant and growing international membership; it isn't a purely "American" (meaning USA) standards organization. <a href="../../../u/n/a/User%7EUna_Smith_5169.html" title="User:Una Smith">Una Smith</a> 01:17, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Fine: thanks for the addition. It might be worth while finding out the proportion of non-North American members (of which I'm one). I'll see what I can dig out. . . .<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinguisticDemographer_342e.html" title="User:LinguisticDemographer">LinguisticDemographer</a> 08:42, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
