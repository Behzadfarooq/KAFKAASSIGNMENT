<p>The earliest explicit references to asteroids date from the beginning of the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">twentieth century</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Hector Servadac, Voyages et aventures à travers le Monde Solaire</i> (<i>Off on a Comet</i>, 1877), novel by <a href="../../../j/u/l/Jules_Verne_fa88.html" title="Jules Verne">Jules Verne</a>. A <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_era.html" title="Victorian era">Victorian</a> vision of touring the solar system <i>via</i> handy "comet Gallia", the comet captures the "recently discovered asteroid <i>Nerina</i>" as it traverses the asteroid belt. Nerina was fictional at the time, but 1318 Nerina would be discovered and named by Cyril V. Jackson nearly sixty years later.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../e/d/i/Edison%27s_Conquest_of_Mars_d6a4.html" title="Edison's Conquest of Mars">Edison's Conquest of Mars</a></i> (1898), serial by Garrett P. Serviss. A fleet of spaceships from Earth on its way to attack Mars halts at an asteroid that is being mined for gold by the Martians.</li>
<li><i>La Chasse au météore</i> ("Hunt for the Meteor", or "Chase of the Golden Meteor", 1908), by <a href="../../../j/u/l/Jules_Verne_fa88.html" title="Jules Verne">Jules</a> and Michel Verne. This posthumously published <a href="../../../j/u/l/Jules_Verne_fa88.html" title="Jules Verne">Jules Verne</a> novel was extensively edited and modified by his son Michel. The attribution of plot elements between father and son was long debated, until Verne's original version was unearthed. The book begins with the rivalry between two amateur astronomers who both claim discovery of a new asteroid. Originally an in-crowd issue among astronomers, it becomes a major world-wide problem when it is found that the asteroid is about to fall on Earth (to be exact, in Greenland). Unlike later asteroid books, the main problem is not the damage which its fall may cause, but the fact that it is made of solid gold, which could upset the economy of the world. Thus, the asteroid's eventual fall into the Atlantic and its disappearance beneath the waves is presented as a satisfactory aversion of the economic danger, and there are none of the huge and highly destructive tsunami which in later stories (and in reality) would have followed.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></li>
<li><i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Valley_of_Fear_48b1.html" title="The Valley of Fear">The Valley of Fear</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/1/1914.html" title="1914">1914</a>), short story by Sir <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Conan_Doyle_84ae.html" title="Arthur Conan Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>. <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professor_Moriarty_f2fa.html" title="Professor Moriarty">Professor Moriarty</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherlock_Holmes_4282.html" title="Sherlock Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a>' arch-enemy, "is the celebrated author of <i>"<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dynamics_of_an_Asteroid_bb82.html" title="The Dynamics of an Asteroid">The Dynamics of an Asteroid</a>"</i>, a book which ascends to such rarefied heights of pure mathematics that it is said that there was no man in the scientific press capable of criticizing it" Though the Holmes stories were published at the same time as those by <a href="../../../h/2E/_/H._G._Wells_6b56.html" title="H. G. Wells">H. G. Wells</a>, Holmes regards astronomical studies as an issue of pure abstract science, which would never have practical applications or provide the scene of future adventures.</li>

The <a href="../../../t/i/t/Title_role.html" title="Title role">title character</a> lives on an asteroid named "B-6-12". He then travels among various asteroids, each inhabited by a single person: a lamp-lighter, a king, a businessman, a geographer...Saint-Exupéry made no effort at scientific accuracy, since he was mainly writing social and political commentary and satire. (For example, his reference to "Baobab trees which, if not uprooted in time, might take root and break an asteroid to pieces" is commonly understood as an allegory of <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">Fascism</a>). Still, he seems the first writer to conceive of Asteroids as worlds where human beings could live and call home, an image which later writers were to develop with greater scientific plausibility.

<p>When the theme of interplanetary colonization first entered SF, the Asteroid Belt was quite low on the list of desirable real estate, far behind such planets as <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mars.html" title="Mars">Mars</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venus.html" title="Venus">Venus</a> (often conceived as a a kind of paradise planet, until probes in the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> revealed the appalling temperatures and conditions under its clouds). Thus, in many stories and books the Asteroid Belt, if not a positive hazard, is still a rarely-visited backwater in a colonized Solar System.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/t/Asteroids_in_fiction.html" title="Edit section: Mineral extraction">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mineral extraction</span></h3>
<p>The prospects of colonizing the Solar System planets became more dim with increasing discoveries about conditions on them. Conversely, the potential value of the asteroids increased, as a vast accumulation of mineral wealth, accessible in conditions of minimal gravity, and supplementing Earth's dwindling resources. Stories of asteroid mining became more and more numerous since the late <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940s</a>, with the next logical step being depictions of a society on terraformed asteroids — in some cases dug under the surface, in others having dome colonies and in still others provided with an atmosphere which is kept in place by an artificial gravity.</p>
<p>An image developed and was carried from writer to writer, of "Belters" or "Rock Rats" as rugged and independent-minded individuals, resentful of all Authority (in some books and stories of the military and political power of Earth-bound nation states, in others of the corporate power of huge companies). As such, this sub-genre proved naturally attractive to writers with <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarian.html" title="Libertarian">Libertarian</a> tendencies. Moreover, depictions of the Asteroid Belt as The New Frontier clearly draw (sometimes explicitly) on the considerable literature of the Nineteenth-Century <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frontier.html" title="Frontier">Frontier</a> and the <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wild_West_dfa6.html" title="Wild West">Wild West</a>. And since (in nearly all stories) the asteroids are completely lifeless until the arrival of the humans, it is a New Frontier completely free of the moral taint of the brutal dispossession of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States_7838.html" title="Native Americans in the United States">Native Americans</a> in the original.</p>

Earth, Mars, Venus and the Jovian Moons are all dominated by competing tyrannical political systems (a Communist one, a Fascist one, and a Capitalist "democracy" totally dominated by a single vast, all-owning and all-controlling corporation). The scattered, despised and numerically-inferior asteroid miners are left as the sole remaining champions of individual liberty. The "Rock Rats" neatly turn the tables by finding out how to produce energy from the collision of matter and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-matter.html" title="Anti-matter">anti-matter</a> asteroids (anti-matter or "Contraterrene" is the "Seetee" (C-T) of the title). Virtually unlimited energy is broadcast from the Asteroid Belt all over the Solar System, for everybody to tap and use completely free of charge — and all the oppressive systems go crashing down.</li>

A tense love affair takes place between an asterite entrepreneur, who represents a kind of reversion to 19th Century Capitalism, and a woman officer in a space warship sent by the Social Justice Party (in power at Washington D.C.) to clip that entrepreneur's wings. The encounter is the first skirmish in what eventually develops into a full-scale Asterite <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_Independence_9222.html" title="War of Independence">War of Independence</a> (consciously modelled on the American one), told of in further stories.

Miners, riding small "donkey ships", need to contend with both the harsh natural environment and with fierce human competitors. They must be ready at any moment to take up a gun or a bazooka to defend their finds of "grey matrix in which abyssal crystals occur". (The reader is not told what this may be, except that it is evidently valuable enough to kill for.) The extra-solar environment is chosen by Leinster in order to convey the feeling of an ever-expanding frontier - Sol's own Asteroid Belt has become "tame", as did the rings of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturn.html" title="Saturn">Saturn</a>, and the rough adventurous types move further on.

<p>Another way in which asteroids could be considered a source of danger is by depicting them as a hazard to navigation, especially threatening to ships travelling from Earth to the outer parts of the Solar System and thus needing to pass the Asteroid Belt (or make a time- and fuel-consuming detour around it). Asteroids in this context provide to space travel stories a space equivalent of reefs and underwater rocks in the older genre of sea-faring adventures stories. And like reefs and rocks in the ocean, asteroids as navigation hazards can also be used by bold outlaws to avoid pursuit.</p>
<p>Representations of the Asteroid Belt in film tend to make it unrealistically cluttered with dangerous rocks. In reality asteroids, even in the main belt, are spaced extremely far apart (even so, they can still be a risk to ships travelling at high speeds).</p>

<p>Before colonization of the asteroids became an attractive possibility, a main interest in them was theories as to their origin - specifically, the theory that the asteroids are remnants of an exploded planet. This naturally leads to SF plot lines dealing with the possibility that the planet had been inhabited, and if so -that the inhabitants caused its destruction themselves, by war or gross environmental mismanagement. A further extension is from the past of the existing asteroids to the possible future destruction of Earth or other planets and their rendering into new asteroids.</p>
