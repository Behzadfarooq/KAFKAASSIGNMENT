<p>Ashlie was born in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> and raised in Long Beach, and inherited the laid-back and down-to-earth Southern California attitude. At an extremely young age, her mother noticed the passion and excitement Ashlie had for performing and got her feet wet by introducing her to the world of modeling. She landed her first modeling job at the age of three and continued to model in many print ads, fashion shows and was a regular in Kmart's national advertising campaigns. At the age of six, Ashlie decided she no longer enjoyed, "having her hair curled" and desired something more interactive, so she began acting classes at the Beverly Hills Acting School. The owner of this renowned school noticed Ashlie immediately in a cattle call of nearly 1000 girls, zealously pursued her, and guaranteed that she would be signed in her first showcase, which she was…</p>
<p>With great support of her mother and father, Ashlie continued her pursuit in the performing arena…with countless dance, singing and acting classes. Meanwhile she also excelled in her school drama classes and gave stellar performances in many school plays. Though Ashlie was very shy in school, once she stepped onto a stage, it belonged to her and any trace of her shyness quickly disappeared. She aced her first ever television audition, leading her to a co-starring role on the new Disney show "Lizzie McGuire." As Lizzie's nemesis, Ashlie's character is the popular, pretty and utterly snobby junior high student we all love to hate. Another testament to her acting ability is the fact she can portray this character's attributes with great sincerity, while they are so opposite of her generous spirit and kind soul.</p>
<p>Following the momentous success of the television show, Disney created <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lizzie_McGuire_Movie_b69a.html" title="The Lizzie McGuire Movie">The Lizzie McGuire Movie</a>. Ashlie jumped at the chance of filming a movie, packed her bags, and traveled to both Canada and Rome for the filming. She relished in the opportunity to improve and diversify her acting skills on this new adventure. She counts the experience of working on her first feature film and working abroad, as one of the best experiences in her life so far.</p>
<p>Though acting is her passion and love, Ashlie thinks it is important to be a regular teenager, and always finds time to be with her two younger sisters, hang out with her friends, go to the beach and the movies. She excels in school, is dedicated to getting good grades and eventually graduating from college.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashlie_Brillault_e01d.html" title="Edit section: Charity work">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Charity work</span></h2>
<p>Charity work is also a top priority in Ashlie's life. She recognizes her tremendous blessings and feels a strong need to give back to her community. She resides as a board member of Kids with a Cause, an organization that works on different projects with low-income families, inner city youth, foster kids and cancer patients. In addition, she is involved with the Ronald McDonald House, Long Beach Child Cancer Center, and speaks at local high schools in connection with the DARE organization. Though acting keeps her busy, she finds the time to participate in at least one charity event a week. With grace, charisma, and beauty this exceptional young actress will continue to light up the screen for countless years to come</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashlie_Brillault_e01d.html" title="Edit section: Personal life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Personal life</span></h2>
<p>Ashlie Brillault is a talented young actress best known for her role as Kate, classmate of Lizzie, in the Lizzie McGuire Show and movie. Ashlie is nothing like the snobbish, self-centered character she portrays in the show. The real Ashlie is quick to point out she loves her family and making children happy. She exudes a friendly, bubbly and outgoing personality. A California native, 16-year-old Ashlie was born in San Francisco. Her debut into public life began at age three modeling in a bridal party. By age four Ashlie’s creativity led her into directing small neighborhood drama productions of Cinderella, her favorite fairytale.</p>
<p>Ashlie is unmistakably devoted to her craft. “I love the whole experience. Of course I love the acting part of it. It is really fun to play a different character, someone who isn’t like you in real life."</p>
<p>Ashlie has studied various acting systems and techniques, but her foremost approach to playing a role is to understand the character from different points of view. She reads the script many times, picking up nuances about the character as well as what other characters are saying. Ashlie credits family support as well. "My little sisters help me out a lot when I have a script, and I’ll practice it with them and they tell me what they think about it."</p>
<p>And she doesn’t take her success for granted. “I love how exciting it is to actually be on a movie or TV show set — it’s not something that a lot of people get to do."</p>
<p>It was of course several years after those neighborhood performances that Ashlie auditioned for the role of Lizzie in the Lizzie McGuire show, and ended up landing the role of Kate.</p>
<p>Ashlie's incredible talent is apparent in her convincing portrayal of the arrogant Kate — she is constantly mistaken for the character she plays. People frequently approach her, wondering how she could treat Lizzie so shamefully. Of course, anyone who knows Ashlie knows she is far from the character she portrays.</p>
<p>And Ashlie has yet to come up with a response she is satisfied with. “I have no idea how to answer that. People are always asking me, ‘Why are you so mean to Lizzie?’”</p>
<p>“Should I say, ‘ It’s a conflict character so she has to do that,’ or ‘it’s what the writers told me to do,’ or maybe they want me to answer it like Kate and say, ‘Oh, it’s because I don’t like Lizzie.’ ”</p>
<p>While Ashlie isn’t certain how to answer those questions, what is certain is that the questions are a testament to her acting ability and how believable Kate is to viewers.</p>
<p>The Lizzie McGuire show and film are relevant to today’s younger audiences. Ashlie said, “I feel the show deals with a lot of things people go through, especially when they are in middle school. People can relate to it. It always has an ending that is very moral. It influences people, when they are in that situation, to do the right thing.”</p>
<p>Ashlie believes the show influences kids in a positive way, teaching them to become better persons with values and compassion towards others. “Because that’s definitely what Lizzie represents. Lizzie is always contemplating what she should do, but in the end she always chooses the right way."</p>
<p>Ashlie actively supports several charities, her favorite being a relative new organization, “Kids With a Cause.” It initially consisted of young actors and musicians helping less privileged children by spending time with them.</p>
<p>“It is really cool, because rather than sending them a check, it is great to be able to actually be there with the kids, and see how hanging out with them has really made their day and how excited they are," Ashlie explained. Kids With a Cause is a Los Angeles based charity, but is expanding throughout the country as well as Canada, where Ashlie recently participated in the organization’s opening there.</p>
<p>Ashlie’s compassion for children was evident as I told her about Patricia, a little girl who is a huge fan of the show, who needs a back operation, and it is no wonder that Ashlie is active in numerous charities.</p>
<p>A conversation with Ashlie about school brings home the fact that while she has had tremendous success in acting, and is active in charity work, she is at the same time a regular teenager. A high school junior, her classes include English honors, intermediate algebra, US history, science honors, AP psychology and French. Her favorite subject is American history, and not surprising, her favorite film is “The Patriot." Ashlie says she would love to do a film like that, dealing with either the American Revolution or the Civil War.</p>
<p>Even though Ashlie excels in homework, like most kids, that isn’t her favorite part of high school. And like most kids her age, she loves school because she gets to hang out with friends. And like many other youngsters, middle school was a challenge. She felt that some kids identified her with her character, Kate. “They thought I was really snobby and just like my character, even though they had never even talked with me in real life. That made it really hard."</p>
<p>One might wonder how Ashlie could be a movie star recognized all over the world and still be a regular teenager. When she first started high school she would get numerous requests for autographs. But now she is just another student to her classmates. The exception being freshmen who still ask her for an autograph.</p>
<p>Ashlie is close to her family, and during our talk her mom was nearby. Even though Ashlie has had more success than the average teenager, she definitely doesn’t come across as knowing it all. It was indeed heartening to hear Ashlie at times depend on her mother for guidance. And this goes to further prove the point that Ashlie is nothing like Kate.</p>
<p>You can watch Ashlie Brillault on two new DVDs Disney is releasing on December 9: "Fashionably Lizzie" and "Growing Up Lizzie." Each of these DVDs contains four episodes of the television show.</p>
