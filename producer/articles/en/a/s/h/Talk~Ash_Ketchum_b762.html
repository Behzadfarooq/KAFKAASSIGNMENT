<dd>That's one of the greatest mysteries of Ash, Who is his father? Since he has never appeared pointed out, we don't know if he's even still around. There's a page at <a href="http://www.pikasurf.com/index.php?ps=evidence/tioad" class="external text" title="http://www.pikasurf.com/index.php?ps=evidence/tioad" rel="nofollow">Pikasurf</a> discussing that matter and speculating a little. The <a href="http://www.pokemon.com/mailbag" class="external text" title="http://www.pokemon.com/mailbag" rel="nofollow">US Pokémon Company</a>* has said that they wish to keep this matter a mystery, though.

<p>Was <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larvitar.html" title="Larvitar">Larvitar</a> ever part of Ash's Team? This is an issue in the anime that we must put in this article in an NPOV manner.</p>
<p>Those who say yes cite that Larvitar opened itself to Ash, and Ash had commanded it to attack (Ash ordered Larvitar to use Hidden Power on TR on numerous occasions). Those who say no cite that Ash carried six Pokémon with him already (Bayleef, Cyndaquil, Totodile, Noctowl, Phanpy, and Pikachu - you see all seven Pokémon in a scene where Ash and his team are stuck in a TR truck), and that on numerous occasions they referred to Larvitar as a wild Pokémon (note the crowd at the foot of Mt. Silver where a lot of trainers wanted to catch it). Of course, we must consider other story factors such as the increasing divergence between the games and the anime.</p>

<dd>If Haunter is there, Larvitar deserves to be there. Ash had Larvitar for a number of episodes, so it is worth adding, but mentioning the above point that the matter is disputed. <a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonic_Mew_f169.html" title="User:Sonic Mew">Sonic Mew</a> 18:47, May 19, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, no one has complained, so I've added Larvitar, though with this on the end: (Note that it is disputed whether Ash actually <i>caught</i> Larvitar.) <a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonic_Mew_f169.html" title="User:Sonic Mew">Sonic Mew</a> 08:54, Jun 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In Red Version, although this wasn't in a "battle", Ash was eaten by a Mewtwo. This is known because it is mentioned numerous times, including once not long after when Mewtwo coughed up Ash's hat, and again in a scene in Red's "Black Version" (where KO'd characters go) where Ash criticized 3 Mewtwos, saying one of them was the reason he was there. (It was #2, which commented that he did taste good) <small>(Unsigned comment by 198.107.38.90 (<a href="../../../1/9/8/User_talk%7E198.107.38.90.html" title="User talk:198.107.38.90">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_198.107.38.90_618a.html" title="Special:Contributions/198.107.38.90">contribs</a>))</small></p>

<p><i>Ash is credited with being part of an emotional crisis with girls. During the first seasons of the show, Misty has a large crush on him, despite their rivalry. Ash, however, either didn't notice, or didn't care. When the traditional group (Ash, Misty, and Brock) was forced to split up, he hurt Misty's feelings by not appearing to care very much, which caused her to flee amid tears. Ash himself was very confused. After returning to her job as Cerulean Gym Leader, Misty began to develop a growing friendship with Tracey Sketchit, and the beginnings of the same type of crush she still fostered for Ash grew on Tracey, as well. Meanwhile, separated from Misty, Ash began to realize he did indeed care about Misty and that he missed her a lot. Some fans speculate that when he returns to Kanto to see Misty (who is harboring feelings for both boys) he and Tracey will clash, resulting in a rivalry. While in the Hoenn region, however, May is developing a similar crush on Ash, though her feelings are not nearly as powerful as Misty's. Ash, however, seems to have noticed this time (perhaps because of the incident with the group splitup) and is returning the favor, to an extremely small degree. The debate on whether he will "end up" with Misty or May is one of the largest among fans, rivaled only by the question of who Ash's father is (see below).</i></p>

<dd>This is largely speculation:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>An emotional crisis with girls? He just doesn't notice them in the way Brock does most of the time!</li>
<li>"Gotta Catch Ya Later" is an interestng episode, which the paragraph doesn't get the full gist of. In fact, Ash later makes up, though seeing them as 'best friends'</li>
<li>Some people believe that Tracey and Misty became close, but others don't. I haver seen Pokémon Chronicles, and Misty thinks much more of Ash than Tracey. While Tracey, to me, looks like he is much closer to Daisy than Misty. In the Luvdisc episode, he is even invited by Daisy rather than Misty.</li>
<li>Ash doesn't think about Misty much in Hoenn, and I certainly don't see any evidence for him realising that he cares about Misty there.</li>
<li>Well, there certainly wasn't any clash when they were all together in the "Oak's Lab" episode.</li>
<li>A lot of people believe May has a crush on Ash, but this is still open to interpretation.</li>
<li>It isn't that she doesn't feel as strongly as Misy, just that she tends to stay more calm.</li>
<li>How is he "returning the 'favour'"?</li>

<p>I have a neat idea on how Ash's pokemon could be composed.<br />
If Ash's pokemon had seperate articles:<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>They could be more extensive than in Ash's article as a complete unit</li>
<li>It would "Clean up" Ash's article, which would provide more room for a more detailed discription of Ash</li>
<li>It would mention how Ash obtained/befriended/caught each of his pokemon as well as a detailed discription on each of his pokemon and how they evolved (if applicable)(per say.)</li>
<li>It could mention the gym battles in which each pokemon participated.</li>

<dd>...Dogasu isn't a shipper. At any rate, PokéShipping has actually been confirmed (in <i>Gotta Catch Ya Later</i> and again in <i>A Date With Delcatty</i>) and so is not fanon.

<dl>
<dd><i>Advanced Generation</i> is considered a separate series in Japan, and this may have been one of the factors in giving Ash and Brock new clothes. As far as I can tell, Ash's AG clothes are exclusively made for the series, with none of the game protagonists using this set.

<p>Fine, and according to an episode of Pokemon Chronicles, Brock's mom made Brock a new jacket. See, our argument worked out. That's probably what should've happened with Yugi during Dungeon Dice Monsters. 71.111.216.239 21:34, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Another less plausible explanation is that Ash keeps the old clothes throughout the new region in his backpack as spare clothes, or may have couriered them back home in some off-screen moment, or any number of <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hammerspace.html" title="Hammerspace">hammerspace</a>-related explanations. In either case, it could be argued that, at least for Sinnoh, Ash's new clothing may have a weather-related explanation, as it is colder in Sinnoh than Kanto or Hoenn... But the simplest explantion is that <i>Pocket Monsters</i>, AG, and DP are separate series, and thus they are obligated to give Ash and Brock new clothes, which are in the style of the default protagonist in Red/Blue but with a regional feel. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelvSYC_688e.html" title="User:KelvSYC">kelvSYC</a> 20:06, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ash's Hoenn outfit looks strikingly similar to his Kanto/Johto outfit. What I mean is that his Hoenn outfit is like his Kanto outfit buttoned up. The only difference is the blue half-circle on his shirt and the black parts instead of white. His hat is different though. I like his Kanto outfit.</p>

<p>Any reason the box-out calls him Satoshi and then mentions his "dubbed name" as an afterthought? This is for the English language Wikipedia so it's my opinion that the English language name should be used.

<p>Some imageboards like not4chan that I look has a Ash Ketchum naked. One comment said that the TV Tokyo's episode are edited. The actual Ash was naked when he is in water part of Pokemon episodes while the Tv Tokyo's are with shorts. In Japan, where he as known as Satoshi, he is popular as naked than in his shorts.</p>

<p>I know Ash got turned to stone in <i>Pokemon: The First Movie</i>, but doesn't the harbor manager's tale say the Pokemon's tears bring back the lives lost?

<p>I started citing and referencing for the article. As not to alienate a lot of pokefans who may not yet be hardcore Wikipedia editors, I'll just make a little explanaton. Because most of the information about Ash is in the anime itself, you can simply put a description between the &lt; ref &gt; and &lt; / ref &gt; tags. Ie. "Ash Ketchum's favourite color is the color red. He once owned a blue balloon, but he wished it was red &lt; ref &gt;Pokémon anime, episode 90007: Ash's mum gave him a blue baloon. Ash wished on <a href="../../../j/i/r/Jirachi.html" title="Jirachi">Jirachi</a> for it to turn red.&lt; / ref &gt;. It's important to have a lot of appropriate references, and it makes the entire article look more sophisticated. Compare to <a href="../../../p/i/k/Pikachu.html" title="Pikachu">Pikachu</a> which in my opinion is a very well written article. Just a bit of work and we can remove that ugly "this article doesn't cite its sources" template on the main page.</p>
<p>I'll just show you a proper example:<br /></p>

<p>Well, Ash Ketchem is an atheist. He does not believe in God.</p>
<p><br />
For example, let's say that he's a Catholic. I am sure they would at least show a scene where he is praying to God, saints, or the Virgin Mary, going to mass, or worrying about commiting a "<a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortal_sin.html" title="Mortal sin">mortal sin</a>" if that is true. Since Ash does not display ANY religiousness (for any religion), it is safe to say he is an atheist.</p>
<p>That doesn't necessarly mean anything. Most fictional characters are prtryed without religion to make them more universal, but they are not necassarilly intended as atheists.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I removed Ash from the category of fictional athiests for the same reasons I discussed at <a href="../../../m/i/s/Talk%7EMisty_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29_f0cb.html" title="Talk:Misty (Pokémon)">Talk:Misty (Pokémon)</a>. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandon_Dilbeck_91d8.html" title="User:Brandon Dilbeck">Brandon Dilbeck</a> 21:32, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well it is extremely unlikely that he is believes in a <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_God_8ab2.html" title="Personal God">personal God</a>.

<p>Ok, there is not enough evidence to say that he is an atheist, as he could practice form of paganism or be a <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deist.html" title="Deist">deist</a>, but there is enough evidence to say that he does not follow a form of a <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abrahamic_religions.html" title="Abrahamic religions">Abrahamic religions</a>. But if the writers did not think religion is relevant in the Pokémon anime, it is safe to say that it is an irrelevant aspect of Ash's life. Since religion is irrelevant to Ash, we can conclude that he is not a devout person.</p>
<p><br />
How about that we simply add that he is not a religiously devout person instead? <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinkinPark_6d45.html" title="User:LinkinPark">LinkinPark</a> 20:30, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the Pokémon, or at least the legendarys, are "god-like."
