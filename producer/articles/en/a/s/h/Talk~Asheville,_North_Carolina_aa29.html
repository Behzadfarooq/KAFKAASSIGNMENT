<p>The information about famous people with ties to Asheville seems a bit abrupt. I think that this portion of the article needs to be edited to make a distinct paragraph, perhaps adding a topic sentence and transitions to pull it together and make it flow with the rest of the article.</p>

<p>Alphajerk, et al, ... You may be right! However, all of these issues have been discussed and a concensus has been reached. It is important to familiarize yourself with the manners of editing Wikipedia and the histories of any pages that you would like to make major edits to. Please read this discussion page (as you may have already) and look at these items:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a></li>

</ul>
<p>allmusic.com is not the end-all be-all verification for entries on the list of bands here, it's just a first-line source. Speaking only for myself, if there's a reasonable source supporting the notability of a band or performer, I'll leave it alone. But it's very important to discuss at least, or better yet cite (<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>), before you make changes, otherwise other editors will make additional changes that you may not like. (Actually, editors will make changes you don't like regardless of your best efforts. But if you've got Wikipedia policies and guideliness on your side, in addition to editor concensus, your own edits will eventually prevail.)</p>

<dd>allmusic is basically a database for whomever send in material to be put in... and even then they tend to get the information wrong in a lot of crediting cases (and sometimes bios). basically my point is, the title for the section IS "local bands" which denotes bands from the asheville area, and i dont think the ones that ARE listed are a good representation of the area (actually fairly poor), when the list was long, it was a much better representation despite complaints of it being too long. it wasnt self-promotional even with its length but the list made it look long. i think the list is a poor idea regardless of the consensus and doesnt tie in well with the film section and the film section isnt held to the same accountability as the music section.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>i also happen to think right now wiki is quite shortsighted in their placement of music in society. local scenes are what used to make areas thrive with originality, although it seems homoginization is spreading even into places such as this. now i dont think pages should be made as advertisements but if kept to biographical forms like a lot of pages of music i have seen here it is so worth the effort of people to propogate the information. music is called the bastard child of the entertainment industry and it seems its illegitimacy is continuing on at wiki. thats fairly sad because the way this place actually works would make a great data base of bands, music and the formations that have occured in society.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>i added back the band i was referring to after it was reverted, please leave them in place. allmusic takes submissions from ANYONE (and you can be sure they are getting a submission now, despite the band adhering to the already stated regulations of notability... bands like stephanies ID has NEVER played outside asheville as far as i know, although a nice band... but hardly adheres to the rules set forth yet remains].</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>im not trying to really argue but only debate my side and hope for a better representation of what ashevilles music scene really has to offer since it was included as a sub for the city here and is usually a pretty unique thing to here as well.... just because a consensus was reasched previously doesnt mean it is correct. i did notice the deletion of quite a few others that were most notable from this area, more than any currently on the list. it looks like the editing is done by people who might not be as aware of the music scene here. maybe you should trust peoples opinion who are more involved in it.</dd>

<dd>You're correct, just because a concensus was reached, doesn't mean it is correct. Sometimes concensus is the best we can do, though. More importantly, just because a concensus was reached, doesn't mean that the discussion is closed, either.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with a few things that you say (that the 'bands' list is not representative of Asheville, that the standards are not the same for the bands list and the films list). I'm not sure that I like the paragraph format for listing anything at all. But the list format isn't maybe not all that appropriate either.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Personally, all I really care about is that the section does not become a depository of shout-outs from various fly-by-night musical outfits. Bands come and go. And in this day and age, it's possible for a single individual to produce lots of music under multiple names. A local-music subsection could go on for pages, really, for any town the size of Asheville.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'll concede your point regarding allmusic.com. I don't know anything about the website. It was offered as a tool for making decisions. Seemed okay to me. With that said, I'll leave your additions to the list. I can't control what anyone else does. Politely, though, I'd like to ask that you offer some alternatives for deciding the 'notability' of any band added to this article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, I think the issue needs more discussion. Plus also, someone ought to look at how other articles about similar-sized American towns deal with this. -<a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZeno_Izen_583d.html" title="User:Zeno Izen">Zeno Izen</a> 09:14, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I believe that I first suggested that www.allmusic.com be used as a source. I want to clear a few things up. Allmusic is not basically a database which is just made up of submissions made by readers/users. Wikipedia better fits that description. Allmusic is a database which is an authoritative source of information. Libraries carry the print versions, such as Allmusic Guide to Rock (and Jazz, etc.). The reviews are well-written and often quoted elsewhere. <i>Of course</i> there are errors. No source is error-free.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, the list of bands looked like a list of bands who play local clubs. One person even mentioned that he had heard of most of these bands, so they should remain on the list. That's somewhat subjective. Anybody who visits Asheville clubs regularly would have heard of these bands. That doesn't make the bands notable.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know much about Stephanie's ID, and I have no personal stake in the success of that band (or any of these bands), but 30 seconds of research on the web indicated to me that they <i>do</i> play outside of Asheville, and they do have an entry, however meager, at allmusic.com--</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's just important to be civil and open-minded. I hope we can continue to make the page better. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Frosty_85d0.html" title="User:Mr Frosty">Mr Frosty</a> 15:57, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<i>I just deleted a bunch of band names</i> that were added by an anonymous editor. My apologies to anyone who's legitimate edits may have been collatorally damaged. (Though I think I managed to delete only what I was aiming for.) You'll have to add it back it, I guess.</p>
<p>I refrained from deleting "By Morning," or even checking up on the notability of the band. I'm feeling less aggressive about the band list issue than I was earlier. That Film &amp; TV section, however, is beginning to get on my last nerve.</p>
<p>Hopefully I'll get some time in the next few weeks to add more to the history section. If I do, I'll make a special effort to add in some of those interesting things that you mentioned earlier, Alphajerk. Hopefully. yayaya -<a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZeno_Izen_583d.html" title="User:Zeno Izen">Zeno Izen</a> 08:32, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've been following the music/band list debate with some interest here; I would suggest a look at the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chapel_Hill_79b3.html" title="Chapel Hill">Chapel Hill</a> page as an example of a potential reorganization of the music, film and culture-related sections of this article. I'd make the suggestion as Chapel Hill has a similar history as a culture-heavy town in NC, with a lot of grassroots activity, some of which has risen to regional or national prominence, and some of which hasn't. On that page, the idea was to simply provide an encyclopedia-standard overview written effectively enough (NO POV) to lead any interested parties toward further research on their own: of hundreds of bands, artists, writers in the area, I don't think more than 5-10 of each are mentioned specifically, while the overall article makes clear that an abundance of activity is going on, just unmentioned in the interest of keeping the page/article organized, readable, and within the evolving standards of what all NC city articles look like.</p>
<p>As for those standards, I've done a tiny bit of mostly grammatical work on most of the major city NC pages (I've lived in Charlotte, Boone, Chapel Hill and Carrboro, and have spent a lot of time in Asheville, Wilmington and Greenville); I'd love to see one organizational standard for all the "top 20" NC city articles. The Asheville article is one of the better ones. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidals_97d1.html" title="User:Davidals">Davidals</a> 10:26, 2 October 2006 (EDT)</p>

<p>Asheville is my hometown, but this article seems gushy and canned. It's like the Chamber of Commerce wrote it. I don't think it neccesarily violates NPOV or encyclopedic tone, but it certainly feels wrong to me.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. Most Ashevillians are rather proud of their city; This article does display bias. Perhaps specific sections/sentances can be cited before a re-vamp of the article commences? <a href="../../../a/r/x/User%7EArx_Fortis_c13b.html" title="User:Arx Fortis">Arx Fortis</a> 06:52, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Another agreement. I added the "metropolitan area" section a while back, and have otherwise refrained from making changes. The lists should be rethought - it's common to city articles on WikiPedia in general, but lengthy lists really make articles look silly and amateurish. If there's enough material to throw a list together, the entire section could be spun off into a more thorough article. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidals_97d1.html" title="User:Davidals">Davidals</a> 01:06, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I pruned the external links section. There were several links that were obviously links to specific businesses that just happen to be in Asheville (an inn, a club, etc.).

<p>++ I hardly think either Asheville.com or Ashevillenc.com's ads are excessive and as a resident of Asheville I know that both pages I added are certainly more frequently updated and also that explore Asheville is run by the chamber of commerce and the site only lists chamber of commerce members. The whole site is one big advertisement, "official" or not. Neither site employs pop ups and both are a directory of all bussinesses and attractions, not just those that are chamber of commerce members.

<dd>Golbez, thanks for stepping in here. It is difficult to believe that the edits of this user are in good faith insomuch that he/she uses numerous sockpuppets to add them back; Indeed, some of the accounts used to add these spamlinks have Asheville as their only edit (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/LoriKane" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/LoriKane" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Rlph_wiggins" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Rlph_wiggins" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Topracer" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Topracer" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>). Such subversive behavior is, at best, suspicious and brings into question whether there is a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interests</a> involved.

<dd>Arx Fortis, I cannot admit agreement, but I will admit that you are certainly very dedicated to this page. I, <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConspireagainst_a64c.html" title="User:Conspireagainst">Conspireagainst</a>, am not the same as Clarke187 or Rlph Wiggins. This person is a friend of mine, but not one and the same and I would appreciate if you would not make assumptions that you do not know to be true. In fact, I agree with Wiggins' statement about the "Asheville Area Chamber" and the "Explore Asheville" site. You may not know this, but both of these sites aim to specifically exclude businesses that do not wish to play ball with the city, truly making it difficult for many area businesses to be seen. The other sites that were there were intended to make sure that the area businesses can have fair and equal representation on the Internet. You should reconsider your stance, given the facts. I will be happy to discuss this with you further in a more personal manner, if you wish.
<dl>
<dd>Umm, this should not be resolved in a one-on-one personal conversation, Conspireagainst. The idea is to have an open discussion of the best way to document Asheville in an encyclopedia article.</dd>
<dd>Since Wikipedia is not intended to promote businesses (nor to give them "fair and equal representation on the Internet"; see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>), your rationale for adding external links is not convincing. --<a href="../../../o/r/l/User%7EOrlady_761e.html" title="User:Orlady">orlady</a> 15:56, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regardless, in all fairness, perhaps the Chamber of Commerce site should be removed as well. I didn't include it in my pruning because the link has only one unobtrusive ad (a banner at the bottom). But, as Wiggins says, because the only businesses contained on the Chamber's site are those who pay a membership fee to the Chamber, the site <i>is</i> just one big advertisement.</dd>

<dd>Hello all, I find this conversation very interesting as I am somewhat new (extremely new) to the Wikipedia game. But, on the other hand I do have some valuable input on the Asheville front. I basically have to agree with both sides of the argument. If Asheville.com, AshevilleNC.com and the not before mentioned AshevilleNow.com are to be removed then I see no value in leaving ExploreAsheville.com or the Chamber site. It is my very biased opinion that AshevilleNC.com and AshevilleNow.com, my website, are the two best representations of Asheville as a whole from both the local and visitors perspective, as most other sites are simple for tourists. My site is still has some work to be done, but we have been working 35 hours a week on it for several months, and it will be more complete shortly. I hope my input is valuable in your decision making process and not seen as simply a plug for my site, as it is our mission at AshevilleNow to offer an accurate representation of Asheville in all its bright colors. Thanks. ++ User: Anow 11:24, 20 December 2006</dd>

<dd>Thank you for sharing that bit of intelligence, Clarke187. For your future edification, the "Last update" date that appears on dmoz pages is the date when the content of that particular page last changed. Changes in subcategories (child pages) are not reflected. Since there are no websites listed on the main page for Asheville (all 900+ links for Asheville are in subcategories), the page should not be expected to change frequently, but the subcategories are updated often. --<a href="../../../o/r/l/User%7EOrlady_761e.html" title="User:Orlady">orlady</a> 02:45, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Anyway, thats beside the point. I agree that this is an encyclopedia and I would be perfectly happy to stop this little link war we're having if exploreasheville and ashevillechamber are likewise removed because those sites are the biggest advertisements of the lot, at least the other sites will let anyone list pretty much anything for free.Clarke187 20:45, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Errm... It's gotten quiet here.<br /></p>
<p>It seems to me that the linking war is only a symptom of larger problems with this article. Much of the "writing" here consists of listing links and promotional factoids. For example, the following breathless passage is hardly "General Information" (where it is now):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the year 1900, author Thomas Wolfe was born in Asheville. Author F. Scott Fitzgerald lived and worked in Asheville during some of his literary career. His wife, Zelda, died in a fire in an Asheville sanitarium in 1948. In 1933, actress Eileen Fulton was born in Asheville. In 1939, singer Roberta Flack was born in the city.[10] In 2005 alleged bomber Eric Robert Rudolph was transported to Asheville from Murphy, North Carolina for arraignment in federal court. In September 2004, major flooding was reported in town, particularly at Biltmore Village, due to rains from the remnants of Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Ivan."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>May I suggest that, after the article is unblocked, the article should be thoroughly reorganized according to an outline? I suggest including: Geography, History, Demographics, Metropolitan area, Government, Economy, Education, Media, Transportation, Arts and culture, Sports and recreation, Notable natives and residents <i>(to include people like <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Wolfe_ee37.html" title="Thomas Wolfe">Thomas Wolfe</a> who may be mentioned elsewhere in the article)</i>, Sister cities, References, and External links.<br />
Some items will need to be moved. For example, the sentence "Asheville is home to University of North Carolina at Asheville, a liberal arts college of about 3500 students (part of the University of North Carolina System), and Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College" should be moved into Education. --<a href="../../../o/r/l/User%7EOrlady_761e.html" title="User:Orlady">orlady</a> 00:18, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that the best way to solve the bands problems is simply to say that the city has an active music scene, and leave it at that. When I originally added the section, I assumed that people would be willing to set aside their petty differences and get along, but that's very obviously not happening. Ditto with the films list, which was added largely because people around here are so invested in the idea that we're a movie-making community. It's a shame that the Wiki model doesn't work in these cases. — UnknownCity, 15:16, 29 December 2006</p>
<dl>
<dd>As I see it, the issue is not that there is a perceived problem with music and film as topics (in fact, they are potentially important topics), but rather that discussions of these topics have written in a manner more consistent with a promotional brochure (or perhaps weekly newspapers) than an encyclopedia article. Statements like "the city has an active music scene", "Asheville is a regional hotspot for live music", and "recent developments are cementing Asheville as a potential growth area for both film and TV" are <b>not</b> encyclopedia-like. It ought to be possible to present this information in an objective manner. For example (this example uses totally made-up data), say "As of 2006, about 30 local clubs presented live music on a regular basis" [insert reference citation to a newspaper article from which this information was taken]. Also, the list of films and TV shows produced locally could be converted to something like (again this is made-up): "The first movie filmed on location in Asheville was <i>Bedtime for Bozo</i> (1978). Film and video production activity increased in the years 1980 to 1985, when eight major movies were filmed locally (list them) and the ABC TV series <i>Asheville is for Ashes</i> was produced in the city." --<a href="../../../o/r/l/User%7EOrlady_761e.html" title="User:Orlady">orlady</a> 05:33, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For the most part, I'd agree. Unfortunately, I'm not sure that there's any way around people chopping up the section and using it to promote their bands. Likewise, if you start posting links to articles about the subject, it's very likely that it'll get chopped out by someone accusing the editor of promoting whatever newspaper it's linking to. I could be wrong, but it seems very lose-lose to be anything other than very vague. After all, it's not like there's going to be census data on the number of bands around here. You could cite, say, MySpace for the number of active local bands, but I'm not sure any of this information would be considered truly viable in the sense you're talking about. --Unknowncity</p>

<p><br />
Arx Fortis: Good work, although I do have some concerns. First -- and it's a minor point -- that Asheville's music scene hasn't been seriously compared to that of New Orleans or Nashville. Those are both huge cities, and their recording and music industries actually contribute a subtantial amount of revenue to the local economy. Asheville's music scene, by contrast, only just supports itself. In terms of size and commercial success, it's more on par with, say, the Chapel Hill music scene of two decades ago. We have only a handful of venues of any size (and no truly large venues), no major acts are based here (although a number of mid-level performers either have been, or have members who are), and there are no commercially significant recording studios in the area (although there are several good ones). That's not to say that the scene isn't important, I'm just trying to give it some scale for this discussion.</p>
<p>Secondly, what if Stella Blue or the Orange Peel suddenly put up a Wiki page? Shouldn't there be a method to refer to it? Would they then be wrong in editing the music section to include that internal link? Wouldn't it then start to get out of hand again? The more I think about it, the more I'm of the belief that the Asheville music scene either needs the barest mention -- even more spare than yours -- or that it needs its own page completely. -- UnknownCity</p>
<dl>
<dd>UnknownCity, thank you for your comments and you make some good points. I agree with your point about New Orleans/Nashville. Asheville's 'music scene' is not even close to that of those two cities and I doubt a credible source could be found that makes a fair comparison. (<i>edit:</i> To clarify, I do not consider the Asheville Citizen-Times a credible source on this point; it should be an outside source.) This should be removed (or edited if the comparison is cited/referenced).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To your second point, Stella Blue or Orange Peel shouldn't be putting up their own wiki article...that would be considered Original Research (<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>). Let's suppose, however, that someone did create an article for one of those local venues. The venue would need to be noteable enough (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a>) to be considered encyclopedic.

<dd>I was just looking at another Wikipedia page, and I had a thought. When "external links" are posted that seem to be spam, an editor might choose to remove said links outright. Another useful tactic to consider might be to edit the description of the link. Example: "adspammaddness.com - An ad-heavy commercial site with links to Asheville businesses."</dd>

<dd>It's just an idea, but if the tactic is used judiciously, it might be a means toward averting edit wars. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZeno_Izen_583d.html" title="User:Zeno Izen">Zeno Izen</a> 20:44, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The third pgraph of the General Information section, there is a list (in pgraph form) of magazine articles that mention Asheville. I think it would be more informative to include the publication years of the articles in the actual paragraph. The problem is that simply sticking the years in there will make the paragraph look very cluttered. There are already a lot of quotation marks and citation numerals in the paragraph, and the addition of four-digit years would probably take the text over the edge into serious eyesore territory. Yet, we surely don't need another bulleted list in the article.</p>
<p>Dilemma! Any suggestions? <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZeno_Izen_583d.html" title="User:Zeno Izen">Zeno Izen</a> 20:15, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it would suffice to say that Asheville has received significant media coverage in the media, then simply use citations for the sentance to give some examples (no more than 3-4 of the most significant articles). ++<a href="../../../a/r/x/User%7EArx_Fortis_c13b.html" title="User:Arx Fortis">Arx Fortis</a> 05:10, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
