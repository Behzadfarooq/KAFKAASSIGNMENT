<p>Ashraf Ghani was recognized as the best finance minister of Asia in 2003 by <i>Emerging Markets</i>. During his tenure as finance minister of Afghanistan, he carried out a series of extensive reforms. He issued a new currency in record time, computerized the operations of treasury, institutionalized the single treasury account, adopted a policy of no-deficit financing, introduced the budget as the central instrument of policy, centralized revenue, reformed the tariff system and overhauled customs, and instituted regular reporting to the cabinet, the people of Afghanistan, and international stakeholders as a tool of transparency and accountability. He broke new ground in the coordination of donor assistance by requiring donors to keep their interventions to three sectors, thereby bringing clarity and mutual accountability to their relations with government counterparts, and preparing a development strategy that put the Afghans in the driver’s seat regarding accountability for their future.</p>
<p>On March 31-April 2004, he presented a seven-year program of public investment called <a href="http://www.ands.gov.af/admin/ands/documents/upload/UploadFolder/%5CSECURING%20AFGHANISTANS%20FUTURE%20PRINT%20VERSION%20very%20final.pdf#search=%22securing%20afghanistan's%20future%22" class="external text" title="http://www.ands.gov.af/admin/ands/documents/upload/UploadFolder/%5CSECURING%20AFGHANISTANS%20FUTURE%20PRINT%20VERSION%20very%20final.pdf#search=%22securing%20afghanistan's%20future%22" rel="nofollow">Securing Afghanistan’s Future</a> to an international conference in Berlin attended by 65 finance and foreign ministers. Described as the most comprehensive program ever prepared and presented by a poor country to the international community, <i>Securing Afghanistan’s Future</i> was prepared by a team of one-hundred experts working under the supervision of a committee chaired by Mr. Ghani. The concept of a double-compact, between the donors and the government of Afghanistan on the one hand and between the government and people of Afghanistan on the other, underpinned the program of investment in <i>Securing Afghanistan’s Future</i>. The donors pledged $8.2 billion at the conference for the first three years of the program –- the exact amount asked by the government -- and agreed that the government’s request for a total seven-year package of assistance of $27.5 billion was justified.</p>
<p>Focus on poverty eradication through the creation of wealth and the establishment of the rights of citizenship has been at the heart of Mr. Ghani’s development approach. In Afghanistan, he is attributed with designing the <a href="http://www.nspafghanistan.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.nspafghanistan.org/" rel="nofollow">National Solidarity Program</a>, a program of bloc grants to villages in which elected village councils determine both the priorities and the mechanisms of implementation. The program currently covers 13,000 of the estimated 20,000 villages of the country. He also partnered with the Ministry of Communication to ensure that telecom licenses were granted on a fully-transparent basis. As a result, the number of mobile phones in the country has jumped from 100 in July 2002 to over a million at the end of 2005. Private investment in the sector exceeded $200 million and the telecom sector emerged as one of the major sectors of revenue generation for government.</p>

<p>Ashraf Ghani was born in Kabul in 1949, studied political science at the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_University_of_Beirut_ea3f.html" title="American University of Beirut">American University of Beirut</a> where he was a staunch marxist before U-turning later on, international affairs and anthropology at <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_University_082c.html" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a> ( where he earned his PhD), and attended the Harvard-INSEAD and Stanford business schools leadership training program for the World Bank. He served on the faculty of Kabul University (1973-77), <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aarhus_University_427d.html" title="Aarhus University">Aarhus University</a> in Denmark (1977), <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California%2C_Berkeley_70e2.html" title="University of California, Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a> (1983), and <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johns_Hopkins_University_14b6.html" title="Johns Hopkins University">Johns Hopkins University</a> (1983-1991). His academic research was on state-building and social transformations. A Muslim, in 1985 he undertook a year of fieldwork researching Pakistani <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madrasas.html" title="Madrasas">Madrasas</a> as a Fulbright Scholar. He has also studied comparative religion. He joined the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Bank_2c67.html" title="World Bank">World Bank</a> in 1991, working on projects in East Asia and South Asia until 1996. In 1996, he pioneered the application of institutional and organizational analysis to macro processes of change and reform, working directly on the adjustment program of the Russian coal industry and carrying out reviews of the Bank’s country assistance strategies and structural adjustment programs globally. He spent five years in each China, India, and Russia managing large-scale development and institutional transformation projects.</p>
<p>He had worked intensively with the media during the first <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_War_bc7b.html" title="Gulf War">Gulf War</a>, commenting on major radio and television programs and being interviewed by newspapers. After 9/11, he took leave without pay from the World Bank and engaged in intensive interaction with the media, appearing regularly on PBS’s News Hour as well as BBC, CNN, other television programs, the BBC, Public Radio, other radios, and writing for major newspapers. In November 2002, he accepted an appointment as a Special Advisor to the United Nations and assisted Mr. <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lakhdar_Brahimi_93a2.html" title="Lakhdar Brahimi">Lakhdar Brahimi</a>, the Special Representative of the Secretary General, to prepare the Bonn Agreement, the process and document that provided the basis of transfer of power to the people of Afghanistan. Retuning after 24 years to Afghanistan in <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_2001.html" title="December 2001">December 2001</a>, he resigned from his posts at the UN and World Bank and joined the Afghan government as the chief advisor to President Karzai on February 1, 2002. He has worked on a pro bono basis and was among the first officials to disclose his assets. In this capacity, he worked on the preparation of the <a href="../../../l/o/y/Loya_Jirga_e119.html" title="Loya Jirga">Loya Jirgas</a> (grand assemblies) that elected president Karzai and approved the constitution. After the election of president Karzai directly by the people of Afghanistan in <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_2004.html" title="October 2004">October 2004</a>, Mr. Ghani declined to join the cabinet and asked to be appointed as chancellor of Kabul University. As chancellor of the University, he has been engaged in articulating the concept of shared governance among the faculty, students, and staff and advocating a vision of the university where men and women with skills and commitment to lead their country in the age of globalization can be trained.</p>
<p>Since joining the university, Mr. Ghani has resumed his research activities and is directing a program on state-effectiveness. This program has put forward a framework which proposes that the state should perform ten functions in the contemporary world in order to serve its citizens. This framework was discussed by leaders and managers of post-conflict transitions at a meeting sponsored by the UN and World Bank at the Greentree Estates in September 2005. The program also proposes that the vehicle of state-building or sovereignty strategies, underpinned by double compacts between the international community, government and the population of a country could be used as a basis for organizing aid and other interventions, and that a sovereignty index to measure state effectiveness should be compiled on an annual basis.</p>
<p>Mr. Ghani has been sought as a public speaker and in 2005 given the keynote speeches for a number of meetings including the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Bar_Association_b11f.html" title="American Bar Association">American Bar Association</a>’s International Rule of Law Symposium, the Trans-Atlantic Policy Network, the annual meeting of the Norwegian Government’s development staff, CSIS’ meeting on UN reform, the UN-OECD-World Bank’s meeting on Fragile States, and <a href="http://truetalk.typepad.com/truetalk/2005/07/ted_global__day_1.html" class="external text" title="http://truetalk.typepad.com/truetalk/2005/07/ted_global__day_1.html" rel="nofollow">TEDGlobal</a>.
