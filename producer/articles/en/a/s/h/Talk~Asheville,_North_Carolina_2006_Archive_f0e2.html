<h2><span class="mw-headline">Joshua Warren</span></h2>
<p>I think the section on Joshua Warren's book is overstating the book's influence. Anyone else? The Asheville article mentions Thomas Wolfe (as it should), but it doesn't mention <i>Look Homeward, Angel</i>. Fair enough. But then it mentions Joshua Warren <i>and</i> Warren's book. Wolfe's book is a classic of American literature. Haunted Asheville isn't nearly so famous. Haunted Asheville isn't nearly the tourist draw that the article suggests.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Music</span></h2>
<p>I think the music section has gotten out of hand. Too many bands are mentioned. The article states that the bands are "notable", but no evidence is proffered to support that claim. I think it just looks like promotion. I am in support of Asheville's music scene, but I don't think Wikipedia should be used as a promotional tool for it. Would anyone else like to weigh in on this? <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Frosty_85d0.html" title="User:Mr Frosty">Mr Frosty</a> 16:52, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Even if it can be seen as promotion they are still notable local bands, I think its fine. There are only a few artists there that I havent heard of. Silverweed 13:26, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Even if they're notable, most larger cities (i.e., Houston, TX) don't go to such lengths regarding local artists. Besides, the section is clearly biased.</p>

<dd>I <b>concur</b>. If the band/performer is not already known outside of Asheville, then it would appear as more of an advertisement than a reference. I've noticed a lot of "blue links" link to something completely unrelated to a band. These bands don't have a wikipedia article. I think the criteria should be that the band have at least one of the following:
<ul>
<li>a discography/biography at www.allmusic.com</li>
<li>an existing wikipedia article (<u>not just an on-the-fly stub</u>)</li>

<dd>I think your criteria are good for pruning purposes. From there we could use the bullet-pointed lists on the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a> page to attend to new additions. In other words, someone should go ahead and edit the current list based on your criteria. Then, when new entries are inevitably added, they should be included/removed based on the notability page.</dd>

<dd>allmusic is far from authoritative, being riddled with misinformation and narrow view of a proper database of what is really happening musically. the "list" format doesnt look proper with the "film" section that simply seperates them by comma. also, the criteria for bands i have added are in accordance with wiki and have been deleted. is radio rotation, national/worldwide publication/reviews, mentioned elsewhere in wiki, and being on a label not enough? i have had to add a notable band currently in asheville 4 times now as someone simply deletes it without checking to see that they are pushing a new national genre having toured the US multiple times as well as several releases. it seems there is conflict as to what is acceptable between music and film with very small [even unreleased] films being mentioned while other bands that dont meet the criteria are kept and others deleted. i think you are far from any consensus on this matter. some of the bands that are left dont meet the criteria as well as some being deleted. seems a bit biased.</dd>

<dd>as long as the bands are active in asheville, i think they deserve mention just as the film section allows. maybe they dont need their own page as some have, but with the current interactions of the internet and bands promotional abilities, i think it would be a nice way to introduce the world at large to search bands local to asheville and its unique music scene at least the name to further search them out on the web.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Alphajerk (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Alphajerk_3098.html" title="Special:Contributions/Alphajerk">contribs</a>) 2 August 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">More re: pruning 'bands'</span></h2>
<p>Righty, nice work Arx... In the interest of further solidifying the list, I looked up all the remaining 'bands' at allmusic.com. Here are my notes. 'one&amp;same?' means I found the band at allmusic, but couldn't find anything to verify that the band I found was the one referred to by the Asheville article. 'check' means I found the band and a reference to either Asheville or North Carolina in that band's entry, suggesting that the band is the one referred to in the Asheville article.</p>

I see what you are going for with the "pruning" of the music section, I find your criteria to be a little too strict. (My fault, I'm afraid. I started the section.) The biggest reason it bothers me is that AllMusic is mostly for bands with label support, and doesn't really represent the local music flavor that Asheville is known for. These acts are usually limited to regional tours, and many established ones are still mostly known on an entirely indie level. Just because they aren't on a major label doesn't mean that they aren't legitimate, and I'd argue that one of the few places they are able to get the recognition they deserve is in a write up about the music scene of which they are a part.</p>
<p>It's that scene's active and vibrant nature, in fact, that's causing the problem. I'd suggest checking these acts against MySpace, iTunes and other indie music sites. That, or I'd strike having any proper names in the write-up. Or, I'd start a page wholly devoted to the Asheville music scene. No matter what you do, I'd suggest that this section will always be something of a popularity battleground. <b>-- UnknownCity</b></p>

I reverted (by copypaste) the text that was rewritten earlier. While not perfect, the previous text bore a reference, and the words used in that paragraph were all based on information found in that reference. Since the change to the unsourced text was done anonymously and without discussion, I can only assume that it was made by a random passerby.</p>
<p>Also, the multiple edits made it difficult for me to sort out exactly which words had been changed and how. So I just scooped up the original text and dropped it back in.</p>
<p>Thanks for barnstar Arx. And yeah the list looks a lot better. It will probably need to be maintained, though. -<a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZeno_Izen_583d.html" title="User:Zeno Izen">Zeno Izen</a> 07:06, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

In 1540, Spanish explorer Hernando DeSoto came to the area, bringing the first European visitors <a href="http://www.obcgs.com/ashv_hist.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.obcgs.com/ashv_hist.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.obcgs.com/ashv_hist.htm</a> in addition to European diseases which seriously depleted the native population <a href="http://www.tolatsga.org/Cherokee1.html" class="external free" title="http://www.tolatsga.org/Cherokee1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tolatsga.org/Cherokee1.html</a> . As the Cherokee were eventually dominated by European settlers, the area was used as an open hunting ground until the middle of the 19th century. <a href="http://www.asheville.be/history/Asheville_History_Pre_1800.html" class="external free" title="http://www.asheville.be/history/Asheville_History_Pre_1800.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.asheville.be/history/Asheville_History_Pre_1800.html</a></li>

<li>The history of Asheville, as a town, begins in 1784. In that year Colonel Samuel Davidson and his family settled in the Swannanoa Valley, redeeming a soldier's land grant from the state of North Carolina. Soon after building a log cabin at the bank of Christian Creek, Davidson was lured into the woods by a band of Cherokee hunters and killed. Davidson's wife, child and female slave fled on foot to Davidson's Fort (named after Davidson's father General John Davidson) 16 miles away.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In response to the killing, Davidson's twin brother Major William Davidson and brother-in-law Colonel Daniel Smith formed an expedition to retrieve Samuel Davidson's body and avenge his murder. Months after the expedition, Major Davidson and other members of the his extended family returned to the area and settled at the mouth of Bee Tree Creek. <a href="http://www.wnchistory.org/museum/droversroad.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.wnchistory.org/museum/droversroad.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wnchistory.org/museum/droversroad.htm</a></li>

<li>Over the course of years, more settlers came to the area. The United States Census of 1790 counted 1,000 residents of the area, excluding the Cherokee. The county of Buncombe was officially formed in 1792. The county seat, named “Morristown” in 1793, was established on a plateau where two old Indian trails crossed. In 1797 Morristown was incorporated and renamed “Asheville” after North Carolina Governor Samuel Ashe. <a href="http://www.wnchistory.org/museum/droversroad.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.wnchistory.org/museum/droversroad.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wnchistory.org/museum/droversroad.htm</a></li>

<p><br />
the history seems short and only limited to the origins, not necessarily the history. where is grove, originally planning on building grove park in swannanoa (became grovemont) to vanderbilt and his massive estate and "town" of (vander)biltmore? or is this just a bunch of information that needs to be written? or the "levelling" of the city from battery park to mccormick field?</p>
<p>another "oddity" of asheville is its choice to not default on debt from the depression saving many city landmarks that in other cities were destroyed in urban renewals. or the st lawrence basicilica built the largest unsupported tile dome in the US in a manner no one can figure out by Rafael Guastavino.</p>
<p>is this information worth writing to be added? i would hate to waste my time writing it only to have it pulled down.</p>

<dd>There's plenty more that needs to be added to the history section. The small amount that I put together took me most of a day. I started from the beginning, and would have gone to the end, but that little bit kind of burned me out.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>All of the things that you've mentioned here seem very interesting. I'd like to see them included. The hard part is getting the sources. But if you have some books or know some websites and don't mind taking a little time to figure out the citation templates, the rest is cake. Or at least that's how it was for me.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As far as having anything pulled down, I can only speak for myself. I just want to see the article improve. I think if your work is sourced, discussed somewhat and makes for a better article, it ought to stay. -<a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZeno_Izen_583d.html" title="User:Zeno Izen">Zeno Izen</a> 09:27, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>there are a few historical books on asheville, complete with pictures to verify the claims... and also well known history in this area. sorry, i havent had time to come back to this, i was a] busy with work and b] more than put off by the band section... that is a whole OTHER issue to itself, the last band list i saw the people on it MIGHT be on allmusic but arent notable from asheville or even possibly around anymore.... most of the notable artists here got deleted from the big list. if you really want to trim it down, just put Warren Haynes [despite him leaving asheville for nashville to succeed] because there are not really any other prominent musicians from here.
