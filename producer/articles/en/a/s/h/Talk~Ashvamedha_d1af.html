<dd>What concerns me is very simple - as with distinction between 'religion and science', here its distinction between religion and history. This article falls under religion, the interpretations of griffith therefore cannot be held in light. If the views of western interpreters are to be exerted, by all means better exert them in another thread, or maybe shifting this thread from hinduism to history of india(?) and make another article in hinduism section named 'ashvamedha in hinduism'. As hinduism is referred to as an <i>living religion</i> or something of that sort, that wouldn't be a problem and would also completely sort out the issues. What say? The historical article can then, to comply with dab and paul's views; be renamed 'ashvamedha in vedic hinduism'. Leafy 17:46, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>you are not making sense, sorry. this is a topic of history of religion. The ashvamedha plays a minor role in contemporary Hinduism, yes, that's why we have an "Arya Samaj" section. That's it. Feel free to add whatever the Arya Samaj people have come up with to that section, we won't stop you, but you cannot claim the term or its history as your own. Well, you can, on a gazillion of webpages and fora, but not on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(íÅ≥)</a></small> 22:14, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Just because it isn't performed much anymore, doesn't turn it into an article of only academic views. Its importance is still relevant to a great degree in modern times. Nor am I interested in exhibiting arya samaj's views; because I dont comply with them. Who's claiming an article of history as my own? <b>You're</b> claiming an article of religion as your own. I dont think their views are correct, nor am I interested in trying to claim their views as important thing of article. On the other hand you seem to sentimentally attached to making a rift in the article, although I dont see why you should be bothered - to rename it as 'ashvamedha in vedic hinduism' doesn't make a difference; you however claim it to be an article of history which all the more gives a reason to shift it to 'history of india' section.

<dd>sigh, I'm only complying with <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicy_66bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Policy">Wikipedia:policy</a>. there is a section on the historical sacrifice, which is in the academic field of history of religion, and there is a section on modern Hinduism, which should report on contemporary movements wrt their relative notabilities. Yes, claims concerning the historical sacrifice have to be academic. We report only claims with any sort of authority. If the claim is religious doctrine, made by a contemporary religious leader, we insert it in the modern section, provided the person making the claim has sufficient notability <i>as</i> a religious leader. If the claim is not religious doctrine but concerns historical events, it is a claim of the academic field of history (in our case, Sanskrit philology), and we'll report claims by academics with notability in <i>that</i> field. That's the long and short of it, I'll not spell it out to you again, now feel free to make adequately sourced contributions to the section of your choice. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(íÅ≥)</a></small> 11:11, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>These 'sections' concerning distinction between the two are what is bothering me, and I do not see why you're so reluctant to make distinction between the historic and religious sections of the article. Yes, one who comes to religious article will no doubt be given a link that will redirect him to the historical content, and academic research on a historical sacrifice means more of archaeological and literal sources over philological sources. On the other hand I dont see how a reader of the article wouldn't think that the details of the ritual <i>are actually what the philologists view the sacrifice to be</i>. The article is a religious sacrifice with importance in contemporarial times as well, so naturally religion takes higher priority. Yes it is a concern of academical research as well, but that doesn't mean that how the sacrifice is performed will be completely based upon the views of philological historians, nor have you made any attempt to indicate that the details of the sacrifice are based upon research of western historians, unless you assume that they'll try to induce that by looking at the verse notations being attributed to griffith. Translations by griffith are based upon a religious vaisnav scholar named sayana, so I guess you'll then classify it under <i>Ashvamedha according to Sayana's Translations</i>. I've posted a site with polemics regarding the translations. I've given the resources for the griffith's translations I posted. If you really want to make so many classifications the article will be filled with millions of classifications. Leafy 12:00, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've asked for peer-reviewed publications from the field of <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_religion.html" title="History of religion">history of religion</a>, you haven't given any. Per <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, we cover all notable opinions, giving precedence to the mainstream view. "sites with polemics" are irrelevant.

<p>And I said I dont have to, because those are religious views about a religious ceremony. And the reason I posted the site with polemics was because you were asking for some proof regarding critique of the ritual, which was available in that website, translating words with chances of mystical interpretations in a materialistic fashion. I'm not talking about <i>academic views</i> because that classifies in its own section. And please, timeline of universe and timeline of bible are aeons apart. We dont have the article detailing jesus filled with <i>academic views</i>. The theory of big bang has more proof, but the evidence regarding ashva medha is sparing. And please, I think you ignored the more important part that it is to be performed by a KING and not anyone, naturally its performance would be less - that doesn't mean you consider the ritual as extinct and thereby bring up strange relations of extinct cultures like the norse legends you bring up. There is a BIG difference between those extinct cultures and that of vedas! Leafy 14:10, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I suggest you look at it with more care cuz we dont have views of historians totally dominating the whole section - trolling? I already asked you, I ask you again - do you know what it means? You're the one who's completely failing to understand the policy, a religious ritual is a ritual.

<p>And please, you love to forget an important fact that this is a religious ritual and therefore you dont have to put academic reviews regarding the <b>religious</b> views of a <b>religious</b> ceremony! Leafy 14:14, 26 January 2007 (UTC) Do try explaining to me how the article of jesus is any more in favour of your suggestions when we have a whole section dedicated to historicity of jesus - which comes to the academic study you so much love - as opposed to having it fill the whole article itself. Being a religious ritual, atleast the introduction should cover proper views of the scriptures and a brief excerpt concerning the ritual, and a section speaking of 'ritual in detail' be dedicated to the <i>academic views</i> which you feel should dominate the article.

<dd>Arya Samaj have no juristiction over "the proper views of the scriptures". I gather their position within Hinduism is comparable to that of biblical literalists within Christianity. If it buys us peace, we can have a statement "a modernized form of the ritual has been performed since 1991 by <a href="../../../a/r/y/Arya_Samaj_19a5.html" title="Arya Samaj">Arya Samaj</a> and related movements." <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(íÅ≥)</a></small> 14:40, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'm not talking just about arya samaj, but AWGP, aurobindo's and the rest of the crew as well. I'm not claiming their works as academical, but to view <i>academical views</i> as most authentic is what I'm opposed to. Why do you think I'm talking only about arya samaj? Because you found my ID in the only arya samajik forum out there? Earlier in the talk page I was arguing with regards to the views of Devi Chand, who happened to be an arya samajist but the footnote regarding the <i>views</i> was what I objected to, to say he took a cue from dayananda was better. Yea I know their overly fundamentalistic ideology is irritating, but I'm not here trying to propagandise their views with the likes of VJSingh. Call it personal aversion or whatever, it is not talked about in detail ANYWHERE and for you to assume that everyone unanimously agrees with this is not correct either, the disagreement was prevalent amongst hindus atleast since the time buddhist scholars began to dominate. Secondly, as there is not much documented information regarding this ritual in vedic times, the views regarding the ritual in scriptures and its performance in hindu mythology should first be highlighted, "The Vedic Sacrifice in Detail" or something as such where a little bit is added that it is talked about in detail by Griffith, and I dont think anyone would have a reason to allege his interpretations are "fallacious", for as I said, academic views comply with those of griffith and the like. But I still say the same, that philology =/= history. Leafy 16:06, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>what do you want? we do have a "modern" section.

<p>There is not much information regarding the ritual to begin with, and its a religious ritual for crying out loud, its not something that requires an <i>academic peer review</i> which you're so obsessed with. To speak of "academic reviews" implies there is no clean evidence and therefore the views of some ancient author cannot be validated as the authentic ritual. Wikipedia is not interested in considering the views of outdated research in a religious article either, from where begin your fantastic claims that it is not a religious ritual. Leafy 16:37, 26 January 2007 (UTC) And even after I explain that we're not talking about "anyone" but resources from historic schools, you seem to enjoy ignoring that line. Why are you so obsessed with giving lesser precedence to RELIGIOUS views in a RELIGIOUS article? Leafy 16:39, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Wikipedia certainly has the right to demand 'academic peer reviews' on everything it quotes or references. It is nothing more than a summary of the results of 'academic study'. We cannot expect it to understand the value of traditonal Vedic education. In the eyes of 'academics', a man can study 30 years at gurukul and when he gets out he's just as ignorant as when he went in. We can't expect Wikipedia to accomodate any view other than that of the current generation's pseudo-intelligentsia. Who cares if people are misled? It's their mistake for thinking a resource such as Wikipedia can be objective in regards to such matters to begin with.</p>

<dd>Asking academic stuff regarding academic material is fine with me, but to have an article detailing a religious ritual be dominated by views of academicians is what I'm bothered about. To ask for academic material regarding a religious ritual is no doubt absurd, the whole fuss about 'religion and science' lies here itself. The article is concerning religious performance, and as the ritual is not well documented for to begin with, the introduction should deal with everything relating to the ritual and not the ritual itself. As you said, it is as such in the <i>eyes of the academicians</i> implying that there needs to be made a distinction between the views of academicians and religious figures. The quotations from scriptures should precedence over any academic acknowledgement of the ritual, considering the fact that inconsistency lies in the whole ritual. The article doesn't detail of what the outcome of the ritual was explained to be either [conquest, protection of nation, incurring progeny, etc...]. Wikipedia has the right to demand <i>academic peer reviews</i> - regarding academic material, which may include the performance of this sacrifice. However to ask regarding religious views, that is absolute BS. Leafy 10:14, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

Regarding contemporary religion, we can of course cite any notable religious leader, and I invite you again to do that.

<dd>what steaming nonsense. I have <i>myself</i> created the Arya Samaj section.<i>peer-reviewed</i> Vedic philology goes to the Vedic section. "opinions of religious scholars" go to the "modern" section, because they are <i>modern</i> religious scholars. now stop the trolling and contribute to whatever topic it is you want to contribute. If you disagree with philological mainstream, I am sorry, but that's your problem, and you won't be able to do anything about it. As Kanchanamala keeps saying, Vedic texts are difficult, that's why there's a specialized academic field dedicated to their study. Hindus are perfectly qualified to express their view on their own faith. Which happens to be <i>modern</i> Hinduism, I doubt any of you was born early enough to remember king Samudragupta. What you are suggesting is basically that every Catholic is a natural expert on Biblical criticism and Koine Greek philology by virtue of having been sprinkled by some water, or that every Muslim is an expert on Classical Arabic by virtue of having said a short phrase. A view which besides being patently ridiculous is also emphatically rejected by both the Catholic Church and Islam. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(íÅ≥)</a></small> 12:30, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm a bit surprised you seem to want to mention the position of <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalitstan.html" title="Dalitstan">Dalitstan</a> in the article, Rumpel, since you do not appear to share their views at all.

I am not sure we should legitimize such anti-Hindu extremism by listing it as a notable position in a "dispute" over the ritual.

<dd>I summarized the anti-Hindu polemic and removed the source since it is rather pointless to cite a hate site here in a academic article.Nonetheless, since Dalitstan achieved quite a popularity among anti-Hindu fringes when they were around it is important (I think) to mention their views, properly contextualized as propaganda, of course.<a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumpelstiltskin223_6de5.html" title="User:Rumpelstiltskin223">Rumpelstiltskin223</a> 15:45, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I wrote "through deliberate falsifications and selective choice of quotes taken out of context".

<p>Paul Barlow, if you can cite firsthand documentary evidence, in Sanskrit, and not based on some translation, that 'ashva' in 'ashva-medha mahaa-yajna' means a horse, then do so. I seriously doubt if you have even an iota of competence. People like you should stop dabbling in subjects like the Vedas in which you not only have no competence but which is none of your business. No one needs ignorant people to malign Hinduism. Let me share an anecdote with you. An 'asura' went to the ocean at the southern tip of India, and asked the ocean to give him a fight. The ocean said that the 'asura' should seek someone who was his equal, and sent him way up in the north to the Himalayas. The 'asura' asked the mountain to give him a fight. The mountain said that it was not in his nature to fight, and sent the 'asura' to Vali, the 'vaanara' king of Kishkindha. Guess what, Vali put the 'asura' in his place. Paul, I am greatly impressed by the tenacity of people like you. What you should do is, find out if there is an article on Christianity or Islam. Visit those articles, and start asking for proofs for such basic tenets as, "Was Mary really a virgin?" or ask proof for anything about the holy book of Islam or the prophet. Your mischief won't last long. I dare you to try. Put up or shut up.<a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKanchanamala_449b.html" title="User:Kanchanamala">Kanchanamala</a> 04:12, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Nothwithstanding your editorial remarks, how are you so sure that 'ashva' here means a horse? Denial is a subterranian river ('gupta-vaahini') in your little knowledge.

<dd>Perhaps because ashva does normally mean horse. However, why don't you pour de Nile-like rivers of your profound knowledge over us and explain why it does <i>not</i> mean what it <i>usually</i> means. Rudra suggests that you are claiming that it is a bahuvrhi compound. OK. Tell us. By the way, have a look at the <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_true_Scotsman_3eed.html" title="No true Scotsman">no true Scotsman</a> fallacy. You seem to be adopting the "no true Hindu" equivalent. According to you "Hindus" deny that the sacrifice involved a real horse. This is despite the fact many Hindus clearly do not, and that a real horse seems to be depicted on Samudragupta's coins and referred to in the Epics. So were the Hindus who created these objects and texts "degenerate" or "confused" in some way? Were they No True Hindus? <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 13:08, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Paul, Samudragupta's coin has nothing to do with understanding the 'ashva-medha mahaa-yajna'. I have just informed you guys that 'ashva' here does not mean a horse. I don't intend to initiate anyone into Vedic studies in this forum. Please find yourself a learned teacher, and do fundamental research on the relevant Vedic material. It does not matter whether your teacher is a Hindu or a Martian as long as that teacher is learned and competent.

<dd>I don't really understand why Rudrasharman, Dab and Paul are complicating such a simple proposition. So, let me try to lead you all through the logic step-by-step:
<ol>
<li>Ashva does not mean a horse.</li>
<li>Why? Because I said so. <small>and I don't need references</small></li>
<li>Why should I believe you&#160;? Because I am a <i>true</i> Hindu. <small>and by the way, asking for references smacks of anti-Hinduism</small></li>
<li>What makes you a true Hindu&#160;? See answer to (2) and repeat cycle.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>See , it is simplicity itself&#160;! If you still don't get it, get yourself a <i>true</i> teacher who will explain this to you. Then you can come back and work on this article. However before you try editing the article, make sure these statements appear obvious to you (else continue with your education)
<ul>
<li>Any reference which say Ashva=horse is too old or, too new, or too western or too communist; and definitely non-Hindu.</li>
<li>Any reference, <a href="http://www.unc.edu/depts/jomc/academics/dri/idog.html" class="external text" title="http://www.unc.edu/depts/jomc/academics/dri/idog.html" rel="nofollow">ahem person on internet</a>, who says Ashva does not mean horse is correct by definition.</li>

<p>Man, you guys have started attacking me like a pack of hyenas. That's okay. I have known college students acting like that. My good friends, you seem to have a lot of time at your disposal, I don't. Anyway, Rudrasharman, you seem to have great facility in Sanskrit. That makes it easy for me. Now, more than one word has been used in different contexts while referring to a horse: 'ashva', 'turaga', 'saindhava', 'vaajin', 'hari', and so on. The word for horse in Sanskrit seems to be 'haya' from the root 'hi gatau vriddhau ca'. The word 'ashva' from the root 'ashoo vyaaptau sanghaate ca' is a very potential word. When unable to determine the right meaning in any given context, especially in the Vedic texts, it is convenient for one to explain it away as a horse. In explaining the 'gana sutra' "shveta-ashva-ashvatara ..." in the Ashtaadhyayi, Kaumudi does not explain the word 'ashva' to mean a horse. Shankaraananda, for instance, in one context, explains it to mean 'indriya'. I have not come across any instance where any commentator, Sayana, Uvata, Mahidhara, and the like, have explained 'ashva' in the Vedic 'ashva-medha mahaa-yajna' to mean a horse. Rudrasharman, I am a Hindu. For me, the Vedas are the holy book. It bothers me when someone goes out on a rampage to show the Vedas as dealing with horse and horseshit. It is as highly improper and unbecoming of any decent scholar to do so as trying to prove that Mary, mother of Jesus, did not have an immaculate conception. Let us be decent and sincere. I shall give you guys the last word.<a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKanchanamala_449b.html" title="User:Kanchanamala">Kanchanamala</a> 22:02, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Last word? The point here is not to shut you up. It's to encourage you to contribute something. You keep on repeating "ashva is not 'horse' (in some contexts)". What you don't say is what 'ashva' is, <i>instead</i>, in those contexts. In other words, you haven't offered a positive assertion, something that can be reliably or credibly verified. Even here you could have mentioned what Sayana, Uvata or Mahidhara <i>do</i> say about 'ashva' in 'ashva-medha mahaa-yajna', but again you merely register a denial.</dd>
<dd>As for "horse" in Sanskrit -- or Vedic -- there are many words: <i>haya</i> carries no special distinction. In fact, if any word does, it would be <i>a≈õva</i>. Consider the structure of the Naighantuka (the first 3 parts of the Nighantu, that deal in synonyms). It has lists, of words <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, etc., followed by a defining or explanatory word "X". If the Naighantuka is to make any sense at all, clearly the import of each such list is "The words <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, etc are found/used with the sense of 'X'", and for this to be <i>useful</i>, it must be the case that 'X' is generally much better known or more commonly understood or clearly less ambiguous than the words <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, etc. that it explains (some of which are obscure indeed!). Note also that the context of the words in the Naighantuka is unambiguously Vedic (and Rgvedic at that.)</dd>
<dd>Now, look at Ngh.1.14. What are <i>a, b, c, etc</i>? The list starts <i>atya·∏•, haya·∏•, arvƒÅ, vƒÅjƒ´, sapti·∏•, vahni·∏•, dadhikrƒÅ·∏•, dadhikrƒÅvƒÅ, ...</i> and amounts to 26 words in all. And what is the defining, explaining 'X'? You guessed it, <i>a≈õva</i> (<i>itya≈õvƒÅnƒÅm</i>).</dd>
<dd>For completeness: <i>a≈õva</i> also occurs in the Daivata (the 5th part of the Nighantu that deals with epithets of divine beings, at Ngh.5.3). Yaska is well aware of this, and specifically talks about it in his commentary on Ngh.1.14, which is in N.2.27, where in Lakshman Sarup's translation, he says "The following twenty-six (words) are synonyms of horse [...] There are Vedic passages where the word is used (both in the sense of) a horse and a deity. We shall explain those (passages where the word is used in the sense of) a deity later, and in this place those (where it is used in the sense of) a horse." (<i>... athaitada≈õvavat</i>. See N.9.1. for <i>a≈õva</i> the deity.)</dd>
<dd>It's all there in the Nirukta, from Yaska's time, well before any medieval mystifications, or worse, misconstruals of <i>bandhu</i>s as literal "definitions": Yaska, following the Nighantu, using <i>a≈õva</i> as the most readily accessible and understandable word for... horse. <i>In relation to Vedic usages</i>. Wow.</dd>
<dd>(And btw, I make no claims of "great facility". I'm more a historian than a sanskritist, and what I do in real life to pay my bills is far removed from both. Even so, was "shveta-ashva-ashvatara" a "test" of some kind? "shvetaashva" is one word here, as is clear from the items listed for '..lopas ca'.) <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudrasharman_3689.html" title="User:Rudrasharman">rudra</a> 05:11, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rudrasharman, I don't know who you are, and why you are so adamant to show that 'ashva' in the Vedic 'ashva-medha mahaa-yajna' means a horse. Let me respond. (1) As I have said above, when unable to determine the right meaning of 'ashva' in any given context, especially in the Vedic texts, it is convenient for one to explain it away as a horse. The translator quoted by you is a good example of it. I am not inclined to think that Nirukta is interested in giving the synonyms of horse. [By the way, Vedic 'devataa' does not mean a deity that is worshipped in a mandir]. (2) I am only interested in pointing out that 'ashva' in the Vedic 'ashva-medha mahaa-yajna' does not mean a horse. If you can quote Yaska, you should be able to try to find out what 'ashva' means in the 'yajna'. Let me give you an analogy. In the context of computers, if one says that 'hardware' means articles made of metals, as tools, nails, fittings, utensils, etc., I tell that person that 'hardware' does not mean that in the context of computers. That's all. You should do your own digging to find the gold. I shall not do it for you in this forum. (3) Please don't encourage me to spend any more time in this discussion. If you want to keep horsing, be my guest.<a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKanchanamala_449b.html" title="User:Kanchanamala">Kanchanamala</a> 18:59, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(1) Yaska's Nirukta is a commentary on the Nighantu, as stated at the very beginning: "<i>samƒÅmnƒÅya·∏• samƒÅmnƒÅta·∏• | sa vyƒÅkhyƒÅtavya·∏• |</i>" If, as you suggest, "deity" is inherently associated with worship in a mandir, then "divinity" might have been a better choice of word, but there is no real danger of confusion given even the slightest acquaintance with Vedic texts.</dd>
<dd>(2) Um, no. I'm not here to do <i>your</i> research for you. Your say-so, which is what it has amounted to so far, is worthless.</dd>
<dd>(3) Suit yourself. If you don't want to contribute what 'ashva' <i>does</i> mean, then don't. *shrug* <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudrasharman_3689.html" title="User:Rudrasharman">rudra</a> 19:56, 4 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This interpretation of Nighantu/Nirukta is completely backwards. The text is not giving us a list of terms to be used synonymously with 'horse', its giving us a list of terms which elucidate the various meanings of 'a·π£va'. Take the term 'vƒÅjƒ´' for example. If you look it up in Monier-Williams (MW938c) you will see:
<dl>
<dd><b>vƒÅjƒ´</b>: in comp. for vƒÅja mfn. strengthening, stimulating, producing virility; n. an aphrodesiac.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>In turn, look up vƒÅja (MW938a), and you will find:
<dl>
<dd><b>vƒÅja</b>: m. (&gt; <i>vaj</i>) strength, vigour, energy, spirit, speed, RV. AV.; a contest, race, conflict, battle, war, RV.; the prize of a race or of battle, booty, gain, reward, any precious or valuable possession, wealth, treasure, RV. AV.; food, sacrificial food, RV.; (?) a swift or spirited horse, war-horse, steed, RV. AV.; the feathers of an arrow, RV.(...)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>[Note: I did not add the (?) before 'a swift or spirited horse' - it's Monier-Williams' own note. I did, however, limit the glosses to those with RV (and AV).] The logic here is to elucidate all the concepts implied by the highly polysemous term 'a·π£va'. Think about it for a minute and you will see that L. Sarup has it backwards. If he were right, then vƒÅjƒ´ (or vƒÅja, as the case may be) would mean nothing other than 'horse'.</dd>
<dd>Besides, don't you find it at all odd that a translator/interpreter (Sarup) should use a one-dimensional gloss (a·π£va = 'horse') while translating a text the very nature of which is to explain the polysemous aspects of various important terms in Vedic literature?
<dl>
<dd>Did you even read what I wrote? Look at your own example and perform the appropriate substitutions in "The word <i>a</i> is found/used with the sense of 'X'". This does not preclude other meanings for <i>a</i>. In fact, that is precisely the point: the Nighantu is primarily a collection of <i>difficult</i> words, whose original meanings in not a few cases were unknown in (or lost by) Yaska's time. According to your "interpretation", the lists <i>a, b, c...</i> consist of well-known or understood words that elucidate the meanings of the various X's! Sheesh, the extent to which people will go to mystify everything with ten-dollar words like "polysemous" and whatnot. *shakes head* <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudrasharman_3689.html" title="User:Rudrasharman">rudra</a> 02:21, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, for your argument to be correct, then all of the terms listed would have to be rather obscure and otherwise non-related to the key term (in this case 'a·π£va'). However, haya, for example, is primarily defined by Monier-Williams as 'horse' and secondarily as 'urging on, driving', both in connection with the root &gt;hi. Of all the terms listed by the Nighantu in connection with 'a·π£va', haya is most clearly 'horse', and - going by your interpretation - any gloss in this context would be completely superfluous. However, if the aim of the Nighantu is, as I have said, to give a list of terms which help to clarify the various connotations of the word 'a·π£va', then its inclusion makes perfect sense. -Varoon
<dl>
<dd>The Nighantu was a traditional list by Yaska's time. No one knows the original reasons for the compilation, and Yaska does not say either. As far as we know, he made no attempt to reduce it to just the obscure words, so the occurrence of words that <i>now</i> appear familiar is of no significance, just as there are still a number of obscure words that had it not been for the Nighantu and the Nirukta would have been lost completely. "All of the words have to be obscure" is a straw man. <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudrasharman_3689.html" title="User:Rudrasharman">rudra</a> 02:21, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here's a simple test for Varoon. We have an associative structure of the form {<i>a, b, c</i>...} &lt;=&gt; X. Let us call the left-hand-side list {} the "numerators" and the right-hand-side 'X' the "denominator". We have two theories of the association (and thus, by implication, what the Nirukta is "all about")</p>
<ul>
<li>Polysemic&#160;: Each numerator is a gloss of the denominator</li>
<li>Metonymic&#160;: The denominator is a gloss of each numerator</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider, first, the word <i>gauh</i>. It has, as we know, tons of meanings, a polysemous word if there ever was one. Apart from the standard "cow", for example, there is "earth (i.e. world)". Next, consider the word <i>pr.thivƒ´</i>, which also means "earth", apart from its divine associations. Let us agree, then, that <i>pr.thivƒ´</i> is (or at least, can be) a gloss of <i>gauh</i>. Finally, let us assume that this gloss, of <i>gauh</i> by <i>pr.thivƒ´</i>, occurs in the Naighantuka. Our problem is to predict the form of the entry.</p>
<ul>
<li>Polysemic&#160;: <i>pr.thivƒ´</i> should be a numerator for the denominator <i>gauh</i></li>
<li>Metonymic&#160;: <i>gauh</i> should be a numerator for the denominator <i>pr.thivƒ´</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, someone please consult Naighantuka 1.1 (the very first entry) and get back to us. <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudrasharman_3689.html" title="User:Rudrasharman">rudra</a> 06:07, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>while this is all very interesting, it is also completely offtopic here. You could add to the articles on <a href="../../../n/i/r/Nirukta.html" title="Nirukta">Nirukta</a> or <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polysemy.html" title="Polysemy">polysemy</a> etc., but since the meaning "horse" of <i>ashva</i> in <i>ashvamedha</i> is completely undisputed, I don't see what the discussion is giving us here. I mean, the <i>ashva</i> of the Yajurveda text is sprinkled with water, has things whispered into his ear, is left to roam the countryside, is yoked to a chariot, bathed, bound to a stake and finally killed. Now <i>ashva</i> may be polysemous, and refer to the number seven or the constellation Sagittarius, but you'd need to be completely off your rocker to argue that the idea is to whisper into the ear of the number seven, or to yoke the constellation of Sagittarius to a chariot, and, more to the point, nobody has been shown to have suggested such a thing in anything like respectable academic discussion, so discussion of the polysemy of ashva may be interesting on our <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashva.html" title="Ashva">ashva</a> article, but it is completely irrelevant here. I am also tired of the allusions that topics of Hinduism are somehow treated more criticlally than topics of Christianity , as Kanchanamala does above. That's just a completely empty claim, an entirely transparent attempt at playing the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_card.html" title="Race card">race card</a>, and half a minute of research would show that this is simply not the case.

<dd>what is wrong with you? If you like to be addressed as a "she", all you have to do is ask, or maybe identify yourself as female on your userpage. I thought you were objecting to my referring to the <i>ashva</i> as a "he", which would at least have some relevance to the article (since, you may be surprised to learn, Wikipedia talkpages are for discussing <i>articles</i>).

<p>Fellow editors: It is normal practice to use secondary sources. But when questions are raised using primary sources, they should be considered. Secondary sources should not be treated as definitive. After having all the discussion so far in this forum, one should not say that the meaning 'horse' attributed to the Sanskrit word 'ashva' [in 'ashva-medha mahaa-yajna' in the Vedas] is undisputed. The dispute should be mentioned in the article.<a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKanchanamala_449b.html" title="User:Kanchanamala">Kanchanamala</a> 23:57, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKanchanamala_449b.html" title="User:Kanchanamala">Kanchanamala</a>, what you say may well be true and I personally will be happy to add other interpretations of Ashvamedha i the article, <i><b>if</b></i> we can source the interpretations to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. As you probably well know through your own experience editing wikipedia we <i><b>cannot</b></i> do <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> on wikipedia and cannot therefore state that the Ashva = horse is disputed based on disagreement between editors. To reiterate:
<ol>
<li>If we obtain a reliable secondary source that provides another interpretation of Ashva in the context of Ashvamedha, or states that the interpretation of Ashva as a horse is disputed, we can and should add that to the article.</li>
<li>If you feel that we should <i>not need</i> a secondary source for this purpose, but should add the other interpretations based on your (and other editors) analysis of primary vedic sources; then you should take the dispute to <a href="../../../v/p/p/WP%7EVPP_9f2a.html" title="WP:VPP">Village Pump (Policy)</a> in order to request a change to the underlying wikipedia policies that would allow us to do so.</li>

<dd>we do say that "Swami Satya Prakash Saraswati", whoever that is, claims that ashva is the Sun and stuff. That's Arya Samaj doctrine, and duly treated under the Arya Samaj section.

<dd>Kak in his book on the ritual initially claimed that a real horse is used in some parts of the ritual and that a "substitute" is used elsewhere. In his keenness to dissociate physical sacrifice from the Rigvedic sages, he claims that real horse sacrifices may have been performed by non-Vedic peoples who later merged with them and "corrupted" the Vedic ritual (no evidence at all is provided for this). His theory that asvaka refers to a toy seems to be a recent development. In his book he follows the argument that it refers to a fire, sourcing the claim to S. Sankarananda, the leader of the Ramakrishna movement in the 40s and 50s. Sankarananda's book claims that the "dead horse" is in fact "a fire called asvaka which represented the sun dead in the sky during the night preserved in a small scale fire in the earth". In this version she sits in an all-night vigil by the fire with her husband (Sankarananda, <i>The Rigvedic Culture of the Pre-Historic Indus</i>, Das Gupta, 1943). It should be noted that Sankarananda, like Dayananda, is preocuppied with the idea that sexual imagery of any sort <i>must</i> represent degeneration from a primitive "purity". "the sex cult...did not originate as a religious cult. It is an after-product. It is a degeneration of the original. It is the people who bring down the ideal, which is too high for them to comprehend, to their own levels." However, he goes on to helpfully explain that the Christian cross <i>did</i> originate as a phallic symbol, so "Christian votaries are devotees of a sex cult". <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 10:35, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<p><b>Abecedare,</b> I respect you. May I submit that, (1) I have only shared my comments as a discussant, and (2) I have only suggested that a change should be made in the article on Ashvamedha. When I read a passage in the Vedas, say "ashvena ca rathena ca sooryah ..." [Krishna Yajurveda Taittiriya Samhita 4.4.8.18], I think like say Sayana who "adopts the naturalistic interpretation [of the Vedic devataas], which is supported by modern European scholars" [S.Radhakrishnan, "Indian Philosophy",1929, page 68]. When I look up at the sky, I see the bright white shining sun. I don't see any chariot driven by seven horses. I am deeply concerned about the Vedas because my faith is firmly founded on it. If I have come out strongly sometimes, I shall beg my fellow editors to forgive me.<a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKanchanamala_449b.html" title="User:Kanchanamala">Kanchanamala</a> 18:53, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Did <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radhakrishnan.html" title="Radhakrishnan">Radhakrishnan</a> quote this passage, or just Sayana, in his book? And was it in the context of the Ashvamedha? AFAIK, TS.4.4.8 is part of the Agnicayana (Fire-Altar) ritual, and has <i>a≈õvena ca rathena ca vajrƒ´</i> (not <i>s≈´rya·∏•</i>). The entire passage is obviously about Indra (if not also addressed to him through the bricks). The bearer of the thunderbolt on a chariot drawn by horses is a perfectly coherent image, don't you think? <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudrasharman_3689.html" title="User:Rudrasharman">rudra</a> 21:30, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the point Kanchanamala is making, through an example, is that the language of the vedas is not always literal. This I assume no one will disagree with&#160;!&#160;:-)</dd>
<dd>As for the question of whether the Ashva in Ashvamedha refers to a horse or not - <i>luckily</i> we don't have to settle that issue on wikipedia (that is what academic journals are for&#160;!). All we have to do is <i>cite</i> what <i>reliable sources</i> have said on the issue - as far as I see the article already does that, and more views (from acknowledged/prominent scholars, academicians or religious figures) can be added if and when an editor provides them.</dd>
<dd>Does anyone disagree with the summary&#160;? If so, please provide a concrete suggestion on what <i>specifically</i> you would like to add/change in the article. If not, any general discussion on the <i>subject</i> of the article (rather than its <i>writing</i>) interesting as it may be is better moved to other forums such as <a href="http://www.hindunet.com/forum/" class="external text" title="http://www.hindunet.com/forum/" rel="nofollow">this</a> or <a href="../../../h/n/b/WT%7EHNB_0b8f.html" title="WT:HNB">WT:HNB</a>.</dd>

<p><b>Abecedare:</b> May I suggest you consider the following to be included in the article in the very introductory paragraph: <b>When the Vedic text is interpreted, like Sayana does, in a naturalistic way,</b> [cite S.Radhakrishnan, "Indian Philosophy", 1929, p.68] <b>the word 'ashva' in some contexts in the Vedas does not mean a horse.</b> [cite Krishna Yajurveda Taittiriya Samhita, 4.4.8.18]<a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKanchanamala_449b.html" title="User:Kanchanamala">Kanchanamala</a> 02:51, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKanchanamala_449b.html" title="User:Kanchanamala">Kanchanamala</a>, for the suggestion. I think the <i>particular language</i> you suggest may not be includable (if that is a word&#160;:-) ), since it may violate wikipedia's guidelines on <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYNT_6790.html" title="WP:SYNT">synthesis</a> and may be even considered somewhat tangential since, (1) neither of the cited sources are specifically talking about the ashvamedha yagna, and (2) no secondary source cites the two sources to draw the desired conclusion.</dd>
<dd>That said, I think your suggestion did clarify some issues for me. If I understand your viewpoint correctly now, you don't dispute that <i>ashva</i> literally translate into "horse" even in the context of Ashvamedha; rather your view is that the term "horse sacrifice" is used figuratively and does not involve the literal killing of an animal? In summary the point that you wish to add is along the lines: "while Ashvamedha literally translates to 'Horse sacrifice', some commentators interpret the term as a figurative reference to 'ascetic austerities' ". Right&#160;?</dd>
<dd>If so, this point is currently mentioned in the "Vedanta and Puranas" section of the article. If we can find reliable sources making this point directly, we can place it more boldly, perhaps even in the lead. IIRC, Sri Aurobindo has provided an alternate interpretation of Ashva in his writings ... although I don't recall if that was in the context of Ashvamedha and I cannot locate the specific work right now. Anyone have that reference handy&#160;? If so, we could add a sentence about the existence of non-literal interpretations more prominently.

<dd>The history of this issue is fairly clear. European scholars became interested in the Vedas during the nineteenth century. There is generally little "Christian" bias in this interest, but of course Christian missionary activity was common in the British Empire, and missionaries certainly regularly claimed that Hinduism is morally degenerate in comparison to Christianity. Ever since Wilkins‚Äô translation of the Gita there was a discursive convention contrasting the ‚Äúpure‚Äù and ‚Äúnoble‚Äù forms of Hindu thought with corrupted or degenerate forms. Max M√ºller regularly uses this kind of language. The Ashvamedha was certainly used by missionaries to attack claims for the sacred status of the Vedas. In some cases, as with the <i>Brahmo Samaj</i>, that led to a rejection of the authority of the Vedas as a basis for Hinduism (M√ºller congratulated Sen and Mozoomdar for conceding this). An alternative and more popular response was a reactive tendency to accept the pure/degenerate model but to defend the Vedas by insisting that they were ‚Äúpure‚Äù and that later interpretations were ‚Äúdegenerate‚Äù. These accounts drew on earlier traditions that had accepted symbolic and figurative significance to the ritual, but which did not deny that the ritual itself existed in the ‚Äúnaturalistic‚Äù sense. The radical claims of Dayananda substituted the symbolic language that had developed for the ‚Äúliteral‚Äù reading, insisting that the latter was a misinterpretation. His account is extreme, others were less so. Most did not deny that an actual horse was central to the ritual. They either denied simply the sexual aspect of the ritual or the literal killing of the horse. There are several such traditions. They are all directly connected to responses to Christianity and, more recently, to Islam. As far as I know there is no denial of the literal nature of the ritual prior to the 19th century, though of course there is much discussion of the symbolic aspects and of the notion that the exterior form leads us to a deeper spiritual meaning. The Epics are clear that a literal ritual is described, as are all early sources. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 20:58, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Abecedare,</b> thank you for your timely help. You have been a good guide to me in the twilight zone of Wikipedia. (1) I am a student of the Vedas born and raised in the world of academics. That, nonetheless, I have not been excommunicated by Wikipedia is a welcome situation, and for that I shall remain grateful to my fellow editors. (2) I have been made to realize that I am not yet in a position, in Wikipedia, to dispute the interpretation that 'ashva' in the Vedic 'ashva-medha mahaa-yajna' means a horse. But when I am, I shall make my submission. (3) Also, Abecedare, in the example quoted by me, 'ashva' is used literally not to mean a horse.

<dd>AFAIK, the only translation is that of Griffith. Getting his original may be problematic, though. The published versions available these days have been "edited" by at least two people, Surendra Pratap and Ravi Prakash Arya. If the efforts with 23.19-31 are any indication, all bets are off. You'll just have to read it yourself, and answer questions such as: what is bound by the sacrificer with 22.3 and sprinkled while reciting 22.4? In whose ear is 22.19 whispered? And so on. Not to mention the brahmana commentary, or the details in the shrautasutras.</dd>

<dd>A clarification is in order, I think. "Three full translations" is misleading, because the same text is not involved in all three. The Yajurveda has two <b>major</b> variants, Shukla ("white") and Krishna ("black"), that amount to distinct textual traditions, within each of which there are further recensional variations. The Shukla Yajurveda has two main recensions, Kanva and Madhyandina, which have survived. The Krishna Yajurveda has at least three (Taittiriya, Maitrayani, Kathaka). AB Keith's translation (and I believe Devi Chand's) is of the Taittiriya recension of the "black" YV, while Griffith's is of the Madhyandina recension of the "white" YV. There's plenty of overlap in material, but the texts are far from equivalent in any sense that would allow Keith's and Griffith's translations to be considered subsitutable for each other. <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudrasharman_3689.html" title="User:Rudrasharman">rudra</a> 03:39, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The BAU that is generally cited, and which has the Ashvamedha-related material in the first two brahmanas, is actually the Kanva recension (i.e. ≈öBK 17). This is mainly because Sankara's commentary was on that version. In the Madhyandina recension, the BAU (at ≈öBM 14.3 onwards) starts with the third brahmana of the Kanva version (<i>dvayƒÅ ha prajƒÅpatyƒÅ·∏• ...</i>). The first two are found instead in the ≈öBM at 10.6.4 (1.1.1-2 as just one paragraph) and 10.6.5.1-8 (1.2.7 split into two), as the concluding sections of the Agnirahasya. Also noteworthy is that TS.7.5.25 is probably an older version of ≈öBK-BAU.1.1.1-2/≈öBM.10.6.4, and the core bandhu may have even had origins in actual liturgy. <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudrasharman_3689.html" title="User:Rudrasharman">rudra</a> 04:19, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you again to all who are sharing views on this question. I had not previously been introduced to this question and so am learning much by reading your dialog. It is helpful to me when specific citations are given. I found a systematic presentation of the "inner yajna" perspective in the document "Yajur Veda" at: <a href="http://www.vedah.com/org/literature/PDFs/Yajur_Veda.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.vedah.com/org/literature/PDFs/Yajur_Veda.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.vedah.com/org/literature/PDFs/Yajur_Veda.pdf</a> In particular, pages 77-89 include a tabular outline of the way this school interprets various aspects of the sources in a symbolic way. Can any of you with more experience in this question give me perspective on this document? A quick way to research its views on this topic is to open the document in Adobe Acrobat Reader and then do a search for the term "ashva" which quickly allowed me to go to the relevant parts of this long document. It is clearly a secondary source, but one that supports the symbolic interpretation theory. Please help me understand this better. <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBuddhipriya_9b91.html" title="User:Buddhipriya">Buddhipriya</a> 04:48, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unfortunately, this is not the place to discuss the contents of the document. The only issue is whether this can be considered a reliable or credible secondary source. Are there any reviews or critical assessments of this document (or its "school")? Do the assertions hold up philologically? Also, please note that while slagging so-called "ritualistic interpretations" is quite common among mystics, it is a staple of Hindu politeness to refrain from commenting adversely (in public, at least) on the alternatives propounded by such critics. <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudrasharman_3689.html" title="User:Rudrasharman">rudra</a> 05:38, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are quite right that the document cannot be relied on as an academic citation.

<dd>I read the Aurobindo PDF again more closely and at the end it does provide a citation to what may have been their source for that article. I tracked the book down further at <a href="http://www.mlbd.com" class="external free" title="http://www.mlbd.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mlbd.com</a> which is the publisher. Here is what I dug up: Kak, Subhash., 2002. The Asvamedha: The Rite and its Logic. Motilal Banarsidass, New Delhi. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 81-208-1877-6</a> Bibliography: vii+71p. Abbreviation, Notes, Ref. Index. The publisher's blurb says "ABOUT THE BOOK: This book describes the ASVAMEDHA rite and its symbolism to explain distinctive aspects of the Vedic sacrifice system. Several questions related to the Asvamedha are posed and answered in the context of Vedic epistemology. This rite has three important functions: (i) it presents and equivalence of the naksatra year to the heaven, implying that it is rite that celebrates the rebirth of the Sun; (ii) it is symbolic of the conquest of Time by the king, in whose name the rite is performed; and (iii) it is celebration of social harmony achieved by the transcendence of the fundamental conflicts between various sources of power. Numbers from another Vedic rite, the Agnicayana; help in the understanding of several of its details. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: SUBHASH KAK is an acclaimed scientist, historian and Vedic scholar. Currently a professor at Louisiana State University, he has authored thirteen books and more than 200 research papers in the fields of information theory, neural networks and Indic studies." I became curious about this and Googling his name found his home page: <a href="http://www.ee.lsu.edu/kak/" class="external free" title="http://www.ee.lsu.edu/kak/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ee.lsu.edu/kak/</a> The article already mentions that there are metaphorical interpretations of the rite in addition to the literal interpretations but perhaps the issue is more sensitive for some than I for one realized. <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBuddhipriya_9b91.html" title="User:Buddhipriya">Buddhipriya</a> 08:19, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>this is quite rich. I was so far prepared to assume that Kak is a bona fide engineer that just happens to dabble in Arya-Samaj-style "Vedic" kookery. But the relativity thing seems to establish that the guy is a complete fake beginning to end. No egineer worth his salt would spout such nonsense about general relativity. As it happens, we do have a full page "devoted to his kookery", it's at <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subhash_Kak_8b01.html" title="Subhash Kak">Subhash Kak</a>. It appears it does need a bit of cleanup, since it seems to depict him as a serious researcher (and poet, of course). We'd also need to check if there is such a thing as a "<a href="../../../k/a/k/Kak_neural_network.html" title="Kak neural network">Kak neural network</a>". The article seems to rely on citations of Kak himself to establish that there is a type of neural network named after Kak. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(íÅ≥)</a></small> 11:19, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I will rely on the judgement of the usual editors for this article on what would be best to do. I have little knowledge on this topic and so am simply placing the citation at the feet of those who are able to assess it better. For me, the important insight I have gotten from this exchange is that the topic is a matter of living faith to some, and as such has the potential to give offense. It is a measure of my ignorance that I was surprised to learn that. <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBuddhipriya_9b91.html" title="User:Buddhipriya">Buddhipriya</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/d/User_talk%7EBuddhipriya_22b5.html" title="User talk:Buddhipriya">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Buddhipriya_a5a5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Buddhipriya">contribs</a>) 16:23, 14 February 2007 (UTC).</small> <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBuddhipriya_9b91.html" title="User:Buddhipriya">Buddhipriya</a> 18:22, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>you are right; the "offense" is largely due to Ambedkar et al. who have used the ancient ritual to denigrate contemporary Hinduism. Some Hindu authors are "feeding the troll" as it were by embarking on ludicrous claims instead of simply shrugging it off as irrelevant to their faith. You could as well try to call a Frenchman an ogre because his Gaulish forbears used to practice human sacrifice. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(íÅ≥)</a></small> 17:52, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Citation: J. P. Mallory. In Search of the Indo-Europeans: Language, Archaeology and Myth. (Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.: London, 1989) pp. 135-7 <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-500-27616-1</a>. I believe that Mallory is a mainstream text. He has a section on "Horse sacrifice" that says "Some would maintain that the <i>premier</i> animal of Indo-European sacrifice and ritual was probably the horse." His summary of the Indic version of the asvamedha is firmly literalist. He then compares the Roman horse sacrifice which was known as the October Equus. He then cites another parallel sacrifice in medieval Ireland. "A detailed analysis of this and other material has led Jaan Puhvel to propose a Proto-Indo-European myth and ritual which involved the mating of a figure from the royal class with a horse from which ultimately sprung the famous equine divine twins." He says that the name of the Indic ceremony, which he transliterates as "asvamedha", derives from the Proto-Indo-European *ekwo-meydho "horse-drunk", attesting a ritual which included both a horse and drunkenness. The modern English mead is part of the same series that gives us Sanskrit madhu-, Greek methy, Old Church Slavonic medu, etc. Another interesting parallel is in the recurrent depiction of Indo-European divine twins associated with or represented by horses such as the Indic Ashvins "horsemen", the Greek horsemen Castor and Pollux, etc. He connects up other details with archaeological evidence that paired draught horses were not likely to have been employed until after 2500 BC, and consequently some time after some assume the disintegration of the Proto-Indo-European community, raising a conflict between the mythological prevalence of the divine horse-twin motif and the physical evidence of cultural artifacts. In all, it is an interesting read which I have summarized perhaps so much as to be unintelligible. He has citations to the materials by Puhvel which may be worth looking into. If you want them I can provide them. <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBuddhipriya_9b91.html" title="User:Buddhipriya">Buddhipriya</a> 08:54, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mallory is indeed a good summary of mainstream opinion, and this article could indeed do with a comparative paragraph addressing these things. <i>ekwo-meydho</i> is however conjecture, there is no cognate term, and translating <i>meydho</i> as "drunk" is a bit daring: <i>meydho</i> is *not* the same as <i>medhu</i>. The literal meaning of Sanskrit <i>medha</i> is "broth, juice", but it obviously came to mean "cooked animal sacrifice" early on, so that it would be very misleading to translate <i>ashvamedha</i> as "horse-broth". <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(íÅ≥)</a></small> 10:07, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From <i>Indian Philosophy</i> Vol. 1 (OUP 1929) p.69:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Mr. Aurobindo Ghosh, the great Indian scholar-mystic, is of opinion that the Vedas are replete with suggestions of secret doctrines and mystic philosophies. He looks upon the gods of the hymns as symbols of the psychological functions. S≈´rya signifies intelligence, Agni will, and Soma feeling. The Veda to him is a mystery religion corresponding to the Orphic and Eleusinian creeds of ancient Greece."</dd>
</dl>
<p>At this point, within the same paragraph (i.e. "inline"), R. quotes a lengthy passage by A. from <i>Arya</i>, Vol i, p.60. (<i>Arya</i> was a journal/magazine edited by Aurobindo, where he published the first forms of the essays that he later reworked into books such as <i>Secret of the Vedas</i>):</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"The hypothesis I propose is that the Rg-Veda is itself the one considerable document that remains to us from the early period of human thought of which the historical Eleusinian and Orphic mysteries were the failing remnants, when the spiritual and psychological knowledge of the race was concealed for reasons now difficult to determine, in a veil of concrete and material figures and symbols which protected the sense from the profane and revealed it to the initiated. One of the leading principles of the mystics was the sacredness and secrecy of self-knowledge and the true knowledge of the gods. This wisdom was, they thought, unfit for, perhaps even dangerous, to the ordinary human mind, or in any case liable to perversion and misuse and loss of virtue if revealed to vulgar and unpurified spirits. Hence they favored the existence of an outer worship effective but imperfect for the profane, and an inner discipline for the initiate, and clothed their language in words and images which had equally a spiritual sense for the elect and a concrete sense for the mass of ordinary worshippers. The Vedic hymns were conceived and constructed on these principles."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>R. continues, to conclude the paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"When we find that this view is opposed not only to the modern views of European scholars but also to the traditional interpretations of SƒÅya·πáa and the system of P≈´rva-Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅ, the authority on Vedic interpretation, we must hesitate to follow the lead of Mr. Aurobindo Ghosh, however ingenious his point of view may be. It is not likely that the whole progress of Indian thought has been a steady falling away from the highest spiritual truths of the Vedic hymns. It is more in accordance with what is known of the general nature of human development, and easier to concede that the later religions and philosophies arose out of the crude suggestions and elementary moral ideas and spiritual aspirations of the early mind, than that they were a degradation of an original perfection."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Aurobindo has long been classified as a mystic. This effectively places his views outside the scope of philological critique and evaluation. Since he has to be read on his own terms or not at all, it isn't clear why he needs to be cited here. <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudrasharman_3689.html" title="User:Rudrasharman">rudra</a> 02:39, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The title page of the PDF mentioned earlier has no author other than "Sri Aurobindo Kapali Sastry Institute of Vedic Culture" and it is not otherwise clear on authorship. As I noted in an earlier post, I concur that the PDF document is not worth citing as it does not have a very clear line of sourcing other than to the Kak materials which we have already covered. I am not aware of a citation directly to the writings of Aurobindo, but I have no broad knowledge of his writings. I regret if my language was imprecise. Thank you for sharing the quotation which helps add to the discussion. <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBuddhipriya_9b91.html" title="User:Buddhipriya">Buddhipriya</a> 03:40, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I remember, Aurobindo himself is ambivalent about horses, but wants to follow Dayananda, who he claims "will be honoured as the first discoverer of the right clues" to Vedic interpretation (strange that it wasn't until the late 19th century that the <i>first</i> discovery of the right <i>clues</i> to interpret these texts occurred), so there is a lot of stuff about how asva is really an image of energy as such. Of course this is true of Shakespeare too. When Richard III says "my kingdom for a horse" vulgar materialists have interpreted this to mean that he wants a horse to escape from the battlefield in a cowardly fashion! In fact the true spiritual interpretation is that he wishes to replace his worldly kingdom for the freedom of the spirit as imaged by a horse which really stands for the inner energy or vital power of his soul (etc etc etc). <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 09:07, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
