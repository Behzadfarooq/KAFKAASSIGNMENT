<dd>Thank you for your response on my talk page. It is always more helpful in the cleanup of an article to have more extensive feedback than it is to deal with a general contention that an article needs improvement. I have made this mistake before.

<p>Just a question about the main <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_reenactment.html" title="Historical reenactment">historical reenactment</a> page, and its treatment of 'fantasy' groups</p>
<p>"<i>Although most historical reenactment groups follow a very loose interpretation of history</i>"</p>
<p>I can't quite put my finger on why this doesn't seem quite right, but I'm thinking along the lines of:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a group doesn't take care of their authenticity, do we still call them a <i>historical reenactment group</i>?</li>
<li>What do we mean by "most"? I'm thinking it refers to the <a href="../../../s/c/a/SCA_5e72.html" title="SCA">SCA</a>, which is more numerous than anyone else, and if <a href="../../../s/c/a/SCA_5e72.html" title="SCA">SCA</a> have <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_the_Conqueror_976a.html" title="William the Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a> wearing <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plate_armour.html" title="Plate armour">plate armour</a>, and <a href="../../../s/c/a/SCA_5e72.html" title="SCA">SCA</a> are categorised as 'reenactment' (not sure if they define themselves that way) then indeed "most" would be the correct word.</li>
<li>OTOH, I've never been to a show where someone wore glasses, cotton, black leather, etc. Maybe we're overreaching by trying to categorise so many types of group in one sentence</li>
</ul>

<dd>I guess the difference is the one between "professional" groups (basically stunt or theater groups, which "reenact" a very specific thing with access to professional costumes) and "amateur" groups (anyone else). Nearly all reenactment events I've seen so far had people wearing cotton clothes, hidden skateboard or inliner protectors, period-mismatched attire or weaponry, and so on. Heck, in some events I've seen people wearing modern sports shoes on the battle field (especially when the ground was too wet to enforce authentic-looking footwear).</dd>
<dd>Some events have very restrictive rules regarding authenticity, but while most groups (especially German ones) like to bash other people's inauthenticity, that doesn't mean THEY value it higher than anything else. The general consense is that it's okay if it LOOKS authentic from ten meters away.</dd>
<dd>As a member of a group whose battlefield colours are red on black, I have to say that while there IS a crowd that tries to be as authentic as realistically possible, most people avoid the insane price (money AND time) of such authenticity. Most people don't have the time (which is especially rare if you're more than just a display or living history group and have to maintain a certain skill level) to make their entire kit on their own (which also happens to be inauthentic for a "knight") and don't have the money to afford a (custom tailored) fully authentic kit (which IS a problem if you can't make a living off reenactment -- which is true for nearly everyone but professional groups). Additionally, egalitarianism and men-only combat groups don't go well together.</dd>
<dd>The SCA is on the borderline of LARP and reenactment, but I wasn't thinking of them in particular. Despite the inauthenticity I described most groups still regard the SCA as more of a bad joke than a reenactment group (justified or not).</dd>
<dd>With "most" I actually meant most groups, not most reenactors. Wherever reenactment isn't mainstreamed (everywhere but the U.S.A. I guess), many tiny groups coexist, oftenly without knowing of each other. There are myriads of groups in Germany alone -- most of them are just too tiny to be noticed unless they participate in a larger event. You oftenly only find out about them per hearsay and deeper investigation.</dd>
<dd>I can only talk from my experience and what I've heard,tho , and that only covers Germany and the UK. -- <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmodai_1a4e.html" title="User:Ashmodai">Ashmodai</a> 03:10, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd better give my own group the '<a href="../../../a/u/t/Authenticity_%28reenactment%29.html" title="Authenticity (reenactment)">authentic</a>' tag when it's mentioned then, if it's a major factor distinguishing them from other groups.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I should probably mention that every amateur group I know in the UK doesn't tolerate inauthentic kit (even down to the types of wood used in eating-bowls, or making people go barefoot if they don't have authentic shoes) which is why I queried the edit about <i>most reenactors don't care</i>. <a href="../../../o/j/w/User%7EOjw_9290.html" title="User:Ojw">Ojw</a> 20:51, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd suggest "most" -&gt; "many" then. Apparently there are reenactment groups which strictly enforce authenticity. I guess that factor is the main reason authentic and less-authentic groups don't meet a lot -- the authentic ones wouldn't accept the other type at their events and the other type's events don't appeal to them.</dd>
<dd>As a German reenactor who's mostly been to events in the UK so far (and whose choice of events was based on recommendation), I guess I cannot give an informed neutral oppinion on the scale of strictly authentic versus loosely authentic gear and groups.</dd>
<dd>Considering how authentic (or rather inauthentic) the gear of reenactors in Germany tends to be in disregard of how much they claim to value authenticity (or rather nag about the inauthenticity of others), I'd wager the less authentic crowd is larger -- probably more so in countries where the reenactment supply is very restricted (many German reenactors get most of their equipment -- especially weapons -- from Eastern European countries or the United Kingdom). If the same ratio is true in the UK, then I guess that the authenticity crowd is still very large in comparison because reenactment is more common there than it is here.</dd>
<dd>I guess the "A-factor" is a topic of its own, so the article might need a lot of expansion if we want to cover the entire issue. -- <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmodai_1a4e.html" title="User:Ashmodai">Ashmodai</a> 22:18, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Obviously I'd be delighted to meet you regardless of costume, even if our groups have different ideas on the a-word. I do suspect that it is a factor in our groups' respective choice of engagement though... We only know 1 or 2 european groups and they do fairly realistically... (will mail..)</dd>

<dd>Oh, it's nothing personal. I just don't think it meets the criteria for deletion, especially in comparison to similar images which didn't get deleted or VfD'ed. I think you might be somewhat paranoid and disruptive, but so far I haven't seen anything inapropriate from you. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmodai_1a4e.html" title="User:Ashmodai">Ashmodai</a> 18:00, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Ashmodai, is the text a word to word copy, or has it been rephrased? I tried to find obvious copied sections, but didn't. It would help if you point out the part. I will send an administrator for a check via film project later today. Thanks for checking. <a href="../../../h/o/v/User%7EHoverfish_6f42.html" title="User:Hoverfish">Hoverfish</a> 08:59, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh, you mean the sections you already deleted? Yes, they look copied/rearranged, but since you deleted them it's not clear what the copyvio is refering to. I will notify the admin to check in edit history. <a href="../../../h/o/v/User%7EHoverfish_6f42.html" title="User:Hoverfish">Hoverfish</a> 09:18, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
