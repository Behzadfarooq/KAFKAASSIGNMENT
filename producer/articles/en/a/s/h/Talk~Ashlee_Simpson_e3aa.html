<p><b>FAC comments that are unresolved</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Keep Ashlee's Pieces of Me single picture, as the main picture.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In the interests of being fair, the lead has swung too far the other way. In my best attempt to be neutral I think it is clear that while the criticisms are strong and common, it is also clear she is very successful and her music sells well. If the lead has two sentences clearly stating the negative criticism (well done I think), it could now use one mentioning how succesful. Instead of chart topping, which sounds promotional, just mention her albums have sold very well and she had her own show on MTV that did well (try to specify how well). Try to keep it short too. One sentence should really do it, two could easily overdo it. After that is fixed, I'll probably go neutral. I don't think the article is great, no offense, but I don't think I could motivate myself to find specific issues. Maybe that's just my bias against pop culture topics in general, so sorry, but neutral won't hurt the article. Autobiography has the opposite problem, in that the only non positive mention is that reviews where mixed. Some mention of the negative publicity/criticism that came from the promotion of the album should be mentioned in the lead. Again, probably only one additional sentence. Sorry for combining the advice, but they're related and it saves an edit. (Taxman)</li>
<li>Writing is not up to featured standard, and needs work for flow and style. Description of future events is not encyclopaedic. (Exploding Boy)</li>
<li>I'm still very much dissatisfied about the criticism section being weaselly, as many assertions we make there are not being backed up by the references, which only make one or two broad generalisations. The Orange Bowl incident has some speculation that is not referenced (i.e. backlash against MTV-isation of the halftime show). Overall, the article is starting to look a lot better than it used to be, but I'm not ready to support just yet. A lot of the sentences don't flow well (although there are slightly fewer of them than before), and their phrasing often sounds similar to what you'd find in a fan magazine. (Johnleemk)</li>
<li>Regarding Paris, at least she is notable for "famous for being famous" and for being in the tabloids on her own right for her wild antics. Further, the article clearly addresses what is notable about Paris. In this case, it is "famous for being a sister of someone famous" and "famous for screwing up the incredible opportunities presented to her after having years of professional training and the world's best media exposure." The article does not come close to addressing this and is much more suited to a fan site (Noitall)</li>
<li>But the article is compromised, in my eyes, by the "Controversial incidents" section, which reeks of spin. That was the reason I disliked the article back then; not so much the excessive detail, which is hilarious, but the spin, which makes it hard to trust either the article or the person writing it. A lesser criticism is that the article says nothing about the process of manufacturing Ashlee. I have a rough idea how people such as this transition from being competent singers and the sisters of famous people into actual pop stars, with a contract and a product and songs, but this article skips the process entirely.(Ashly Pomeroy)</li>
<li>This article seems shallow to me. On reading this I get no impression of how she fits into the history of American popular music. I'm not even sure what genre of music she performs, other than "pop" or "pop rock." The closest thing to this is the single dismissive statement by a critic that her music is a "mundane melange of Avril-ish brat pop and Sheryl Crow cod rock." Which artists have influenced her? Whom does she acknowledge as her musical mentors? Whom are the artists she has influenced? There is a great deal about her life and career, very little about her music. For that matter, there is very little about her voice. We are told that Mariah Carey sings in a whistle register, but all we learn about Simpson's voice is that on occasion it has been damaged by acid reflux. The whole article reads like something from People magazine (which is high praise, of a sort). A hundred years from now, people reading this article would have some idea of what kind of celebrity she was, but very little idea of what kind of singer she was. (Dpbsmith)</li>

<p>Earlier an anon vandalized the "trivia" section with the comment "what a retard". Once again I lobby for this section to be removed. I got two votes in favor and none against last time; should I take that as sufficient consensus, or would someone else like to weigh in? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 04:50, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I decided to be bold and removed it. This sort of trivia (for or against Ashlee) isn't really appropriate, IMO. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 13:52, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let's discuss removing the "spammer" trivia. If we included everything as trivial as that our article would be enormous. In fact, in the past many things more notable than the spammer trivia have been removed, so I think it's time for that to go as well. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 19:30, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Two things:</p>
<dl>
<dd>A) Unless someone opposes it in the next day or so, I'm removing the spammer trivia.</dd>
<dd>B) I would like to go ahead and start the article on the new album <i><a href="../../../i/n/_/In_Another_Life_47af.html" title="In Another Life">In Another Life</a></i>, to be released in October. There is information about it I'd like to add to Wikipedia, but I feel it would be too detailed for this article. However, I'd like to hear some other opinions first, because I know some people think writing articles on yet-to-be-released albums is like trying to tell the future (which I think is flatly wrong, because you're using verifiable info, but that's just my opinion). <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 03:26, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I believe the spammer trivia has already been discussed above, and consensus was to keep it. I believe it should be kept too, since the level of triviality of this item seems consistent with the level of triviality for some of the other items mentioned in the article. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 04:27, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There is nothing else even close to the level of non-notability of that bit of trivia. It's some posts on internet forums! Stuff that was five times more notable has been removed. It stands out like a sore thumb. I don't see how you can make this argument. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 04:38, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Look. I made this point before, but I'll do it again: the spammer trivia made no newspapers, no magazines, and no TV shows. It's nothing! It was reported on some internet site and I, who keeps up with this stuff, didn't even hear about it until someone added it here. On the other hand, we have removed numerous things that have made it into <i>all three</i> of the above forms of sources. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 04:42, 7 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You have just made the case for keeping it. If it's not recorded here, this historically notable fact will disappear and be forgotten.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Well, you definitely know much more about Ashlee than me. I'm just putting in my opinion, as requested. If you remove the text, I won't revert it (though I can't speak for the others, of course). --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 06:11, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>B) No objection</dd>
<dd>C) I've restored lipsync.us to the external links section. I may be mistaken, but I don't believe Wikipedia has any "recent updates" requirement for external links. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyraider_7d6f.html" title="User:Skyraider">Skyraider</a> 14:02, 8 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>A)Right, and if I provide a link (or 10) for the hairstyle info, then can we restore that?</dd>
<dd>C) It's an argument, not a rule. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 18:29, 8 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>A)I never said the hairstyle info wasn't mentioned anywhere, just that I didn't consider that level of detail to be encyclopedic. As for the astroturfing matter, you stated that it wasn't mentioned in any magazine, and I provided the Wired link as evidence to the contrary.</dd>
<dd>C) Fair enough. Reasonable people can disagree about it. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyraider_7d6f.html" title="User:Skyraider">Skyraider</a> 21:17, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't tell if that's print or internet only content. If it's the former, I guess you proved me wrong, but the point still stands that her hairstyles get a lot more print coverage and yet we removed that. As for lipsync.us, I'm struggling to understand your motives for defending the inclusion of a ridiculous little hate site that hasn't been updated in six months, <i>especially</i> when we already have <i>another</i> hate site link. Help me out here. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 03:19, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Is Jargon Watch featured in print? Its inclusion by a Wired staffer makes it more notable than not, though. I personally don't think lipsync.us really needs to be kept, and I have no real opinion on her hairstyles (though I think the level of coverage given to it seems a little much). --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 04:51, 9 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Jargon Watch is most assuredly part of the print magazine. The link I provided relates to Volume 13, Issue 5, the May 2005 issue. My motive for keeping lipsync.us is a desire to preserve balance. In the link section, we have an official site and two declared fan sites. (The Wikicities site is not exactly NPOV, either, but for argument's sake, let's assume it is.) Under those circumstances, I don't think it's unreasonable to include 2 detractor sites, <i>especially</i> when the "ridiculous little" one apparently gets a quarter million hits a month. On hairstyles, Everyking, we did not "remove that", as there are at least two mentions in separate sections of the article. There was simply a disagreement about the appropriate level of detail, and I appealed to the consensus. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyraider_7d6f.html" title="User:Skyraider">Skyraider</a> 00:26, 10 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>OK, let's say we cut it down to one fan site and one hate site. Deal? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 03:31, 10 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If that's the consensus, I'll accept it, but it is actually a worse balance than we have now. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyraider_7d6f.html" title="User:Skyraider">Skyraider</a> 20:39, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Recent edits have added to the article that Ashlee was "accused to lying to the American public" and so on (the additions stress <i>lying</i>).

<dd>Please don't. First, you're not allowed to revert this article, per your arbcom decision.

<dd>Well, I don't know about the controversy surrounding this article, but I thought I'd weigh in with my two cents (I hope nobody minds). I think that the paragraph about Ashlee's hair colour could be condensed and turned into the caption of the image present in the "In 2005" section. Speaking as an Ashlee fan, I thought it was too trivial for its very own paragraph (no offense to the original editor). One problem with this suggestion is that information on the current image's source copyright status is missing on its description page, but I suppose the image could be replaced with a fair use screenshot from a recent television appearance or something. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 23:40, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I don't mind if you revise it however you like.

<dd>Why should we remove fansites in principle? We could cut it down to one. But that one fan site is a vastly better resource in terms of news and media than any of those other links. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 22:21, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Two things:</p>
<p>Carnildo reverted someone who removed lipsync.us from the Ext. links section, and used a rollback to do so. Clearly this was not vandalism, as opinions are strong about the presence of that link, and I've tried to get it removed before myself. Also I think if another editor is removing it that should re-open the question of whether we should keep it, since that adds another voice into the mix.</p>
<p>Also, I noticed that the intro has been reworded a bit so the SNL sentence now says this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"In October 2004, she used a pre-recorded vocal track on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live (possibly in place of her own voice, as some accused her of lip syncing), a highly publicized incident that drew substantial negative attention from the press."</dd>
</dl>
<p>The part I find problematic is the line "possibly in place of her own voice". There are two possible interpretations of that: either she was using a track of her own, recorded, voice in place of her live voice, or she was using <i>somebody else's</i> recorded vocals in place of her own. I think the uninformed reader would tend toward the latter interpretation, but nobody (that I know of) has actually argued that the recorded vocals were not her own, so I think we should find a better wording for this. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:10, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article needs to say more about how the lip-sync thing has come to define her as a public personality.

<p>I agree about the better press early on part - so what do suggest we do here?

<p>So, if we're going to say the album got a mixed reception, we need to provide at least one positive and one negative review.

<p>Hi Everyking et al.,</p>
<p>In the season 4 finale of <i><a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk%27d.html" title="Punk'd">Punk'd</a></i>, <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashton_Kutcher_4ef3.html" title="Ashton Kutcher">Ashton Kutcher</a> and his crew members set up a fake art museum and arranged for Simpson to visit it. They then convinced Simpson that her friend's jacket had caught fire due to being placed on top of a candle (though Simpson maintained that she put the jacket in front of the candle), causing the overhead sprinklers to go off, and ruining all the paintings in the room.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I removed this at the request of the FAC commenters... since there wasn't too much wide coverage of this I think its legatamite to get rid of...</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, I think we should mention some of the musical awards she has won, this way we can address both the concern of the anon and leave room for a bit more criticism.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on these?</p>

<p>I'm not seeing the cause of the confusion about the relationships, as mentioned in the to-do list. She's not with Cabrera unless she's making it a secret. She is still seen with him occasionally but says she's single right now. I think the relationship basically ended back in February or so, but it always seems to have had kind of an on again-off again nature, so you can never be sure. As for Wilmer we know even less about that. She says they're just good friends, but there have been lots of rumors, mainly several months ago, back in the spring I think. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 02:52, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The "back to blonde" section included only stuff that happened <i>before</i> she went back to blonde (except the magazine cover image). So I renamed it to "early 2005"; I couldn't think of any good common thread besides that. Also I feel the "criticism" section needs to be balanced somehow.

<p>"Simpson has cultivated a more <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebellion.html" title="Rebellion">rebellious</a> and rock oriented image than that of her sister." What's up with cultivated? Skyraider seems to think it's important. Personally I think it alters the meaning too much. Without cultivated, it refers to how she is seen by others; with cultivated, it refers to how she <i>wants</i> to be seen. This gets my alarm bells ringing because it comes close to the "manufactured image" line. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 03:10, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hm, interesting. One could argue that everyone cultivates their image, and pop stars more than most; and without "cultivated", we're saying that she <i>is</i> seen as more rebellious than her sister (more rock-oriented is a given). Seen that way by whom? On the other hand, "cultivated" does have an air of calculation about it. Since this section is essentially comparing her with her sister, we could just let people draw their own conclusions on those comparisons...like so. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrackle_442f.html" title="User:Grackle">Grackle</a> 03:49, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Basically, that's what I was getting at. I think we can agree that through her personal style choices, she has sought to distinguish herself from her sister. To say that she "has" a particular image is another matter, and "decidedly different" doesn't address my concern. I think the former statement is fair and accurate, and the latter one is not. (We note the fact that she wears "punk" style shirts. fair enough. That's not to say that any music store with a "punk" section puts her recordings in it.) If you find the word "cultivated" objectionable, would "adopted" or "sought" be more acceptable? <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyraider_7d6f.html" title="User:Skyraider">Skyraider</a> 21:40, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't really think it's notable enough. I'm not going to remove it, because it's kinda borderline, but still I'd rather see it go. In my opinion, a small segment in the middle of a Canadian tabloid show and Jimmy Kimmel's seldom watched show is not enough to establish notability from the media, at least not in this case when we have in the past deleted things that have gotten vastly more media coverage.

<p>When the SNL incident first occurred, AP News ran the same photo that currently is on Wikipedia (of Simpson crying walking away from the stage) and said it was taken a few minutes after Simpson walked offstage. I'm aware that some sites have stated it was taken earlier after rehearsals, but this is not part of the original AP release. Since I was determined to have the caption reflect the AP info and 'Everyking' was determined to make it say "backstage earlier when she was having trouble with her voice" (he or she must hover over the page waiting to revert any changes they don't like!), I decided to compromise and simply caption it "Simpson backstage at SNL", which is factual and without spin. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 06:17, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I never claimed the image was taken directly after the second song. In the pic on the article, she's wearing the exact same outfit she wore in the <i>first</i> song. The presence of the cameraman sitting at the camera unit, along with the boom mike extended over the stage, seem to indicate that the image was taken as she left the stage after the first song, and not during rehearsals earlier in the day. I don't see why simply saying "backstage at SNL" is such a problem, since it's obviously factual, regardless of what time it was taken. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 06:50, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Anyone with eyes and a brain can view the video footage and see that the band is NOT playing their instruments when the music starts. And even if it WERE the band playing, why would the entire band, en masse and in perfect unison, mistakenly start playing THE SONG THEY HAD JUST PLAYED? Give me a break. This is clearly NNPOV fannish whitewash from people who trying to exercise "damage control" and positive spin away from what is patently obvious. I am neither pro-Ashlee or anti-Ashlee. But Wikipedia pages are not fan pages, they are not advertising for the star in question. It is generally regarded by most people that the entire band was miming, and this needs to be reflected on the site. If you want to temper that to the untrue-but-fairer-sounding "many people", fine.

<dd>The article's slanted acceptance of the view that the band was really playing is, in itself, an unsupported, unverified (and probably unverifiable) claim. For the article to accept that all bandmembers "accidentally" launched into the wrong song - which just coincidentally happened to be the same wrong song that the drummer allegedly cued the wrong vocal track for - is too much of a stretch of the imagination to call this article, and its adherents, fair and balanced. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 22:07, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>There are plenty of "giving Ashlee the benefit of the doubt" statements in this article that are not sourced. Having said that, I am certain that if I cited webpages (and there are many) that make the same statements I am making, you'd STILL be reverting my edits dozens of times. If you really wanted to shut me up, you could simply rewrite the pertinent point - that it has not been conclusively proven that the band wasn't miming (their own claims don't count!) in a way that suits your temperament. But of course, you won't do that, because you and Everyking (you both <b>are</b> different people, aren't you?) apparently prefer to hover over this page day and night to make sure the page always says what you want it to say. And yes, I know the song order got switched - that's no doubt why they screwed up and played the wrong backup recording! <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 03:23, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>To me, the criticism section seems fine. It explains why Ashlee is not embraced by everyone but does it in a way to where it doesn't bash her.</p>
<p>I've removed the criticism section. If you want it there, write something decent in its place. As it was, the section consisted almost entirely of references to the fact that some people don't like this singer. That a negative review can be linked to is hardly revelatory; there is barely an album in existence that has not been both positively and negatively reviewed. There was also a reference to some MadTV skit, which was not an event of particular notoriety or noteworthiness, and some unsupported references to Simpson being "not punk" and a "poser". Please. All this section confirmed was that this singer is not universally beloved. Do people really need an encycolpedia to tell them that? Perhaps the Ashleeturfing section is useful information that should be retained, but buried, as it is, amidst a heap of useless information, I can't be bothered finding out. This section, if it should exist at all, should be rebuilt from the ground up. I've made the first step by razing it.Inutero2222 15:31, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Everyking has just performed a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ashlee_Simpson&amp;diff=56298938&amp;oldid=56191401" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ashlee_Simpson&amp;diff=56298938&amp;oldid=56191401" rel="nofollow">blanket revert</a> of my edits (including formatting of footnotes, merging of short paragraphs in compliance with the MoS and changing "Ashlee" to "Simpson"), and I'd like to know why. Especially since his edit summary seems to imply that removing information is a bad thing, which it isn't always. For example (in addition to my above comment), what is the significance behind mentioning what songs Simpson performed at the Australian MTV Video Music Awards? <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 17:19, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your edit appeared to be removing information which I consider notable. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 19:04, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think we need to include the precise release date of <i>I Am Me</i>, especially as it's on the album article (same with the date of the Australian MTV Video Music Awards). Celebrities such as Simpson appear on lots of magazine covers, and unless the covers are significant in anyway (e.g. I left the mention of <i>Teen People</i> in because she appeared with her sister), it's not very useful to mention all of them. As I said above, if there isn't anything significant about Simpson's performance at the VMA's (unlike the <i>SNL</i> or Orange Bowl appearances, which received widespread coverage in the news), then it probably isn't worth mentioning either. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 20:39, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I guess I'll concede your first point; it isn't strictly necessary, but it takes up only a tiny bit more space to give the date detail and someone's bound to add it back soon anyway (not realizing that it was excluded for stylistic reasons). The same goes for the Australia VMA date. On the magazine covers, I feel pretty strongly those should all stay, if for no other reason than that they mentioned nowhere else on the encyclopedia, and there isn't really anywhere else where they fit. Do you want to create a "list of magazine covers featuring Ashlee Simpson"? It needs to be <i>somewhere</i>, and I feel it's notable enough to include here. For the AVMA performance—she hosted it, which is very notable, and if we're mentioning that we might as well mention she performed too. We aren't short on space here, and I guarantee you all this info we're debating about would come in handy to people. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 03:43, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You've blanket reverted a second time, again removing formatting and stylistic work I performed. If you come across an edit which you disagree with, at least take the time to read it through instead of undoing all of it. If somebody reinserts the exact dates, then we can remove them again and explain on their talk page why we did so. I'm a little bothered by your assertion that the information about the magazine covers needs to be "somewhere". I think that any article along the lines of List of magazine covers featuring Ashlee Simpson would probably be AFD'd sooner or later, and we'd be back to square one again. Perhaps the articles about the magazines could contain lists of people appearing on the covers, but then the inclusion of those would eventually be debated as well. I'm concerned that the article is becoming more and more like a fan page (albeit relatively NPOV) or a "current events" piece for Simpson than an encyclopedia article. Some of the information doesn't really come in handy to me; I'm a fan of Simpson and I couldn't care less about what she performed at the VMA's (even if I did, I still wouldn't think Wikipedia or any other encyclopedia would be an appropriate place for it), and I doubt that many casual readers would either. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 20:19, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

You also removed {{<a href="../../../a/c/t/Template%7EActiveDiscuss_7837.html" title="Template:ActiveDiscuss">ActiveDiscuss</a>}} from the article, which I felt was an appropriate template to insert given that this discussion is still undoing.

<dl>
<dd>Yes, but why do you think it is notable? Simpson hosting an awards ceremony may be considered notable as she never did that before, but she appears on lots of magazine covers and only two (at best) of the ones listed appear to be significant enough for mentioning in an encyclopedia article about her. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 12:38, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Lots of people read those magazines. They all get very wide exposure. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 16:19, 11 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I know that. The point I'm making is that because Simpson appears on many magazines, they can't all be notable enough for mentioning, so we have to pick the most notable ones to include and leave out the rest. Simpson appears on and performs on lots of widely-seen television shows, but obviously we don't mention all of her TV appearances because it would be rather pointless and useless for almost all readers. Just like we wouldn't list every single released by Madonna or Elvis Presley on their articles; it would just create bloat. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 17:38, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I concur. Other musician articles, especially the featured articles, don't list every magazine cover their subjects have appeared on. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyraider_7d6f.html" title="User:Skyraider">Skyraider</a> 22:58, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I list most of her TV appearances, where they are pertinent to her albums or songs, on the album and song articles. Unfortunately it is more difficult for me to make the connection between those articles and these magazine covers; often they have little to nothing to do with the music. The new Marie Claire article, for instance, has Ashlee talking about the pressure on girls about their weight and looks and about the importance of feeling confident in themselves, that kind of thing. So where am I supposed to put that? "Nowhere" is an unacceptable answer—the covers are notable information that need to have a place on WP somewhere. I put it here because there isn't any more logical place, the article isn't terribly long at present, and it's relevant. The creation of a subarticle about this kind of thing, about her general publicity/image, would be great—would you like to create one? It sounds a bit daunting, but don't let me hold you back; if you do that then feel free to move it there. Otherwise I don't really see what can be done. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 05:23, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There is another option: remove the information. As I explained above, it's not all notable or relevant and does not "need" to be on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../_/_/_/WP%7E_f74a.html" title="WP:">Wikipedia is not</a> an indiscriminate collection of information. I think the same should probably be done with the album and single articles as not all of the television appearances are notable; I just took a quick look at <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pieces_of_Me_d709.html" title="Pieces of Me">Pieces of Me</a> and felt that it was generally overdetailed. Excess bloat should be trimmed, not spun into subarticles; that just spreads the problem across more than one page rather than solving it. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 12:42, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It seems we have a fundamental philosophical disagreement.

I consider that kind of detail to be completely arbitrary, and feel it will repel many readers and make their eyes glaze over (well, mine did). I don't see anybody else lobbying for the inclusion of this information, though I wish that more users would join in this discussion.

<dd>I disagree. The backlash against Ms. Simpson has been significant, and forms a considerable part of her notoriety. Therefore, it's appropriate to include some coverage of the criticism.

<p>Should there be a section or content reffering to Ashlee's recent plastic surgery? I think so, it's a pretty big change. She looks more like Sarah Michelle Gellar now.</p>

<p>A few months ago, an article on one of Ashlee's non-single songs, "Catch Me When I Fall", was deleted through an AfD debate. Unfortunately I just learned about this debate and deletion recently; had I known then, I would have voted to keep. As it happened, the issue slipped under the radar screen and only got a couple of votes, all in favor of deletion. I've reproduced the article <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_Catch_Me_When_I_Fall_8f37.html" title="User:Everyking/Catch Me When I Fall">here</a> so others can see it. My case is that A) this song is particularly notable as far as non-singles go (SNL association), and B) non-single articles are more common these days in general, so the fact that it wasn't a single shouldn't be a rigid indicator of the article's unsuitability. So what I want to see is if people have any opinions about making an undeletion nom here, for or against. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 08:05, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Even prior to her lip synching incident, Simpson was parodied on a <a href="../../../m/a/d/MadTV_cbe2.html" title="MadTV">MadTV</a> skit. During the skit the actress potraying Simpson made statements such as "Enjoy the commercial... I mean the show!" (refering to The Ashlee Simpson Show), and "The best thing about being a product... I mean an artist!", and goes to a recording session where he vocals have to be mechanically enhanced."</p>
<p>I'm fine with including this information on WP somewhere, but I feel it's too minor to take up a paragraph in this article. A paragraph could be written about jokes made at her expense in general, incorporating a brief mention of MadTV's skit. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 04:22, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone please substantiate the claim that she was homeschooled. Or better yet, don't, because I know it isn't true. I won't bother fixing the article again, feel free to continue to list false, unsubstantiated claims about where/how she was schooled. She attended Prarie Creek Elementary from 2nd to 6th grade and Richardson North Junior High School for 7th and 8th. I could prove it by providing scans, or you could look up the schools' phone numbers, call, and ask. Whatever.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, you don't understand; it's not supposed to be claiming she was homeschooled all her life. I've seen yearbook pictures of her so I have no doubt she attended regular school for most of her school-age years. My understanding is that she was homeschooled by her mother when she was a teenager, after they moved from Texas because of Jessica's career and (I'm assuming) when Ashlee was a backup dancer. I'm about 90% sure I remember her talking about this at some point or another, although it has been quite a while. It may be mentioned in the NY Times article, if someone can access it and confirm. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 05:54, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have also restored it: I think there are some things in there that are perhaps too minor to mention (or at least to go into detail about) on a general article on her (particularly "Ashleeturfing" and the MAD TV skit), but I can't agree with the outright removal of the section. Ideally it would be reworked into something that would incorporate positive views as well—something like a general "popular reception" section. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 12:21, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm removing it again, for the reasons I posted in the first "criticism" section of the talk page. If you think the section should be reworked, rework it. Right now it is a terribly written, terribly trivial section, and bad sections drag down the tone of the entire encyclopedia. Inutero2222 03:47, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Its well sourced so no reason to remove it again because I have restored it back and if it removed again it would be regarded as vandalism..--<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;font-family: Monotype Corsiva;"><a href="../../../c/o/m/User_talk%7ECometstyles_42cd.html" title="User talk:Cometstyles">Cometstyles</a></span> 03:53, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is only well sourced to the extent that the information it contains is repeated elsewhere. The relevance or authority of the source is highly questionable i.e. the first Rolling Stone link proves merely that one Rolling Stone writer does not like Ashlee Simpson. The second link demonstrates the existence of a MadTV skit, but not the importance of it. And so on. This section adds absolutely nothing. The reference tell us only that one can Google up a negative article about any artist in existence. Should anyone wish to retain this section, provide reasons for the relevance of the material you are retaining. If not, your edit will be regarded as vandalism.Inutero2222 03:45, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To tell you the truth, as best I can remember, the section was added a long time ago by people who thought I had somehow skewed the article in her favor, because the SNL incident had just happened, and to them that meant the article needed to give more weight to criticisms about her being a bad singer and so on—basically, they wanted to skew it in the other direction, although they wouldn't have put it quite like that. So I guess the section wasn't created with the right motivation, and it was full of a lot of crap (and would have been far worse if I hadn't struggled against it), but that doesn't mean I think it should just be removed. In my opinion the criticisms about Ashlee are baseless, not to mention obnoxious, but they are common—and they were <i>very</i> common back in late 2004/early 2005. To not represent that in the article would seem like a serious deficiency to me, and I'd rather have a poor "criticism" section than to have nothing. Ideally, there'd be a good, balanced section about both positive and negative views, but who's going to write that? What if we restored the criticism section, but left a note to editors (commented out) in the text urging people to rework it into a balanced form? Given time, somebody would probably produce results on that, if they were made aware of it. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 03:26, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The one relevant question is, is it credibly sourced (including being paraphrased properly to what the source actually says)? If it is, it is in poor taste to remove it for 'dragging down the article' as one person put it above as that is throwing off academic credability for personal opinion and point of view. The point of a wikipedia article isn't to credit or discredit someone, it is to combine legitimate sources of information into a collective encyclopedia article. That means positive things about a person go up... and so do negative things. In fact so do trivial things (like plastic surgery). Again <i>as long as they can be sourced to a place that is credible and in a position to make such a claim</i>. If you're Ashlee Simpsons biggest fan, sadly it's tough shit for you. If you're her biggest hater guess what, it's tough shit for you too here. Leave your personal opinions at the door when you write into an encyclopedia article, or accept you aren't capable enough to do it. It is not a fan site. It is not a trash site. It is an encyclopedic biography. I totally agree poorly cited trash should go down, it's slander and is prohibited by wikipedia. However well cited criticism and events are very applicable to a wikipedia article and should stay up, as taking them down is a violation of policy once someone has properly placed them up and referenced them. That is called neutrality and should be what every article strives for. I went through it all, and looked at most the sources, and as far as I could tell only one definetly needed to be pulled (and the base event itself could go back up eventually, but needs to be written in a more accurate form or reference a differant source supporting the claim to avoid being considered slander as it included words that could be argued to be 'weasel words' in it's current form). The rest appears to follow legitimate guidelines for wikipedia on being applicable without crossing into baseless slander. [Wednesday, 2007-04-04 T 09:26 UTC]</p>

<p>Every time I blink, I find that the album sales figures have been changed by somebody again. This problem would be remedied if there were sources to back up the numbers, instead of just having to have faith in the various editors who drop by to add their preferred number. I propose removing the sales figures from the table, and only allowing them to be added back when/if somebody provides sources. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 03:56, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
