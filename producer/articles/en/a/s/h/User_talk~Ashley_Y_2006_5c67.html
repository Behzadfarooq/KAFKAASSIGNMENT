<p>OK. See this Israel-Palestine - maybe you'd wanna contest prod here too - and then I'd move it into one AfD. Crummy reason given for contesting prod, of course. Either you object to deletion or you don't - that's what prod is for - to save AfD time and effort.</p>
<p>As for "genital integrity" "intactivism" - sorry, HAD to comment - like with the Anti-<a href="../../../s/h/e/Shechita.html" title="Shechita">Shechita</a> protesters and the Christian-child-blood-in-Purim-cookies people - it's very thinly veiled Anti-Semitism, among other anti-'s. Intactivists oughta leave us alone to circumcize our baby boys in the eternal Jewish way. Sheesh!</p>

<p>I found your comment of "There is no such thing as a neutral editor" quite interesting, and was wondering if you could indulge me in an experiment. On my userpage, I have three userboxes (suitably subst'd) so all it says is that I'm Irish, live in the UK, and spend lots of time on wikipedia. In otherwords, no POV or bias userboxes. I've 1000+ article edits, over multiple pages so any inherit bias I have should be recognisable by now. Please feel free to browse my contributions to wikipeda articles, and let me know what biases I should be aware of. As I said, this is only my own curiousity, and there's no time limit, nor any need for you to do anything at all. But if, as you say, there is no neutal editor, that means I must have biases that affect my editing. (I'm not dening I have bias, but I don't believe they affect my editing materially) So please review my edits, and if you can find a bias that affects my edits, please let me know.

<p>Um, Ashley... I don't think you noticed, but you're inserting comments in the middle of an outline that a bunch of us are building... do you see the structure we're working on? The point is to summarize the main points in an orderly fashion because the debate has been getting so repetetive. Do you think you can work with that structure, rather than interpsersing signed comments? I don't want you to refrain from commenting, it's just this thing we're trying to put together, y'know? -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 07:10, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Tony is very communicative. Perhaps he didn't want to lose the information about the flow of the argument. Perhaps he's pointing out this isn't a vote.

<dd>Ashley Y, thanks for trying to make the Christian userbox discussion better. I should explain that sorting discussions on Wikipedia is generally thought to be a bad idea, because by segregating opinions it encourages people to just pop in and vote without looking at how the discussion is progressing. The only advantage it has really is that it makes it easier to do some simple counting. I won't revert it again myself but I don't think that attempts to sort debates on Wikipedia tend to prevail. Unless you think it's a really important thing to do (and I could be convinced) it's best not to do so. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 22:22, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Ashley,</p>
<p>This is what I just put on the <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic_Reconstructionist_Paganism_f3b3.html" title="Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism">Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism</a> page:</p>
<p>This subtle renaming/caps issue is actually a rather large problem. Since 1992 at the latest, "Celtic Reconstructionism" and "Celtic Reconstructionist" have been established as tradition names. This is different from "Celtic reconstructionism", and brings up a lot of the "method and/or tradition" issues we juggled at the beginning of this process. I think it is inappropriate to subltly refocus the article this way, and without any discussion on the talk page. Therefore I am returning this to the name we agreed on. I would also note these changes have just been made to all Reconstructionist traditions over on the Polytheistic Reconstructionism (now Polytheistic reconstructionism) page. Interested editors may want to go look at that, too. --<a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_9cdf.html" title="User:Kathryn NicDhàna">Kathryn NicDhàna</a> 17:14, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Ashley Y, thanks for everything you're doing to help end the userbox wars.

<p>Hi, I posted a message <a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshley_Y_Userboxes_Politics_b2fa.html" title="User talk:Ashley Y/Userboxes/Politics">here</a>, wanting to check in with you before userfying any political userboxes to your space that seem to need userfying. You appear to be the one hosting political boxes, according to the nav template, but I don't know whether you were being choosy about which ones you host. After a few days, it occurred to me that maybe you haven't got that page on your watchlist, so I'm posting here.</p>
<p>The userboxes in question are {{User Australian Democrats}} and {{User Social Democrat}}, which are currently delete protected, but used to look like:<br clear="all" /></p>

There's also apparently a variation on the second one, {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser_Social_Democrat_%28OSV%29_8f62.html" title="Template:User Social Democrat (OSV)">User Social Democrat (OSV)</a>}}, which was never deleted. Anyway, do you object to having those templates moved to your space, as has been requested <a href="../../../g/e/r/Wikipedia_talk%7EGerman_userbox_solution_356d.html#Categories_with_userboxes" title="Wikipedia talk:German userbox solution">here</a>? If you have no objections, I can go ahead and do undeletes, history moves and soft redirects, checking "what links here" for redlinks.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>What follows are the sentiments, expressed in their own words, and in the 'protest signs', of the obscure, very small, but very vocal 'activist group' known as "Protest Warrior".</p>
<p>"What's becoming clear is how the religion of Islam is addicted to war and mayhem. Not a radical minority, not a rogue sect, but its very essence is about submission and sacrifice and proving your worth by worshipping death in this life to gain a paradise of orgies and drunkenness. Their entire history is of warfare, and any accomplishments of their so-called Golden Age has been proven to be merely parasitic off the cultures they've conquered and reduced to dhimmi servitude. That every country under sharia is corrupt, belligerent, desolate and barbaric obviously gives them no pause, except to constantly drive them into further psychotic rage as they refuse to ever accept any responsibility for their conditions. They are akin to the powers in Orwell's 1984; there must always be an enemy. It's no surprise that women are treated like property in these countries as that's the only way Muslim men can feed their egos, to dominate others rather than ever actually produce something."</p>

<p>Their 'protest signs'...</p>
<p><a href="http://www.protestwarrior.com/new_signs.php?thumb=9" class="external text" title="http://www.protestwarrior.com/new_signs.php?thumb=9" rel="nofollow">Signs</a></p>
<p>I thought you might be interested in this group's sentiments. They are currently very actively editing their own article on Wiki and there is a lot of 'group think'. Perhaps you might want to become involved in the editing and discussion process on that page. If you do, please don't vandalize, and try to remain civil. Should you not want to involve youself, please forgive my intrusion.</p>

<p>Can you take a look at <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mama_Zogb%C3%A9_e51a.html" title="Mama Zogbé">Mama Zogbé</a> and the associated AFD <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mama_Zogb%C3%A9_aafe.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mama Zogbé">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mama Zogbé</a>. Given the reasons that the AFD nominator chose to AFD nominate instead of letting the prod run (not fully stated in the AFD), I think it would be good to have wider input into this AFD. So far there is only one particpant that has contributed to the AFD that has been uninvolved with the problems in the main article about the religion. This article is a biography of a living pagan religous leader. (I can't tell if the pagan religion is a true survival or a modern invention/pastiche, which isn't all that unusual for outsiders with limited interest.)</p>
<p>Since you have an interest in contemporary paganism, which this is certainly related to, and are on my list of users to request expertise from, I picked you to ask.

Perhaps we should think of a better name for the grouping? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 22:32, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What would you call them? I was originally going to call the cat "Wikipedia process debate", but decided to follow the example of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_userbox_discussions_946f.html" title="Category:Wikipedia userbox discussions">Category:Wikipedia userbox discussions</a>. —<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Y_1ca2.html" title="User:Ashley Y">Ashley Y</a> 22:58, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I guess, something like "essays related to IAR" (Category:Ignore All Essays?) but that doesn't sound too good either.

<p>I appreciate your efforts to making the status of WP:SNOW less disputed. However, unfortunately, like the status of IAR, it has been disputed for the better part of a year now.

<dd>Hardly. But that has been tried before several times and was shouted down.

<dd>Probably the pro-guideline people should explain why it should be so from a process point of view, i.e. what its provenance is as a guideline, pointing to the appropriate written principles of what makes something a guideline. This will make more headway with the process-heads who object. The anti-guideline people should explain the possibilities for abuse were it to be given the formal stamp of approval as a guideline, so that those issues might be better addressed on the page.</dd>

<dd>Well, if it matches actual practice, then it follows that is a guideline. There are always some people that say "but I don't <i>like</i> actual practice" but that's not a valid argument. The problem here is that the debate has deadlocked between people who claim this is actual practice, and people who claim that it's not. I suppose either party could point out where it has been used to show how it works in practice. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 09:22, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That particular action would likely be approved by everyone. The recently added nutshell statement of <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROCESS_3d0f.html" title="WP:PROCESS">WP:PROCESS</a> "Process should be followed except when there is likely no objection" has it right, I think. Other actions might be encouraged by an official "stamp of approval" on WP:SNOW that would not, in fact, carry consensus approval. The degree to which this might be a problem, and how to address that on the potential guideline page, is what should be being discussed if we want a consensus on making it an official guideline. —<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Y_1ca2.html" title="User:Ashley Y">Ashley Y</a> 20:22, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Here's the problem with removing the "editorializing" in the comparitive performance section of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perl.html" title="Perl">Perl</a>: originally, the link to the shootout was added by someone who had a strong axe to grind against Perl, and was adding any link that he could find to essays, IRC chat logs, and this benchmark to demonstrate what he felt were the failings of Perl. I and others pointed out that the benchmark was flawed, and I even re-wrote one of the benchmark tests so that it was substantially faster. In the end, however, because this particular user was very insistant, we agreed on a compromise. We added a disclaimer <i>and</i> the link to the flawed benchmark.

<p>Please note my comments there. There's really no reason that every single place in Israel be under contest. In this case, the International Law doesn't put the sea shore of the lake in Syria NOR does it border with the golan - According to international law line, Israel should control the eastern shore completely.
