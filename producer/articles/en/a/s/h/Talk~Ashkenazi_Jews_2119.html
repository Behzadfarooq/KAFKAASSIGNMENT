<p>Couldn't it be argued or even proven that Ashkenazi-achievements are mainly due to self-promotion rather than superior ability? This is proven in the times Hitler removed Jews from positions of power and influence resulting in Germany going ahead in leaps and bounds regarding technologies and other advancements. I can't imagine anyone disagreeing on Hitler's Germany not being a great step in human discovery, even though there may have been doctrines that others found unacceptable. Druidictus 21:24, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Druidictus, take a look at the record - Hitler's Germany took a straight and rapid trip to the bottom. The engineering faets rested on advances made before the Nazis seized power.</p>

<dd>High average IQ could certainly lead to disproportionately high numbers of Nobel Prizes. And it is hard to imagine that "self-promotion" could be a factor in achieving high IQ scores. Wikismile 19:17, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Actually, Ashkenazi Jews have been found to have essentially the same IQs as Germans and the Dutch. Iq can hardly be a direct proxy to such overwhelming achievement for such a small group, then, even though Germans too have been overrepresented in Nobel prize winning.<a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnham_36c9.html" title="User:Ernham">Ernham</a> 17:22, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Although assumed for many years - Jewish IQ superiority is largely a myth. A recent large study says average at best, but not the highest by far. Sticking together socially is far more important for econmic, etc results than IQ anyway. ( Would you rather have 10 more IQ points or be Bill Gates son, if you wanted to get rich?) Strong social/familial cohesiveness wins the game over the decades and generations. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../1/5/9/User%7E159.105.80.219.html" title="User:159.105.80.219">159.105.80.219</a> (<a href="../../../1/5/9/User_talk%7E159.105.80.219.html" title="User talk:159.105.80.219">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_159.105.80.219_a03c.html" title="Special:Contributions/159.105.80.219">contribs</a>) 11 December 2006.</small></p>

<p>If you have a <b>problem</b> with the contents of Koestler and Wexler's books, I'd suggest you articulate those objections in an impartial and scholarly manner inside the article. Of course, that also means you'll have to explain the ideas that are contained in those books. Putting a "disclaimer" above the books as you have done is not NPOV. If you can't keep your emotions or personal biases out of the article, maybe you shouldn't be editing it.</p>
<hr />
<p>You are correct to ask for an explanation for such statements; I am happy to provide such an explanation. In regards to Arthur Koestler's 1976 book, <i>The Thirteenth Tribe: The Khazar Empire and Its Heritage</i> (Random House), I offer the following information. Most of the significant claims in his book have been throughly debunked by historians.</p>

<dd>...Leon Wieseltier can only be commended for debunking Arthur Koestler's attempt to rehabilitate the long discredited theory of the non-Semitic origins of East European Jewry [NYR, October 28].</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A glance at Koestler's intellectual meanderings and fluctuations across the past three decades can only lead one to conclude that his intentions this time around in The Thirteenth Tribe were not the advancement of knowledge but cruel mischief, unforgiveable attention seeking (considering the predictable Arab response already noted by Wieseltier). Koestler, therefore, deserves to be openly chastised for misusing his considerable intellectual talents and devoting them to such a peripheral theory bordering on fantastic speculation, a tangential issue in Jewish history even in its heyday a generation or so ago.</dd>

<dd>Many elements of Arthur Koestler's thesis were proven false, while a few others were proven true. Some of his false claims are:
<ul>
<li>His concept that German Jews did not migrate to eastern Europe in large numbers.</li>
<li>His claim that French and German Jews mostly died out in the Middle Ages.</li>
<li>His exaggerated population figures for Khazaria.</li>
<li>His claim that Crimean Karaites descend from Khazars.</li>
<li>His supposition, based on Gumplowitz and other Polish Jewish scholars, that certain Polish placenames were named after Khazars. Only in Hungary and Transylvania do we find placenames that actually come from Khazars.</li>
<li>His claim, based on Mieses, that an Austrian legend about Jewish princes was based on the Khazar rule of Hungary.</li>
<li>His claim, based on Poliak, that Ashkenazic shtetls were derived from Khazar village life.</li>
<li>His claim that Ashkenazic Jews have hardly any genetic or anthropological connections to the ancient Judeans.</li>
</ul>

Hi Bcorr, you are correct that this description is very sketchy. It's an echo of the material on <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">race and intelligence</a>, which seems to have come mainly from <a href="http://jerrypournelle.com/reports/cochran/overclocking.html" class="external text" title="http://jerrypournelle.com/reports/cochran/overclocking.html" rel="nofollow">Greg Cochran's</a> article on Jerry Pournelle's Chaos Manor page. Greg Cochran is an evolutionary biologist with an interest in neurology, as evidenced from PubMed. This article, "How the Ashkenazi Got Their Smarts", circulates in various blogs and other resources, and never does he quote a peer-reviewed article. Perhaps most can be gained by contacting him, (he works at Amherst College, MA, dept of biology). I've been unable to figure out his email address - perhaps you have ways. At any rate, this is not the first time I've heard an evolutionary biologist make rather off-the-hand remarks that turn out to be wild speculation. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff"></a> <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a> | <a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 16:01, 18 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Has anyone else actually read the massive material recently added to the article? It is a lengthy tract claiming that the Ashkenazi are <i>not</i> descended from the Biblical Jews.

<dd>It's mostly Khazaria nonsense; the cites given (for example Brooks) don't come to the conclusions the author of this article has. While the information about Khazar Jews may be accurate to a degree (if outdated), the claim that Ashkenazi Jews and Khazars are the same is simply not true. Genetic and linguistic evidence indicates that Ashkenazi Jews descended from Jews living in the Roman empire, and particularly the Italian regions, who migrated northwards from there to Germany, where Yiddish began to develop, and from there eastwards to Poland, Hungary, Ukraine etc. It is possible that Khazar Jews make up <i>some</i> of the ancestry of Ashkenazi Jews, but it is a minority at most, and that connection is itself still unproven. As Brooks himself concludes "Are all Jews around the world descended from the Khazars? Certainly not. East European Jewish ancestry originates substantially from ancient Judea, and the same is true of most other modern Jewish populations (with the exception of groups like Libyan Jews and Ethiopian Jews). But, it is rational to conclude that some Jews also have some Khazar ancestors." <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 02:30, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, in Polish history it is noted that at the moment Poles came into contact with the Khazars, there were already Jews in Poland - and these groups were considered completely distinct, both by the outside world and by themselves.

<dd>While I'm the farthest thing from an expert on the subject, I do find the "Ashkenazi = Khazars" claim to be rather contrary, if not completely antic. Also, couldn't we do better than quoting large, repetitious chunks of fourteen(!) other encyclopedias? They may just qualify as fair use (no more than 10%, etc), but I don't like the way they comprise the bulk of the history section. The hodgepodge reminds me of a lazy college student's essay. It'd be best to excise the quotes and (if possible or necessary) rewrite the data, or simply summarize. In my opinion, of course. -- <a href="../../../h/a/d/User%7EHadal_a4d0.html" title="User:Hadal">Hadal</a> 04:06, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Be warned about genetic studies that are interpreted as demonstrating that Askenazim are descended in large part from ancient Middle Eastern Jews. The studies are simply not capable of supporting any very firm conclusion, and interpretations usually rest on what the investigators believe anyway. Since historians do not usually know much genetics, nor geneticists much history, there is a danger that each group will uncritically accept the other's beliefs. As far as descent from the Khazars is concerned, one would need to know what their genetic markers looked like, and we don't. Furthermore, there is no genetic signature that distinguishes Jews from all other populations. Rejection of the Khazar idea is usually about as arbitrary as its acceptance; more information is needed, but we won't get it if everybody thinks the question is answered - or should never be asked.<small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 209.77.137.57 (<a href="../../../2/0/9/User_talk%7E209.77.137.57.html" title="User talk:209.77.137.57">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.77.137.57_095a.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.77.137.57">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

Genetic tests don't connect modern Jews to ancient Israel. They connect them to each other - slightly. There is no genetic test that can bridge unknown history or is related to soil tests. The group we call Jews today may, or may not, be the Jews of Israel. For all we know the Palestinians may be the Jews - actually more likely to carry David's blood than anyone else. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../1/5/9/User%7E159.105.80.219.html" title="User:159.105.80.219">159.105.80.219</a> (<a href="../../../1/5/9/User_talk%7E159.105.80.219.html" title="User talk:159.105.80.219">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_159.105.80.219_a03c.html" title="Special:Contributions/159.105.80.219">contribs</a>) 11 December 2006.</small></p>

The genetic studies that I have read about are really not reliable. The sample size tends to be under a hundred, when the actual population is many millions of people. It's impossible to generalize on such a massive population with such a minuscule sample size with any degree or illusion of accuracy and to do so is junk science and poor methodology. By having these papers quoted as "absolute evidence" (which they aren't!) of a certain genetic marker (such as 8,000,000 Jews coming from four women) we are in essence submitting to the use of junk science. This isn't even the way that the people doing the tests wanted us to use their results, likely. Until we have the technology to test millions of people's genetic markers, there is absolutely no way we can figure out "where a large ethnic group" comes from, whether it is homogeneous or heterogeneous or any other piece of information, really.

<dd>The Behar study (the four Ashkenazi mothers) was about 640 individuals and used 14 markers. That's the first reasonable size study. The cost of sequencing is going down rapidly. Of course, one thing about studying Ashkenazi Jews is, it's not like studying Finns, where you go to Finland and find people who speak Finnish. The researchers actually choose their sample (i.e., they decide who is an Ashkenazi Jew), which means that any notion of statistical validity is out the window. I agree with you that a lot of the earlier studies of other populations (done in the 1990s) are really bogus. For example, the study of the Ethiopian Jews that everybody puts so much weight on had, I think, 38 individuals. I originally added that material, and when I did so, I added a paragraph that said frankly exactly what you are saying here, about the questionable statistical validity. Of course, that paragraph was my synthesis, and somebody else insisted that it be removed, which was the correct thing to do in this case. I do think 640 individuals is enough to say with some accuracy that there were a lot of them with Middle Eastern origin. Don't forget that haplotye analysis increases in validity and accuracy over time, as new markers are identified and can be applied to old studies. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetzenberg_43b3.html" title="User:Metzenberg">Metzenberg</a> 16:43, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've found a source that is <i>very</i> informative on the various migrations since about 1650 (and especially since the 19th century), how the Jews fit the various societies, how some countries might be best understood as containing <i>multiple</i> Jewries, of the splits between Orthodox and modernizing tendencies, etc. Unfortunately, I have been able to borrow it only briefly. <s>Someone is strongly encouraged to track down a copy and mine it heavily; with any luck I might be able to borrow it some other time myself.</s> It is:</p>

<p>I read it this weekend &amp; took a lot of notes. Not as detailed as I hoped, but very suggestive. I've found material to add to a lot of articles. I'll add to various places over the next few weeks. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 07:09, Jan 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Riff book has a lot of good detail, especially post-1850, but that isn't where the story should start. Some points that should make it into the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>During and after the <a href="../../../c/h/m/Chmielnicki_Uprising_1b4c.html" title="Chmielnicki Uprising">Chmielnicki Uprising</a> (1648–1654) tens of thousands of Jews were killed. Prior to that, there were some 200,000 Jews in Poland. This triggered the first of many waves of migration out of that area. Probably half of the Jews either were killed or left.</li>
<li>Another major migration in 2nd half of 18th century triggered by Poland's political decline.</li>
<li>Because of this and other migrations over the next 250 years, many areas of East Central Europe had growing populations of Jews, often with Galician roots. In areas where the economy was largely rural and undeveloped -- Northeastern Slovakia, Sub-Carpathian Ruthenia, parts of Transylvania -- they often became intermediaries (peddlers, even lessors or managers of noble estates). Also, many Jew migrated to the cities, where a lot became involved in commerce and industry. Transylvania &amp; Sub-Carpatathia developed density of Jews comparable to Galicia. Moldova (where they were about 20%) similarly.</li>
<li>Urbanization: Jews from Prussian Poland mostly went to Berlin and Breslau. "By the turn of the century over a third of the Jews in Bohemia (92,746) lived in Prague and its immediate environs, while nearly a quarter of those in Moravia lived in Brno." [Riff, p. 31]</li>
<li>By the time of the rise of nationalism in the 19th century, Jews constituted a very large proportion of the middle class in East Central Europe. During late A-H Empire, middle mgt &amp; bureaucracy., + banking, retail, and "the free professions". As a result, as national elites grew and were competing for middle-class role, it was Jews they were competing with.</li>
<li>Assimilation and acculturation took many different directions. In Hungarian-ruled areas, even most Orthodox learned Hungarians and saw themselves as "Magyars of the Hebrew persuasion". Similarly, in Austrian-ruled Bohemia and Moravia, Jews were acculturated as Germans, but after independence learned Czech. Similar in lesser degree elsewhere, even at times Poland.</li>
<li>The <i>Kresy</i> (part of Russian Empire: Polish Lithuania-Belarus &amp; Volynia): ethnically diverse, politically backward. Relative lack of anti-semitism. Shtetls intact, Jews were about half (or even more) of the larger towns. Acculturation was toward Russians, and not much of it at that, because the towns were more Jewish than Russian.</li>
<li>Important social splits: Orthodox, Hasids, (post 1890s) Zionists of various persuasions, Folkists (nationalist, like the Zionists, but wanting to remain geographically where they were), various religious reform movements, esp. the Neolog in Hungarian areas, Bundists and other socialists, I'm sure things are missing from this list.</li>
<li>Important geographical issues: Can't be neatly divided by country, and besides, borders moved. Speaking of Poland c. 1900, Riff (p.30) writes that it had "Not one Jewry, but several" in different parts of the country.</li>

<p>Everyone is "the world's smartest" in their own IQ tests. If I made an IQ test here and now, and got 100% right, would I be the world's smartest? Also, intelligence isn't simply mathematical or verbal reasoning. It's much more. Therefore it's wrong to say group X is the smartest due to having the highest IQ. Not to mention that the Soviets were the world's best in many thing in their own Olympics. They weren't in other countries' Olympics. --85.49.224.196 01:40, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're absolutely right, and that's why the article <i>doesn't say that Ashkenazim are the "smartest" because they have the highest average IQ</i>. All that it says is that "According to many studies, Ashkenazi Jews have the highest average intelligence of any ethnic group as measured by IQ", something which can be empirically measured and quantified. Any claims of of Askhenazim being "better" or "smarter" are only personal interpretations not supported by that data, and most importantly, not made in the article. <a href="../../../y/i/d/User%7EYid613_c34c.html" title="User:Yid613">Yid613</a> 04:03, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>This whole section on IQ needs to be gutted and re-written without on the racist nonsense. I'll do so as soon as i have time, using the recent largest moss representative, thus valid, study ever done on Ashkenazi IQ by Bachman/Lynn.</p>
<p>I absolutely agree. The whole "achievement" section is racist and has no place in wikipedia.</p>
<p><br />
Some studies say the Jews have a high IQ - of course other studies say they have an average or low IQ. A racist section in wiki? But if it doesn't say Jews are superior then it will be called anti-Semitic, get your high IQ guys working on that problem. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../1/5/9/User%7E159.105.80.219.html" title="User:159.105.80.219">159.105.80.219</a> (<a href="../../../1/5/9/User_talk%7E159.105.80.219.html" title="User talk:159.105.80.219">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_159.105.80.219_a03c.html" title="Special:Contributions/159.105.80.219">contribs</a>) 11 December 2006.</small></p>

<p>I'm not sure that citing Cochrane is "original research", isn't it rather reporting the (controversial) research of these authors? Furthermore, the reversion by Jdwolff reverted all of the objective information about IQ testing (citations of other studies) which have nothing to do with Cochran at all. Also he removed the Nobel prize information, again an objective fact, not related to Cochran per se. <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaisershatner_51b9.html" title="User:Kaisershatner">Kaisershatner</a> 17:27, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, the study of Cochrane and the rest of the University of Utah team is being published in the Journal of Biosocial Science.

<p>At the moment, the paragraph gives immense credit to Cochran, who is just a clever loudmouth and has pushed for his research to be published in The Economist before it had even reached the professional literature and been exposed to peer review, expert commentary and the inevitable letters to the editor.</p>
<p>The paragraph should take the following form:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reliable statistical source that Ashkenazim are in the world's top percentiles of IQ.</li>
<li>Examples (e.g. ACM prizewinners)</li>
<li>Theories
<ul>
<li>Conventional theories</li>
<li>Radical theories, e.g. Cochran and his lot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course this paragraph is very easily misunderstood, and if not written properly will lend credence to anti-Semites (look, the Jews are just so @#^(*# clever, you can never win while they move to dominate the world, better kill 'em off etc etc). <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 10:39, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is an article here in Wikipedia about Gregory Cochran, apparently written by one of the members of his cult. The entire Cochran section should be moved there and referenced from here. Including it here, in a relatively incomplete article on Ashkenazi Jewry, makes it seem vastly more important than it really is. It is a minor piece of research, virtually all theory with no empirical science, by two authors who are neither geneticists nor historians. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetzenberg_43b3.html" title="User:Metzenberg">Metzenberg</a> 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is wrong fact, that Ashkenazi Jews came Europe through Khazaria Khaganate, first Jews came to Germany in 1600s, Jews were pushed eastwards after decline of Khazaria - they played important role in Poland early history and in Hungarian history. So, you have to correct your text.</p>

<dd>That is a theory. It gets mention in the article. There were Jews in Germany well before the 1600s.

<dd>In addition to the DNA evidence, there is overwhelming linguistic and historical evidence that the Ashkenazi Jews originated in the Middle East and arrived in northwestern Europe, before moving eastwards. The Khazar theory has popular with a few Jewish writers in the middle of the 20th century, when many Jews wanted to disassociate themselves from Germany. More recently, it has been taken up by various anti-Zionist groups because it suggests that modern Jewish ancestry is not Middle Eastern. However, this theory has no mainstream support among historians, or in linguistics or human genetics.</dd>

<p>This article seems incomplete in that it states that Ashkenazi origins go back to the 10th Century in Central/Eastern Europe. Were their ancestors from previous centuries Pagan Europeans who converted to Judaism and/or intermarried into small Diaspora Jewish communities in Central/Eastern Europe? Would this intermarriage/conversion explain the significant population growth of European Jews up towards the Industrial Revolution and onward before the Holocaust of WWII?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ashenazic Jews are most closely related to Roman Jews, and the intermarriage ratw was quite low, 0.5% per generation. See: <a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/97/12/6769" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/97/12/6769" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:02, 17 August 2005 (UTC) Your source does not support your claim - it is very important to look at the data, rather than the claim made by the title or abstract. As is typical of investigations of Jewish ancestry, the study uses commonly accepted history as a basis for both design and interpretation of the experiment. But the history is really not that clear - particularly on the origin of the Ashkenazis, which is essentially a legend. A cold look at the historical evidence indicates that Jews migrated throughout the Roman empire, and beyond, and there is no reason to suppose that they did not intermarry with local populations. There seems to be resistance to the idea that a substantial portion of Jewish ancestry comes from places other than Israel, but the genetic data is entirely compatible with that view. True, the Ashkenazi population can be seen as distinct (in some senses) from other European populations, but that does not in itself tell us where it came from. We will be enlightened only by assembling a complete picture of the genetics of the several populations that might have contributed to the Ashkenazi.</dd>

<p>Good point! Like most other historical articles about the Ashkenazi population, there is nothing mentioned about how the Jews got from the Judea/Mediterranean Basis during the Roman Empire times to places in Northern Europe such as Germany and Northern France. It seems new insights into Ashkenazi DNA are answering some questions about Jewish migration patterns. Apparently, the male Y-chromosome patterns of Ashkenazi Jewish decent match the y-chromosome patterns of other Middle Eastern populations such as Lebonese, Iraqis, etc. This is proof that atleast the original male founders of the Ashkenazi community were of Southern Mediterranean/Middle Eastern origin. However, studies on the mtDNA (the founding mothers' side) have shown that the female founders might be from local European ancestry. This is interesting for several reasons. One is that in Jewish tradition "Jewishness" is passed on through the mother. However, according to DNA evidence it appears "Jewish" males intermarried non-ethnically Jewish woman. Despite this anamoly, it does explains some things. For one, it explains why most European Jewish populations look like their host communities (because the intermarriages of the southern Jewish traders with European women) while still maintaing Jewish culture and religion.</p>
<p>An historical framework for this DNA evidence has not been explored and fully elaborated on. In other words, how exactly did the Jewish male traders from the Mediterranean Basin move into new communities in the North? How did these males then intermarry the local women (probably converting the local women when intermarrying)?. Also, which communities did the Jewish males move from (maybe somewhere in Italy? Maybe in Greece? Maybe Mesopotamia?) and in what specific time periods did this migration take place(400s, 500s, 600s CE, etc.)? If anyone has information they should add it to the Origin of Ashkenzi article which is probably being merged into the Ashkanzi article. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 137.99.168.167 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_137.99.168.167_eaef.html" title="Special:Contributions/137.99.168.167">contribs</a>) 26 Sept 2005.</small></p>

Actually the authors have no way of knowing where the women camce from. the fact that the haplotypes were found in some other Jewish populations could be explained by migration from europe into other Jewish populations.

<p>It seems to me that, although largely forgotten post-WW2, significant distinctions were made between German Jews, sometimes called Yekkes (not sure if this is a derogatory slang word or whether the German Jews themselves used this) and so-called Ostjuden of East Europe. I don't know a great deal about it, but I recall books by Sander Gilman highlighting the extent to which these differences were considered significant in Europe by both Jews and non-Jews, extending to language (Yiddish), custom, physical appearance, etc. I know this is a touchy subject, and I don't want to harp on it, but I wonder whether treating Ashkenazim as a homogeneous mass doesn't do a disservice. Are there Ashkenazi "sub-sub-ethnic groups", or whatever is the appropriate term here? --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnotherBDA_0c9c.html" title="User:AnotherBDA">AnotherBDA</a> 13:32, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yekke is a slang term used by Israelis for Jews specifically from Germany. There term is used, with some qualification, in Spielberg's recent film on Munich. Within Ashkenazi Jewry there have long been religious and national differences in culture.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yekke is not slang, and it's not an Israeli invention. Yekkes were and are very different in look and custom from other Ashkenazi Jews. Ashkenazi is a very broad term. Within it are Hugarians, Poles, some Dutch, and Lithuanians, all of whom have different customs. 88.153.142.83 00:39, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The term Yekke originated in the 19th century when some of the Jews of Germany stopped wearing long coats and adopted the short "jackets" worn by other Germans. More traditional Ashkenazim referred to these modernizing Jews as "Yeckes" (the Yiddish word for "jackets", like the German word Jaecke, which is a cognate of "jacket" in English). So it started out as slang that one group of Ashkenazim used to label another. Of course, the use of the word has evolved since that time, and it has become a label for a subgroup. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetzenberg_43b3.html" title="User:Metzenberg">Metzenberg</a> 12:13, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why are Jews smarter? There is precious little laboratory science to help with finding the answer. That being the case, to arrive at a plausible paridigm one must keep the solution very simple, and rely heavily on common sense.</p>
<p>In only one short paragraph, were the ideas of Galton (1860) and Wiener (1900's) mentioned, yet theirs were the only plausible model. I have been watching this phenomonon for 60 years and I think the answer is so simple, that even a child can see it. But only a child, untouched by intellectual fashion and politically correct taboos.</p>
<p>Here it is:</p>
<p>Why are Jews so smart? There are many explanations, some of which strain common sense. But you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out why. It can all be explained quite clearly:</p>
<p>Through millenia of widsread illiteracy, Jewish culture valued the twin cultural ethics of learning and literacy above all else. This was true since Jesus' day, and long before. Pressures to become the most learned in the Jewish community were around forever. Many of the men were rabbis of some sort, and every one dreamed of becoming the chief rabbi. The competition for that job was stiff, and was entirely based upon mental abilities. It was not even important what was studied. Even if it had been the game of chess, it would still have produced the same result, just as long as the challenge was a hard mental contest.</p>
<p>Early on then, the smartest Jews rose to the highest level of their society. Moreover, the field of competition was among all men thanks to universal male literacy, and not just among a much smaller group, as it was elsewhere. So a very strong merit system was in place from the beginning, and for a very long time. This cultural accident alone can answer the question.</p>
<p>But there was another and even stronger pressure. As if to insure the result, the smartest men reproduced themselves moreso than ordinary males. That was because the most highly placed rabbis were freed from having to make a living. They were supported by the community so that they could study all day long. Even more significantly, the head rabbi went through wives like popcorn, a younger one each time. Culturally, it was a great honor for an ordinary father, not blessed with great intelligence but only the ability to become rich, to give up his young daughter to the Rabbis bed, once the rabbis previous wife died having her 20th child. There is even hard evidence for this gleaned from the detailed family records that Jews are well known for, even going back to Bible days. So the most intelligent men were selected not only for intelligence, but for their ability to reproduce a lot, too. This is an even surer recipe for the selection of smart genes, but the realtive smartness of the Jews was helped along from another, and most unexpected direction.</p>
<p>Consider how the culture of non-Jews effected their own special outcome. In the culture of Christendom, the best minds, indeed the cream of the crop, were recruited, prized, and sent into the priesthood. Thus, in a single stroke, the genes for the best minds were collected from the entire male population, every generation, and then simply sent off into the celibate priesthood, thus removing them from the gene pool forever. So while Christendom impoverished its own gene pool of intelligence, the Jews enriched theirs, thereby making the relative difference between the two populations even larger.</p>
<p>I can't emphasize enough the role of male universal literacy among the Jews. Not only did the Jews invent a system that produced smart men (without realizing it), but they forced their entire male population through it. That took care of all the unsung geniuses from poor families who were so often overlooked by every other system, even in lands very far away from Christendom. Indeed, who among the gentiles could read at all? Only a small part of the population, the clergy and the aristocrats. And as we all know, from the example of the colonization of South America, selecting managers solely from the aristocracy is a very bad idea.</p>
<dl>
<dd>i would like to remind you that the Eastern Orthodox Church allows the priests to be married, your theory does not apply to the whole of Christendom.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Post Script: The arguments above can also be used to explain negative outcomes, of course, such as the higher than average rates of certain inherited diseases among Jews. Also, when the arguments above are applied to other groups and races, many heretofore complex and thorny issues suddenly become clear and easily understood by all.</dd>

<p>As a proud Jew is saddens me to have to correct this but your theory does not hold much water. Unfortunately, the push for everyone to become the most learned, and even universal literacy, are fairly recent phenomena. If you look in the halakhic works of the middle ages (cf. Shulchan Arukh and Rambam) you will see many laws pertaining to those who cannot read. If you look in the Beit Yosef you will see that the purpose of the repetition of the shemone esrei during prayer was quite clearly for those in attendence who could not read it themselves. Illiteracy was clearly a large enough problem that such the rabbis imposed a fairly major inconvencience on the congregation (be require the repetition), which is generally prohibited. In regard to the aim to be the chief rabbi, no such aim existed except for the few learned. Until the chassidic movement, probably less than several thousand men learned any gemara at a given time. While it was normal for the common people to attend lectures or study scripture and often mishna, intense learning was not the aim. It is certainly understandable to conclude that everyone wished to be a great rabbi because most of our sources from the time are great rabbis, but it is important to understand that this is a selective pool and not representative of the overall population. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishJew_f584.html" title="User:IrishJew">Avraham</a> 15:35, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>By the above we would have to say that the rich have high IQs. Maybe here and there but not as widespread as we are led to believe. Watch TV when they interview the average Jew in Israel and you see the majority fitting right in at any trailer park in my area. This of course doesn't mean low IQ but their sentiments appear to be lower level redneck by and large. I see little intellectual detachment in most Jews - hyper-emotional instead - on many sensitive subjects, not the hallmark of high IQ - more a cultural thing. Success, college education, research, etc are more likely to come from family pressure/example and social cohesion ( nepotism, opportunity etc). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../1/5/9/User%7E159.105.80.219.html" title="User:159.105.80.219">159.105.80.219</a> (<a href="../../../1/5/9/User_talk%7E159.105.80.219.html" title="User talk:159.105.80.219">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_159.105.80.219_a03c.html" title="Special:Contributions/159.105.80.219">contribs</a>) 11 December 2006.</small></p>
<p>The rpetition does not indicate it was ordained because of illiteracy, the fact that the Gemmorah and Shulchan Aruch give the reason for the repetition as widespread illiteracy indicates it was ordained for that reason.

<p>The recently added part of the article concerning the khazars in the Origin of Ashkenazi section, might be a fallacious argument. The theory of khazars being the origin of the Ashkenazi, was postulated by Arthur Koestler. The article states that the theory is not disproven by DNA evidence, when in fact the DNA evidence seems to indicate that in fact the origins of the Y-chromosome is Middle Eastern in origin, and the mtDNA is local european in origin. There is no pervasive Turkish or Turkish related genetic markers as far as I know. I think that part should be taken out of that section, maybe put in another one, like "Alternative Theories" or "Koestler's One-Time Theory".<small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 137.99.170.195 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_137.99.170.195_3451.html" title="Special:Contributions/137.99.170.195">contribs</a>) .</small> The preceding comment is mistaken in just about every detail. Koestler was not the originator of the Khazar hypothesis; he merely wrote a book about it (parts of which were pretty fanciful, other parts not). No sensible geneticist would argue that the genetic evidence on Ashkenazi origins is complete or unambiguous; the commenter is accepting interpretations as if they are fact, but that is not how science works. The (presumed) lack of "pervasive Turkish...markers" is irrelevant: we don't know what genetic markers Khazars might have carried, and anyway there has never been a comprehensive analysis of genetic markers in that population.</p>

This alternative theory is that a proportion of Ashkenazi are descended from the Khazars, a Central Asian tribe that converted (at least in part) to Judaism in the 8th-9th centuries. The Khazars were defeated in war, and disappeared from historical records in the early Middle Ages. According to Koestler numerous sources indicate that some Eastern European Jewish communities were founded by Khazars, but the contribution of the Khazars to the Ashkenazi population is not clear. The theory is controversial because of its implication that a large group of Jews has its origins outside of Israel, and is often ignored or disparaged in discussions of Ashkenazi origins.

<p>If Koestler's work is to be mentioned, it should be as a hypothesis advanced by a non-historian layman, albeit talented novelist, who based his history on a largely recited account taken from Dunlop and his racial theory on physiognomic analyses now disproven by genetic testing as well as a few poorly-analyzed and misunderstood similarities in place names. While it's probably that the Khazars had some impact on the genetic makeup of Ashkenazi Jews, Koestler claimed, with no evidence that a serious historian would accept, that all Ashkenazi Jews were primarily Khazar in origin, which is simply false. As an interesting, marginally related and ironic side note, an article recently published states that a genetic marker predisposing the bearer to Parkinson's Disease (which was killing Koestler when he committed suicide) that appears in Ashkenazim derives from Middle Eastern ancetors. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 18:47, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>For Jaydig: What precisely is wrong with the statement that "All of these studies are preliminary, and interpretations of data tend to follow commonly accepted historical explanations of Ashkenazi origins. A definitive view must await more exhaustive studies that include larger numbers of subjects from possibly related ethnic groups, as well as more genetic markers "? That is a pretty standard warning that the genetic data is incomplete, and an observation on the way in which the extant data has been interpreted. Can you argue with getting more data? Have you read the cited papers in their entirety? How do they rule out a Khazar contribution to the Ashkenazim? What if the Khazars shared genetic markers with Middle Eastern populations?</p>
<p>(The prvious paragraph is not mine.) I have met several well-educated Ashkenazi Jews who 'learned' the Khazar theory as supposed truth in their youth, presumably from their parents. Several months ago, I researched how they could have come to believe such an outlandish fancy and found this Wikipedia article. The information helped me explain to some of them both the truth and the history of the notion. Given the currency of the beleif in Khazar ancestry, it would ba a shame if the debunking information is removed in a misguided attempt to suppress a neutral but inaccurate theory—which only happens to be being used this deacade for nefarious political purposes. <a href="../../../d/v/d/User%7EDvd_Avins_c9e5.html" title="User:Dvd Avins">Dvd Avins</a> 10:05, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Behar study states that "The term “Ashkenazi” refers to Jews of mainly central and eastern European ancestry, in contrast to those of Iberian (Sephardic), Near Eastern, or North African origin (Ostrer 2001). Most historical records indicate that the founding of the Ashkenazi Jewry took place in the Rhine Basin, followed by a dramatic expansion into eastern Europe."</p>
<p>The study does not claim that Ashkenazi Jews "migrated from Israel". That quote is taken from the CNN article. The CNN article also states that "Ashkenazi Jews are a group with mainly central and eastern European ancestry."</p>

<dd>Actually, the most accurate would be to just directly quote the DNA conclusions from the study from the PubMed link (it's succinct and clear): "<i>Both the extent and location of the maternal ancestral deme from which the Ashkenazi Jewry arose remain obscure. Here, using complete sequences of the maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), we show that close to one-half of Ashkenazi Jews, estimated at 8,000,000 people, can be traced back to only 4 women carrying distinct mtDNAs that are virtually absent in other populations, with the important exception of low frequencies among non-Ashkenazi Jews.

<p>But the study only says "likely of Near Eastern ancestry"; it does not prove Near Eastern ancestry at all, it merely makes the interpretation because the haplotypes are found in other Jewish populations. In fact the haplotypes could have come from somewhere else: the study did not by any means make an exhaustive search for the haplotypes in other populations. Your certainty is not warranted by the data: you should examine your own assumptions and ask yourself why you are so ready to draw conclusions.</p>
<p><i>Al-Andalus asks</i>, "What with the other 60% (the majority)? Even so, for the 40% with "likely" Near Eastern mtDNA, this does not exclude European admixture for that 40%." I think this is one of the dangers of interpreting early results of haplotype analysis. In fact, haplotype analysis is a cummulative process. Many haploytpes cannot be positively identified as Middle Eastern or European at this time because not enough data has been collected and analyzed. The 40% is just the low lying fruit, the ones that can clearly be placed in one of four large groups. But 40% is probably a lower limit on what more comprehensive studies in the future will eventually find. Haplotype groups can be as small as one, which is to say, there will probably never complete certainty over time, but that the confidence level will rise over time. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetzenberg_43b3.html" title="User:Metzenberg">Metzenberg</a> 07:07, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not all Ashkenazi males are descended from Levantine populations. The lineage of Levite Ashkenazi Jews appear to descend from European origins. --68.211.66.29 01:29, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Am J Hum Genet. 2003 Oct;73(4):768-79. Multiple origins of Ashkenazi Levites: Y chromosome evidence for both Near Eastern and European ancestries.</p>
<p>Behar DM, Thomas MG, Skorecki K, Hammer MF, Bulygina E, Rosengarten D, Jones AL, Held K, Moses V, Goldstein D, Bradman N, Weale ME.</p>
<p>Previous Y chromosome studies have shown that the Cohanim, a paternally inherited Jewish priestly caste, predominantly share a recent common ancestry irrespective of the geographically defined post-Diaspora community to which they belong, a finding consistent with common Jewish origins in the Near East. In contrast, the Levites, another paternally inherited Jewish caste, display evidence for multiple recent origins, with Ashkenazi Levites having a high frequency of a distinctive, non-Near Eastern haplogroup. Here, we show that the Ashkenazi Levite microsatellite haplotypes within this haplogroup are extremely tightly clustered, with an inferred common ancestor within the past 2,000 years. Comparisons with other Jewish and non-Jewish groups suggest that a founding event, probably involving one or very few European men occurring at a time close to the initial formation and settlement of the Ashkenazi community, is the most likely explanation for the presence of this distinctive haplogroup found today in &gt;50% of Ashkenazi Levites.</p>

<dd>I don't think anyone was saying Ashkenazi Jews have <i>no</i> European DNA. I'm sure Ashkenazi Jews have traces of all sorts of DNA in them, like most other ethnic groups, including European. This particular study seems to have found that for a small sub-group of Ashkenazi Jews, the Levites, which comprise what, 4-5% of Ashkenazi Jews, it is likely that 50% or more (i.e. 2-3% of all Ashkenazi Jews) have non near-Eastern, likely European, ancestry.

<dd>Yes, "extermination," or rather its German equivalent, was chosen by the Nazis precisely because it implied the Jews were less than human.

<p>First of all, if we say "Askenazim have the highest IQ of any ethnic group," including "leading East Asians, who also perform highly on IQ" is pointless. If readers are interested in group differences in IQ, they can visit the article that is linked to: Race and Intelligence.</p>
<p>Second of all, saying "Ashkenazim have the highest <i>average</i> IQ of any ethnic group" is pointless. If ethnic groups as a whole are being discussed, including "average" is redundant; that is the same as saying "France's average GDP" instead of "France's GDP"—which no one says.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Including East Asians indicates that Askenazim are not the only alleged outlier.</li>
<li>GDP is a total. Unless you're talking about <i>per capita</i> GDP, in which case people who care about being accurate <i>do</i> include "per capita" in their description, making it an average. In the case of a group IQ measurement, perhaps it should be obvious that it's average being discussed. But in the real world, people may naively read it as <i>everyone</i> in one group having higher IQ than <i>everyone</i> in another group. The manner which the issue is usually discussed tends to encourage at least a mild form of that misapprehension. Whne the variation within a group exceeds the variation between groups, saying that one group is more whatever than another is completely inappropriate. <a href="../../../d/v/d/User%7EDvd_Avins_c9e5.html" title="User:Dvd Avins">Dvd Avins</a> 17:05, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I did mean per capita GDP. No one says average per capita GDP, and no one "naively reads" this as meaning "<i>everyone</i> in one" country has a higher income than "<i>everyone</i> in another" country.</dd>

<dd>As for East Asians: I still think of including them as inappropriate for the reason stated above.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Per capita <i>means</i> it's an average. <i>Per</i> in Latin means the same thing it does in English. <i>Capita</i> means <i>head,</i> which is used as a substitute for <i>person,</i> since there's generally a one-to-one correspondance. So per capita means divided by the number of people, or, in more mathematical terms, the mean (or average) across the population. <a href="../../../d/v/d/User%7EDvd_Avins_c9e5.html" title="User:Dvd Avins">Dvd Avins</a> 02:45, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am summarizing my reasons for revising the first section. In the past, before there was good genetic evidence, Ashkenazi history often tried to play down connections with the Middle East, to stress that the Jews of Eastern Europe were very European. Thus, the standard textbook we had always showed a map of Jewish communities under the Roman Empire, to stress the longstanding history of Jews in Europe.</p>
<p>But there is little documentation to prove that the Jewish communities of Roman Europe, such as the one that existed in Cologne around 300 CE, survived as Jewish communities. And there is cultural evidence that the Jews who settled in the Rhineland and northern France beginning about 900 CE had recent origins in the Middle East. There is abundant evidence that the Jews of the western Mediterranean in Roman times were Hellenized, that they spoke Greek and Latin, but little Hebrew and Aramaic. For example the inscriptions in Jewish catacombs in Rome were predominantly in Greek.</p>
<p>There is some documentary evidence that Jews from Italy were invited to come north, but were these Jews in Italy descended from Roman populations? There was a remnant of the Roman Jewish population until the 20th century, called the Romaniote Jews, who spoke a Judeo Greek dialect.</p>
<p>However, the Jews who arrived in the northern Europe around 900 CE used very little Greek or Latin. Instead, the Yiddish language is full of words with Aramaic and Hebrew roots. Furthermore, the early Ashkenazim were steeped in Bavli (Babylonian Talmudic) culture, to which they began to contribute almost immediately after their arrival. The works of Rabbi Gershom of Mainz (10th century), Rashi of Troyes (11th century), and later the Tosafists (12th century) attest to this.</p>
<p>Bernard Lewis's histories have shown the importance of Islamic influence in Judaism up to the 12th century. In the early years of Islamic society, when Europe was comparatively backward and illiterate, large numbers of Jews moved west from Babylon to Spain, North Africa, and other Mediterranean destinations. In the Middle Ages, there was a large Jewish community in Provence, which could have traded with and contributed to the Jewish population further north.</p>

<p>The present article states incorrectly that the only Sephardic community that suffered in the Holocaust was that of Greece. In fact, there were Sephardic communities throughout the Balkans, especially in Yugoslavia, and the Jewish populations of France, Italy, and Holland all contained a significant proportion of Sephardic Jews.

<p>I would like to see the material on the intelligence moved to a different page. A brief description of it and a link belongs here here. I would also like to handle the Khazar Jews issue the same way. These are special issues and points of view, both lacking in mainstream accceptance. Underlying the POV of the people who want to talk so much about Ashkenazi intelligence is a view of Ashkenazi Jews as a racial group or a homogeneous ethnic group. But that's only one of the meanings that the word "Ashkenazi" has. I want this page to explain what Ashkenazi Jews are and where they come from.</p>
<p>The focus of so many people on Ashkenazi intelligence (and the racial eugenics theories they want to expound) is as offensive as it would be to have a huge section of the page on Italian Americans be devoted to the mafia.</p>
<p>Ashkenaz was a nation and a culture that existed for 1000 years, but that never had a state or a government. Now in the 21st century, the original communities of Ashkenaz have been liquidated and all the original inhabitants have migrated away. Even the Russian Jews that are left live in large urban centers far removed from the original shtetls. Ashkenaz is the remnant of the culture they once had.</p>
<p>The Cochran paper does not belong on this page, except as a footnote. I would like to see two new pages developed.</p>
<p>1. Jewish Achievement. I stress that it should be called Jewish Achievemant and not Ashkenazi achievement. The only reason that the majority of Jewish Achievers have been Ashkenazi is that before the mid-20th century, over 90% of all Jews were Ashkenazi. Many of the great Jewish achievers have been or are Sephardic and Mizrahi.</p>
<p>2. Ashkenazi Intelligence. A page to explain all of the different theories about why Ashkenazi Jews have high IQs. A page from which controversy about IQ and race can be referenced.</p>
<p>I have recently done quite a bit of work on this page, creating a new first section and modifying the material on origins. I have more to do here, but I will let it stand for now until others comment and have their say.</p>
<p>I have created a separate page called <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashkenazi_Intelligence_13c4.html" title="Ashkenazi Intelligence">Ashkenazi Intelligence</a>. I would invite the editors here who are interested in these theories to restore material that has been deleted here. This is obviously a contoversial and important topic, and we will hear more about it in the news this year. I've heard that a major cover story in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Republic_cd90.html" title="New Republic">New Republic</a> is pending. I have not removed any material about Ashkenazi intelligence here, but I hope others will consent to my doing so.</p>
<p>One more thing. I looked at the Koestler book this weekend, and I found the book fascinating. I don't happen to believe it, but the man is an engaging writer. One of my favorite books was always his novel <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darkness_at_Noon_288e.html" title="Darkness at Noon">Darkness at Noon</a>. I am surprised there is no page "Khazar Jews" on which the theory could be discussed. It is amazing too how many people have been interested in it, and how many books and articles have been written. Why doesn't someone who is interested in it create such a page. Could start by restoring the deleted materials from here.</p>

Jewish achievement seems to be a regularly noted sociocultural trend, so I think the present discussion of this in the Achievement section is appropriate.

<p>I agree that there needs to be a mention of Ashkenazi achievement because of the current controversies in the news. But the real subject matter belongs under "Jewish Achievement" in that article, and not under Ashkenazi achievement alone. So this article is really the wrong place.</p>
<p>A great many of the famous Jews that are so often mentioned are not of Ashkenazi origin at all. People who are interested in this subject are often interested in the relative contributions of culture and education versus genetics. If you went back to the early 19th century, most of the Jews that had made a mark on European science and philosophy were of Sephardic origin, not Ashkenazi. At the time, a great majority of Ashkenazi Jews still lived in very backwards conditions in eastern Europe. It was only when they emerged from Polish and Russian ghettos that they were able to make comparable contributions. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetzenberg_43b3.html" title="User:Metzenberg">Metzenberg</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMetzenberg_713c.html" title="User talk:Metzenberg">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Metzenberg_05b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Metzenberg">contribs</a>) 24 April 2006.</small></p>

<p>It is an autoimmune disease that has a higher prevalence in the Middle East and amoung Jews, suggesting a possible genetic compenent. It is not at this time known to be a genetic disease however, at least not a single-polymorphism genetic disorder. It hasn't been identified or researched in families. It doesn't belong in a list of Ashkenazi genetic diseases. For one thing, it isn't even an "Ashkenazi" disease. It appears to be common to Jews of Middle Eastern origin in general.</p>
<p>I have a lot of sympathy for people with diseases, so I hope nobody will be offended here, but this page should not have a laundry list of every disease that is slightly more common among Jews, whether or not it is truly genetic.</p>
<p>Many people have a misconception, because there is so much talk about a few Jewish genetic diseases, that Jews have more genetic diseases. The fact is that all genetically isolated groups have a reservoir of a specific genetic diseases that are found in the group, but not in the population at large, This includes the people of Finland, Sardinia, Iceland, Japan, and the other minority populations of Israel, like the Beduins, the Druze, and the Samaratans.</p>
<p>The reason so many Jewish genetic diseases are known is that Israel has cradle-to-grave health care, including free genetic testing, and an remarkably high percentage of the world's human geneticists are Jewish. Ever since the discovery of an enzyme assay test for Tay-Sachs, Jews have embraced genetic testing and cooperated with geneticists like no other people in the world. If comparable research were done on other peoples, a similar number of illnesses would be discovered and explained as genetic. There are entire regions of the world where practically no research into genetic disease has ever been done.</p>
<p>If nobody else objects, I would like to eliminate the list of diseases from this page, and perhaps put it on another page, called Jewish Genetic Diseases, which might be a place to talk about the organizations that support testing, the foundations that support research and help families, and so forth. There could be a link to that page from this page, explaining that certain genetic illnesses are commonly found in Ashkenazi populations.</p>

<dd>No, that's common knowledge about Haplotype analysis, and the paper I cite here (Forton et al. Accuracy of Haplotype Reconstruction from Haplotype-Tagging Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms) discusses the problem. The entire conclusion that is given by the Behar article is based on fewer than 15 genetic markers and fewer than 700 individuals. (I don't remember the exact numbers.) Read the article if you want to. Thus, the conclusions that will emerge over time will change. This is not saying the results are not valid. Indeed, they are. <i>They are valid to a level of statistical signifiance that can be interpreted by a person who reads the articles themselves, and understands the reasoning behind statistical inference and haplotype analysis, which most people who read this will not.</i> People have a way of believing too much when they read such research. I am often astonished by what people claim based on extremely limited data that is not randomly selected. Over time, the conclusions of this research will change. That's not because the original research was wrong. To indicate that there is controversy, that different people interpret the results differently, and that responsible researchers in the field itself understand the preliminary nature of their results, does a service to the reader. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetzenberg_43b3.html" title="User:Metzenberg">Metzenberg</a> 21:33, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jay, I think if you read the Behar paper and see the conclusion to that paper, you can see that it is properly qualified. It is a very good paper. It is a paper based on an evolving but very incomplete collection of data, and I am sure that the authors themselves would agree with the way I qualified the results, so that they could be intrepreted better by persons not familiar in a technical way with Haplotype analysis. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetzenberg_43b3.html" title="User:Metzenberg">Metzenberg</a> 21:52, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, my issue is not with how some people see the definition of who is or isn't a Jew. My issue is simply with phrasing throughout that section. In many cases, it seems to say (more or less) "(Such and such) is a Jew because...";. That's a biased statement and should be reworked to something more like "According to (Jewish tradition, certain lineage methods, whatever), this person would be considered a Jew". For example, saying "Karl Marx was a Jew" is not a fact, but saying "Karl Marx would still be considered a Jew by certain people" is accurate. -<a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERasd_0960.html" title="User:Rasd">user:rasd</a></dd>

<p>Karl Marx may have been an atheist at one point in his life, but I have read that he was buried with a Christian service in a church cemetary. Much/most of his anti_christian reputation is anti-Marxist propaganda than truth.

<dd>Why is Bobby Fischer listed as somebody who renounced being Jewish because he denied the holocaust. Denying the holocaust does not equal a renouncement of Jewishness or Judaism. To my humble knowledge, the holocaust is not one of the 13 principles of the Jewish religion, and a SHomer Shabbos believing Jew who does not believe in the holocaust is still a righteous individual according to Shulchan Aruch. Perhaps a silly one. Or with no knowledge of history. But righteous. 88.153.142.83 00:50, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Both Karl Marx and Bobby Fischer are good examples of persons who have denied being Jewish , yet are Jews under the "religious" definition that is discussed here. And that's all that the article is saying. If Bobby Fischer were to go to a rabbi and renounce his former beliefs, stating his desire to be a part of the Jewish people once again, the rabbi (on accepting the sincerity of his desire to resume being a Jew) would perform a "return" ceremony for him rather than a "conversion" ceremony.</dd>

<dd>One more point ... although the Rambam's 13 principles are often considered the best formal statement of traditional Jewish beliefs (they were originally controversial, back in the 13th century), rabbinical authorities have always agreed that there is no halakkic requirement that a Jew must believe them. Indeed, it is often said that Judaism has no creed other than the Shema ("the Lord is one"). Shulchan Aruch is considered the most authoritative manual of practice, for an Orthodox Jew (whether Ashkenazi or Sephardic). It is a guide to what a Jew should do, not what a Jew should believe. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetzenberg_43b3.html" title="User:Metzenberg">Metzenberg</a> 12:33, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see folks have been going back and forth in a revert war. Maybe it would help to have a discussion here about what is meant by "related". Not counting the occasional mixing, Germans and Ashkenazi Jews are not <i>genetically</i> related. But they <i>are</i> tied linguistically, and profoundly influenced each others cultures over a period of many centuries.</p>
<p>Also, other Semitic groups <i>are</i> related to Ashlenazi Jews both genetically <i>and</i> culturally. One could argue that such ties should only be discussed in an article on Jewry as a whole, as the ties between the Arabs and Mizrahi Jews are culturally closer (and with more though still infrequent genetic mixing) than between any non-Jewish Semites and the Ashkenazim. Still, if this article is to stand on its own, I think the connection bears mentioning. I know that when I read descriptions of Ottoman-era Middle Eastern customs and attitudes, they seem much more akin to those of my Ashkenazi ancestors than pre-Enlightenment European customs and attitudes do. <a href="../../../d/v/d/User%7EDvd_Avins_c9e5.html" title="User:Dvd Avins">Dvd Avins</a> 09:30, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is no ethnic definition here. Ashkenazi Jews can be darker than dark while many are blonder and bluer-eyed than many "Aryans". Ashkenazi Jews are bound only by their historical inhabitation of Western, Central and later Eastern Europe. They are bound by a legal tradition (<i>minhag Ashkenaz</i>, one of the two mainstream traditions in Jewish law). But there is no ethnic common denominator. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 12:15, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>

<dd>Yes, no doubt, there has been some intermixing of the Ashekenazi with other groups with whom they have lived in proximity, especially since the Enlightenment.

<p>The ethnobox says that there are an estimated 11 point someodd million Ashkenazim, and uses an uncited reference to a study on musical pitch as its source. This is hardly what I'd call a "reliable" citation. While the UC researchers might very well have believed their number to be correct, I think a better source is needed to corroborate this number...specifically, a source that actually discusses the number of Ashkenazim and says how the number was obtained. The subject of the UC study is "perfect musical pitch", and if you actually read the article, it becomes quite clear that the interest of the article is completely unrelated to an accurate estimate of the number of Ashkenazim in the world, contrary to the implication made by saying there are 11.2M (est) and then citing that article as the source. Without wanting to step on the toes of whoever decided that constituted a good source for a population estimate, my judgment is that it's pretty shoddy scholarship. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 22:57, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The words Seraphim (Hebrew plural of seraph) and Sephardim are unrelated in etymology. Hebrew has several different consonants that can have that "s" sound, depending on position in the word and dialect of Hebrew. Hebrew words (that are not borrowed from other languages) are derived from three letter roots. The root for Seraphim is the same root as the verb to burn (shin-resh-peh). Sephard was the original Hebrew place name for Spain. It begins with a completely different consonant (samech). In Hebrew, foreign loan words and place names with an "s" sound tend to start with samech. Sometimes European languages have transposed consonants. Hebrew doesn't do that. Consonants stay in order. So those two words have no relationship in Hebrew.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm no scholar, but I just Googled, and I found that the Hebrew word seraphim appears in TANAKH (the Hebrew Bible) in only one place, but it is an important passage. The seraphim are the ones that say, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts ... " in the book of Isaiah. That passage (in Hebrew) is repeated in the daily Jewish prayers, in the amidah (the standing prayers that are the centerpiece of every Jewish service). Otherwise, the seraphim are mentioned in the Book of Enoch, which was originally of Jewish origin, but did not make the canon, and became part of the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocrypha.html" title="Apocrypha">Apocrypha</a> (the books that are preserved, sometimes only in Greek, in the Septuagent by the Catholic church).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If there is a Jewish theology about orders of angels, it is probably not canonical, like St. Thomas. Maybe next time I am at a good Jewish library, I will look up the Book of Isaiah in the midrashic texts and see if I can find anything. It would have to be translated into English. But we are so way off topic here. Please get yourself a wikipedia login so that we all can recognize each other next time we meet in the wikiuniverse, and go to work on the page on seraphim, if that interests you.

<dd>I might not be the best person to answer this, but I'll try. <a href="../../../k/a/s/Kashrut.html" title="Kashrut">Kashrut</a> (Jewish dietary law) is based on a few original passages from the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah.html" title="Torah">Torah</a>, mostly enumerated in <a href="../../../l/e/v/Leviticus.html" title="Leviticus">Leviticus</a>. The laws concerning the festival <a href="../../../p/e/s/Pesach.html" title="Pesach">Pesach</a> (or Passover) are a different subject, but also originate in the Torah. With the development of rabbinical Judaism (around 70 CE to 500 CE), these laws and the basis for their practice were developed much futher in the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talmud.html" title="Talmud">Talmud</a>.</dd>

<dd>If you receive a formal Jewish education in a <a href="../../../y/e/s/Yeshiva.html" title="Yeshiva">yeshiva</a>, you learn not just a set of rules or a list of do's and don'ts, but the reasoning behind them. This emphasis on studying the reasoning behind the law is a part of the Talmud and of all Jewish education. It helps in making decisions when new and novel situations are encountered, like new foods not known in ancient times. <i>Why can't Jews eat penguins?</i> That one is easy. Birds that are birds of prey or scavengers cannot be eaten. <i>What about corn (maize) during Passover?</i> The laws concerning <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passover.html" title="Passover">Passover</a> prohibit eating <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leaven.html" title="Leaven">leaven</a> during the eight days of the festival. The sages of the Talmud went into much greater detail, but could not possibly know about every new food that Jews would encounter. When Jews began to live in Ashkenaz, they were too isolated from other communities of the time, so they were forced to make rulings for themselves. Two different traditions developed: Sepharidic and Ashkenazic. The Sephardi and Ashkenazi rabbis encountered different foods in different parts of the world, and made different decisions. However, this does not mean that Ashkenazi rabbis believe Sephardim are wrong, or vise versa. An Ashkenazi Orthodox rabbi would tell a Sephardic family to follow the Sephardic traditions, and vice versa. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetzenberg_43b3.html" title="User:Metzenberg">Metzenberg</a> 07:04, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is an British/American difference. The British originally called wheat by the name corn. When they colonised America and came across maize they also called it corn. Then Americans then took to calling what the British originally called corn by the name wheat. Some people in Britain still call wheat by the name corn. I expect the reference to corn came from a British source or translation and refers to what Americans call wheat. Nicolharper 00:31, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Corn is a word that originally referred to a small hard particle and hence it was applied generically to grains, including staple grains. Incidentally, "corned-beef" arises from the application of "grains" of salt to beef. The English settlers having no name for "maize" yet, used the generic English word for grain. This practice later become a dominant meaning. So "corn" does not equal "maize", except by modern usage. I am not an expert on this dietary pilpul but I believe the word corn should be substituted for grains to avoid confusion. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoraBG_00c0.html" title="User:NoraBG">NoraBG</a> 14:09, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"local intermarriage with local European females"? What makes other Europeans more "local" than Jews? If they are (for example) German, they would have migrated into Europe roughly 1st millenium BCE, right? If they are Hungarians, they wouldn't have arrived until roughly the end of the 1st millenium CE, by which time there were quite a few Jews in Europe. The current wording seems to suggest that the peoples who migrated from Central Asia are somehow "more European" than the Jews, who migrated from Palestine. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 05:23, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>People who have never read the article keep changing the conclusions of the Behar article that is cited here. Please, if you don't know what a <a href="../../../h/a/p/Haplotype.html" title="Haplotype">haplotype</a> is, and you haven't actually read the article, then don't try to edit the conclusions of that article!</p>
<p>Behar identified four founder haplotypes that represented 40% of the maternal lineage in a relatively small sample. The fact that 40% belong to lineages that can be traced to Middle Eastern origins says nothing about the other 60%. It does not say that 40% are Middle Eastern and 60% are European. It says, 40% belonged to larger haplotype groups, about which we have enough data at this time to attribute a Middle Eastern origin, while the other 60% are partly of unknown origins because the data we have today is limited.</p>
<p>The analysis and identification of haplotypes is a cummulative process. Some genetic markers that could someday be used to refine the Behar paper probably haven't even been identified yet. Some of the other 60% belong to small haplotype groups for which there just isn't enough information at this time to identify origins. Some of those haplotypes are probably also of Middle Eastern origin. The smallest theoretical haplotype group has one member in the entire human population. There could be individuals in this sample who belong to such haplotype groups, and we will never be able to figure out where their maternal ancestor came from.</p>
<p>It's important to understand that the conclusions of the Behar article are very preliminary, and that the authors themselves qualified their conclusions quite carefully. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetzenberg_43b3.html" title="User:Metzenberg">Metzenberg</a> 05:56, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. The proposition doesn't even make sense. Cohen is obviously very proud of his Jewish heritage and faith. Yet he couldn't possibly portray Kazakhstan in a more negative light. The whole point of his Borat character would seem to be the expose and contrast the tacit, low key yet no less despicable antisemitism that he proves the existence of in America, with its most outrageously open form in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. I'd say he chose Khasakstan to represent all these other countries due to its almost complete obscurity to westerners. Of course his portrayal of Kazakhstanis is completely inaccurate in every other possible way, and the anti-semitism is not nearly as hilarious, yet the ugly truth is that in countries such as Poland, Russia, the Ukraine, the Arab World etc..., though exagerated, the anti-semitism he ascribes to the Kazakhstanis may be exagerated, yet not nearly as exagerated as one might believe. Just take a look at the article on <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_libel_against_Jews_e798.html" title="Blood libel against Jews">blood libel against Jews</a> and you'll see the limitlessly absurd forms that antisemitism has taken in history.

<dd>The current scholarship, which is summarized in the article, suggests that while Jews were established in the western Roman Empire, their communities remained only in small numbers after the western Roman Empire collapsed. The Judaism that became established north of the Alps in Ashkenaz was heavily influenced by Middle Eastern and Babylonian Jewish culture. The early Ashkenazim were some of the greatest scholars of the Torah and Talmud, carrying on traditions established outside of the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> in <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon.html" title="Babylon">Babylon</a>. The earlier point of view that Ashkenazi Jews were from the Roman Empire is still partly true, but it is partly wishful thinking on the part of European Jews. At least up to the 20th century, many westernized Ashkenazi Jews wanted to consider themselves more European. An excellent summary of Middle Eastern influence on Judaism is the collective opus of books and articles by Bernard Lewis. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetzenberg_43b3.html" title="User:Metzenberg">Metzenberg</a> 03:29, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is no difference, from a Jewish perspective, between converting to Islam and converting to Christianity. A Jew who converts to Islam becomes a Muslim, yet he remains in some sense a Jew. Judaism is universal in stressing that all righteous peoples have a place in the world to come, and that all monotheistic faiths worship the same God. I cannot pretend that I speak for anyone but myself on this, but it should come as no surprise that Judaism isn't for everyone who was born Jewish. Surely there are those who were born Jewish for whom Islam provides a better path. A former Jew who becomes Muslim and later decides to return to Judaism can do so, and a rabbi would help him through the process by performing a return ceremony rather than a conversion. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetzenberg_43b3.html" title="User:Metzenberg">Metzenberg</a> 02:52, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article suffers from the same problem most articles on Jewish groups suffer from: It keeps trying to retroactively apply 19th century ideas back through time and make Jewish religious labels (and Jewishness itself) into "ethnic" designations rather than religious one. Ashkenazi is not an ethnic label, it is a religious and to a lesser extent grographic one. Sammy Davis Jr. was Ashkenazi. If he moved to Iran and married a Sephardic Persian Jewish wife, their children would have been Ashkenazi. If their son did the same thing, their children would be Ashkenazi. And if his son and his son and his son, for ten thousand generations did the same thing, the child would have been Ashkenazi. He would be Ashkenazi despite the fact he's the offspring of 10,000 Persian women and the 10,000 sons of Persian Jewish women and his only Ashkenazi ancestor was the black guy from the rat pack. Now comes the ultimate kicker. Not only were all those sons Ashkenazi, so were there wives once they married them. A wife becomes Ashkenazi or Sephardic with her husband. Doesn't make sense from an ethnic perspective, and that's because it is not a title of an ethnic group but a religious one. 88.153.142.83 01:17, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, I have to point out another horrible anachronism. Even in the section on Religious definitions, someone inserted nonsense phrases like "ethnic sephardi." There is no such thing as an ethnic Sephardi, espescially in a religious context. The daughter of the Ashkenazi wonder rabbi Yehudah HaLevi who married a Sephardi rabbi became Sephardi as soon as the wedding was done. Can someone explain to me how she changed ethnicity? Or how a blond Dutch Sephardi is the same ethnicity as a Morrocan Sephardi? Also, and here comes the king of terrible anachronisms, someone contrasted Sephardim with Mizrchim in the religious section. Ahhhhh!!!! Mizrachi as a title for Eastern Jewry is a modern Israeli political designation. Religiously they are Sephardim. No, they never lived on the Iberian peninsula anymore than Hungarian Ashkenazim lived in Germany, nevertheless religiously they are Sephardim. 88.153.142.83 01:40, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sounds like you have some knowledge about this. Why don't you get a log-in, so you can come back here and we will know who you are, and start contributing. But first, please do actually read the article as it is now written. There is absolutely nothing in the article about "ethnic sephardi" so you must be imagining something. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetzenberg_43b3.html" title="User:Metzenberg">Metzenberg</a> 11:56, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here is the quote. "In this respect, the counterpart of Ashkenazi is Sephardic, since most non-Ashkenazi Orthodox Jews follow Sephardic rabbinical authorities, whether or not they are ethnically Sephardic." Like I said, one cannot be ethnically sephardi. It's not an ethnic designation, but a religious one. 82.81.103.16 08:45, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dude, you're trying to split hairs. In the early 20th century, there were <a href="../../../l/a/d/Ladino.html" title="Ladino">Ladino</a> speaking communities in the Balkans, Greece, and Turkey. "Ethnically sephardic" in this context refers to such groups, which until around 1950 had in-married just as the Ashkenazim had. In addition, the majority of Jews of Morocco and North Africa were also of Sephardic ancestry. How about we say, "of Sephardic ancestry." Would that be kobesedek? --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetzenberg_43b3.html" title="User:Metzenberg">Metzenberg</a> 09:30, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the graphic on the right, why is Germany listed seperately from the European Union? I understand if one wants to point out the current Ashkenazi population in Germany, but I find the double-listing slightly misleading. Perhaps Germany should be listed as a subitem under European Union.</p>

<p>The box at the top right estimates there are 3.7 million Askenazi Jews in Israel, which would account for 70% of the 5.4 million Jewish population of Israel. Contradicting this, the section 'Modern history' states that Ashkenazis account for "probably less than half of Israeli Jews".</p>
<p>A further comment: The article repeatedly contrasts <i>Ashkenazim</i> with <i>Sephardim</i>, which is misleading and inaccurate. Sephardis are just one of many non-Ashkenazi Jewish groups. Others are Yemenite, Iraqi and non-Ashkenazi Italian Jews as well as Greek <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romaniotes.html" title="Romaniotes">Romaniotes</a>. Although an inclusive definition of <i>Sephardi</i> is commonly in use in popular parlance, this article should strive for greater accuracy. <a href="../../../r/c/s/User%7ERCSB_30e1.html" title="User:RCSB">RCSB</a> 15:00, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
