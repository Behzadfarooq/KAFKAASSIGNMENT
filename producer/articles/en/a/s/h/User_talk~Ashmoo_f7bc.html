<p>Are you planning on listing all of the countries in which Tim Tams are sold? I suspect you'll be looking at dozens.

<dd>My impression was there are only a small number of countries where they are sold. It seemed as relevant as the paragraph about England and which shops they are sold in. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmoo_727a.html" title="User:Ashmoo">Ashmoo</a> 7 July 2005 23:21 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, ok. I would've taken out the bit about which shops in the UK had I noticed it then too! It's not as rare as you'd think, though -- Campbell Soup owns Arnotts now, so they're available in at least some of Campbell's markets (at least Canada, the US, and the UK, and I suspect throughout Europe but I can't confirm that.) Apparently the AU-IL trade relationship is <a href="http://www.austrade.gov.au/overseas/layout/0,,0_S3-1_3z6-2_-3_PWB110452173-4_-5_-6_-7_,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.austrade.gov.au/overseas/layout/0,,0_S3-1_3z6-2_-3_PWB110452173-4_-5_-6_-7_,00.html" rel="nofollow">remarkable</a>, though, so I'll resign myself to marvelling that people do Tim Tam Slams with things other than liqueurs and port. — <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMendel_e2b1.html" title="User:Mendel">mendel</a> <a href="../../../m/e/n/User_talk%7EMendel_d73b.html" title="User talk:Mendel">☎</a> July 8, 2005 01:24 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm surprised that they are available in Canada &amp; the US. If they are widely available I'd support removing the comments about the UK &amp; Israel. Or maybe just making a list of countries where they are sold. The whole article is a bit trivial though, so I'm not going to get too worked up about it. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmoo_727a.html" title="User:Ashmoo">Ashmoo</a> 8 July 2005 01:38 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been watching over the Aisha article. Your removal of that sentence is fine with me. It was there because Stevertigo came and made extensive modifications and got quite upset if they were removed or changed. I didn't dare remove his bit re "marriage age as part of attack on Muhammad"; I just copyedited it a little.

Come to think of it, that paragraph and the mention of Gary Miller, even though it claims to be response, is in actuality not a response to any criticism but an ad hominem attack on Christianity - outside the scope of the article. Do you agree? Just as a note to you, your edits to the Criticism of Islam page have in general have been very helpful, and you are right that much of the article is/was nothing more than Islamic apolagetics.

<p>Thanks for your rationale, I think that I understand it now. Even though Gary Miller's argument is logically fallable, it is still appropriate for inclusion if it is (not surprisingly) what Muslims say, and responses to that still have to be sourced.

<p>That was me what wrote that, and it was a fair cop. The problem is that there's a huge literature on the human urge to find pattern, but I couldn't find anything to quote that was either broad enough, or talking about textual analysis specifically. A lot of it is on visual pattern perception -- like the tendency to see faces in things. I'm sure the right quote is out there, if I could just find the right search terms. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 04:22, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your comment. It is really sad to see some people unjustly forge materials. Thanks for the example. I remember once I saw strange commandments attributed to <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionism</a> somewhere; maybe they belonged to the same document. I don't know. I personally don't like the <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">zionism</a> thought since the land belonged to the Jews over 3200 years ago. Their thought is not justified to me simply by the Golden Rule. But this does not in any case justify, and even it is disgusting, that some people accept a forgery just because they like it to be in that way. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 02:39, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a cavalry tactic where a small group of very heavy cavalry rides in front and others behind. Their aror protects them against enemy fire while they fire themselves.</p>
<p>In Nuremberg armor was tested by squarely shooting at it with a crossbow. if there was just a mark and the armor was not penetrated, it was sold as first class product and the mark was a sign of quality. Few knights were able to afford it.</p>
<p>Crossbows carried by knights were small versions totally out of metall. before metall was avaiable in such amounts the crossbow was to clumsy for riders.</p>

<p>Hello, Ashmoo, thank you for your help on the new "It!" page. I remember seeing "it (!)" at the cinema as a child, and I was mostly intrigued about the information given about the Golem. An online essay on the Golem points out that this film is the only English language film in times past that featured the Golem.

<p>You asked for citations on two topics. The first one was for the idea that many studies have been done demonstrating naltrexone to be of questionable value in supporting abstinance. Since the statement says "many" I assume you want more than one. How many would you like? Here's a quick list:</p>

<p>I could probably provide about a dozen more. How many do you feel is sufficient?</p>
<p>Also, you requested citation for "For those who don't understand the mechanism involved, these results have been assumed to reflect the effectiveness of the two treatments in combination.". I'm not sure what you're asking for for this. A physician's opinion survey performed by someone like Reuters? This information was gathered in an unofficial manner, having discussed the issue with a couple dozen or so medical professionals regarding their professional associate's thoughts on the matter. Do you feel that this needs rephrasing?</p>
<p>I also noticed that you had a problem with "This logic is faulty because it assumes that the two treatments are merely complementary, like two people pushing a car, as opposed to sequential, like turning a doorknob and then pulling on it.", stating that it is "POV demagogic unsourced comment". I'll take these three up with you on the discussion page for Alcoholism.</p>
