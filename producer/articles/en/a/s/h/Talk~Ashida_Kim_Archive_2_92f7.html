<p>All those e-mails I sent you BEGGING for page protection and this is how you address the issue? By pretending it wasn't me? Just consider the illogic of that! Who would want to be me? And who would ask for nothing except a little common consideration? Here I am again, doing what you ask, trying to play by your rules, coming to your talk page to give you more attention. But, no matter what I do or say, you refuse to protect my page so my friends cannot be stalked. You and your ilk are all just trolls who have no decency whatsoever. You just want to play games hiding behind your silly "policies." I hope someone does this to you someday and you get to enjoy the frustration you inflict on me and others. I pray that all who come to your sick site will see that you are just another bunch of trash and bash liars who have never done anything of value and are so jealous of anyone who has that you would rather believe and publish lies about them than speak the truth. I ask you for the fifth time, as politely and respectfully as I can in light of your tacky behavior, to protect my page or remove it.</p>

<dd>I haven't had any emails from anyone claiming to be <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashida_Kim_6a74.html" title="Ashida Kim">Ashida Kim</a> in several months now, sorry. If you are really Kim and you honestly didn't anticipate the fact that the martial art business is dangerous to the (obviously) unprepared before you published your voluminous claims of mystical martial superiority, then I'm afraid I probably can't help you. You have a funny, rude way of threatening, insulting and <i>then</i> cajoling in order to try and get your way, and it isn't going to work. Politeness and respect are non-negotiable requirements here. I have always met you halfway, and again, if you behave yourself and watch your mouth, I will try to help you. If you continue to verbally abuse and threaten me and the other editors here, you are on your own, as simple as that. I will not protect the Ashida Kim page because, in my judgment, there is no reason to. You may be able to find another administrator to do so, however. If you don't want to behave well and still want the Ashida Kim page deleted, log on to your account at User:Ashida Kim and submit it to <a href="../../../a/f/d/AfD_0ef6.html" title="AfD">AfD</a> yourself. On a professional note, if you are afraid that people are out to get revenge on you, don't expect too much sympathy from a traditional <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_martial_arts.html" title="Chinese martial arts">Chinese martial arts</a> instructor. We are taught and teach strict <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confucian.html" title="Confucian">confucian</a> virtues, holding that such fear is the natural product of living an unrighteous life, and that if someone else solves these problems for you then you won't learn anything from the lesson (because that is what it is, didn't you know?) to the betterment of your character. It is very simple to avoid the problems you describe ahead of time with some common sense before the fact.

<p>I too have had the same sort of attacks made against me on my own site by these trolls. But, I say again, that is not the issue. The issue is that your entry has been and can be again easily, used by the trolls to publish the addresses of my friends and put them in danger from real fighter(not all of them are honorable nor nice but care for the quality of the martial arts) who are looking to beat me up. Been through all of this on the Discussion page already. Please don't ask me to repeat it. You will see that no matter what I say, they just twist it and come back for more. It is obvious they are malevolent vandals(so said you). But I ask again, why is it so importanat for you to keep up an entry that serves no purpose but to bash me? You set yourself up Even now it "damns me with faint praise." No that is called Brown Nosing. Good or bad, Ashida Kim, you and your cult will always set yourselves up for bashing.</p>

<p>Has any of the people from Bullshido given any proof of these allegations? They have the document that you have sign stated that person was a black belt in Vale Tudo. Vale Tudo has no ranking system like Tae kwon do or Karate. Vale Tudo, Muay Thai and other similar systems have no such belts for many years and you have no right to add your own belt system without their permission. Have they shown you these proofs of their claims? yes</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I see nothing on the article that is untrue. Speaking of proof, has Kim ever answered the question of who awarded him his black belts? No He has not.</p>

<p>Does the Death to duality a figement of Ashida Kim's imagination? Yes Does anyone have any sources they can refer too where Ashida Kim mentions this in his books? No</p>
<p>"That placing one's palm on the opponent's chest brings death to duality."</p>
<p>"I have practically all of Master Kim's books (the ones from the 70's and 80's anyway) and I've never heard of death to duality before. The closest thing I can think of is that there's a dim hsueh point somewhere on the chest which is explained in 'Ninja Death Touch'. But that's barely related to this death to duality thing. So I have no idea what the guy was thinking when he initially wrote the article with 'Death to Duality' in it." -The IP Guy.</p>

<dd>As I recall, the phrase was put in the article by User:Ashida Kim himself a few months back to answer some of the critical statements made about his claims.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Original research</span></h2>
<p>I've removed the section which speculates on Ashida Kim's identity. The only references it provided were to a forum, which I don't think we can consider to be a reliable secondary source. In my opinion, this is original research by proxy.

<dd>Even if all of us go and verify the copyright information, it's still original research. Copyright records are a primary source, and using them to infer Ashida Kim's identity is a novel interpretaion of that information. If a reliable secondary source (e.g. a martial arts magazine, the New York Times) were to publish this speculation about Kim's identity, then we could include it in the article. <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPburka_537f.html" title="User:Pburka">Pburka</a> 03:25, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've removed the section once more. I am convinced that this is original research. Although the research may not have been done expressly for Wikipedia, it has not "been published by a reputable publication", as required by <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Furthermore, the article on bullshido.net which reveals this information explicitly references Wikipedia and the recent AfD, making it look suspiciously like this research was, in fact, done with the intent of publishing it in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPburka_537f.html" title="User:Pburka">Pburka</a> 15:28, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think that it was published specifically for inclusion here (The Bullshido crew have been going around with Ashida Kim for several years now), but I would indeed like to see some citations for the info provided from other verifiable sources. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFire_Star_28a1.html" title="User:Fire Star">Fire Star</a> 15:50, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The article in question was researched by an attorney who used the services of a local professional investigator. The research is as solid as you're going to get, and I'm not sure why it would be removed. Wikipedia is not one of our primary concerns at Bullshido, and the article was written exclusively to put the proverbial nail in the coffin of this guy's already dubious credibility. As such, I feel the section should be included, but as I am an interested party I'll leave it up to another editor to replace. --<a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhrost_6b8d.html" title="User:Phrost">Phrost</a> 21:46, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is not a matter of whether the information is correct or not. "Truth" is too big a concept for a little project like Wikipedia. All we try to do is summarize verifable information in an NPOV manner. The trouble with this info is that it is not verifiable using <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">wikipedia:reliable sources</a>. If a more mainstream and accountable source, like a magazine or newspaper, gave Kim's real name then we could certainly include it. However Bullshido does not count as a reliable source. I am disturbed that you say the article was written as an attack on Kim's credibility. All of our articles should be NPOV and not written with an intent to harm their subjects. Please see the <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">wikipedia:five pillars</a> to find our core principles.

<dd>Generally speaking, I agree with you. This is an exception, as Bullshido is not exclusively a web forum but it also posts articles, similar to how Slashdot, Boingboing, deviantART, Fark, Kuro5hin, or any number of websites publish or redistribute news and then allow their community to provide instant feedback. The bulk of the information provided within the Bullshido article does appear to be reliable, as it can be verified by a number of different private and public databases. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHall_Monitor_050f.html" title="User:Hall Monitor">Hall Monitor</a> 19:46, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ashida's revenge</span></h2>
<p>First is Ashida Kim giving out the owner of Wikipedia's personal info on his forum. <a href="http://p206.ezboard.com/fashidakimmessageboardsfrm2" class="external autonumber" title="http://p206.ezboard.com/fashidakimmessageboardsfrm2" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>Second is Ashida Kim telling his forum that Bullshido is really a rival ninja clan (run by Stephen K. Hayes) out to take away his business: <a href="http://p206.ezboard.com/fashidakimmessageboardsfrm2.showMessage?topicID=560.topic" class="external autonumber" title="http://p206.ezboard.com/fashidakimmessageboardsfrm2.showMessage?topicID=560.topic" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>Third is Ashida Kim's correspondence with The Church of Satan in 1994. Starting with a letter from a girl named Judy W. who Ashida Kim has bullied and threatened to join his Black Dragon ninja clan. Next is the letter from Ashida Kim where he brags how he kicked Haye's students butts. Brags that he became a ninja by "beating people up". Writes how he could have killed Stephen K. Hayes with his death touch. Makes claims that he can stop his heart at will and become invisible. Finally are Stephen K. Hayes responses. <a href="http://apodion.com/vad/article.php?id=&amp;aid=47" class="external autonumber" title="http://apodion.com/vad/article.php?id=&amp;aid=47" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>Kenpo Tom 16:23, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wow. The modern martial arts business is a fraud magnet, as sleazy as any other subjective arena.

<dd>I wouldn't worry about the threats too much, it's mostly hot air. Immediately after publishing our research on Kim's identity (performed by an Attorney and private investigator no less), Radford/Kim poted to his forums that he'd be coming for us and "wouldn't be shooting pictures". Fortunately, I haven't been shot by Ninjas lately. --<a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhrost_6b8d.html" title="User:Phrost">Phrost</a> 21:41, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ashida's website was "suspended" by a webhost called "vDeck." There is no reason given for the suspension, but because of this, ashidakim and dojomaster were taken down. That only left one article left, which was nothing but criticism. So we could be NPOV, I removed all links. I know this is not a good time to do such an act, but we just cannot host dead links. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zach</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 07:48, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Kim claims</span></h2>
<p>It strikes me that 2/3 of this article is comprised of claims by the subject and discussion of those claims. If we remove the claims and the $10k challenge there are only four sentences.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Ashida Kim is the pseudonym of a controversial Florida-based American martial arts teacher and author best known for his books on ninjitsu training published during the 1970s and 1980s. Kim promotes himself as the leader of the Black Dragon Fighting Society form of Koga Ryu ninjitsu. Kim is not known to be recognized by any official Japanese martial arts scholar or organization. Kim offers mail-order black belt programs in a belt factory fashion.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>With some additional copyediting and NPOVing, would this make a more succinct, NPOV article? -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 08:31, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why would you remove his claims, though? The fact that he claims these things is completely verifiable, and it's part of what makes him notable. Would you remove <a href="../../../s/o/l/Sollog.html" title="Sollog">Sollog</a>'s claims? And how could simply documenting a person's notable claims possibly violate NPOV? Obviously, any <i>comments</i> made regarding those claims would have to be very carefully phrased so as to be NPOV, but that's what we're here for.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshenai_4e13.html" title="User:Ashenai">Ashenai</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshenai_68df.html" title="User talk:Ashenai">talk</a>) 09:59, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As I said before, the websites that posts these claims were taken down by the web server that hosted Ashida's website. But, as always, we could state what he claimed to do and see if it was true, what it was said it about, and as pointed out at the AFD, maybe post a book review or two. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zach</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 17:10, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I protest the recent edits by Zscout370 while this page is under protection. The decision to "remove" the dead links exceeds the accepted norms for allowable edits while the page is under protection. The decision to remove the remaining live link was an editorial decision that reflects one individual admin's (incorrect) perception of NPOV. -<a href="../../../o/%5E/o/User%7EO%5EO_8499.html" title="User:O^O">O^O</a> 16:54, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>With the only link that was present was [<a href="http://www.bullshido.net/modules.php?name=Reviews&amp;file=viewreview&amp;id=160" class="external free" title="http://www.bullshido.net/modules.php?name=Reviews&amp;file=viewreview&amp;id=160" rel="nofollow">http://www.bullshido.net/modules.php?name=Reviews&amp;file=viewreview&amp;id=160</a>, which is very critical of Ashida. Because of that, if I left that link remain, I would be people telling me I have an anti-Ashida bias. So, to be fair, I removed all the external linkls, including to Bullshido. If his website gets back online, sure, they can go back in. Plus, the main reason why this is protected because of the recent spree of vandalism and a request of the talk page of this article. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zach</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 17:16, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Zscout370, with all due respect, once a page is protected there are very limited edits that should be done. Those are primarily inserting tags such as NPOV or AFD, or reverting to a pre-controversy version. I think it is appropriate to remove dead links once the page is unprotected, but not during. -<a href="../../../o/%5E/o/User%7EO%5EO_8499.html" title="User:O^O">O^O</a> 17:27, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Then I apologize for my mess up. Now, the external links look fine and I added the listing of the books that he wrote. Good job on adding the link to his forum, since that is his only (?) website that remains up. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zach</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 17:42, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are enough people paying attention to the article now that I think we can relax a bit about vandalism.

<dd>Reword it until it's NPOV. It is what Ashida Kim has on his website why he must have the $10,000 challenge.

<dd>At one time I had a link on this article to Wayne Muramoto's article: <a href="http://www.koryu.com/library/wmuromoto4.html" class="external text" title="http://www.koryu.com/library/wmuromoto4.html" rel="nofollow">Real or Fake? Is Your Martial Arts School Legitimate?</a> but it was removed. A relevant quote to the issue of traditional Japanese martial arts organisations is as below:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"The Internet, although it's a source of cheap frauds, is also a great resource for networking. Various discussion groups will be able to put you in touch with people who can give you frank opinions about nearly any martial arts organization in the US. There are discussion groups for karate, aikido, iaido, and jujutsu. Post a question about a group and you will get a lot of replies from nearly anyone who has an opinion about it in a few days, if not hours.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The koryu (ancient martial arts) are a bit harder to ferret out, which is why you will find more fakes, frauds and truthshavers here than in, say, Shotokan karate. For one thing, most of the literature remains in Japanese, and there aren't that many practitioners in America who can go back to the original source materials easily. How do you know if Master Joe Bob is really a teacher of some ancient swordfighting art called Tenshin Shoden Shinkage Shinto Booga Booga-ryu?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Again, obtain as much information as you can on your visit to the dojo. Then try to find resource material that corroborates or deny the claims. I know they're going to hate me for giving 'em more work to do, but besides the above mentioned books and Internet groups, there are several individuals who can help you, if they're not too busy. Hugh F. Davey of the Shudokan Martial Arts Association maintains strong connections with legitimate credential-giving authorities in Japan. Diane and Meik Skoss of Koryu Books were/are members of several koryu arts and study groups in Japan for several years. Now relocated in the continental US, they are a prime resource of information. Kim Taylor, who puts out the laido Newsletter, teaches at the University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada, and sponsors several sword and iaido seminars, is also a good source. All of these people can be found by searching the Internet for their web sites and/or discussion groups.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>People like the Skosses and Kim Taylor, etc. are becoming more important, because the frauds themselves are organizing into their own legitimizing groups. To lend an air of authenticity, some groups are banding together and awarding each other tenth degree black belts. So then they legitimize each other's fakery. If you check out such individual instructors against their self-serving groups, you may be put under the impression that they're legitimate, unless you hunt the Internet and contact other people not connected with them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If it is a koryu, nine times out of ten the style should be listed in the Bugei Ryuha Daijiten, a compendium of martial arts systems put together by Watatani Kiyoshi and Yamada Tadashi. This book is over 1,000 pages of small type and has yet to be fully translated into English, and obtaining an out-of-print copy in Kanda, Tokyo, would set you back several hundred dollars. But it sits on the bookshelf of most bilingual researchers, and anytime someone asks me an obscure question about koryu lineage, it's the first book I pull out.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another warning sign that your style may be fake is if you ask about lineage, and the teacher or the senior students put you off, saying you're not ready for such secret knowledge. Japanese society is notorious for its mountains of paperwork, and all legitimate martial ryu (styles) were assiduously recorded and documented in some kind of provincial or clan record. Watatani and Yamada assembled all the known references together into compiling several thousands of ryu listing. If the koryu is not listed in the Bugei Ryuha Daijiten, I'd be very suspicious.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One word of warning, though. All the books on the shelves of your local chain bookstore may not be equally legitimate. As a longtime journalist, I've run into cases where people believe anything that's been printed, because it's printed. That's not true. Even the most sincere writers can make honest errors in accuracy. And with mass media and the fast buck being so omnipresent, books, magazines and the Internet are flooded with frauds of all kinds, not just in martial arts. Books have been printed on glossy stock with fancy photographs that, to my eyes, are full of crap (pardon the expression, but that's my gut reaction to some of the stuff I see).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Someone once sent me a book about his teacher and style, perhaps to make me aware of this "unique individual." What I saw, however, was a carefully orchestrated con game foisted on that admirer and the rest of the students; a con game perpetrated for decades through a masterful use of obscurity, oriental stereotypes and misunderstanding of Japanese history."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The lineage claimed by Ashida Kim seems to me to follow the last paragraph pretty closely. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFire_Star_28a1.html" title="User:Fire Star">Fire Star</a> 00:55, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As mentioned above, it's been nominated twice and was kept both times by a clear consensus. Ashida Kim isn't attacked in his article, his eccentric past and marketing claims (and counter-claims) are simply documented. Some people will think that makes him look like a mercenary fraud, other people will think that makes him look like a paranoid casualty of the 1960s who lives in a fantasy world of his own making, yet others will think that he is the invincible great-grand-master of all things ninja. That is up to the reader. If you have something to add to the article, something that will stand up to the standards of verifiability, then please do so.

<p>Yeah anon is right man there are billions of fraud martial arts instructors all over the USA. Ashida Kim is not as famous as Bruce Leee but in his hometown he is just another master. after all,we dont know what crap Frank Dux taught for people to call him a fraud.</p>
<p>I don't know anything about a true ninja,there is no evidence that they are descendants of yesteryears ninja and much of their history is documented orally.</p>
<p>Still,I am curious as to why only Ashida Kim's page was put up when there are several other teachers? Could Jimmy Wales please verify my question?</p>

<dd>As I understand it, the main reason he was deemed notable in the AfD was his published works.
