<p>How about inserting the page into the Asheville, North Carolina page? The school has over a hundred years of history with the small city.</p>

<p>Alright so I've been learning how to write using MediaWiki Markup and have finally committed to writing an Asheville School article. I will do my best to make this page into a Featured Article one day. If you who know the ways of Wikipedia better than I could give me pointers and feedback, I'd be much obliged. Thanks alot.

<p>And BTW I believe these "criticisms" were introduced by someone who listed a porn model as a notable alum... <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.76.228.3.html" title="User:67.76.228.3">67.76.228.3</a> 21:13, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK, that's fine...I won't argue that "It's important for every article to have a criticisms section (where applicable)" but I would argue that these criticisms are completely irrelevant to an encyclopedia article.</p>
<p>I mean the criticism is that the rules are strict, that they can't use instant messengers...yadda yadda yadda...I don't think petty student complaints have a role here.</p>
<p>FYI I'm an alumnus of the Asheville School. Teens always complain about rules...they did in my day (early 90s), they do now. I'm sure they did 100 years ago.</p>
<p>It's just not valid.</p>
<p>And FYI, my less then friendly reaction to you was your opening a dialog with me with a THREAT. Altering an article is not vandalism. And also aren't you supposed to be nice to noobs?</p>
<p><a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.76.228.3.html" title="User:67.76.228.3">67.76.228.3</a> 21:12, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's important for every article to have a criticisms section (where applicable). For example, <a href="../../../d/a/p/Daphnia.html" title="Daphnia">Daphnia</a> probably wouldn't need a criticisms section, but this article does. Removal of the criticisms section can get you banned as making either POV edits or removing content. --<a href="../../../m/1/s/User%7EM1ss1ontomars2k4_d48d.html" title="User:M1ss1ontomars2k4">M1ss1ontom</a><a href="../../../m/1/s/User%7EM1ss1ontomars2k4_Esperanza_41c3.html" title="User:M1ss1ontomars2k4/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../m/1/s/User%7EM1ss1ontomars2k4_d48d.html" title="User:M1ss1ontomars2k4">rs2k4</a> | <a href="../../../m/1/s/User_talk%7EM1ss1ontomars2k4_b66e.html" title="User talk:M1ss1ontomars2k4">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_M1ss1ontomars2k4_ef71.html" title="Special:Contributions/M1ss1ontomars2k4">C</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_M1ss1ontomars2k4_0011.html" title="Special:Emailuser/M1ss1ontomars2k4">@</a> 22:35, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please don't be a [expletive deleted] and make threats please. I just wanted to discuss the issue. The criticism portion is a complaint about school rules, that's irrelevant for an encyclopedia entry. Have criticism is fine, but these criticisms are not valid for an encyclopedic entry, and further are a POV.</p>
<p>Every school has rules, do complaints of the rules belong an encyclopedia?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes. It is valid criticism of the school.

Unless there have been drastic changes since I was there I think it would be hard to make the argument that AS is "one of the strictest private schools in the United States".</p>
<p>It is a private boarding school and it is expected to be far more rigorous then other types of schools, both for academics and discipline. But as these types of schools go it's actually quite lax.</p>
<p>So they don't let you use IM...that's not really egregious or anything. I mean if they were locking students in their rooms, maybye that would be a criticism. But as I recall we had quite a bit of freedom and perks for upperclassmen.</p>
<p>Maybye I'm getting old but I just think putting these kinds of gripes on wikipedia is kinda infantile.</p>
<p>As for tuition, it is my understanding that it actually costs about twice what is charged in tuition for each student...but it is covered via a trust fund and other forms of fund raising. It is a good education and a good experience IMO...my first two years of college were cake after AS. <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.76.228.3.html" title="User:67.76.228.3">67.76.228.3</a> 03:11, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

As a recent graduate myself, I hope you will not take the wildly exagerrated accusations of my former schoolmate seriously. I was a member of the Honor Council, the prefect/proctor system, and the Student Council Vice-President, and I fully disagree with his claims made on behalf of all the organizations of which he was never a part. I would vote that you delete the Criticisms section, as it is only an outlet that some people choose to take to voice their minority discontent on the internet and then claim to be self-righteous in doing so.68.187.201.226 02:36, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Brand new to WP--sorry if I've used improper procedure, but I wanted to document the fact that I deleted a Notable Alum--Dave Cheadle, who actually went to Asheville High, not Asheville School. I also added one, Charles Ries.</p>
<p>I later deleted an entry for John Currin, who was first listed as a Fly fisherman and musician, then later changed to U.S. congressman, then changed to US Ambassador to Jamaica. We do have a alumnus John Currin, who may or may not be a fly fisherman and/or musician. My apologies if the original entry was factual; the subsequent changes prompted me to delete the whole entry.</p>
