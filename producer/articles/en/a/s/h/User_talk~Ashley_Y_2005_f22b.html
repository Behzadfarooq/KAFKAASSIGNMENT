<dd>I encountered Robert in late November. At that time I would often go to his talk page via the user page (which was empty) to try to dissuade him from being so rude. I inserted a placeholder there for my own convenience. Later on I wikified some of the emails that he was most fond of quoting, in the hope that he would take the hint and start quoting the Wikilinks instead of the full text. He didn't seem to mind. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 11:46, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why did you add stroking and fluttering to Meissner's corpuscle? I specifically stated in the talk page why I didn't include those in my rewrite. In case you didn't notice, your original addition of these points caused a debate which is still ongoing. Are you purposely fueling the fire? Unless you have some compelling reason, I will be reverting your change. --<a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJag123_5e35.html" title="User:Jag123">jag123</a> 16:38, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm pretty happy with Jakew's last edit myself. —<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Y_1ca2.html" title="User:Ashley Y">Ashley Y</a> 03:29, 2005 Feb 1 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm glad you're happy with Jakew's last edit. When someone removes something from an article and states his/her reasons why, the decent thing to do is usually explain why you'll be changing it again. You haven't done that before changing the article, nor when I asked on the talk page and still fail to do it here. Considering that most of the debate that is occuring on Robert's RfA involves your additions to the articles, your lack of concern in keeping the peace (or even making an effort) is disappointing. Futhermore, since you can't provide any reasons for your changes, I can't help but think that your edit is in fact POV, and at this point, only serves to anger pro-circumcision activists. In case you didn't realise, the uncertainty in the POV of your addition was an important issue in order to prove that Robert was acting unreasonably and you've just clarified that. He obviously knows you better than I. Your edits will be reverted. --<a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJag123_5e35.html" title="User:Jag123">jag123</a> 03:54, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, "pro-circumcision activist" Jakew didn't seem to be angered since he added to my edit. As for the RfA on Robert, I trust that will stand or fall on its merits. If you're looking to see me edit in a certain way for the purposes of finagling that somehow then I really can't help you. —<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Y_1ca2.html" title="User:Ashley Y">Ashley Y</a> 04:07, 2005 Feb 1 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm sure Jakew bit his tongue. Unlike you, he appears more interested in having a neutral article than reverting and causing more problems. The problems caused from your previous edit aren't even over and you're doing it again. It's completely mind-boggling. You're right, you can't help me; you obviously are editing articles with a POV. --<a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJag123_5e35.html" title="User:Jag123">jag123</a> 04:16, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't understand why you want these two articles to be merged. While I agree that both drinks have very similar ingredients, that is where the similarity ends. On top of the different proportions of the main ingredients, and the obviously different names, they have distinct cultural histories. For these reasons I believe that the negative effects of a merger would considerably outweigh the positive. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarruthers_b97e.html" title="User:Carruthers">Carruthers</a> 14:57, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm a bit confused about the way you want to organize the categories. I think that many of the articles in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parasitology.html" title="Parasitology">parasitology</a> are not about parasites, and should not be listed as such:</p>
<ol>
<li>parasitologists are all in a subcategory of parasitology but aren't parasites themselves</li>
<li>medicines for treating parasites (e.g. <a href="../../../f/u/m/Fumagillin.html" title="Fumagillin">Fumagillin</a>) and concepts relating to parasites (e.g. <a href="../../../f/e/c/Fecal-oral_route.html" title="Fecal-oral route">fecal-oral route</a>) aren't parasites but are parasitological subjects</li>
</ol>
<p>It seems to me that either the category needs to be redesigned, or parasites needs to be a subcategory of parasitology, not vice-versa. If I'm missing something, let me know.</p>

<dd>The idea is that parasitology is the study of parasites. There's a broader discussion of the proper relationship between subject and "study of" categories <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Categorization#.22X.22_and_.22study_of_X.22_categories" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Categorization#.22X.22_and_.22study_of_X.22_categories" rel="nofollow">here</a>, which you might be interested in contributing to. —<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Y_1ca2.html" title="User:Ashley Y">Ashley Y</a> 05:47, 2005 Jun 18 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I took a look, and I'm still not convinced. Do you have your own reasons for putting parasitology under parasites? <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarry491_9990.html" title="User:Harry491">Dave</a> <a href="../../../h/a/r/User_talk%7EHarry491_73d9.html" title="User talk:Harry491">(talk)</a> 12:19, Jun 18, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Ashley, I contributed to this article and keep an eye on it. Can you help me with getting a RfC or RfA on the <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominion_of_Melchizedek_2038.html" title="Dominion of Melchizedek">Dominion of Melchizedek</a> article? It might be good to have a woman there to help remove the bias. All I've tried to do is take from credible sources using parts that have some consensus and balancing some areas with the other side of the story. I gave up on that, and just started posting POV check at the top. That POV check is even considered vandalism by some that claim I have sock-puppets. As you can see I need help. I'll give you an example of something that needs balancing as I see it. An employee of the US OCC has been quoted as saying that DOM is illegal, whereas the offical web site of the US OCC only refers to DOM as an "unrecognized soverignty" that licensed a bank that may be operating illegally without permission in the USA, so I and another wikiuser tried to get consensus (even boldly editing) to add this fact, as a "however" following the employee's quoted statement. I also asked Jaxl for help on this today. Am I way off base here? Cordially,<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnski_87b6.html" title="User:Johnski">Johnski</a> 07:09, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
