<p>Hi AshLin,</p>
<p>I had to look up what Aurelian meant&#160;! There really is no coordinated effort on wikipedia for Indian Butterflies, but we do have a couple of people adding material that they bump into and it is not likely to change in a while. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirenVaz_d87d.html" title="User:VirenVaz">User:VirenVaz</a> is <b>the</b> main contributor. I would like to know a bit about Thomas Gay since I have come to be in the possession of some of his diaries with notes on the daily activities of Bulbuls and other birds around his home. Please email me Thanks <a href="../../../s/h/y/User%7EShyamal_ed48.html" title="User:Shyamal">Shyamal</a> 04:45, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi AshLin, I have contributed a wee bit to the butterfly section here in wikipedia. I generally like to rear a caterpillar before I put up info about its development. But that is a tedious long process and I'm rethinking that one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently, I try to maintain the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_butterflies_of_India_6511.html" title="List of butterflies of India">List of butterflies of India</a> list which I'm sure you seen already. These list are supposed to be india specific. In 4 out of the 5 families we has far fewer butterflies than we should. In Nymphalids we have too many. This is cos the list is for South Asia. I have been trying to whittle this list down and also find the missing butterflies from the other families.</li>
<li>I'd suggest you take up one family and try to complete the info. You've done some stuff here on papilionids so maybe you could complete that with whatever info you have.</li>
<li>Please remember that only the list is Indian. The species description is common to the world so look for butterfly description before starting a new article.</li>
<li>Images are very welcome. Upload them on commons and use them here. I am also trying to get people to give me images but thats not going too well since they insist on having the copyright within the picture which Wikipedia doesn't allow.</li>
<li>Lastly keep to the scientific names of species.</li>
</ul>
<p>Glad to have someone to help me.</p>

<ul>
<li>grin* I understand your confusion, I'd go as far as saying, u'd think I were daft. Yeah I rear the cats then put up information. One reason is the images. And yes I am a member of butterflyIndia. Each member there has different ideas about how to propagate information about indian butterflies. Few allow me to load images without their copyright within the image itself. So Shyamal and I have to wait to get images of the butterflies ourselves.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>The other reason is something related to what you have mentioned, "copyrights". I figured that if I had seen this behaviour myself and use the books as corroboration then I wouldnt be infringing on any copyrights.<br />
But as I mentioned previously I'm rethinking this process. --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirenVaz_d87d.html" title="User:VirenVaz">Viren</a> 08:41, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Great work. You could work directly on the main page. In case you are planning a draft version, the accepted practice is to make them under your user pages ...like...

<p>Yup. Awesome work. Finally we have a list with a number(87) closer to the 94 total paps in india. Great work AshLin. --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirenVaz_d87d.html" title="User:VirenVaz">Viren</a> 08:23, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Papilio seems to be the accepted genus name for most of the older genera names. See <a href="http://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/sci/bio/life/insecta/lepidoptera/ditrysia/papilionoidea/papilionidae/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/sci/bio/life/insecta/lepidoptera/ditrysia/papilionoidea/papilionidae/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>

<p>Hi AshLin, Princeps is now a junior synonym for Papilio. check <a href="http://internt.nhm.ac.uk/jdsml/perth/lepindex/detail.dsml?TaxonNo=167695.0&amp;UserID=&amp;UserName=&amp;" class="external autonumber" title="http://internt.nhm.ac.uk/jdsml/perth/lepindex/detail.dsml?TaxonNo=167695.0&amp;UserID=&amp;UserName=&amp;" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Suggest using this site to check the correct taxonomy for butterflies. In recent times a whole load has changed even at the family level. For eg. both nyms and lycs have had a lot of merging done. So the older material has to be changed to keep up with the current times. --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirenVaz_d87d.html" title="User:VirenVaz">Viren</a> 19:56, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Do you have images to go with the stubs (see for example <i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeps_arcturus.html" title="Princeps arcturus">Princeps arcturus</a></i> where there is a missing image in taxobox)? If you are not planning to upload images in the near future, it would be best to remove the image links from the stubs. <a href="../../../g/d/r/User_talk%7EGdr_e2ab.html" title="User talk:Gdr">Gdr</a> 14:03, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>AshLin, moving means that the current/old page is kept within the system and a redirect to the new page is put into it. Right on top of each page you should have the tabs article,discussion,edit,history,<b>move</b> and unwatch. It took me a very long time to notice this move option so make be I missed it or maybe it appeared after sometime. Please let me know if you have it. Another point, I'd suggesting leaving the pages with the genus name as Papilio and not moving them, reason being that later when you do do the recat/reclass work you will have to move these pages back. Finally if you do need the entries to evolve with the material you are using so that it makes your work easy then so be it. As long as the correct data appears soon I dont mind the journey. --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirenVaz_d87d.html" title="User:VirenVaz">Viren</a> 20:33, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>List looks good. stub for P.mayo has to be created. Changed the ones you asked for. These pages are essentially redirects to the Papilio pages. I have no power of deletion (No one does-deletion goes thru a process of voting) therefore I cannot delete the extra pages. Hope this suffices. Off to bed --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirenVaz_d87d.html" title="User:VirenVaz">Viren</a> 20:55, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi AshLin, noticed that some of the species pages already existed but in alternate names. Have made the new pages into redirect pages. Regarding status in taxoboxes, there is a standard list of possible flags. Moved the Saw-scaled viper image into the taxobox. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Tree_of_Life_taxobox_usage_fb59.html#Conservation_status" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Tree of Life/taxobox usage">Status flags</a> Please check the image i have added in <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pathysa_epaminondas.html" title="Pathysa epaminondas">Pathysa_epaminondas</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphium_antiphates.html" title="Graphium antiphates">Graphium antiphates</a>, obviously one is incorrect but I dont know which one.

<ul>
<li>I suggest correcting the taxonomic information first. Even before beefing up the stubs.</li>
<li>Before beefing up the stubs, I'd just like to say that these species specific pages are something that even amateur leps worldwide will be reading as well as editing so maybe the format should be somehting like the one for <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphium_sarpedon.html" title="Graphium sarpedon">Graphium sarpedon</a>. What say you.</li>
</ul>
<p>To correct taxonomic info I'd suggect the lepindex. I've given the link previously. It is also in the External links on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_butterflies_of_India_6511.html" title="List of butterflies of India">list of butterflies of India</a></p>

<p>When you start an article you need to say <i>what it is about</i>! So this opening is not very helpful to the casual reader:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Brown Gorgon</b> <i>Meandrusa sciron</i> is not known to be threatened.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This would be a much better opening:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The <b>Brown Gorgon</b>, <i>Meandrusa sciron</i>, is a species of <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swallowtail_butterfly.html" title="Swallowtail butterfly">swallowtail butterfly</a> native to <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>. It is not known to be threatened.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This tells the reader the most important fact first, and then the rest can be understood. <a href="../../../g/d/r/User_talk%7EGdr_e2ab.html" title="User talk:Gdr">Gdr</a> 13:02, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Whoops, I forgot to mention. When looking for images or uploading inmages, I'd suggest uploading onto wikimedia commons. This allows projects other than those on the english wikipedia to use them. And obviously to look for an image use commons first and then the english wikipedia. In commons follow the categories, that usually is the fastest method.</p>

<p>Bless you Ashwin, you might have seen the taxonomists and entomoligists list that I try to keep for using as links in wikipedia. This will help to give me some direction. In the taxobox when you put the name of the describer, make sure to link it to the correct wiki. --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirenVaz_d87d.html" title="User:VirenVaz">Viren</a> 19:02, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You might want to take a gander by <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirenVaz_Taxonomists_61be.html" title="User:VirenVaz/Taxonomists">Taxonomists/Lepidopterists</a>. The link is also on my user page. C &amp; R Felder are father and son. I dont think they have a wiki yet. I'll put it in in the evening (I'm at work now) Anyway the full names are in the list. Also try to put them down as C. Felder &amp; R.Felder date. So that each can be linked to his own page. --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirenVaz_d87d.html" title="User:VirenVaz">Viren</a> 04:06, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Wanted to add. When you find a taxonomist that is not there on my user page, please add it maintaining the order that is there.

<p>Hello AshLin, thanks for your <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Arthropods_9edc.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Arthropods">message</a>. To be honest, I thought <a href="../../../i/p/h/Iphiclides.html" title="Iphiclides">Iphiclides</a> was some kind of orphan page, forgotten by all and that my cleanup tag was in vain... Glad to have been proved wrong! You did some good work on it in remarquably little time, I must say.</p>
<p>Your work on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Butterflies_of_India_%28Papilionidae%29_2a69.html" title="List of Butterflies of India (Papilionidae)">List of Butterflies of India (Papilionidae)</a> is very impressive. That is definitely lots of work. I don't think I can help very much, being unfamiliar with butterfly taxonomy, and particularly Indian butterflies! But I am very interested in this kind of initiative, and hope that more people will start doing similar projects for other regions around the world. Your project is an excellent example for others.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Arthropods_fb32.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Arthropods">WikiProject Arthropods</a> is now functional. Please feel free to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Arthropods_fb32.html#Participants" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Arthropods">join</a>. I hope this will help standardise resources on arthropods, and encourage the development of many sadly ignored stubs and articles. Would you like me to add an {{<a href="../../../a/r/t/Template%7EArthropodTalk_e054.html" title="Template:ArthropodTalk">ArthropodTalk</a>}} template on the talk page of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_butterflies_of_India_6511.html" title="List of butterflies of India">List of butterflies of India</a> and the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Butterflies_of_India_%28Papilionidae%29_2a69.html" title="List of Butterflies of India (Papilionidae)">List of Butterflies of India (Papilionidae)</a>? This would help to direct people who might be interested to the WikiProject mainpage.</p>
<p>On a totally different subject, you say you are a proud Puneite. I wanted to look this up, as I did not know what you meant, but found nothing on Wikipedia. Eventually I found an article on <a href="../../../p/u/n/Pune.html" title="Pune">Pune</a>. I guess that's what it means, you are from Pune? Then maybe there whould be a redirect from Puneite to Pune, don't you think?</p>

<dd><i>Dear Stemonitis,</i></dd>
<dd><i>Hi, I'm AshLin, self-appointed steward&#160;:) (one of three, actually) of the Indian butterflies Wikibase. I noted your formatting changes to Scarce Swallowtail and I have disagreement with your changes in respect of converting the names to all small case.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>It's like this, we have a usage in our 1000 species wikibase of using initial capitals for common names. For example, we write Common Evening Brown and not common evening brown.It helps bring out the species clearly in the text and is a technical writing aid to make the text more readable. We feel small case is counter-intuitive to easy assimilation.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>If you feel very strongly over the issue log me on my talk page. If I recieve no communication from you within next three days, I assume that you are willing to concede our small point whether we are right or wrong and then I shall undo those small changes of initial capitals back to what they were.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>I felt it was important to explain our point of view and solicit your cooperation before hand. We would also appreciate if you feel that you are correct and we are wrong, let our Indian butterflies wikibase be like that only and permit us to continue to follow the guidelines we have established and are used to working with.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Aside from that do visit our pages. We appreciate constructive critical comments. An entry point is <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Butterflies_of_India_%28Papilionidae%29_2a69.html" title="List of Butterflies of India (Papilionidae)">List of Butterflies of India (Papilionidae)</a>. We are hard at work adding data and there are many more stubs than we would like but give us three months time and then revist us.&#160;:).

</dl>
<p>To clarify my standpoint, I feel that there is absolutely no reason to insist on capitals in common names. If you feel that lower case results in ambiguity, then you can solve that ambiguity by using scientific names, or by more careful use of language ("the scarce swallowtail" is just as unambiguous as "Scarce Swallowtail"). Even many ornithologists (including the RSPB in its publications) do not use upper case, and experience no problems.</p>
<p>That aside, I am of course willing to concede to majority decision in particular groups where there is a long-standing tradition of capital letters. One such group is the Lepidoptera. When I went through the invertebrates making titles as consistent as possible, as far as regards upper/lower case, I noticed a majority of lep. articles used upper case, and so I did not change any (also true of Odonata; Mollusca currently a mess and could go either way).</p>
<p>In the case of the <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scarce_swallowtail.html" title="Scarce swallowtail">scarce swallowtail</a>, the article was already at the lower-case title, so I was only matching the text to the title. Were the article to be at <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scarce_Swallowtail_ce2e.html" title="Scarce Swallowtail">Scarce Swallowtail</a>, then the text would have to match that. Feel free to move it thither. It would, in my opinion, be even better if it were located at the scientific name, but that's a different issue.</p>
<p>Note also that even the most vociferous Capital Letter Advocates [<i>sic.</i>] concede lower case for group names, <i>e.g.</i> "swallowtail butterflies", so it should be <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_butterflies_of_India_%28Papilionidae%29_40b8.html" title="List of butterflies of India (Papilionidae)">List of butterflies of India (Papilionidae)</a>, with a small "b" (or "List of Indian Papilionidae", or "List of Indian papilionids" or somesuch). --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStemonitis_ca3d.html" title="User:Stemonitis">Stemonitis</a> 07:33, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there, thanks for your message. looks like you have quite a task ahead of you as do many of the arthropod people here. sorry i can't help any more with the lep taxonomy - more of the physiological/molecular entomology for me, but if i can be of help just let me know. as an aside - i agree with you on the comments you made above re:captilisation of common names. go with what you feel is best - debates over captilisation etc.. are nit-picking and in my view users such as the above should be spending more time writing constructive articles than pointing out what they percieve to be minor inconsistencies. keep up your very good work! <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldfinger820_9be7.html" title="User:Goldfinger820">Goldfinger820</a> 10:05, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aswin, it helps to add any redirects for common names and synonmys to the pages. The synonyms can be mentioned within the taxo box itself instead of in the text.

<p>Hi Ashwin, the categorization to genus level may be redundant given that the taxo boxes themselves allow for the same. The genus links take you to the genus boxes which give all the species.

<dd>Lt. Col. Ferrar was in the army and then moved to civil service. I added some more info. Betts was mostly into birds but see the title of the BBC radio play (btw, most of the info on that page is quite original and thanks to Sir Mark Tully (nephew of Betts) for putting me in touch with Betts' daughter. <a href="../../../s/h/y/User%7EShyamal_ed48.html" title="User:Shyamal">Shyamal</a> 10:28, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, I thought it would be best to put a link after the title of the section describing the nilgai because all of that information comes from the same page. I am new to Wikipedia, so is there some other way that I should be doing it if such a large chunk of info comes from the same source? I am already planning to add something to the references section, but I need to read up a little bit more about the Wikipedia "language" so I can get everything to appear correctly.</p>
<p>Actually, I'm from Texas and am currently attending a university in Nashville, Tennessee working towards a BS in computer science. I've grown up spending a lot of time on ranches so naturally I have an interest in wildlife and wildlife conservation. On my family's ranch we have mostly white-tail deer, axis deer, blackbuck antelope, fallow deer, wild turkey, red deer, assorted species of sheep, and feral hogs, the latter being more of a pest than anything else. My uncle was known for his wetlands conservation efforts and I also have access to areas that are abundant with ducks and geese. Back to the topic at hand, we do not have nilgai on our ranch, but I have been to other ranches that do have them on several occasions. As for updating my user page, that will have to wait for a few day as I am currently in the process of finishing my semester final exams while at the same time trying to get all of my things packed to get ready to move out of my dorm by Saturday morning (it's Thursday night here right now). Anyway, I also want to say thanks for welcoming me to the community. It's good to know that there are such great, friendly people out there. On a final note, you may find my that my contributions will tend to not specialize in any one field, as I am the kind of person that looks things up and does a little research on anything that piques my interest, usually from something on television. The Science Channel, The Discovery Channel, and The Learning Channel are among my favorite stations to watch over here in the States (I'm assuming you are in India), though I do indulge in watching my favorite weekly comedies (perhaps I can use that as a start for my user page). Sorry to be so long-winded. Well, I'm off to get rested for my automata, formal language, and computation theory exam.</p>

<p>Hi AshLin. Sadly, I'm no longer in Africa - just uploading my rotten pics to try to temporarily cover the <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a> gaps. Oddly, I'm in the middle of a BIAS battle right now, and what I really need is an Indian Wikipedian. Ideally one with military knowledge.&#160;:-)</p>
<p>There's a bloke called Maj Gen <a href="../../../r/a/n/Ranjit_Lal_Jetley_3776.html" title="Ranjit Lal Jetley">Ranjit Lal Jetley</a> up for deletion. I have no personal interest in him, but feel that if he were British or US he wouldn't be described as non-notable. The article is also badly written (am editing to improve) and has naff all references. If you feel this article is worth saving, would you comment at the AfD? (Btw, I've noticed that being a relative of a "notable" person seems to count with the media-driven, name-recognition folks; if this Jetley is part of a military family, related to those who <i>do</i> appear on Google, perhaps mention that as well?)

<blockquote>
<p>Papilio paradoxus Race telearchus Race <i>telearchus</i>, Hewitson-Male, Upperside: forewing dark brown richly shot with blue, a short oval streak or large spot and a postdiscal and subterminal complete series of spots bluish white; both the series curve inwards on the wing anteriorly, the inner series of spots elongate. Hindwing rich hair-brown, with or without a subterminal series of white specks that increase in size anteriorly. Underside rich chocolate brown. Forewing: the cellular short streak faintly indicated, the postdiscal series of spots of the upperside not present, the subterminal series white, the spots much reduced in size. Hindwing: markings as on the upperside. Cilia dark brown alternated sparsely with white. Antennae black; head, thorax and abdomen velvety brown, the head and anterior portion of thorax and the thorax and abdomen beneath sparsely spotted with white. Female. Upperside, forewing: basal half dull brown, apical half brown shot with brilliant blue; markings as in the male, but larger and whiter, the spots in the postdiscal series more elongate. Hindwing brown, a series of comparatively broad whitish streaks in the cell and in all the interspaces, those in the latter end in a postdiscal series of whitish spots; beyond these a prominent subterminal series of whitish spots. Cilia brown, white in the middle of the interspaces. Underside: pale dull browm markings much as on the upperside, but larger, more diffuse, with the addition on the forewing of whitish streaks in thecell and in the interspaces posteriorly. Antennae black; head, thorax and abdomen blackish brown, more fully spotted with white than in the male. The second and rarer form of the female closely resembles the male, but is larger and paler, with the pale blue-glossed spots on the upperside of the forewing elongate and more prominent and the ground-colour lighter than in the male. Expanse: 120-150 mm Habitat: Assam, Burma, Tenasserim, extending to Siam. Papilio caunus Race <i>danisepa</i>, Butler- Male. Upperside rich velvety brown shot with blue. Forewing: apical third of cell, four short streaks beyond in interspaces 4,5,6 and 9 and a subterminal series of spots curved inwards opposite the apex, bluish white. Hindwing: the cell, a series of streaks from the bases of interspaces 1 to 7 and an incomplete subterminal series of minute spots, white; the streaks in interspaces 4 and 5 short, those in the interspaces above and below gradually longer. Underside brown without the blue gloss; markings as on the upperside, but the subterminal markings on the hind wing complete. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen black; beneath, the thorax and abdomen with a few white spots. Female. Resembles the male, but the blue gloss on both fore and hind wing is more restricted, the ground colour paler brown, somewhat of a rich golden bronze, and the white markings are fuller and broader. Expanse 110-132 mm Habitat: The hills of Assam; Arrakan; Upper and Lower Burma; Tenasserim, extending to Siam. I first came across this magnificent butterfly on the Tannjah Pass, 1000 feet, over the Dawnat mountains in Tenasserim, and until I had caught and examined it, mistook it for an extraordinarily large speciment of <i>Euploea rhadamanthus</i>. It is apparently sometimes, notwithstanding its disguise, attacked and preyed upon by the Pigmy Falcon (<i>Microhierax</i> caerulescens<i>), as in the nest-hole of a pair of these birds I once</i> found the fragment of a forewing of a butterfly which was identified by the late Mr. de Niceville as belonging to this form of <i>P. caunus</i>.</p>
