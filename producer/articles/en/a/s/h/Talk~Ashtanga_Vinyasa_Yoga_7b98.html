<p>First of all, thank you Mottad (whoever you are!) for doing some massive improvements to the text here! I was just in Mysore, South India, and while I was there I was showing a few folks the dearth of quality information about Ashtanga Yoga, and about Sri K. Pattabhi Jois, on Wikipedia. But I'm glad the situation has improved. My first concern from here is that it's not called Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga, it's called Ashtanga Yoga. Sri K. Pattabhi Jois has never called it anything else. Thus we should move the information away from this page and to the Ashtanga Yoga page. I am, however, a Wikimedia beginner, so I wish to take this slowly. I also have plenty of things I would like to add here, under the curatorial guidance of my friend who has published nearly all of the english language articles by Sri K. Patabhi Jois. He has also published much of the biographical information about the life of Sri K. Pattabhi Jois. So there's a well of information from which to be drawn. (I'm still unclear about this Talk page as well... It's function and appearance, and who checks it. I guess I'll go through the Wikipedia tutorial...) - <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouljerky_114e.html" title="User:Souljerky">Souljerky</a></p>

<li>Hi souljerky. Thanks for the heads-up! I'm also a wikipedia beginner, and this is pretty much the only change I've made. Although I kinda planned to make entries for the bandhas, I ahven't really had time. Um, what else. Oh, it was saved as Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga by someone else, I didn't know why and don't know how to change it. As for the information on Jois, I think it's great that you updated his page with that. How long were you in Mysore? Was it amazing? Mottad</li>

<li>Hi all. It's been about 3 years since I was in mysore, but I hope to be getting back soon. Anyway, I think the use of "vinyasa" in <b>ashtanga vinyasa yoga is to differentiate it from the philosophical system of Ashtanga Yoga</b>. And yes, I know that Ashtanaga Yoga as taught by Jois does embrace that system. But the system doesn't necessarily require one to practice ashtanga yoga as taught by jois. One could simply practice mediation and be following the philosophical system of Ashtanga Yoga. For practicality's sake "Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga" is a good term to differentiate between the philosophical root and thiss particular system of following it (as opposed to any others), and one that does, after all, accurately describe the practice. Keep breathing!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It seems that the wisest thing to do is call it what Pattabhi Jois calls it: Ashtanga Yoga. If there is a need to differentiate it from other types of Ashtanga Yoga, people may always say "Ashtanga Yoga as taught by Pattabhi Jois." The Ashtanga Yoga's taught in India within different traditions vary widely, except for in their general definition of consisting of eight-limbs. EHS111 22:29, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think I gave the page its original name. The problem is that there is already a page called <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashtanga_yoga.html" title="Ashtanga yoga">Ashtanga yoga</a>, and this page explains the general idea of the eight limbs, so this name is gone. If you want to name the page Ashtanga Yoga as taught by Pattabhi Jois, go ahead, but I feel that it is a pretty awkward name. In any case, I would suggest to put a redirect of the current name to whatever new name you choose. Wikipedia lives from people who go ahead and do bold edits, so if you have a better name for the page, by all means go for it. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilke_e69c.html" title="User:Wilke">Wilke</a> 08:18, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Looks like the majority feels that there is no difference between Ashtanga and Ashtanga vinyasa yoga. I would like to propose the following merging plan. Introduction and method sections together can go in as a Pattabhi jois style of Ashtanga section in Raja Yoga aka Ashtanga yoga article. Bandas, Drishtis and Mantra can become independent or new sub sections in Raja yoga as these sections dont exist in that article yet. Rest of the stuff can be merged into their respective headers. --<a href="../../../v/y/z/User%7EVyzasatya_d19c.html" title="User:Vyzasatya">Vyzasatya</a> 12:24, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The consensus was there was no difference between <b>Ashtanga Yoga</b> and <b>Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga</b>, yes. However that is not the same as saying there is no difference between <a href="../../../r/a/j/Raja_Yoga_0eff.html" title="Raja Yoga">Raja Yoga</a> and the <b>Ashtanga Yoga</b> of Sri K. Pattabhi Jois. Definitely do not merge. Move this article to <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashtanga_Yoga_7020.html" title="Ashtanga Yoga">Ashtanga Yoga</a>, (this would require the assitance of an Administrator). <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_foord_ef46.html" title="User:Paul foord">Paul foord</a> 23:16, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The above logic doesn't make sense to me. From the <a href="../../../r/a/j/Raja_Yoga_0eff.html" title="Raja Yoga">Raja Yoga</a> article, "Raja yoga also is known as Ashtanga Yoga. The term <b>Ashtanga</b> means eight limbs, thus <b>Ashtanga Yoga</b> refers to the <a href="../../../y/o/g/Yoga_Sutras_of_Patanjali_f889.html#The_Eight_Limbs_of_Raja_Yoga" title="Yoga Sutras of Patanjali">eight limbs of [Raja] yoga</a>." Thus, "Ashtanga Yoga" <i><b>is</b></i> "Raja Yoga." Now, if there is "no difference" between "Ashtanga Yoga" and "Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga," this article should be <b>merged</b> into <a href="../../../r/a/j/Raja_Yoga_0eff.html" title="Raja Yoga">Raja Yoga</a>. If Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga is not the same as Raja Yoga, then it's not the same as Ashtanga Yoga either. In that case, <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashtanga_Yoga_7020.html" title="Ashtanga Yoga">Ashtanga Yoga</a> should remain a disambig page and <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashtanga_Vinyasa_Yoga_1542.html" title="Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga">Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga</a> should stay put. <a href="../../../r/d/f/User%7ERDF_91de.html" title="User:RDF"></a> — <a href="../../../r/d/f/User%7ERDF_91de.html" title="User:RDF">RDF</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/f/User_talk%7ERDF_abf5.html" title="User talk:RDF">talk</a></sup> 23:45, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the methods section it says <i>The main difference of this style of Yoga to other styles is the focus on vinyasa, which is the union of movement and breath.</i> Hence the article itself declares that it is a specialised form of Ashtanga Yoga.

<p>There should be some mention that Ashtanga (vinyasa) yoga has six series. I've got some information about this on my own site that I've lovingly collected and I wouldn't be opposed to reproducing it here. This is the page I'm talking about: <a href="http://www.ashtangadiary.com/ashtanga-yoga-series/" class="external text" title="http://www.ashtangadiary.com/ashtanga-yoga-series/" rel="nofollow">Ashtanga Yoga Series</a>. There's also a list of asanas in each series which could be added too, I'm sure you could find them by browsing the link provided. I'm just not sure if they should be on a new page or appended to the Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga page. Opinions welcome. Coffeeaddict 08:57, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Are we all more or less happy about the name of this article? I'd have thought this school was more commonly known as <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashtanga_Yoga_7020.html" title="Ashtanga Yoga">Ashtanga Yoga</a> (a scrappy-looking disambig page at present), arguing for a move to that title, but admittedly that might have some POV implications (the name being basically a claim on the part of the founder that his style is <i>the</i> Raja Yoga of Patanjali (others merely manifestations thereof, standard one-upmanship in this area, not to say many others). Alternatively, that about a parenthetical disamig, like Ashtanga Yoga (Pattabhi Jois) or something to that effect. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 04:27, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hope this is the right place to ask this. The Nasagrai drishti is listed as "at a point six inches from the tip of the nose". In David Swenson's 'Ashtanga Yoga' book he says it's simply "the tip of the nose"</p>

<p>I have heard some contention as to whether the breath used in Ashtanga Yoga should appropriately be called "Ujjayi Breath". It was relayed to us in a class in NH, USA (and i don't know that this was actually said) that Nancy Gilgoff feels Ujjayi, when properly done is done in a seated practice involving the 3 locks, and not done while flowing through Vinyasa. Rather that the breath in Ashtanga practice should be called- "the ocean-sounding breath" or a breath "imitating the rasp or drag heard in Ujjayi breathing". I would love someone with a little more involvement with the Mysore community to comment on this. I was taught at Sivananda Yoga Farm (Grass Valley, CA USA) that Ujjayi breath was a breath that was done with a very certain seat, a certain emphasis on engaging all three locks and done in a slow and deliberate manner with a certain count - but i never wanted to question the difference between the views of these two systems - it seemed it would reveal itself in time, and now I am excited to hear your thoughts on it!</p>

<p>Regarding Krishnamacharya's teachings, based on my discussions with other direct students of his (Mark Whitwell and Srivatsa Ramaswami) and review of written material by his son TKV Desikachar, I must dispute the statement that "Today, Ashtanga remains the most faithful to his original teachings to teenage boys." I don't believe this statement is verifiable nor does it reflect NPOV, so I recommend deletion (or significant revision) of it. SeekingToKnow 06:31, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
