I have uploaded this image with confidence that I can use TV screenshot to identify the actress. The image summary is pretty self-explanatory. Any technical violation is inadvertent.

<p>You said: "Once again, I am baffled by the sheer lack of details on your work or explanation on my image. You have so far only explained why you have removed this image from "<a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Aniston_336d.html" title="Jennifer Aniston">Jennifer Aniston</a>" article <i>(although that is still a matter of debate as I have plenty of examples of screenshots being used as actor/actress identifier - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanie_Zimbalist" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanie_Zimbalist" rel="nofollow">Example</a>)</i>. But I cannot understand why you have tagged the image itself for deletion.<br />
I have read <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a>. TV screenshot upload (copyright) issue clearly states that an image can be used for identifying/commenting a TV program and/or its contents. So logic would dictate that my screen shot is perfectly valid as it describes a TV advertisement.<br />
So please stop this nonsense and remove your "quick deletion" tag from my image immediately. If you have any rational objections (which you are currently lacking), I suggest we get a second opinion, possibly from an actual administrator."</p>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't delete the image, another admin did. However, if the image is not used in any articles, we are not permitted to keep it around (assuming it is a fair-use image). As to other fair-use images being used to depict living people, these would also generally be in violation of <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a>. This is grounds to mark those images as problem, not an excuse to use fair-use images inappropriately in additional locations. The license clearly states that the image can be used for "<b>identification and critical commentary</b> on the station ID or the program and its contents". You were not doing so, you were using the image solely to illustrate a living person for whom a replaceable freely-licensed image could be created. Note that a tv screenshot may be used to depict that t.v. show. This is entirely different from using a t.v. screenshot to depict an actor from that show, which is not permitted. Now, you are welcome to seek another opinion but note that another administrator (Nv8200p) already reviewed this image and found it to be inappropriate for the Wikipedia as it was being used. However, given that the image was clearly a fair-use image (it was a t.v. screenshot) and given that it was being used to depict a subject which still exists (in this case, a living actor) in violation of the first criteria of <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a>, you will not get very far with a third opinion. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 02:12, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Additionally, I don't understand your crack about "an actual administrator". I'm sure you are aware that I am an administrator here on the Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 02:12, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You said: "No! I didn't know that you're an administrator. Your willingness towards being more arrogant and unprofessional was a far cry from general web administrators (especially on non-profitable sites), who generally tend to be more helpful and professional.<br />
<b>As for the copyright issue, it is now clear to me that, although you know copyright facts in great details, you are just willing to make things difficult rather than take the professional and rational approach. If you knew all along that all this image needed was "specific pointer towards the TV program itself" (i.e. - if the image had been labelled as (for example) "Jennifer Aniston seen here during a Heineken TV commercial - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Phoebe_Buffay_1.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Phoebe_Buffay_1.jpg" rel="nofollow">Example</a>", this image could have been saved). You could have done this yourself. Obviously it is your ego that has prevented you from resorting to "fixing other peoples problems".<br /></b> But certainly it was a good experience for me."</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is not the case as has been pointed out to you both by the pointer to <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a> and by explanation. Once again, <i>you may not use a fair-use image to depict an actor from the show</i>. You may not use fair-use images to depict living people.

<dd><i>...I see your point regarding "Flag congestion". But now it looks well weird with too much room inside the template.

<dd>Hey, sorry to interfere but I would like to share some quick points. There is a difference between a customized aircraft (ex <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-15SG_0df6.html" title="F-15SG">F-15SG</a>) and a jointly developed aircraft (ex <a href="../../../j/s/f/JSF_7984.html" title="JSF">JSF</a>). Su-30 MKI does not come under both of these categories for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>Though, Su-30 MKI is a variant of Sukhoi's Su-30, the avionics of the aircraft (like radar computer, radar warning receiver, mission computer etc.) are made by DRDO and HAL; a crucial component of any fighter aircraft. As a matter of fact, there are talks of Indian avionics being used in the variant Sukhoi has developed for Malaysia.</li>
<li>The missiles being used in the aircraft are also Indian. For example: <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astra_missile.html" title="Astra missile">Astra missile</a> will replace <a href="../../../k/a/b/KAB-500L_e44c.html" title="KAB-500L">KAB-500L</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmos.html" title="Brahmos">Brahmos</a> (joint Indo-Russian) will replace <a href="../../../k/h/-/Kh-59.html" title="Kh-59">Kh-59</a>. DRDO is already developing an indigenous Optical locator system for these missiles.</li>
<li>Electronic countermeasure system of the aircraft is Indian too. Tarang, the RWR system, was developed by DRDO.</li>
<li>Israel's contribution to the aircraft is equivalent to that of Russia's. Elta EL/M-8222 self-protection jammer and LITENING targeting pod are all Israeli made.</li>
<li>French contribution: HUD Sextant VEH3000 and navigation system Totem INS/GPS</li>
<li>The radar of the aircraft, Ibris <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phased_array_radar.html" title="Phased array radar">phased array radar</a>, is jointly developed by DRDO and Russia.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Without these equipments and gadgets, a fighter aircraft is nothing but a sitting duck. Therefore, to say that Su-30 MKI is joint collaboration between India and Russia with Israeli help is more accurate.

<dd>Well.. on second thoughts, "Under licensed production from Russia" seems fair enough.

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No. Sukhoi cannot add all of the concerned Indian, French and Israeli gadgets to any other aircraft without their permission. As a matter of fact, the equipments are added to the aircraft by HAL and not by Sukhoi. The MK, MKM and the MKK versions, the <a href="../../../s/u/-/Su-35.html" title="Su-35">Su-35</a> and the <a href="../../../s/u/-/Su-37.html" title="Su-37">Su-37</a> do not feature these gadgets. That's why there were reports that Sukhoi had approached DRDO and HAL to add the Indian avionics to the MKM version.

<dd>I think I got what you are trying to say. I was just replying to your this remark, <i>Sukhoi is the party making all the money out of this and it will distribute revenue and profit to all the external partners accordingly, and also, it holds the right to sell this variant to other parties</i>. All I wanted to say was that Sukhoi is not involved in the deal between IAF and HAL, DRDO, IAI and Thales Corp. IAF pays IAI and Thales Corp. directly for their gadgets since the Israeli gadgets are for sale to very few countries and Russia is not one of them. The difference between MKM and MKI versions should give you a clearer idea.

<p>Because, exactly as you said, there were NO cameras back then. Comparing a film character to a wall sculpture of a person that we cannot even verify if it's the way he looked is hardly notable. We have written testimony about what Xerxes looked liked, but you cannot encyclopedically compare a live action person with wall art. Maybe, if it was a true painting, but even so the film is not based on history, it's based on a comic book. That is why we have a comparison with the comicbook, because that is what it get's its information from, not history. Now, the comic gets it from history, but vaguely. It is not appropriate, nor would it pass fair use to compare film Xerxes to wall art Xerxes, especially wall art where you cannot really see the man (it's a side profile, where you cannot distinguish beard from robe. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon;color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole">(Contact me)</a> 23:00, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No problem. It was something that came up awhile ago. I actually don't understand why we have a "historical accuracy" section, when we know the film wasn't based on history, but a graphic novel that took its own liberties with history. But, I think that has more to do with the fact that most critics of the historical inaccuracies are not familiar with the fact that there is a graphic novel out that the film is really based on, and that the film really didn't change anything in comparison to the novel. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon;color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole">(Contact me)</a> 23:09, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
