<li>I hope you do not mind me asking but why is the name of the page the same as your username? You asked for help, well to wikify an article it means adding appropriate sections (which it has) and linking internally to other article which are relevant, for more info see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikify_fc6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikify">Wikipedia:Wikify</a>. For example in the character and history sections you could make an interwiki link on the word <i>Villain</i> by doing this: [[Villain]] and it would produce <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villain.html" title="Villain">Villain</a>. To link to an article with a slightly different word for example you wanted villainous to link to villain you would put [[Villain|Villainous]] and this would link the word villainous to villain. Hope this helps.<a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETellyaddict_29e0.html" title="User:Tellyaddict"><b><font color="#DD0000"><font color="#0066FF">Telly</font></font></b></a><a href="../../../t/e/l/User_talk%7ETellyaddict_ee7a.html" title="User talk:Tellyaddict"><b><font color="#66FF33">addict</font></b></a><sup><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Tellyaddict_972b.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Tellyaddict"><font color="red">Editor review!</font></a></sup> 14:26, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Very strange.</p>
<p>You know what? Ashnard reminds me of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel_Volgin_28e1.html" title="Colonel Volgin">Colonel Volgin</a>. (You've played MGS:3 I assume.) That's not good, by the way... do you like him too? Just picking on you, but still... it's a weird character to like soooo much. If it makes you feel better, I didn't like Ike too much, but don't you dare talk crap about Greil. Err. See you around, Ol' King Daein. Peregrine 16:54, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I have played MGS3, I love that game, I am also quite partial to Greil (although I prefer to call him <a href="../../../g/a/w/Gawain.html" title="Gawain">Gawain</a>). Ashnard is quite like Volgin, but Ashnard isn't a bisexual pervert. So...Thanks for the comment, I'm really starting to get use to this place. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshnard_d1d9.html" title="User:Ashnard"><font color="green"><b>Ashnard</b></font></a> <sub><strong class="selflink"><b><font color="green">talk</font></b></strong></sub> 18:15, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is true!!! You have a good point on me, there. Haha, well... You make SURE you have fun here on wikipedia. And, on a side note: Ivan is hardly a man. Happy editing. Peregrine 22:23, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I will, by the way, have you noticed that Rolf from <a href="../../../p/a/t/Path_of_Radiance_db9c.html" title="Path of Radiance">Path of Radiance</a> seems incredibly ...effeminite? That boy must be the campest thing in videogames (besides Tingle). I mean, he seeks support from <i>Mist</i>. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshnard_d1d9.html" title="User:Ashnard"><font color="green"><b>Ashnard</b></font></a> <sub><strong class="selflink"><b><font color="green">talk</font></b></strong></sub> 22:41, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Oh, Rolf... give him a chance. Atleast he's not an idiot like Boyd, or walking around with his eyes closed all the time like Oscar! He's still a kid, he could, uh... ya know, toughen up as he ages. <i>(Maybe we'll see in GoD, who knows? Sothe definetely came a long way... if he just ditched that belly shirt)</i> Plus, he's a sniper...so snipers rock, right? Tingle frightens me to my core, ahhh. I am not fond of that fairy-loving, body suit wearing freak with little man boobies. Have you played Twilight Princess? Looking back I don't think Tingle was in it at all. Thank goodness. Well, see-ya. Peregrine 23:13, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Let's hope Rolf doesn't end up like Sothe (who looks like a medieval rent boy). Snipers rock... Rolf doesn't, Shinon is legendrary, as is Will and Rebecca, yet Rolf seems to degrade (or spoil) the whole class. As for Oscar and Boyd? Well, Oscar cooks the meals and Boyd is better with a bow than Rolf. Tingle gives me nightmares, he reaches the daunting heights of Raikov and Rolf in being androgynous, I'm still aggrovated that he charged me so many rupees in The Wind Waker. Who are the guys that creates these characters? Y'know, this discussion is giving me an idea for an article...THE MOST SEXUALLY AMBIGUOUS CHARACTERS OF VIDEOGAMES!!!

<p>Oh...Ashnard. It'd be unfortunate if you made an article like that. See, you'd realize shortly thereafter that just about every great game would have more than one character on that very list. I guess I'd have to admit now that I guess I DO like Shinon a whole lot, and I guess, maybe I agree that perhaps someone more... experienced (and someone with more of a personality) should've become commander after that whole, <i>incident</i>. (Pah.) Who (in your game) was better as a sniper, Wil or Rebecca? I have not beaten Rekka no Ken, I'm on Chapter 19 Gaiden, I played as Hector the first time thru because I never realized it was something that was unlocked by the person who owned the game before me. I don't mind. I believe that Hector is the man, yes? Well I should really stop talking now. Later. Peregrine 03:55, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Shinon was cool, but he was left eating humble pie later on when Ike beat him down, I liked his personality, but I'm still annoyed that he and Gatrie ran off, leaving me with the inexperienced rabble that is Rhys and co, to think I wasted experience on him (pah). Rekka no Ken is absolutley excellent, it's just as good as PoR (SS is <b>nowhere</b> near as good),Wil is roughly on par with Rebecca, although it is really laborious getting Rebecca up (she starts really weak). I'm kind of an FE addict, so I've completed all gaiden chapters (even the Kishuna ones). Hector really is the man, one of the best Lords, as for Ike, surprisingly,he probably has the deepest personaliy for a lord, now Eliwood is the one who is uncharismatic. You really should complete this game. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshnard_d1d9.html" title="User:Ashnard"><font color="green"><b>Ashnard</b></font></a> <sub><strong class="selflink"><b><font color="green">talk</font></b></strong></sub> 08:32, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>You were ticked about that? Hmph. (I guess I was a little, hell... ok. It sucked) You gotta think about how crappy it would feel to have loser Ike in charge, he had been a mercenary for a couple days!Honestly it would've made perfect since to leave Titania in charge. (Although I have a sneaking suspicion it still wouldn't have appeased Shinon, he loved Greil and he was really just having a hissy-fit. You know how those mid-life crisis are.) So you've mastered Rekka no Ken? Hah, I guess I'll talk to you if I have questions, hmph... except I won't because I am too arrogant and filled with pride to do so. I've already gotten Rebecca pretty good, so I guess I'm past the hard part, good to know. Hmph, I am still pretty vague on what the heck Kishuna is. I mean, yeah he's a morph and he nullifies magic but he's weird as hell. Hah, we probably shouldn't be carrying on a conversation here, despite it being a "talk" page. Sorry about that! I'll take your advice and try and beat Rekka no Ken, although working all the time kinda stops me from playing, with as OCD as I am I need hours on end for some quality FE gameplay time. Aaahh, sorry again. Peregrine 18:24, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Don't worry about editing here, it's my talk page, and I don't mind. Ike's alright, but Aether and Ragnell make him appear better than he actually is. Titania's just worthless, as a unit, and as a personality. Actually, Soren should have took charge, he's an excellent personality, strategist and unit. Keep at Rekka no Ken, if you've trained your Lords and have got some decent magic users then you should complete it in no time. Hector Hard mode is <b>very hard</b> though. Well, I think it is, it took me ages to do it. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshnard_d1d9.html" title="User:Ashnard"><font color="green"><b>Ashnard</b></font></a> <sub><strong class="selflink"><b><font color="green">talk</font></b></strong></sub> 18:36, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ike is okay. Yeah, but... he didn't have Ragnell or Aether until he became a lord so at first he was kinda a little turd. Did you see this crud on the GoD article about Ike being back? I mean, it could be true. I guess if someone produces these "recent scans" then I guess I'll have to believe it. I like Soren massively... He is extremely intelligent, very powerful and an excellent strategist but he is completetly inept at getting along with people, he'd probably be hard to like as a leader. I never used Titania, I don't waste experience on Jeigan characters, but... she probably just had the most experience as a fighter and as a person in a leadership position. I don't personally like her, it's just logical. All my magic users in Rekka no Ken never cease to amaze me. Canas, Lucius and Erk are all really good in my game and yes, it does make it a lot easier. I'm not as good at FE as you, my Looorrdd... so, yeah... I didn't do it on HARD mode. I guess I don't rock so much anymore. SEE YOU. Peregrine 19:10, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The point about Soren not being social enough to be a leader is valid, remember when he nearly got himself killed by a laguz, Soren is still class though. I haven't heard about Ike coming back in GoD, I hope he does, though. And by the way, Canas is the best FE character ever, (except Ashnard), he totally destroys anything when he has Luna. If you're training Lucius on your first playthrough, then you must be quite adept at the game, it took me several playthroughs to realise he was actually worthwile. Wait a minute, Lucius is another weirdo geezer bird, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

<p>OK, friend. I am also unclear about the use of images found on the internet. I have seen many people, however, who have used images from webpages and stated the source as the URL. (That's what confuses me because, yes... it clearly states "no images from search engines, or webpages". Perhaps you should talk to the person who made your talkpage, his name is at the bottom of the greeting. I'm pretty sure that's what they're there for. =) I do know a place where you could obtain the image, although I'm sure you probably do too... but perhaps you can get permission from the owner of this site to use the images? ( www.fe-online.co.uk ) On the other note: I can do my best to help you expand the article itself. I'll take a look at it, although... I'm sure YOU'RE the master on all things Ashnard. Peregrine 20:54, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks, I'll contact that User. On another note, What about GoD? The Black Knight is playable, Ike and crew return? Why doesn't the guy making the claims make links or something? But, seeing as the game is getting releases in Japan in acouple of days, there is going to be an information explosion. Thanks. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshnard_d1d9.html" title="User:Ashnard"><font color="green"><b>Ashnard</b></font></a> <sub><strong class="selflink"><b><font color="green">talk</font></b></strong></sub> 20:59, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yep. It always happens days before a release, like you said. Luckily for us, we are not the only people so obsessed with the game and shortly after (very shortly) the game IS released I am sure we will have all of the false information weeded out. It does boggle my mind though, the Black Knight as a playable character makes little/no sense to me. If anything he could come back as a character whom reveals himself to be the "Black Knight", in that case I would think it would be too early to know of this, since you'd probably have to play quite a bit into the game to find something like that out. On a side note: I am also getting sick, and I can tell it's going to suck. I guess it makes sense that Ike might be in GoD, although I honestly don't care for that scenario... Gallia is on the border of Crimea and is his place of birth... it'd be hard for him to not get involved. What music do you listen to Ashnard? You should listen to <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_X_03aa.html" title="Symphony X">Symphony X</a>. Later. Peregrine 21:15, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Err, I guess I have no right to assume you should, since you very well probably don't listen to metal, but... it's different... triumphant, wars and gods, and mythology... uh, yeah... but hey why not check it out sometime? Peregrine 21:18, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're into metal then. Where are you from Peregrine? I assume that you're American, but I could be wrong. As for GoD, I can't wait for this game, I'm glad we're getting an actual sequel that links to previous characters, the memory card thing sounda amazing. But I'm not sure whether I want spoilers, but that would mean I would be unable to view over the article. I really am in two minds. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshnard_d1d9.html" title="User:Ashnard"><font color="green"><b>Ashnard</b></font></a> <sub><strong class="selflink"><b><font color="green">talk</font></b></strong></sub> 21:26, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am American, don't think dirty of me.;) Weird of you to assume though, Symphony X actually isn't very popular here (Although they are one of the few good metal bands from the states.) I am not "into" metal though. I listen to all types of music, mostly instrumental music, much of it kind of pours over into different genres. I particularly like Symphony X because it gets me revved up for these types of games, also... the man has a beautiful voice, he is not screaming or anything. I HATE almost ALL metal currently circulating in pop-culture. As for GoD I did kind of assume that the old characters would have a lot to do with it and that it would be a sequel so I'm not too relieved. Ah, those Shinon/Janaff conversations rocked my world. The <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peregrine_falcon.html" title="Peregrine falcon">peregrine falcon</a> is a lovely bird, yes? I love birds... I have three of my own. Hmmm... one is an <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_grey.html" title="African grey">african grey</a>, she can talk... and scream, and imitate horrendous noises. Peregrine 21:47, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>OH YEAH, I created a draft on my userpage and copied your Ashnard page onto it, so I'll work on that in a bit and I'll show it to you, if you like the changes then you can just revert the article to the version in my draft... k? Oh yeah, your introduction is vague because you don't exactly state WHAT his attitude is on life, rather that it remains that same... so try to describe that a little better.

<dd>I've fixed the introduction, thanks for the constructive criticism, I'm glad you're showing an interest, honestly. I've never read the Shinon/Janaff conversations, but I expect they're hilarious. You're pets seem cool, and, I've decided that I don't want any spoilers for GoD, so I'll stop visiting the GoD page and try to form an information barrier concerning it. <b>Thanks Peregrine.</b> <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshnard_d1d9.html" title="User:Ashnard"><font color="green"><b>Ashnard</b></font></a> <sub><strong class="selflink"><b><font color="green">talk</font></b></strong></sub> 23:13, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How's it going Peregrine? Those Japanese are so lucky compared to us Westerners. Not much is happening in England, the weather is miserable, and the army are actually allowing Prince Harry to go to Iraq, let's hope he doesn't get kidnapped, because the ransom will be absolutley enormous.

<dd>I'm only 15, so I'm merely a school student (it's currentlly my week break). Come on Peregrine, America is great (no, I haven't been there), but, the USA (and Britain) have lost popularity since the war. You're president is percieved as an idiot, and the Prime minister is viewed as the poodle of the idiot. As for me, I've never really favoured these red-necks, they all seem too bigoted for me, I'd probably vote for the democrats if I was American (and at voting age). Don't worry though, we (the UK) have our fair share of problems, but the less said about that the better, but I'm not too critical, at least I'm not living in Iraq or Iran. As for sleep, I won't be going to bed until about another hour. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshnard_d1d9.html" title="User:Ashnard"><font color="green"><b>Ashnard</b></font></a> <sub><strong class="selflink"><b><font color="green">talk</font></b></strong></sub> 22:52, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>The poodle, eh? Well, Tony Blair is not quite like our "Mr. George W.". George W. Bush really is an idiot, not just a percieved idiot. (And I thought that BEFORE Iraq, wow... that was a long time ago.)Either way...we talk crap about ANY person in ANY government who agrees with ANY thing George Bush does.(including our own--that was the major smear campaign used against republicans during the mid-term elections. "So and so agrees with George Bush 90%, do you want someone... blah blah") I don't know, it WOULD be hard to be a major leader and not kiss the ass of the SUPERPOWER of the world, but at the same time you DO have your right to put your foot down and disagee. The Prime Minister COULD work on pulling more troops out in the future... (Is that why they're sending Harry?) but... atleast he's doing something... hey... our troops all have to... duh duh... "stay the course", I really wish I could see my comrades home... honestly. No more Iraq... thinking about how bad things are there, it does make you feel better about everything, but only for a moment... I feel horrible for everyone who's died. America is great, yeah... to live in maybe. But aren't we really just monsters for doing this? I can't see how anyone could agree with it. <a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Peregrine_70b0.html" title="User:Le Peregrine">Peregrine</a> 23:13, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Haha, I can't think of anyone for that list. Ashnard is manly. Hey, actually Sephiran would fit in pretty well, I wonder how he got the be Prime Minister.

<dd>Iraq is a disaster, but I do believe that Bush believes he is doing good eventhough he's messed up big time, the loss of many lives can be attributed to him. We shouldn't kiss U.S ass, but I think Mr Blair gets more criticism than he deserves. At the beginning, they thought they would just bomb the place, get the <b>weapons of mass destruction</b> and all the Iraqis would live happily ever after. But things are far more difficult, there was no WMD, and the country is in a total mess, if the Iraqis aren't bombing troops, they're bombing each other, with the whole Sunni and Shi-ite thing. It shouldn't be a surprise that the citizens would actually be pissed off about their compatriots dying, things were never going to be simple. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshnard_d1d9.html" title="User:Ashnard"><font color="green"><b>Ashnard</b></font></a> <sub><strong class="selflink"><b><font color="green">talk</font></b></strong></sub> 23:23, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>GIRL!? Are you serious? No offence, but I thought you were a bloke, I'm male by the way.

<p>Ah, heh heh. No, I'm a girl. ...All I feel I should say about Iraq now is that, rumors have it we had enough intelligence pointing towards them not having WMDs that we shouldn't have bombed them in the first place. Things, aren't ever going to be nor were they EVER simple, in Iraq. just like they are not simple in Israel. The Sunni/Shi-ite thing as well as the Israeli/Palistinian thing has been going on since before we were all born. The conflict between Sunni/Shi-ite is an emotional, religious struggle that is of a deeper intensity than a non-Muslim could never understand. (NOT to mention, most of our political leaders don't EVEN KNOW the DIFFERENCE between the Sunni and the Shi-ite. They actually interviewed several figureheads who failed to give an adequate answer.)</p>
<p>I got to the end of Twillight Princess, I mean... what I THINK is the end and NEVER beat it, my Wii has been sitting there and I just stopped playing. I got to Zant after all those weird light ball puzzle things with the hand-thing, ya know? I talked to him, and I shut it off because it was late and I didn't feel like playing anymore. Haven't even turned it on since, I guess... it just disappointed me because I did just about everything I COULD do in the game up to then and it barely took me any time, I expected... MORE. But, Zant is certainly very... very weird. Those noises he makes, and the way he looks UNDER all that crap is even weirder, he looks kinda like Voldo from Soul Calibur. Is that battle the last one? Or is there more? I could play it right freaking now, I am just too fucking weirdly unattracted to playing that game ever since that night. I liked Midna, I thought she was the cutest but she DOES treat you like a DOG. Hehe.</p>
<p>Sephiran! I know he gave the Black Knight that STUPID blessed armor, he must have. I know it. Why is the Black Knight his bitch, hm? WHY? I wanna know, and I have a sneaking suspicion we will find out. After all, he must've approved this war with Gallia which is completely against (what you believe to be) his character. Also, the Apostle would never agree to that... I wonder what happened there. ERRRR!</p>
<p>Zant is only sexually ambigious because he's such a weird looking...thing. Sephiran just looks like a girl. <a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Peregrine_70b0.html" title="User:Le Peregrine">Peregrine</a> 23:45, 23 February 2007 (UTC)\</p>
<p>OH OH, maybe they killed her and blamed it on Gallia, but that would be so unoriginal, oh...... I NEED YOU GoD!!!!!!</p>
<p>Oh, I know how Sephiran got to be Prime Minister. Duke Tanas and his friends thought he was cute.&#160;;)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I do not condone the murder of Iraqi civillians, yet the Sunni Shi-ite thing is senseless, when people are so embroiled in their beliefs that they are ready to die for them then it goes beyond any potential empathy,sympathy or understanding. I watched a programme where Iranians were speaking of martyrdom by suicide as a beautiful thing, but I suppose they're not too bothered when they think they're going to "paradise". As for the politicians, they really should do their research, but so should all of us really, in reality, I only have a vague understanding of the whole Sunni/Shi-ite/Kurde thing. Yet even with my current ignorance, infinite research would probably never give me understanding of some of the things they do.</dd>
</dl>
<p>(Long post, keep energy) As for TP, it's magnificent, you should complete it. Zant is like some insane rentboy, in reality, all he is is Ganondorf's bitch. Those crazy Japanese, they make great games though. Midna is class, but so was the King of Red Lions, everybody is forgetting him for the new girl. Poor boat.</p>
<p>So many secrets left for GoD, somewhere down the line, I think Sephiran is linked to Lucius (eventhough they're in different universes). They're both priests, they both look like girls, they pretend to be pacifists, but they'd probably have you dead if you looked at them the wrong way. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshnard_d1d9.html" title="User:Ashnard"><font color="green"><b>Ashnard</b></font></a> <sub><strong class="selflink"><b><font color="green">talk</font></b></strong></sub> 00:02, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, it's horrid, and senseless. There is, nothing outside mediation can do though. I will beat it, although I already knew that he was Ganon's bitch. I totally did not forget about the damn boat, OK? I played Windwaker QUITE some time ago, I loved it. It's just Midna is still just the cutest thing ever! Hrm... I sound like a girl now, hm? Sephiran and Lucius are alike in many ways, however, Sephiran is much more sinister than Lucius. My theory was always that Sephiran was in search for Lehran's Medallion when you first meet him in the game, and that mixed with the fact that he is uniquely interested in the Galdr of Release that Mist knows. It's funny. You know, the Apostle would never put up with a war with Gallia. I wonder how he does away with that problem... he would need her however, to perform the Galdr. I mean, if I was right. I could be completely wrong but these things just all seemed blatantly obvious from the end of PoR. Anyway, I am guessing it is pretty late now.

<p>I know what you mean, I can't really see it to be true. I'm just stating things I saw to be rather obvious... how they affect the plot of the next game I honestly don't know. I don't know what Sephiran WOULD even be up to if it WE'RE true. I honestly have no idea of his intentions, he is certainly a enigmatic character. I could never see him intending to use the medallion, yet... he seems so interested. For good, or bad? I don't know... Maybe he is just trying to protect the innocent, or maybe he's just a completely heartless evil assmunch. Goodbye.</p>

<p>Haha! Someone else got in on this, you're right... okay, I CAN'T BELIEVE Sephiran WOULD be a villian. But this is what makes me say that... Begnion, goes to WAR with Gallia.

<p>You're right, Armando. I was actually not serious about "KNOWING" that, but... Sephiran has ties to the Clergy, I wouldn't see how you would get blessed armor unless it was from a clergy member. Second of all, Sephiran does have some kind of unique control over the Black Knight. For all we know, however... the Black Knight could've been a spy for Sephiran to keep Ashnard in check. Who knows? <a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Peregrine_70b0.html" title="User:Le Peregrine">Peregrine</a> 23:53, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>-And yes, I get that "control" thing from the fight between the Black Knight and Ranulf. He seems to actually take ORDERS from Sephiran. Like I said, they could be after the same thing... That could be good, that could be bad. From what I've heard though, the Black Knight helps you out in GoD... if they are cohorts than they probably are both good. Then again, Begnion goes to war with Gallia, it seems to be a rather monstrous assault. Hmm. Oh, I need the damn game. <a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Peregrine_70b0.html" title="User:Le Peregrine">Peregrine</a> 23:56, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Black Knight probably isn't dead, if they don't actually show his demise, then he probably isn't dead, anyway, what was stopping him from teleporting when the castle fell down? As for the the BK Sephiran thing, the BK may have refrained because he knew that defying the Primeminister would mean Begnion would wage war upon Daein, and Begnion would kick Daein's arse any day.</dd>

<dd>Hey Armando, I'm pretty annoyed by IGN right now, they've handed an insignificant staff member the Fire Emblem preview to do, which he made an awful job of. He spent most of the preview emphasising the lack of use of the Wiimote and the fact that it was originally a Gamecube game. Why is everybody so embroiled in the technical sides of things? I don't care! Nothing is mentioned of relevant aspects such as characters and gameplay, he even had the audacity to call Intelligent Systems lazy. Why can't these previewers step aside and stop prioritising the technical side above everything, and why do they state the obvious? <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshnard_d1d9.html" title="User:Ashnard"><font color="green"><b>Ashnard</b></font></a> <sub><strong class="selflink"><b><font color="green">talk</font></b></strong></sub> 21:59, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hell, I don't care. IGN can kiss my ass, IGN has never made a whole video game. New metroid was originally based off of the Echoes engine... it's easiest. Yes, they're revamping everything but with GoD I'd rather just have it now, and as for the Wiimote, it would've been cool... but who FREAKING cares. As long as I get it, it fits in the Wii and I can use A controller, I don't care which one...

<p>Let's face it, Ike's a little bitch, without Ragnell or Aether, he's just a mediocre character. He runs around like a little fart trying to be like his father, well guess what Ike? Gawain would destroy you, Gawain was a real warrior not an acrobatic little loser with a poor strength stat.

<p>You know what, Sanaki's and Sephiran's roles reminds of the Queen and the Primeminister in England, except the Queen isn't <i>really</i> worshipped and Tony Blair isn't the dodgy slut of Tellius politics.

<p>Don't worry Peregrine, I didn't take it the wrong way, I'm not an over-sensitive person.

<dd>OK, rant time, why do Americans <b>always</b> depict the British as the snobbish baddies who eat tea and crumpets, it's SOOOOOOOOOOO annoying, saying that, I actually really like Liquid Snake, he destroys Solidus, Solidus is a bit too old, boring and feeble, where as Liquid seems to have something good to say, whilst also being funny, hey, he kind of reminds me of Ashnard. I think Major Zero's accent is as equally overdone as Liquid's, they're both obviously fake. Ocelot is excellent, everybody around him tries to be the elite but they end up dead, when he always survives, always scheming, and is ultimatley, the real winner, good old Adamska. In MGS 3 he's too inexperienced and not the master he is in the others, and the torture fetish is strange but interesting. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshnard_d1d9.html" title="User:Ashnard"><font color="green"><b>Ashnard</b></font></a> <sub><strong class="selflink"><b><font color="green">talk</font></b></strong></sub> 21:43, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Eww. How could you like Liquid. I don't think he eats tea and crumpets, it's really just that twingy annoying fake british accent that makes me call him that. Yes, the guy that does their voice is NOT british therefore making the accent fake... but Liquid, how can you not hate him? Ahh... so annoying. <a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Peregrine_70b0.html" title="User:Le Peregrine">Peregrine</a> 21:48, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I had very little feelings for Solidus, but I HATE Liquid, I'll call him a British twit up to the day I die. No, not because he does anything particularly "twit" like, I just think he's an annoying little brat. What a twerp, he has the better genes anyway but even if he didn't what a FUCKING RETARDED thing to bitch about (although Ocelot was the one that got him all worked up about it.) Ocelot rocks, he is just fucking awesome okay... so he picked up some "things" from Volgin but he ROCKS that torture shit, yo... and I DON'T WANT to call it a fetish because I think it's more of a FETISH for Volgin, more... of a HOBBY for Adamska. He's good at it, what... he's an "interrogation expert" hehe... oh shalashaska... <a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Peregrine_70b0.html" title="User:Le Peregrine">Peregrine</a> 21:51, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>On that note, Liquid still sucks. I'm sorry that he has to be British because I hate him and it's not because he's British it's because he's annoying but that stupid accent doesn't help regardless of how accurate it is. Sooo... basically, Liquid sucks even if he had a spanish accent, or sounded completely english and never served in Britain I WOULD STILL FUCKING HATE HIM. So I am not stereotyping, if anyone is it's Kojima. BTW: You still like Liquid when he's got Ocelot wearing a leather trench coat, sunglasses and NO revolvers, oh... he's such a good guy for having Ocelot go out like that... when I die I totally wanna die possessed by an annoying guy who slowly eats away at my personality until there is nothing left.

<p>Heh. I don't agree with a lot of things about China. They're communists, no... I don't personally care that that is their system of government. You've got to realize when I am just saying things that we generally say over here in the US and not that I actually mean them wholeheartedly. It's China that I meant, and I could list a lot of reason why I have a distaste for the way they do things over there. All I meant, was if any place would've been that bad I would've imagined it a place like that. I guess, even if they are cruel and strict and... overpopulated they are POLITE.</p>
<p>I hope you realize I don't really generalize against anyone. I state cliches in a half-true half-comical way. I am not biased against anyone. If there is one group of people I AM biased against it's idiot biggots. Please understand that I have a deep empathy for all humans (and animals) no matter where they are from. Bad people do exist everywhere. SO do good people.</p>

<p>Hey. Did you ever use ballistae in Path of Radiance? ...I don't remember doing it, and I can't figure it out. But... I'm sure you can, right? errr... you're smart, you should know...</p>
<p>Okay, I'll stop calling you Perry, Peregrine. You do know that only archers and snipers can use the ballistae, don't you? personally, I've never raised Shinon or Rolf, so I haven't used them in PoR. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshnard_d1d9.html" title="User:Ashnard"><font color="green"><b>Ashnard</b></font></a> <sub><strong class="selflink"><b><font color="green">talk</font></b></strong></sub> 07:04, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, I do... (I'm not a moron.) You never raised Rolf? Ah, no wonder you're such a dick about him. In my game Rolf far surpasses anything Shinon could ever have hoped to be, I am playing thru the game on hard mode because I never beat the Black Knight, and also because I never beat it on hard mode. I'm on the battle where you must meet up with Geoffrey, Whenever I move either unit to the ballista pedestal it doesn't seem to work... there were two shots left as well. I haven't played the game in a while... I tend to leave things saved and complete them ridiculous amounts of time later, sometimes months or years. I guess I'm bad at finishing things............... <a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Peregrine_70b0.html" title="User:Le Peregrine">Peregrine</a> 01:59, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ballistae aren't really that important, you'll never double attack with them, and they aren't really that powerful, it's just a device that tries to compensate for archers inability to fight at close range. I assume that you've got Mist up, right? <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshnard_d1d9.html" title="User:Ashnard"><font color="green"><b>Ashnard</b></font></a> <sub><strong class="selflink"><b><font color="green">talk</font></b></strong></sub> 07:58, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually, in this game Mist is only level 17 and I am using Rhys in this battle because he is so about to promote. (You get no experience in Hard Mode. Well, I'm sure you know.) I still haven't beaten this battle. (Of course, I don't play it very often. Maybe one try per day.) Right at the end last time, stupid Zihark died. Killed by a ballista. (Heh, ironic...) I don't like Zihark... (at all.) I just wanted to use people I didn't use this time around, it turned out to be a bad idea, actually. (Especially considering how many freaking swordmasters I already have. Also you get Lucia in this battle.) It doesn't really matter about the ballista anyway. I don't NEED to use it, I just try to advance quickly in this battle (it is 15 turns arrive and there are two houses that bandits destroy if you are not fast) so there is usually ballista ammo left. I was just wondering if you knew some weird thing, like... maybe PoR just doesn't allow players to use ballista, or what? It's no worries, because I have never used them in this game nor do I need to. Thanks though. <a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Peregrine_70b0.html" title="User:Le Peregrine">Peregrine</a> 13:44, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ike's stats are DIVINE though. I used a lot of items on him... I will destroy the Black Knight this time. No doubt in my mind... that's really the main reason I decided to play thru again. Hehe...

<p>Oh yeah, one more thing. We never talked about it. It is true thT Soren, as Petrine is one of "the marked" but, noone else seems to have that "mark" except dragons. Why? Is Soren half dragon or does EVERY half-bred piece of scum have that "mark" and he was just unlucky enough to be branded right in the middle of his forehead.

<dd>I'm a weirdo then, I'm not really a big fan of music, I know it's strange, but...yeah (I guess I just killed off that conversation). As for Soren, yes he is a branded, and so is Petrine and Stefan, there's a whole backstory to it, and how everyone thought he was a spirit charmer but really he isn't. Everyone assumes that he is half dragon, and that's probably the case considering his appearance. Do you do support conversations? You should, it will help you out in chapters, this chapter is good for mounted units, just make sure you protect the weaklings from the Pirates, and watch for the big boss Paladin. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshnard_d1d9.html" title="User:Ashnard"><font color="green"><b>Ashnard</b></font></a> <sub><strong class="selflink"><b><font color="green">talk</font></b></strong></sub> 07:46, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hehe. I do do supports, with people of my choosing. This time around I did a few weird ones. Janaff and Shinon, although I don't use Shinon much because he honestly sucks this time around. Stefan and Soren, which sucks for me because I have to use Stefan and Soren and they are both too good and don't need the precious experience. Ike and Lethe, which is heartwarming really, I thought she was just a cold blooded evil whore. (I'm just kidding. But look at her...) Err, I won't name them all but yes I do supports. I killed Petrine with Soren and between her and Stefan supports I do know most of the story, I was just wondering if you personally thought he was a dragon because I mean, he does even resemble young Prince Kurthnaga there a lil' bit... I also don't like Swordmasters much but like I said this time through I was trying to do things I didn't the first time. (Like get Stefan, and use people I didn't like. I STILL won't use Sothe or Tormod no matter how much you paid me.) Well, geez. I've been talking a lot. So... <a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Peregrine_70b0.html" title="User:Le Peregrine">Peregrine</a> 15:25, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hah, I criticaled Petrine with Soren using one of the long-range magic tomes, personally, I'd put money on Soren being a Dragon, probably a Black Dragon like Kurthnaga. I actually haven't done that many supports, I've only completed about ten, me and my brother have got about 64% on Rekka no Ken though; I was really dissapointed that there wasn't a support window. It kind of pissed me off. I love support conversations, I really like to know the characters' backstories. I'm not wasting my time on Sothe or Tormod until something like my 13th playthrough. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshnard_d1d9.html" title="User:Ashnard"><font color="green"><b>Ashnard</b></font></a> <sub><strong class="selflink"><b><font color="green">talk</font></b></strong></sub> 18:47, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Like I said, I believe that as well. It is also said that of all Laguz, dragons possess the greatest magic power. Ah, anyway... I'm beat, and I actually sucked at the supports in Rekka no Ken because of the whole no support window thing, it blew.

<p>Most probably, they are the definitely the most enigmatic and cunning, look at Ena and Nasir, it's like the less revealed about the character, the more powerful it is so, in rank of power it would be: Deghinsea, Caineghis, Giffca, Tibarn, Naesala. Deghinsea has been around a <b>long</b> time, so I believe he is better than Caineghis. The Black Dragons are most definitely far more powerful than the Whites and Reds. Later. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshnard_d1d9.html" title="User:Ashnard"><font color="green"><b>Ashnard</b></font></a> <sub><strong class="selflink"><b><font color="green">talk</font></b></strong></sub> 07:11, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Deghinsea has definetely been around since the time the Goddess walked the earth. He'll be around this time too. You're right he is most probably the most powerful of all Laguz. All dragon royalty seems to consist of Black Dragons showing that they are atleast higher in social status but I am assuming this is because they are also the strongest. Although... I love hawks the most, I love Tibarn, Janaff AND Ulki. If I could just... err... well, I am going to be leaving again for a few days, not that YOU WOULD NOTICE.

<dd>Hi - the case probably is that, when you reverted the vandalism part-way, other blatant vandalism was introduced on the diff (from the previously vandalised version) which the bot picked up on and reverted you. Thankfully, you got it back to normal quickly&#160;:) Generally, it's best to take a quick scan through the old revision you're restoring to make sure that it isn't vandalised, and if the user who you are reverting have more than one edit at the top of the history list, go to before the fisrt of these. Hope this helps&#160;:). I'd say that it's no-one's fault, except that of the vandals! <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Mart</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23"><font color="red">inp23</font></a></strong> 17:35, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Same old, same old, I've just been trying to get 100 points on every single level of Yoshi's Island DS; that's quite hard. I'm only two levels away though. Valkyrie Profile?

<p>Valkyrie Profile is a game for the PSP, so... you probably can't play it. It's a remake of the original game <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valkyrie_Profile_392f.html" title="Valkyrie Profile">Valkyrie Profile</a> for Playstation. (However it was rare.) It's pretty much about a <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valkyrie.html" title="Valkyrie">Valkyrie</a> working for the All-Father Odin, she must recruit human souls <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einherjar.html" title="Einherjar">einherjar</a> to fight with the gods in Asgard where a holy battle between the Aesir and the Vanir is taking place. So in a nutshell you recruit people who have died, and then when they are ready you send them to Asgard (So you don't get to keep your people too long but you get plenty more.) It's addictive because the battle system is simple and fun and you meet a lot of interesting people (since they all got killed in some way or another.)... yeah, also you find out how the protaganist, Lenneth.. became a Valkyrie as it is obvious she too was once a mortal. (It pretty much gives that away in the opening sequence, and who she was as well.) I Wish I had a DS... grr... this is the kind of music I listen to by the way... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xav_GYKie2w" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xav_GYKie2w" rel="nofollow">great music</a></p>

<p>If you click on the link to the einherjar it is pretty much the plot of the game, Ragnarok is coming and you need to recruit einherjar to stand beside the aesir when it does... hopefully if you do well enough the "end of the world" doesn't quite happen but there are several different endings to the game. Did you learn about Norse mythology in school at all? Actually, both Sigrun and Mist were Valkyries (in Norse Mythology) there are probably others as well with similar names.</p>
<p>Norse Mythology? I'm actually really interested in it, it's just a shame that the stupid schools over here don't teach it at all except for a minimal introduction to it in Primary school (elementary for you I believe) when learning about the Vikings and the invasion of Britain, yes, we were thw whipping boys then, the Romans, the Anglo-Saxons, the Vikings and the Normans all invaded us. It's the worst, my Primary school teacher didn't even know who Thor was. I clicked on the Youtube link; that was errrrrm...interesting, 10/10 for being unique though. You have a PSP, shame on you Peregrine, buy a DS! I'm a bit time tied, so I haven't had time to look at the game links properly, I'l look over them later, sounds interesting, I like the sort of games that incorporate mythology; the whole, Yggdragsil, Fenrir, Ragnorok thing, forgive me, my knowledge for it is shocking for the reasons given above. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshnard_d1d9.html" title="User:Ashnard"><font color="green"><b>Ashnard</b></font></a> <sub><strong class="selflink"><b><font color="green">talk</font></b></strong></sub> 21:53, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, I can't get enough of that "Sports" song. My friend showed me that stupid show and it's grown on me because of things like that. I just love it when the drummer first says "sports", you're SOO not expecting it. It's a shame you don't know much about it, but you don't even need to to enjoy the game... everything seems a little morbid if you don't know the story of Ragnarok and einherjar though. (It still seems kinda morbid actually.) I love Nintendo, but I love Metal Gear so I need Playstation products. Sorry. I'd easily fork over 600 bucks for a PS3 if Guns of the Patriots was out right now... it's sad... I know.

[this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6TdA0QRTIw" class="external free" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6TdA0QRTIw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6TdA0QRTIw</a>] is a anime video with a symphony x song in it, it's nott he best song but I still like it if you want to check it out.</p>
<p>Nice video, are you also into J pop or J rock or any of that sort of stuff? I assume you like anime, I do too, but I'm not a <b>massive</b> fan, I've only really watched stuff like DBZ and Pokemon, it's the only stuff you can get on my TV, anything else you'd need to download from the computer. It's funny, ever since you mentioned Norse mythology yesterday, I've been thinking about it alot and I've been doing a bit of research on it. I already knew there was a lot of references in Fire Emblem like <a href="../../../g/l/e/Gleipnir.html" title="Gleipnir">Gleipnir</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/d/Nidhogg.html" title="Nidhogg">Nidhogg</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/d/Vidofnir.html" title="Vidofnir">Vidofnir</a> etc. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshnard_d1d9.html" title="User:Ashnard"><font color="green"><b>Ashnard</b></font></a> <sub><strong class="selflink"><b><font color="green">talk</font></b></strong></sub> 21:28, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yep. Like I said, Mist and Sigrun as well. Fire Emblem takes a lot of things from a lot of different types of Mythology. I like anime a little, I dunno... it's okay, I loved Cowboy Bebop but that's the only one I can think of that I really really liked. I don't really like J Pop or J Rock although it can be amusing. I really just like music from people who have exceptional skill, so I listen to all sorts as long as the musicians impress me (or come up with something catchy enough. I am glad you have become interested in Norse Mythology, Egyptian Mythology is also very interesting. <a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Peregrine_70b0.html" title="User:Le Peregrine">Peregrine</a> 22:31, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Egyption mythology err... lets see, Anubis,the guy with the jackal head, isn't he God of the underworld, that's about all I know, again, I should know more. It's weird, yesterday I had an argument with someone at school about the pronunciation of Valkyrie, I pronounce it Valkeery, but he pronounces it Valkiry. Did you get taught Greek mythology?<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshnard_d1d9.html" title="User:Ashnard"><font color="green"><b>Ashnard</b></font></a> <sub><strong class="selflink"><b><font color="green">talk</font></b></strong></sub> 06:50, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Absolutely. I was taught Greek Mythology in World History, we split our class up into the different greek city-states so that a few students would learn about the culture of each, then we had to give presentations. It was fun! Also, I took three years of Latin and even though you'd assume we'd be learning Roman Mythology, they all believe in the same gods (Just different names. Zeus in Greece/Jupiter in Rome) so we studied a lot of both. I'm wanted to sleep in today but my birds always wake me up... I have two Cockatiels in my room and my Grey is in the living room telling me "Good Morning". Haha... I love birds, I don't know why. <a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Peregrine_70b0.html" title="User:Le Peregrine">Peregrine</a> 13:41, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hah, pet birds, classic! All I've got is a lazy lump that we call a cat, he doesn't do much except eat, sleep and steal my seat whenever I get up. You took Latin! Cool, was that in high school (did I get that right)? For ancient Greek cities, I know that the two most powerful were Sparta and Athens, the whole Sparta being a war country and Athens being the cultural, academic one. I believe there is a film just came out that is about the Spartans, called <i>300</i>. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshnard_d1d9.html" title="User:Ashnard"><font color="green"><b>Ashnard</b></font></a> <sub><strong class="selflink"><b><font color="green">talk</font></b></strong></sub> 18:50, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have three pet birds, a cat, and a dog. My dog has been eating some food that was recalled because it caused renal failure, I'm so worried for him but he is acting fine. Yes, I took Latin in highschool. Appearantly people over here think that 300 is politically charged and has referrences to the Iraq war although I have not seen it. I love my cat, he is 13 years old and he is lazy as well and my doggy is a little Miniature Shnauzer. Haha, let's talk about British TV. Do you really watch the stuff that they show over here on BBC, like Wire in the Blood and all that? <a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Peregrine_70b0.html" title="User:Le Peregrine">Peregrine</a> 18:58, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I was just wondering, by the way... because I like that show. I also like how the episodes are so long. If you have an American TV channel it must be demented, that song "Sports" I showed you is from Adult Swim's "Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!" and we have plenty more shows just a screwed up as that. <a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Peregrine_70b0.html" title="User:Le Peregrine">Peregrine</a> 18:59, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>It may sound impresive, I got maxima cum laude in the NLE (National Latin Exam) back in the day, however... I couldn't even get close these days. I hardly remember anything, it's so... complicated. I still have a pure silver medal to prove it though, but if anyone asked me anything about Latin I doubt I would know.</p>
<p>Ahhh, the wonders of British television, how do you know about <i>Wire in the Blood</i>? I've watched it sometimes, it's a good psychological detective/thriller type, Robson Green is a good actor. Have you heard of a program called <i>Cracker</i>, it's quite similar to that but older. Are you interested in British TV? I'll tell you anything you want about it. My favourites include a program called the <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragons%27_Den_c5ae.html" title="Dragons' Den">Dragons' Den</a> (the British version). On a side note, I just got <b>100</b> on <b>every single level</b> on <a href="../../../y/o/s/Yoshi%27s_Island_DS_212a.html" title="Yoshi's Island DS">Yoshi's Island DS</a> without the help of a guide, man, I feel quite proud of myself, and yes, I need to get out more. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshnard_d1d9.html" title="User:Ashnard"><font color="green"><b>Ashnard</b></font></a> <sub><strong class="selflink"><b><font color="green">talk</font></b></strong></sub> 20:17, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Never mind 'sounds impressive', that award <b>is</b> impressive, to obtain an accolade centered on Latin really is an achievement, in the schools over here, only French, German and Spanish are offered. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshnard_d1d9.html" title="User:Ashnard"><font color="green"><b>Ashnard</b></font></a> <sub><strong class="selflink"><b><font color="green">talk</font></b></strong></sub> 21:08, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Good for you! Hehe, it's always fun to get perfect scores in games, that's why I never beat them... sometimes I focus on that too much. I'm not sure about Cracker, I might've seen something about it but I have seen much of the Wire in the Blood series, it was on BBC, and I got the DVDs in the mail from "blockbuster.com", however I think there is much that has not been released here. I do like Robson Green and I watched another show he was in but I didn't like it that much... Touching Evil, or something? I'm not sure... Have you ever seen Hyperdrive? That is also on BBC, it is so hilarious, and it's vulgar even... hehe, my mom loves sci-fi, so I love things that make fun of sci-fi. Eheee... well, you're probably in bed.

<p>I watched Doctor Who before they switched the Doctor Who guy (I've seen some of the episodes with the new guy and I don't like him), now that actor is on a show here called "Heroes" and I like that show alot and it's weird seeing him on it because he looks like a hobo and his accent is practically non-existent. That show is an X-Men rip off though... blah blah, genetic mutations, blah blah, powers. You know the bit, but it turned out to be pretty unique in its own right. Pah, if you hung out with me in real life it'd be worse, I'm always acting like Shinon, infact... I'm a skinny red-head and I wear my hair up all the time and go around acting like a jerk. It's fun... but I really don't look like a dude at all, wait... neither does he... <a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Peregrine_70b0.html" title="User:Le Peregrine">Peregrine</a> 13:26, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Oh, Life on Mars... I have not watched that lately... Isn't that the show about some detective... something involving time travel, uhm... sorry... haven't watched it in a while. However, a bunch of new episodes recorded to my DVR. I do watch a lot of British crime dramas... mostly because they're longer and it's a refreshing difference from all the CSI, Without a Trace, Law and Order bull****, I watched a DVD of a show called Containment I think, with Patrick Stewart and that was an interesting show... what happened to that? <a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Peregrine_70b0.html" title="User:Le Peregrine">Peregrine</a> 13:36, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Maybe that show is in my head! I can't find anything about it, it was more like a Sci-Fi/Crime Drama because it would involve stuff like diseases, parasites, chemicals, and even cloning... I know it existed... <a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Peregrine_70b0.html" title="User:Le Peregrine">Peregrine</a> 13:40, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Shinon is a good guy? Hah, compassion is for the weak, emotion is merely a flaw of mankind, he should have let Rolf die, what sort of <i>man</i> allows Rolf to live? What sort of person admires an incompetent jerk that probably likes Rolf, yeah, I wonder what went on in them "sessions" that Rolf talked about. I've just though, Ashnard was an elitist, he pitied the weak, he cared nothing for pathetic street urchins like Sothe, he was a true warrior. RIP Ashnard!!!!! *cries for an hour*. At least Ashnard didn't get annihalated by that son of a bitch Ike. Wait a minute, you're going to sell me to a paedophile who likes British kids?

<p>Yeah, Doctor Who is campy, and ridiculous... my mom watches it, I was amused by a few of the episodes I've seen though. Yes, Patrick Stewart was somebody of importance... I can't remember exactly what, but he is the main character I believe he had a female partner. I watched a couple episodes of that, I got it from blockbuster.com and I really liked it, it was always very interesting.

<p>So when you drag yourself away from worshiping Shinon, do you watch any British comedy? You probably won't get the humour, most Americans don't, or am I being over presumptuous? <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshnard_d1d9.html" title="User:Ashnard"><font color="green"><b>Ashnard</b></font></a> <sub><strong class="selflink"><b><font color="green">talk</font></b></strong></sub> 14:49, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Gimme an example of a British Comedy. If it airs on BBC I will watch it, trust me... I won't lie about liking it either. I don't find most american humor funny so I just as well may not like British humor, or like you said I might not get it.

<p>Appearantly people are making a big deal about your young prince Harry falling outside of a nightclub. Let me ask you, young sir... what do you do at a nightclub...? You DRINK especially when people are driving you around. People need to let off... They SAY he swung at someone but since they can't conclude that it is the truth, I doubt it is. I would've knocked them all out long ago just for following me around all the time. Cute little Prince Harry... I'd party with him and punch out the camera people for him. <a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Peregrine_70b0.html" title="User:Le Peregrine">Peregrine</a> 00:00, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ah, see. He fell on him... which happens usually between buddies when you are too wasted. Haha, why can't a prince get wasted?

<p>I like sitcoms, but (I know it's not proper comedy) but I like shows that are revolved around a comic theme like <a href="../../../h/a/v/Have_I_Got_News_For_You_715d.html" title="Have I Got News For You">Have I Got News For You</a> and <a href="../../../8/_/o/8_out_of_10_Cats_61c6.html" title="8 out of 10 Cats">8 out of 10 Cats</a>, I also think <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Carr_ae3d.html" title="Jimmy Carr">Jimmy Carr</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Kay_bff1.html" title="Peter Kay">Peter Kay</a> are funny. As for Prince Harry, well, that's the nature of the paparazzi, it's just tough, he'll just have to learn to deal with it instead of being a prat. It may seem harsh, but is naive to be of that stature and not expect that. It's commonplace here, the papparazzi anatgonise celebrities into reacting and they laugh it up when they actually do. Some may rant about it, but it has become a rule of that profession. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshnard_d1d9.html" title="User:Ashnard"><font color="green"><b>Ashnard</b></font></a> <sub><strong class="selflink"><b><font color="green">talk</font></b></strong></sub> 15:08, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, I know how it is. I live in America, that kind of news seems to rule over everything else here. We just soak it up, and we have so many obnoxious celebrities just willing to make fools of themselves... and this whole Anne Nicole Smith thing is sick, I refuse to even read about it because it just seems that pathetic to me. Ah, I feel all dizzy because I just finished running, I have a treadmill and I never get to use it anymore because I am always working but I had a day off.

<p>Go treadmill! Most of the time I think celebrities are as much to blame as the press. I heard about that Anna Nicole Smith thing, were you referring to that wacky judge? You know, the judge of that case who seems to be pursuing a "showbiz" carrer.
