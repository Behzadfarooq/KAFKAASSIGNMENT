<dd>Bwahahah. I was watching SNL tonight and Ashlee Simpson came on for her first song and I was like "This girl cannot sing. This is going to suck." Then she sounded so perfect and I said "I'm telling you now, she's lip synching." And my friend said I was just hatin' on her. And then she comes out for the second number and fucks it all up!

<p>This article is one-sided. How should I fix it? Adding another viewpoint didn't solve it. Am I suppose to just remove the unsupported statements and adjectives? Well, what? Do I need to actually make the removals to get anyone's help on this? Well, if nobody answers in 15 minutes, I'll make the edits and see if anyone has any help on this issue.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Tell me what isn't neutral, then. If I write that Ashlee is wonderful and you write in the next sentence that she's terrible, we certainly don't have <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">NPOV</a> then, do we? Your edit was nothing but extremely hostile POV. Furthermore, I don't really know what more should be said about the SNL incident. I think what I've written covers it pretty well. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 02:24, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It states: "although these are not uncommon techniques and have reportedly been used on SNL in the past.". There are no references or sources cited to back this up. It makes the incident misleading, giving the impression that other performers have attempted this, yet no evidence has been cited.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I could cite common knowledge, I suppose, but <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/ap/20041024/ap_en_tv/people_ashlee_simpson_3" class="external text" title="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/ap/20041024/ap_en_tv/people_ashlee_simpson_3" rel="nofollow">here</a>, an AP story about the incident which mentions that. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 02:30, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Please cite it then. Not everyone who reads the article knows about musical guests on a particular show. Seems suspicious though, an anonymous "insider".
<dl>
<dd>Fine, then, I cited it. Eventually Yahoo will take the article down, though, so it's only a temporary solution. And you can have all the suspicions you want; it's common knowledge that most singers use a guide vocal or lip sync on occasion, if not more frequently than that. Graham's point below is well taken, but it is being treated as notable so I suppose it deserves a reasonable level of detail. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 02:39, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thank you.
<dl>
<dd>If you watched the 60 minutes show, the producer clearly said that he has never seen anyone lip syncing in SNL. The statement: "although these are not uncommon techniques and have reportedly been used on SNL in the past." is unsupported and biased. The SNL incident should be written as it is. If it is a common knowledge that backing vocal tape is being used then there's no point of having it mentioned in the article at all isn't it?
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for registering your opinion. Everything in the article pertaining to the incident is just fine, however. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:30, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, there was a clip of Eminem on VH1 a week later on SNL who did the exact same thing on a much smaller scale. He could be heard singing when his lips weren't moving and his mic was down by his waist. There's your proof, there's your example. It's not hearsay or from an unknown source. It's something you can see firsthand, although the press didn't make a big deal out of it since Eminem is less outspoken about his image. Chiharu</dd>

<p>It says her age is 20, but I recall reading an AP story that cited her as 19, and in an SNL skit last night, they called her "not quite twenty". So, what's her age? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheCustomOfLife_ae8d.html" title="User:TheCustomOfLife">Mike H</a> 01:40, Nov 1, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>My dear Everyking, as abusive edit summaries are one of the lengthy charges listed against you in the current RfC, I would avoid making even more of them. Also, over 15,000 signatures in a mere 10 days is not "nonnotable", and certainly does something to balance out the "rah rah Ashlee" attitude that pervades this article. <a href="../../../r/e/e/User%7EReene_958d.html" title="User:Reene">→Reene</a><a href="../../../r/e/e/User_talk%7EReene_2ef3.html" title="User talk:Reene"><sup>✎</sup></a> 08:41, Jan 15, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My comment was referring to something as garbage. It was directed at the petition, not at the person who added it. And I submit that the petition is indeed nonnotable. It's the internet. It's probably 100 losers who have signed it again and again. I voted to delete the article on the "Gay Nigger Association of America", too. Trolling is almost always nonnotable, aside from a few general articles on the phenomenon. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 08:52, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Something is not trolling simply because you disagree with it. Your comment, however, was abusive: "you've got some nerve, removing the quote while <b>adding that nonnotable garbage</b>." It is not the first time you have called an edit you did not like "garbage" or "nonsense" or what-have-you. And if you do indeed have proof that most or even half of those 15,000 signatures are made by the same person or group of people, please present it. <a href="../../../r/e/e/User%7EReene_958d.html" title="User:Reene">→Reene</a><a href="../../../r/e/e/User_talk%7EReene_2ef3.html" title="User talk:Reene"><sup>✎</sup></a> 08:58, Jan 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you had looked at the petition, each signature usually includes a quote or reason for signing. Duplicate signatures happen, but since a unique email address is required for each one and most people bothered to type out their unique reason for signing, I don't see how this petition could possibly have been signed by under 15,000 people (there are currently over 20,000 signatures). <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilsor_f92e.html" title="User:Silsor">silsor</a> 19:30, Jan 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Early career information</span></h2>
<p>Everyking, please explain this to me: how is the fact that Ashlee Simpson got her mouth washed out with soap and her Alanis album taken away at all encyclopedic, notable, or even interesting? <i>This is not important.</i> Neither is the fact that Ashlee Simpson jumped up on a bed and talked on a phone in a commercial -- aren't we talking about her career <i>now</i>, not her career as a spokesgirl for Kohl's?</p>
<p>I'm really at a loss here. Is all of the information in this article equally valuable? <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadame_Sosostris_2e2c.html" title="User:Madame Sosostris">Madame Sosostris</a> 22:06, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Um, no, it's a biographical article, we're talking about her life in general. If you want an article just about the present period in her life, feel free to create one. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 22:12, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The details of most public figures' childhoods are non-notable (with exceptions -- Michael Jackson, for instance, or perhaps Leopold von Sacher-Masoch). This <i>is</i> a biographical article, but the <i>notable</i> part of Ashlee's life is her career, not her upbringing. Most biographers spend far less time on their subjects' early lives, simply because most children do little that can be considered memorable. Just as an example, I've got Lord Blake's biography of Disraeli here, which clocks in at over seven hundred pages, and barely fifteen of those are spent on the years from birth until age seventeen. Even if she is a notable person, not every part of her life is important enough for inclusion in a general encyclopedia. Were we creating a fansite for teen idols, then these things would be more relevant. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadame_Sosostris_2e2c.html" title="User:Madame Sosostris">Madame Sosostris</a> 22:38, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Alanis/soap story is notable because she frequently tells it in interviews, and because it reflects on her early musical interests and influences. The Kohl's thing is notable because it was her first TV commercial. Both will be restored at the earliest available opportunity if they are removed. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 23:06, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Everyking on keeping those two pieces somewhere. The ad does help answer the question "how did she get onto TV anyway?" The Alanis thing should get a mention too. If it doesn't fit well into this article, it at least belongs in the influences section of the Autobiography album because stories like that are supposed to be the premise. <a href="../../../i/m/e/User%7EIMeowbot_a66d.html" title="User:IMeowbot">iMeowbot</a>~<a href="../../../i/m/e/User_talk%7EIMeowbot_b909.html" title="User talk:IMeowbot">Mw</a></dd>

<dd>I think you could cite Morrisette as an influence on the album, but I don't see why the whole story (with the soap and all) needs to be in there. A 'brief' mention of the commercial -- like, five words or so -- would be fine as well. Every word counts in these situations, and I think things ought to be as streamlined as possible, since these articles are already pretty damn big. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadame_Sosostris_2e2c.html" title="User:Madame Sosostris">Madame Sosostris</a> 07:25, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Discography</span></h2>
<p>I've been checking out this article and the link to her album and I noticed that there are also articles linked from that page about her singles. I was curious if putting up some sort of Discography section on this page would not be helpful. Just a thought, but I worked out a preliminary one below so feel free to build on it or put it up, or let me know if I can!

<dd>Yes, that's entirely consistent with the direction these article need to move.

<dd>To be fair, I see events that have yet to happen being included in articles all the time. I myself have done so. I think there's something in the manual of style about it.

<dd>If it stays extremely basic - country, opening date, closing month -- that would be reasonable. A list of anticipated venues would be crossing the line, though. Not only does that come across as ticket marketing, but those dates aren't all even final yet. Some venues are still subject to change depending on advance sales results, the length of the tour is still elastic, and acts and billing are still being negotiated. One interesting tidbit is about who is <i>not</i> running this tour. If this works out and anyone speaks on the record about why, that would be notable as part of a sea change. <a href="../../../i/m/e/User%7EIMeowbot_a66d.html" title="User:IMeowbot">iMeowbot</a>~<a href="../../../i/m/e/User_talk%7EIMeowbot_b909.html" title="User talk:IMeowbot">Mw</a> 03:39, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Just adding a bit in general here, that note about "on the record" is the reason why the Ashlee Simpson articles have seemed bloaty, and other music articles tend to be short. Pop performers' interviews are so heavily coached, and details like biographical information so heavily filtered through press offices, that they give wildly distorted versions of reality. The official history of some of those songs is hilarious, for example, given that some were shopped as demos well before Ashlee wrote them. The previous aborted album projects are also conspicuously missing. Simply put, official information isn't reliable. <a href="../../../i/m/e/User%7EIMeowbot_a66d.html" title="User:IMeowbot">iMeowbot</a>~<a href="../../../i/m/e/User_talk%7EIMeowbot_b909.html" title="User talk:IMeowbot">Mw</a> 05:00, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't how long that SNL photo has said it was during a "rehearsal," but is there any proof of that? It seems unlikely to me. Why would she be so upset over a rehearsal? Would they have a boom microphone in a position like that for a rehearsal? Would they all be dressed the same way as they were during the show? What about the two guitar players - they look (to me) to be standing in the same positions they were during the actual performance, when they were on the main camera after she had walked away. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 01:55, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just for clarification: SNL dress rehearsals are produced as if they were the real show, so that the material can be substituted in rebroadcasts if the live show has problems. If the dress rehearsal performance had been completed, it probably would have been shown in the western US and in reruns instead of the mess seen live on the east coast.</dd>

<dd>This has all been analyzed to death. She did (try to) sing in the first song segment. There were two distinct copies of the lead vocal audible for the first several seconds, recorded and live.

<p>I think including the petition figure is ridiculous. It's like me counting up all the posts on an Ashlee message board or something. The only point of having it is so people can point at it and say: Oh, look how many people don't like Ashlee! But it's deceptive, because it's probably a few hundred kids, maybe a few thousand. They don't deserve to have that kind of attention given to them—<i>maybe</i> I'd accept it if others would accept some of the other things in the article that were removed for being "trivial", but which were in fact vastly more significant than that figure. It's a double standard, attaching more notability to anti-Ashlee information for no good reason. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 08:40, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

It's very easy for people to bomb a petition with throwaway addresses. Being able to collect 300,000 valid email addresses could mean anything from 300,000 individual people actually signing the petition to one person signing 300,000 times under different identities. Of course, the answer is somewhere in between. But because of the wide variety of possible meanings, I don't see how including this piece of data is appropriate for an (online) encyclopedia. Strong reactions about Ashlee's singing? sure. But I don't see how an internet petition is a reliable source of information that can be used to demonstrate a point, because it can mean anything. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 20:36, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have no objection to either wording, but a link to the petition and the news article which mentions it should remain for verification purposes. I think having a number attached just requires us to keep updating it as the # of signatures increases. But simply based on the volume of signers (even if some of the entries are mickey mouse/donald duck/heywood jablome/etc...) Its much more likely that the real number of signers is going to outweigh the fakes, and as it did make the news its a noteworthy event. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a>™<a href="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b5/Radioactive.svg/18px-Radioactive.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="16" longdesc="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" /></a> 23:20, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Everyking, you only ever want to 'summarise' or 'trim' things that are not favourable to Simpson. It's really irritating to see such flagrant pushing of a POV. The VfD on the tour article does not entitle you to some kind of quid pro quo removal of information which casts her in a bad light.

<dd>Since I was the person who added it, I guess I'll defend it. Considering that she has accomplished relatively little in terms of famous entertainers, I'd be hard pressed to understand how this information is any more or less trivial than any of the other minutea mentioned within the article. Ashlee simpson, by and large, is hardly a person of great accomplishment. That being said, I think the information is important in establishing exactly what kind of a person Ashlee Simpson is; IE, one who is relatively removed from "real life," and not very educated. There is no reason why a person who is successful enough to be in the public eye should not have achieved enough of a level of education or personal knowledge to know who Condoleeza Rice is. It speaks volumes about who Ashlee Simpson is as a person. I fully support removal of a "trivia" section, but I don't think it would be appropriate to remove the information completely. <a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacian_4ea0.html" title="User:Pacian">Pacian</a> 06:44, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Defining place of birth</span></h2>
<p>It's generally difficult to find out a place of birth definitively, short of a statement by the person him/herself. Jessica's place of birth was given wrongly for years; it's even stated wrongly on her own website. For that reason I've never added a place of birth to this article, no matter if there's a statement from the label on the website or not. My personal preference would be not to include it without something more conclusive. Coming at the very beginning of the article makes it very important to get it right. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 16:46, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't like you very much, Everyking, and I have to be honest, I don't think you're a very good Wikipedian. I'd like to inform you, in case you didn't already know, that the users of this website are in fact human persons. I understand that you feel the need to be blunt and use candor about your opinion, but does it actually cause you some kind of physical pain to be polite to others? You seem to have a wicked habit of stating your opinion without actually stating it, and then making it sound like it's the ONLY correct opinion (all the while ignoring the potential effect it may have on others and their feelings.) For instance, above, you are basically saying "Pacian's recent paragraph is not notable, and it should be removed." Well, I happen to disagree, and you don't get to definitively decide what is notable and what is not, sir. It is NOTABLE because for a celebrity to potentially offer an indirect endoresment of a product that is in direct competition with a product they are paid to represent could result in millions of dollars of legal damages, and though it is a developing incident, it is none the less completely legit. As a citation, why not visiting The Smoking Gun (the very website I - GASP - cited!) In all seriousness, you need to start thinking about people's feelings. You don't have to kiss butt, but you could TRY to phrase things more politely and considerately. <a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacian_4ea0.html" title="User:Pacian">Pacian</a> 06:02, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry that you don't like me. I have no particular opinion about you. I am aware of the Smoking Gun link. However, where is the cite for this claim that chewing some other kind of gum could produce some big controversy? Personal speculation isn't notable. If you ask me, if she's just quietly chewing the gum in her dressing room, that wouldn't rationally seem to contradict any contracts, anyway. I don't know who made those papers public, but it certainly wasn't her or her management. So this stuff should be cited. And before it even needs to be included at all, there should be a demonstration of notability. The Smoking Gun thing is arguably very, very marginally notable. But speculation about one particular aspect of it? I think there should be a demonstration of notability for that. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:10, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems to me what it says quite plainly is that he is not allowed to edit articles and that, in fact, the only participation allowed is if he sees vandalism in progress (and if so he is expected to report that to someone else so that they can make the correction.) In other words, coming to a talk page to state that something within the article doesn't belong is *NOT* tantamount to reporting vandalism to an appropriate party. Using a talk page to attempt to get changes made that you would make on your own, if you could, is just an attempt at bypassing the fact that you have been instructed not to make changes. <a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacian_4ea0.html" title="User:Pacian">Pacian</a> 07:17, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd><i>On April 09, 2005, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Smoking_Gun_ef42.html" title="The Smoking Gun">The Smoking Gun</a> posted one of Simpson's concert riders. In it she demands that either <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dentyne.html" title="Dentyne">Dentyne</a> or <a href="../../../o/r/b/Orbit_%28gum%29.html" title="Orbit (gum)">Orbit</a> gum be provided at her venue. This has caused a conflict with her paid commercial endorsement of Liquid Ice mints and gum, part of the <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice_Breakers_2fc3.html" title="Ice Breakers">Ice Breakers</a> mint and gum line. Ice Breakers are a product of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hershey.html" title="Hershey">Hershey</a> corporation, while Dentyne is made by <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadbury.html" title="Cadbury">Cadbury</a> and Orbit is made by <a href="../../../w/r/i/Wrigley.html" title="Wrigley">Wrigley</a>. Aligning herself in any fashion with mint or gum products made by the competitors of the company for whom she is a paid commercial endorser is cause for major legal action, though whether anything will come of it remains to be seen. Also of note in this report is a mention of "pre-recorded sequences" which could potentially include vocals, something Simpson claims to have stopped using as recently as April 8 in a Sun-Sentinel.com interview by Jon Bream regarding her Florida tour leg: "'There will be no backing vocal tracks at all,' Ashlee Simpson said of her current tour". <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/features/lifestyle/sfl-liashleeapr09,0,5159381.story" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/features/lifestyle/sfl-liashleeapr09,0,5159381.story" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></i></dd>

<dl>
<dd>On April 24, 2005, she appeared in an episode of the MTV celebrity prank show Punk'd. She was the subject of a prank in which she was set up to think that her jacket had caught on fire due to being placed near a candle, causing the overhead sprinklers in the art museum she was in to go off, thus ruining the paintings in the room. She became upset when confronted about it, but then laughed and was playfully angry when the prank was revealed to her by the show's host, Ashton Kutcher.</dd>

<dd>A subject near and dear to my heart. Is there a directory of fan sites that could replace the separate fan site links? Also, I don't think we need the SNL incident in three formats. Unless the MPEG one is of significantly lower quality, I think having just that one will suffice (MPEG is the nearest to a "free" format of the three, and also has the widest compatibility). --<a href="../../../w/e/y/User%7EWeyes_aab8.html" title="User:Weyes">W</a>(<a href="../../../w/e/y/User_talk%7EWeyes_0fbf.html" title="User talk:Weyes">t</a>) 03:33, 2005 Jun 23 (UTC)

<dd>Unfortunately you seem to lack an understanding of what's important about her image. If you're not going to mention the hair, there's no point in even having an image &amp; style section. You can't adequately discuss it at all without mentioning the hair. You'd have to talk about how she had a more rock-oriented image than her sister without mentioning the huge component in that, that she dyed her hair dark. It would be like deliberately tip-toeing around it. So what do I have to do to prove this to you, aside from just arguing? What sort of evidence can I present? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 4 July 2005 17:40 (UTC)

Suggest you have a look at the articles on <a href="../../../k/y/l/Kylie_Minogue_fac0.html" title="Kylie Minogue">Kylie Minogue</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madonna_%28entertainer%29.html" title="Madonna (entertainer)">Madonna</a> - the former doesn't mention hair once, while the latter does mention hair and images changes, because these were rather crucial to Madonna's success. If Simpson dyed her hair to differentiate herself from her sister, that's worth mentioning (briefly) - subsequent changes in hairstyle aren't. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 4 July 2005 17:48 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good one, Everyking? Say, old boy, do you happen to know what brand of peanut butter she prefers? I think that's notable. In the meantime, I am going to start work on a branch article, Styles and recolourations of Ashlee Simpson's hair.

<p>OK, if we are going to remove entirely notable info on her hairstyle, we ought to also remove the stuff about the supposed "astroturfing". If the hair is non-notable and <i>that</i> is, then that's stepping over the line into absurdity. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 4 July 2005 17:56 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't get that at all... how is her dying her hair as or more notable than her PR people engaging in a pretty widespread astroturfing campaign to artificially inflate sympathy for her? <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size: 74%;">BLANKFAZE</b></a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size:90%;">(что</b><b style="font-size:70%;">??</b><b style="font-size:90%;">)</b></a> 4 July 2005 18:18 (UTC)

<li>I'd say the astroturfing is quite notable. A celebrity considered by many to be fake had two major negative career incidents in the space of a few months. Her ferociously bungling PR machine then tried to create some positive buzz by inventing fake message board users, and they got caught at it. (I might add-- advertising, let alone advertising that poses as communication from a disinterested party, is a violation of the Terms of Use of most internet message boards.) Talk about putting out fire with gasoline! As far as the hairstyle info, as I stated in my initial comment, I don't think it needs to be 100% absent from the section, I just think the first mention covers it and the rest is overkill. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyraider_7d6f.html" title="User:Skyraider">Skyraider</a> 5 July 2005 05:17 (UTC)

<p>Everyking, my boy... I think Worldtraveller is here for the same reason as many of us are — to try to maintain some semblance of encyclopaedic quality at this article. Lord knows if we let you out on your own, we'd have a 70k article full of everything from her hairstyles to the brand of nail polish she uses, not to mention ten or so branch articles... We just want to keep it professional, here, buddy.

<dd>You have either misread the situation or heard wrongly from others. I have no desire whatsoever to include anything but notable info in the article. It was me trying to get the ext links section reduced, the trivia section removed, and the "astroturfing" bit removed. As compared to <i>one</i> thing, the changed hair color, which I wanted to stay.

<dd>I do consider myself an inclusionist, but a moderate one. What I meant is I don't believe in including non-notable trivia. And yes, I think the hair is more notable than the astroturfing. The astroturfing is very obscure. I don't think it made any papers or magazines or onto TV. (I, as a fan, didn't even <i>know</i> about it until someone added it here! Apparently it's just been something discussed on some net forums.) On the other hand, the changed hair is very well known. It has been on TV, in the magazines, all her fans know about it. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 6 July 2005 19:08 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mentor here. I believe the anonymous user was wrong to simply revert Everyking, probably knowing that EK is not allowed to revert the article back.

Worldtraveller, Everyking's recent edit was not egregious. Please try discussing the edits and come to an agreement.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The problem is that we don't know if she was lip syncing or merely singing along to the track to support her weakened voice (I have also heard the argument that she sang along at first but then quit when it became clear her voice could not handle it). In fact this is not something we can determine, so we can't say it's "what she was doing". We have two versions: Ashlee said that she was singing along with the track (I'll grant she was never particularly emphatic or persistent about that claim, but one can hardly blame her for not wanting to rehash it), while many of her critics (speculatively) say it was simple lip syncing, and indeed this is a perception shared by most of the casually aware public. So. My position is that you balance this out, as per standard NPOV practice, by not endorsing either version and stating it in a neutral way that nobody can contest. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 18:32, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Neutral? 24.195.29.118 17:09, 19 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Exactly my opinion. The illness claim is quite irrelevant to whether lip synching was occurring or not, and the tone of the sentence is that of a defensive fan, not a neutral encyclopaedia. NPOV does <b>not</b> mean we give equal credence to opposing theories, or use a tone which seems to endorse either of them; if one situation is widely accepted, then it should be reported as such, while the opposite view might be mentioned as existing but not promoted. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 17:16, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>By this logic every popular misconception in the world would be stated as fact. If you think my version is <i>promoting</i> one point of view, well, I don't know what to say to you. It plainly isn't. Your preferred version most certainly <i>is</i> promoting one point of view, though, because <i>it states as fact something that is disputed and has been denied by the person being accused of it</i>. It's really pretty simple, which makes it all the more exasperating. You think I write like a "defensive fan" in tone, OK, you rewrite it then. If your issue is only with the tone and not with what is actually stated, then we shouldn't be having a dispute about this. My purpose is to have a neutral tone. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 18:12, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

Then there's the footage from the reality show, and the fact that we already knew months before that she had this ailment which sometimes affected her voice. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 04:12, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would not consider the reality show to be a reliable reference: more along the lines of historical fiction than biography, and thus good for general outlines, but not specific details. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 04:22, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Ha, ha. Well, it's footage. They don't call it a reality show for nothing. But still, there's the 60 Minutes segment. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 07:06, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't dispute that she was sick, but to state as fact that the only response to her illness was to proceed with a backing vocal presupposes that there were no other options. SNL could have proceeded with an alternate musical guest (On any given night in New York, there are plenty of world class musicians who would be available for a last-minute substitution). Or the show could have proceeded with no musical performance at all. (SNL prepares 2 hours of material per show, of which the best 90 minutes sees broadcast. They could easily have resurrected some of the material they dropped after dress rehearsal to fill time).--<a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyraider_7d6f.html" title="User:Skyraider">Skyraider</a> 21:58, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That's a weird thing to say, because I am not proposing that was their only option. In any case it's well known they commonly use backing tracks on the show (even the week afterward Eminem was caught, albeit far less obviously, apparently using a track), so your opinion that you're going on about is off-base. But that's beside the point. Explain to me how saying that she apparently used the track because she was sick presupposes that there were no other options. It seems simple to me, but let's try an analogy. Say I have a cold but I go to work anyway. If, later on, I mention to someone that I went into work even though I had a cold, that person isn't going to think that I'm claiming, from a theoretical perspective, that there were no other options available, such as calling in sick and staying home, or for that matter driving my car off a bridge. Rather they will implicitly understand that there were other options, but I chose not to take them. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 04:48, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Saying "although she apparently needed" gives the impression that the article endorses that viewpoint; saying "she claimed she needed" simply reports her claim, and is thus more NPOV. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 11:30, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Worldtraveller has got it right. Everyking, your situation really isn't analogous at all, because you're not making any claim of necessity. "she apparently used the track because she was sick" is not the language that was in the article. The word was "needed". Suppose Lorne Michaels took one of the options that eliminated Ashlee Simpson's performance from the broadcast. Would she still have needed a backing track? Obviously not. Therefore, her illness alone did not necessitate it.--<a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyraider_7d6f.html" title="User:Skyraider">Skyraider</a> 17:12, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We're having this argument just because of the word "needed"? Good lord, I don't care if it says "needed" or "used". If it says "used", then will you agree to the change? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 19:18, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, the sentence is fine as it is. As per worldtraveller, it is more NPOV to use "she claimed she needed". --<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrfixter_3580.html" title="User:Mrfixter">Mrfixter</a> 19:38, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

<p>Surely there is no question that she was lip synching? If she was 'using a pre-recorded vocal track' what else can you call it?

<dd>I've explained this to you already. One can use a <i>backing track</i> to <i>enhance</i> one's vocals while still singing. Lip-syncing means just moving the lips. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 23:59, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
