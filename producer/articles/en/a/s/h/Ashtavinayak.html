<p>This is the most important temple on this tour. The temple, built from black-stone during the <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bahamani.html" title="Bahamani">Bahamani</a> reign, has four gates (It is supposed to have been built by one of the knights named Mr. Gole, from the court of Bidar's Sultan). The temple is situated in the centre of the village. The temple is covered from all sides by four <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minarets.html" title="Minarets">Minarets</a> and gives feeling of a <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosque.html" title="Mosque">mosque</a> if seen from a distance. This may have been done to prevent attacks on the temple during <a href="../../../m/u/g/Mughal.html" title="Mughal">mughal</a> periods. The temple has 50feet tall wall around it.</p>

<p>There is a nandi (<a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiva.html" title="Shiva">Shiva</a>'s bull) sitting in front of this temple entrance, which is somewhat odd as nandi is normally in front of the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiva.html" title="Shiva">Shiva</a> temples. However, the story says that this statue was being carried to some Shivamandir during which the vehicle carrying it broke down and the nandi statue could not be removed from its current place.</p>
<p>The idol of Lord Ganesha, riding a peacock, in the form of Mayureshwara is believed to have slain the demon Sindhu at this spot. The idol, with its trunk turned to the left, has a cobra (<i>Nagaraj</i>) poised over it protecting it. The idol also has two other idols of Siddhi (Capability) and Buddhi (Intelligence).</p>
<p>However, this is not the original idol -which is said to have been consecrated twice by Brahma, once before &amp; once after being destroyed by the demon Sindhurasur. The original idol, smaller in size and made of atoms of sand, iron &amp; diamonds was supposedly enclosed in Copper sheet by the Pandavas and is placed behind the one that is worshipped.</p>
<p>The temple is situated at a distance of 56 km from Pune, next to the river Karha in the village of <a href="http://www.wikimapia.org/#y=18276017&amp;x=74321437&amp;z=14&amp;l=19&amp;m=a|" class="external text" title="http://www.wikimapia.org/#y=18276017&amp;x=74321437&amp;z=14&amp;l=19&amp;m=a|" rel="nofollow">Moregaon</a>. The village derives its name from the <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi.html" title="Marathi">Marathi</a></i> name of the bird <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peacock.html" title="Peacock">peacock</a> - also the national bird of India; there used to be a lot of peacocks in this village in the ancient time, and the village is also set out in the shape of a peacock.</p>

<p>It is believed that the two saints Shri Morya Gosavi and Shri Narayan maharaj of Kedgaon received their enlightenment here.</p>
<p>The temple is North-facing and is on a small hillock. The main road towards the temple was believed to built by <a href="../../../p/e/s/Peshwa.html" title="Peshwa">Peshwa</a>'s general Haripant Phadake. The inner sanctum, 15feet high and 10feet wide is built by Punyashloka <a href="../../../a/h/i/Ahilyabai_Holkar_fe5e.html" title="Ahilyabai Holkar">Ahilyabai Holkar</a>. The idol is 3feet tall and 2.5feet wide. The idol faces North-direction. The stomach of the idol is not wide, but Riddhi and Siddhi idols are sitting on one thigh. This idol's trunk is turning to the right. <b>The right-sided-trunk Ganesha is supposed to be very strict for the devotees</b>. To make one round (<a href="../../../p/r/a/Pradakshina.html" title="Pradakshina">pradakshina</a>) around the temple one has to make the round trip of the hillock. This takes about 30 minutes with moderate speed.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/e/s/Peshwa.html" title="Peshwa">Peshwa</a> general Haripant Phadake lost his <a href="../../../g/e/n/General.html" title="General">General</a>'s position and did 21 Pradakshina around the temple. On the 21st day <a href="../../../p/e/s/Peshwa.html" title="Peshwa">Peshwa</a>'s court-man came and took him to the court with royal honor. Haripant promised the God that he will bring the stones of the castle which he will win from the first war he will fight as the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General.html" title="General">general</a>. The stone pathway is built from the Badami-Castle which was attacked by Haripant soon after he became the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General.html" title="General">general</a>.</p>

<p>The original wooden temple was reconstructed in to a stone temple by Nana Phadanavis in 1760AD. There are two small lakes constructed on two sides of the temple. One of them is reserved for the puja (worship) of the deity.</p>
<p>This Temple faces the east and has two sanctums. The inner one houses the idol and has a rat idol with Modak in his forepaws in front of it. The hall, supported by eight exquisitely carved pillars demands as much attention as the idol, sitting on throne carved like a Cyprus tree. The eight pillars depict the eight directions. Inner sactum is 15feet tall and outer one is 12feet tall. The temple is constructed in such a way that after the winter (dakshinayan&#160;: southward movement of the sun) solstice, the sun rays fall on the Ganesha idol at sunrise. The temple is built with stones which are stuck together very tight using melted lead.</p>
<p>Like a few other idols, this one too has diamonds embedded in the eyes and navel, and with his trunk pointing to the left.</p>
<p>The temple is located in the town of <a href="http://www.wikimapia.org/#y=18535159&amp;x=73224033&amp;z=18&amp;l=19&amp;m=a|" class="external text" title="http://www.wikimapia.org/#y=18535159&amp;x=73224033&amp;z=18&amp;l=19&amp;m=a|" rel="nofollow">Pali</a>, off the Mumbai-Pune highway, about 11 km before <a href="http://www.wikimapia.org/#y=18540082&amp;x=73141029&amp;z=16&amp;l=19&amp;m=a|" class="external text" title="http://www.wikimapia.org/#y=18540082&amp;x=73141029&amp;z=16&amp;l=19&amp;m=a|" rel="nofollow">Nagothane</a> on the Mumbai-Goa highway.

This is a very rare idol which is facing the West. The story says that this idol was the same one which was thrown by Ballala's father (Kalyani-seth) while Ballala was worshipping it.</p>
<p>It seems that the devotees first worship Shri Dhundi-Vinayak and then Shri Ballaleshwar.</p>

<p>The handsome Prince Rukmangad refused sage Vachaknavi's wife Mukunda's illicit call, and was cursed to suffer from leprosy. Mukunda was satisfied by <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indra.html" title="Indra">Indra</a> who deceived her as Rukmangad and she bore a child by name Grutsamad. When Grutsamad came to know about the real story he cursed his mother Mukunda to become the tree of Bori and she in turn cursed him to bore a demon son named Tripurasur, the one who was defeated by <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiva.html" title="Shiva">Shiva</a> after praying the Ranjangaon Ganesha. Grutsamad after getting cursed went to the forest of Pushpak and worshipped Ganesha. Sage Grutsamad is famous for the mantra <i>GaNanaN Tva</i>. He founded the temple and called this Ganesha: Varada-Vinayak.</p>
<p>Ganesha is said to reside here in the form of Varada Vinayaka, the giver of bounty and success. The idol was found in the adjoining lake (to Mr. Dhondu Paudkar in 1690AD), in an immersed position and hence its weathered look. In 1725AD the then Kalyan subhedar, Mr. Ramji Mahadev Biwalkar built <a href="http://www.wikimapia.org/#y=18810255&amp;x=73301452&amp;z=17&amp;l=19&amp;m=a|" class="external text" title="http://www.wikimapia.org/#y=18810255&amp;x=73301452&amp;z=17&amp;l=19&amp;m=a|" rel="nofollow">the Varadavinayak temple</a> and the village of Mahad.</p>
<p>The idol faces the east, has its trunk to the left and has been in the constant company of an oil lamp - said to be burning continuously since 1892.

Shri Chintamani, Theur</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Ganesha is believed to have got back the precious Chinatamani jewel from the greedy Guna for sage Kapila at this spot. However, after bringing back the jewel, sage Kapila put it in Vinayaka's (Ganesha's) neck. Thus the name Chintamani Vinayak. This happened under the Kadamb tree, therefore Theur is known as Kadambanagar in old times.</p>
<p>The lake behind the temple is called Kadambteertha. The temple entrance is North facing. The outer wooden hall is built by <a href="../../../p/e/s/Peshwa.html" title="Peshwa">Peshwas</a>. The main temple is supposed to have been built by Dharanidhar Maharaj Dev from the family-lineage of Shri Moraya Gosavi. He must have built this around 100 years before Senior Shrimant Madhavrao <a href="../../../p/e/s/Peshwa.html" title="Peshwa">Peshwa</a> built the outer wooden hall.</p>
<p>This idol also has a left trunk, with carbuncle and diamonds as its eyes. The idol faces the East side.</p>

<p>The temple is located 22 km from Pune, off the Pune-Solapur highway, and is hence the nearest from Pune. The village of Theur sits at the confluence of three major regional rivers—Mula, Mutha &amp; Bhima.</p>

Shri Girijatmaj, Lenyadri</div>

</div>
<p>It is believed that Parvati (<a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiva.html" title="Shiva">Shiva</a>'s wife) performed penance to beget Ganesha at this point. Girija's (Parvati's) Atmaj (son) is Girijatmaj. This temple stands amidst a cave complex of 18 caves of Buddhist origin. This temple is the 8th cave. These are called Ganesh-leni as well. The temple is carved out of a single stone hill, which has 307 steps. The temple features a wide hall with no supporting pillars. The temple hall is 53feet long, 51feet wide and 7feet in height.</p>
<p>The idol faces north with its trunk to the left, and has to be worshipped from the rear of the temple. The temple faces south. This idol seems to be little different from the rest of the Ashtavinayak idols in a sense that it appears to be not very well designed or carved like the other idols. This idol can be worshipped by anyone. There is no electric bulb in the temple. The temple is constructed such that during the day it is always lighted up by the sun-rays!</p>
<p>The entry fee to this temple is 5Rs. for Indian citizens and 2USD for Foreign nationals.</p>

Shri Vighneshwar Vinayak, Ozhar</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The history encompassing this idol states that Vighnasur, a demon was created by the King of Gods, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indra.html" title="Indra">Indra</a> to destroy the prayer organized by King Abhinandan. However, the demon went a step further and destroyed all vedic, religious acts and to answer the people's prayers for protection, Ganesh defeated him. The story goes on to say that on being conquered, the demon begged and pleaded with Ganesha to show a mercy. Ganesha then granted in his plea, but on the condition that demon should not go to the place where Ganesha worshipping is going on. In return the demon asked a favour that his name should be taken before Ganesha's name, thus the name of Ganesha became Vighnahar or Vighneshwar (Vighna in Sanskrit means a sudden interruption in the ongoing work due to some unforeseen, unwarranted event or cause). The Ganesha here is called Shri Vighneshwar Vinayak.</p>
<p>The temple faces east and is surrounded by a thick stone wall. One can walk on the wall. The main hall of the temple is 20feet long and the inner hall is 10feet long. This idol, facing the east, has its trunk towards the left and rubies in its eyes. There is a diamond on the forehead and some jewel in the navel. Idols of Riddhi and Siddhi are placed on the two sides of the Ganesha idol. The temple top is Golden and is possibly built by Chimaji Appa after defeating the Portuguese rulers of Vasai and Sashti. The temple is probably built around 1785AD.</p>

<p><a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiva.html" title="Shiva">Shiva</a> is believed to have worshipped Ganesha before fighting the demon Tripurasura here. The temple was built by <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiva.html" title="Shiva">Shiva</a> where he worshipped Ganesha, and the town he set up was called Manipur which is now known as Ranjangaon.</p>
<p>The idol faces the east, is seated in a cross-legged position with a broad forehead, with its trunk pointing to the left. It is said that the original idol is hidden in the basement, having 10 trunks and 20 hands and is called Mahotkat, however, the temple authorities deny existence of any such idol.</p>
<p>Constructed so that the rays of the sun fall directly on the idol (during the Southward movement of the sun), the temple bears a distinct resemblance to the architecture reminiscent of the 9th and 10th Centuries and faces the east. Shrimant Madhavrao <a href="../../../p/e/s/Peshwa.html" title="Peshwa">Peshwa</a> used to visit this temple very often and built the stone sanctum around the idol and in 1790AD Mr. Anyaba Dev was authorised to worship the idol.</p>
