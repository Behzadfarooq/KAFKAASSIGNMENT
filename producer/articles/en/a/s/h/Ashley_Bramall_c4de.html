<p>Bramall's family were wealthy merchants from <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hampshire.html" title="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>, but his mother was a convinced <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">socialist</a> and did much to convince her son to support the left in politics. He attended <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_School_ce9b.html" title="Westminster School">Westminster School</a> briefly, before moving to Canford School for the benefit of his health. He went up to <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magdalen_College%2C_Oxford_3b41.html" title="Magdalen College, Oxford">Magdalen College, Oxford</a> in the mid 1930s to read Philosophy, Politics and Economics. He was elected to chair the <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_University_Labour_Club_a0b9.html" title="Oxford University Labour Club">Oxford University Labour Club</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>. At <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_University_9d97.html" title="Oxford University">Oxford</a> he was an active debater at the <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_Union_Society_6bdb.html" title="Oxford Union Society">Oxford Union Society</a> where he often debated with <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Heath_fd9a.html" title="Edward Heath">Edward Heath</a>. He was Treasurer of the Union in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>.</p>
<p>On the outbreak of war Bramall joined the Northamptonshire Yeomanry and he served in the Reconnaissance Corps and at the Army Staff College in Camberley, being promoted to Major. After the end of the war he served in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> in the Allied administration. His younger brother <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edwin_Bramall_3f9d.html" title="Edwin Bramall">Edwin</a> (known as 'Dwin') was much later to be appointed Chief of the Defence Staff and created Lord Bramall.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashley_Bramall_c4de.html" title="Edit section: Parliament">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Parliament</span></h2>
<p>Bramall had already begun his political career by fighting <a href="../../../f/a/r/Fareham_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_32ab.html" title="Fareham (UK Parliament constituency)">Fareham</a> for the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1945_2336.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1945">1945 general election</a>, and when a vacancy occurred at <a href="../../../b/e/x/Bexley_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_b3a6.html" title="Bexley (UK Parliament constituency)">Bexley</a> he was selected to fight the <a href="../../../b/y/-/By-election.html" title="By-election">by-election</a>. During the campaign the Government was forced to introduce rationing of bread, which had never been needed during the war, and many were impressed that Bramall managed to win the seat narrowly. He made a successful <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maiden_speech.html" title="Maiden speech">maiden speech</a> outlining the difficulties in administering Germany and removing <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazi</a>-controlled institutions of government.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1950_5ee5.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1950">1950 election</a>, Bramall lost his seat by 133 votes to his old University adversary <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Heath_fd9a.html" title="Edward Heath">Edward Heath</a> with whom he always remained personally friendly. He had already taken up a career outside politics by reading for the Bar, and was called in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a> to the <a href="../../../i/n/n/Inner_Temple_3dd9.html" title="Inner Temple">Inner Temple</a>. He specialized in landlord and tenant issues. He tried to win Bexley back in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>, and also made an unsuccessful attempt at <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watford.html" title="Watford">Watford</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashley_Bramall_c4de.html" title="Edit section: Municipal affairs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Municipal affairs</span></h2>
<p>Bramall was active in local politics in the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_Borough_of_Westminster_c681.html" title="Metropolitan Borough of Westminster">Metropolitan Borough of Westminster</a> although the local boundaries made it extremely difficult for Labour candidates to win seats. The boundaries had been the same since <a href="../../../1/9/0/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a> and in the mid-<a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> the Council decided to change them, using the Rateable Value of property as one way of making each ward equal in size. The local Labour Party, under Bramall's guidance and advocacy, challenged this method at a public inquiry and persuaded the Boundary Commissioner to accept a new scheme for the wards which Bramall had drawn up.</p>
<p>After this boundary change took effect in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a> the Labour Party won enough seats to elect him as an Alderman. He was elected as a councillor to the new <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Westminster_d04f.html" title="City of Westminster">Westminster City Council</a>; when he lost his seat in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a> the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative</a> group blocked his election as an Alderman. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a> he was elected to the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_County_Council_f90c.html" title="London County Council">London County Council</a> and made the transition to the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_London_Council_1b7c.html" title="Greater London Council">Greater London Council</a> when that body was set up in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>; he was one of eight people to serve as a member of the GLC throughout its existence.</p>
<p>Membership of the GLC made him an <i>ex officio</i> member of the <a href="../../../i/n/n/Inner_London_Education_Authority_4e78.html" title="Inner London Education Authority">Inner London Education Authority</a> and Bramall specialized in education issues. He was Chairman of ILEA from <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a> until Labour lost power in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>. He was then chosen to lead the Labour Group. Labour won back control in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a> and Bramall then became Leader of the authority.</p>
<p><a name="Leader_of_ILEA" id="Leader_of_ILEA"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashley_Bramall_c4de.html" title="Edit section: Leader of ILEA">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Leader of ILEA</span></h2>
<p>In the controversy over education in the 1970s, Bramall stood firmly behind comprehensive schools as a way of raising the educational achievements of most pupils. He was opposed to the use of corporal punishment and had it banned. However, his generally strong leadership did not prevent the scandal over the William Tyndale Junior School in <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islington.html" title="Islington">Islington</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>. He was given a Knighthood in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>. Under Bramall, Labour retained control of ILEA in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a> despite losing the GLC election. He was under pressure to stand as a candidate to replace <a href="../../../r/e/g/Reg_Goodwin_ba33.html" title="Reg Goodwin">Reg Goodwin</a> as Labour Leader on the GLC in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>, but resisted because he wanted to continue at ILEA.</p>
<p>When Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister she put pressure on local authorities, and especially on ILEA, to cut spending. Bramall was opposed but was not willing to go along with the far left demands for an outright confrontation and legal defiance. This made the left determined to replace him, and when Labour won GLC control in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a> with a new left-wing majority, Bramall was voted out as ILEA leader. Knowing this was going to happen, Bramall had cleared out his office and left a note to his replacement on the desk before going to the meeting where the vote for leader was to take place.</p>
<p>Bramall remained on the authority and continued to fight for moderate policies, and it was a sign of the respect which the left had for him that they were prepared to chose him as figurehead Chairman of the Authority.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashley_Bramall_c4de.html" title="Edit section: Retirement">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Retirement</span></h2>
<p>Bramall made an unsuccessful attempt to remain on the directly-elected ILEA in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a> at <a href="../../../p/u/t/Putney.html" title="Putney">Putney</a>. He was well-regarded by Officers of ILEA, especially after the succession of weak far-left leaderships that followed. At his memorial service, a former Chief Officer remarked <i>"Under Ashley Bramall, the ILEA never found it necessary to have a foreign policy"</i>.</p>
<p>In his retirement, Bramall held many public appointments including Directorships of the Museum of London, Chairman of the Westminster College of Further Education, and Honorary Secretary of the Theatres Advisory Council. He remained active in local politics as chair of his local party branch and surprised many by his willingness to undertake menial tasks such as delivering leaflets while in his 80s. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> he acted as Agent in a local byelection which saw Mair Garside, formerly his Deputy at ILEA, elected to Westminster City Council.</p>
<p>He had appeared on <i><a href="../../../m/a/s/Mastermind_%28television%29.html" title="Mastermind (television)">Mastermind</a></i> while Leader of ILEA in 1976, taking "British politics since 1918" as his specialized subject, and was an active member of the Masterminders' club. His second wife, Gery Bramall (who was a fellow Westminster Councillor), was also on the show.</p>
