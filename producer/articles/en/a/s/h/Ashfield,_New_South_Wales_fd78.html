<p>Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the area now known as Ashfield was home to the Wangal people. Their territory was believed to be centred on modern-day <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concord%2C_New_South_Wales_821c.html" title="Concord, New South Wales">Concord</a> and stretched east to the swampland of Long Cove Creek (now known as <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawthorne_Canal_9114.html" title="Hawthorne Canal">Hawthorne Canal</a>). The land was heavily wooded at the time with tall <a href="../../../e/u/c/Eucalypt.html" title="Eucalypt">eucalypts</a> covering the higher ground and a variety of swampy trees along Iron Cove Creek. The arrival of the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Fleet_d34c.html" title="First Fleet">First Fleet</a> in 1788 had a devastating effect on the local people, mainly from the introduction of <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smallpox.html" title="Smallpox">smallpox</a>, to which the indigenous people had little resistance.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_coupe"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/s/h/Ashfield%2C_New_South_Wales_fd78.html#endnote_coupe" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/s/h/Ashfield%2C_New_South_Wales_fd78.html#endnote_coupe" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>By 1790, a road had been built between the colony's two settlements at Sydney Cove and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parramatta%2C_New_South_Wales_dab2.html" title="Parramatta, New South Wales">Parramatta</a>. This rough track later became the main artery of the expanding Greater Sydney and, as the northern boundary of what is now Ashfield, dictated early British settlement in the area. The first land grant in the area was made to Rev Richard Johnson in 1793 and all of it had been granted by 1810. By the 1820s, all the grants had been amalgamated into two large estates: Ashfield Park (the northern half between Liverpool Rd and Parramatta Rd) and Canterbury Estate (the area south of Liverpool Rd). Ashfield Park was named by Robert Campbell, whose father was the laird of Ashfield in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>.</p>

<p>In 1838, Elizabeth Underwood, then owner of Ashfield Park, subdivided part of her land to form the village of Ashfield between Liverpool Rd and Alt St. Part of the subdivision was the building of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._John_the_Baptist%27s_Anglican_Church%2C_Ashfield%2C_Sydney_650f.html" title="St. John the Baptist's Anglican Church, Ashfield, Sydney">St John's Church</a> in Alt St in 1841. This is the oldest surviving building in Ashfield. By 1855, the village had about 70 houses and 200 residents. However, the opening of the Sydney-Parramatta railway line that year, with Ashfield as one of its six original stations, led to a population explosion. In 1872, there were enough residents for the area to be granted a <a href="../../../m/u/n/Municipal.html" title="Municipal">municipal</a> council. By 1890, the population had grown to 11,000.</p>
<p>During this time, Ashfield was seen as a highly desirable location compared to the city, which had become crowded and pestilent. Many grand <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_architecture.html" title="Victorian architecture">Victorian</a> houses were built in the latter part of the 19th century. But by the time of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, the suburb had fallen out of favour and the rich residents had mostly headed for the North Shore. Many of the grand homes were knocked down in the 1920s and 30s and replaced with small <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_deco.html" title="Art deco">art deco</a> blocks of flats or semi-detached houses. A few remain, however, and are listed in the <a href="#Landmarks" title="">Landmarks</a> section.</p>
<p>By the 1950s, the population of Ashfield had begun to fall, as it had in many surrounding suburbs, as people moved to newer houses on larger blocks of land on the urban fringe. The Council's response was to start approving large blocks of flats, many of which were built during the 1960s and 70s but which also continue to be built today. There is, however, recognition of the area's heritage with many buildings in the suburb protected by heritage orders.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_pratten"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/s/h/Ashfield%2C_New_South_Wales_fd78.html#endnote_pratten" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/s/h/Ashfield%2C_New_South_Wales_fd78.html#endnote_pratten" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>While never a noted industrial suburb, Ashfield has had a couple of significant industries. On Parramatta Rd near Frederick St was the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Six_ff46.html" title="Australian Six">Australian Six</a> motor car factory in 1920. This later became an <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amalgamated_Wireless_Australasia_Limited_420d.html" title="Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Limited">AWA</a> factory producing radio valves and other components. The site has since been turned into a commercial and residential development. On the other side of Frederick St was the Peek Frean biscuit factory, the tower of which was (and still is) a familiar site to passing motorists on Parramatta Rd. However, this factory is also no longer industrial, serving today as a mega hardware store. In recent times, the suburb has made the news for the wrong reasons with the <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashfield_gang_rapes.html" title="Ashfield gang rapes">Ashfield gang rapes</a> in 2001-02 and the <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brescia_Furniture_Fire_5645.html" title="Brescia Furniture Fire">Brescia Furniture Fire</a> in 2005.</p>

For most statistics, the suburb was similar to the national averages. The population was 51% females, 49% males. The number of people aged over 65 was slightly higher (15.4%) than the national average (12.6%) while the number of children under 14 was lower (14.7%) than the national average (20.8%).

<p>One area where Ashfield differed markedly from the national figures was in its ethnic diversity. Just 43% of Ashfield residents were Australian born with 11.1% born in mainland <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> and a further 1.6% born in <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>. In total, 16.8% spoke a <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_language.html" title="Chinese language">Chinese language</a> at home. Other significant places of birth included <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> (3.4%), <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">UK</a> (2.9%), <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> (2.6%), <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippines</a> (2.4%), <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> (2.1%), and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Korea_aa29.html" title="South Korea">South Korea</a> (2.0%) while other major languages spoken at home included <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic.html" title="Arabic">Arabic</a> (2.5%), <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a> (2.3%) and <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a> (2.1%). Ashfield Council celebrates the area's multiculturalism with a 'Carnival of Cultures' each year while the preponderance of Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Thai and Vietnamese shops and businesses located along the main artery of Liverpool Road is also testament to the areas diversity. Colloquially among <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_Australian_1f14.html" title="Chinese Australian">Chinese Australians</a>, Ashfield is often called "Little <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shanghai.html" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>" for the sheer number of Shanghainese shopkeepers along the suburb's main business street.</p>
<p>The other area where Ashfield differs is in housing. There were 8,446 occupied private dwellings counted, 58% were flats (compared to the national figure of just 13%), 28% were stand-alone houses, while 9.6% were semis, terraces or townhouses. The high number of flats contributed to a higher than average number of people renting (43%) compared to houses owned outright (31%) or being purchased (15%).</p>
<p>10,449 people were in the labour force with 64% employed full-time, 26% employed part-time and 7.0% unemployed. Fifteen percent of the labour force were professionals, significantly up on the national average of 10.2%. The most common industries were business services (8.0%), hospitality (4.1%), education (4.1%) and health (4.0%).</p>
<p>On the question of religion, 55% reported being a Christian (31% Catholic, 9.9% Anglican), 5.4% Buddhist, 4.4% Hindu, 2.4% Islam, 0.3% Jewish and 0.5% other religious groups. A substantial number (17.6%) said they had no religion. The number of Anglicans is less than half the national average and an indication of the suburb's reputation as a Catholic stronghold for much of the 1900s.</p>

<p>Ashfield is located close to Liverpool Road and Parramatta Road, and so is well served by road. Unfortunately Liverpool Road is often congested through Ashfield. Another major road is Frederick/Milton St which connects the City West Link at Haberfield with Georges River Rd at Croydon Park. There is also a proposal to build a tunnel connecting the City West Link with the start of the M4 at Concord. However, the proposal has drawn substantial local opposition and the plan is currently under review.</p>

Prior to then, Anglican church services had been held in her house. Work on St Johns began in 1840 and it was <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consecrated.html" title="Consecrated">consecrated</a> in 1845. It is the oldest surviving building in Ashfield.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_church"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/s/h/Ashfield%2C_New_South_Wales_fd78.html#endnote_church" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/s/h/Ashfield%2C_New_South_Wales_fd78.html#endnote_church" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>In 1842, rival landowner Robert Campbell made an acre of land between Liverpool Rd and Norton St available for a <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodist.html" title="Methodist">Methodist</a> chapel and schoolhouse. In 1864, a larger building was erected on the site which still exists as the Ashfield <a href="../../../u/n/i/Uniting_Church_in_Australia_5499.html" title="Uniting Church in Australia">Uniting Church</a>. It is also home of the Exodus Foundation providing 400 meals a day to the needy.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterian.html" title="Presbyterian">Presbyterians</a> were the next cab off the rank building their church on the corner of Liverpool Rd and Knox St in 1876. Prior to this, they had been going to St David's in Haberfield. Although they later built a larger church on the same Knox St site, the original church is located at the South Western corner of the property, having been moved twice from its original location.</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic</a> services began in the area in 1880 with the establishment of Bethlehem College. Services quickly outgrew the school's smallchapel and in 1894, the <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincentian_Family_e3ee.html" title="Vincentian Family">Vincentian</a> Fathers started building a church in Bland St opposite Bethlehem. Designed by Catholic Architects Sheerin and Hennessy in a grand Romanesque style, St Vincents was completed in 1907.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptists.html" title="Baptists">Baptists</a> held their first service in the School of Arts building on the corner of Liverpool Rd and Holden St. After building a small church further down Holden St in 1886, they returned to the School of Arts in 1903 which then became known as the Baptist Tabernacle. In 1937, they sold the building, which was knocked down and replaced with a cinema, and moved to their current site on the corner of Holden and Norton Streets. It is Gothic in style with a landmark tower, an impressive street facade and a sympathetically designed adjoining hall.</p>

<p>Currently, Ashfield has three primary schools: Ashfield Public (on Liverpool Rd), St Vincents (a Catholic school in Bland St), and Yeo Park Infants (on Victoria St at the southern extremity of the suburb). It also has three high schools: <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashfield_Boys_High_School_29f8.html" title="Ashfield Boys High School">Ashfield Boys High School</a> (next to Ashfield Public on Liverpool Rd), <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bethlehem_College%2C_Ashfield_fdc3.html" title="Bethlehem College, Ashfield">Bethlehem College</a> (a Catholic girls school in Bland St), and <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_La_Salle_College_Ashfield_9cce.html" title="De La Salle College Ashfield">De La Salle College</a> (a Catholic boys school next to Bethlehem in Bland St).</p>
<p>Ashfield Public is the oldest of these having been established in 1876 after much lobbying from local residents. Prior to that there had been schools operating out of the Methodist, Anglican and Presbyterian churches and there had even be a public school operating briefly out of the Methodist church between 1862 and 1866 but it wasn't till 1876 that it became a permanent fixture. In 1907, two years of secondary school were added and the school became a Superior School but it wasn't till 1965 that Ashfield Boys High was formally established and separated from the primary school.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_public"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/s/h/Ashfield%2C_New_South_Wales_fd78.html#endnote_public" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/s/h/Ashfield%2C_New_South_Wales_fd78.html#endnote_public" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>Bethlehem was next cab off the rank, established by the <a href="../../../s/i/s/Sisters_of_Charity_c92a.html" title="Sisters of Charity">Sisters of Charity</a> in 1881. It led to a Catholic primary school St Charles being established shortly after. When it burnt down in 1904, St Vincents became the replacement, taking on the name of the newly built church next door. The <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_La_Salle_cad6.html" title="De La Salle">De La Salle</a> school was established a little later in 1915.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_beth"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/s/h/Ashfield%2C_New_South_Wales_fd78.html#endnote_beth" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/s/h/Ashfield%2C_New_South_Wales_fd78.html#endnote_beth" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>The year after Bethlehem was established, an Anglican girls boarding school called Normanhurst was started in Bland St. It moved to Orpington St in 1888 and stayed there till 1941 when it closed down. It produced a number of notable students including <a href="../../../p/a/m/Pamela_Travers_cc02.html" title="Pamela Travers">Pamela Travers</a> (author of Mary Poppins) and tennis champions <a href="../../../d/a/p/Daphne_Akhurst_293c.html" title="Daphne Akhurst">Daphne Akhurst</a> and Rose Payton.

<p>The local government boundaries haven't been changed since the Municipality was formed in 1872 but the state and federal electorate boundaries have changed a few times over the years. Prior to 1894, Ashfield was in the state electorate of <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electoral_district_of_Canterbury_8fdd.html" title="Electoral district of Canterbury">Canterbury</a>. From 1894 until 1999, there was a state electorate of Ashfield, which was abolished when the state government decided to reduce the total number of electorates in the state. At a federal level, the suburb was in the electorate of <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_of_Parkes_%281901-69%29_714a.html" title="Division of Parkes (1901-69)">Parkes</a> from Federation in 1901 until 1949. From then until 1977 it was in the now abolished electorate of <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_of_Evans_0c72.html" title="Division of Evans">Evans</a>. Sine 1977, it has mostly been in the seat of Grayndler although parts have been in the electorates of <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_of_Lowe_37c8.html" title="Division of Lowe">Lowe</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_of_Watson_c7c5.html" title="Division of Watson">Watson</a> at various times.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Ashfield is considered a safe Labor area these days. The table to the right shows that when you just look at the polling booths in the suburb of Ashfield, Labor has consistently returned over 65% of the two-party preferred vote in recent years. The high number of people from a Chinese background contributed to a high <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unity_Party_%28Australia%29_fd96.html" title="Unity Party (Australia)">Unity Party</a> vote for a while but that has dwindled as the party itself has lost momentum. The <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Greens_3689.html" title="Australian Greens">Greens</a> vote, while not as large as in other parts of the <a href="../../../i/n/n/Inner_West_%28Sydney%29_3047.html" title="Inner West (Sydney)">inner-west</a> has been steadily increasing and <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environmental.html" title="Environmental">environmental</a> issues are now one of the big local issues.</p>
<p>Historically, the area was more conservative. From the foundation of the state seat of Ashfield in 1894 until 1976, the area returned members who were <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Trade_Party_021b.html" title="Free Trade Party">Free Trade</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalist_Party_of_Australia_29ec.html" title="Nationalist Party of Australia">Nationalist</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Australia_Party_1b2e.html" title="United Australia Party">UAP</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Australia_e08b.html" title="Liberal Party of Australia">Liberal</a> with two brief exceptions in 1894-5 and 1952-3 when <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">Labor</a> members were elected. Since 1976 when Labor's <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Whelan_c86c.html" title="Paul Whelan">Paul Whelan</a> won the seat, the area has always returned Labor members. A similar pattern can be seen in Federal results with mostly anti-Labor members being returned except for 1929-30, 1943-49, 1961-63 and 1972-75 then Labor members consistently from 1977.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_seats"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/s/h/Ashfield%2C_New_South_Wales_fd78.html#endnote_seats" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/s/h/Ashfield%2C_New_South_Wales_fd78.html#endnote_seats" rel="nofollow">[27]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>Current local issues in the area include the redevelopment of Ashfield mall and concerns about over-development in general; and construction of the <a href="../../../m/4/_/M4_Western_Motorway_3adb.html" title="M4 Western Motorway">M4 East</a> tunnel because it might lead to increased traffic pollution. Another contentious local issue is Ashfield Council itself. In 2003, it was described by the Daily Telegraph as one of the worst councils in Sydney after one councillor took out a restraining order against another. Since then another councillor has been sacked for not being a bona fide resident of the municipality while other councillors have made outspoken comments on issues such as the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_War_58f4.html" title="Iraq War">Iraq War</a>, <a href="../../../a/v/i/Avian_flu.html" title="Avian flu">bird flu</a>, the Monarchy and 30 km/h <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speed_limit.html" title="Speed limit">speed limits</a> within residential areas.</p>
