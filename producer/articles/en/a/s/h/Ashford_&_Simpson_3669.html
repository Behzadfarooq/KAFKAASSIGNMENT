<p>According to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvin_Gaye_d75e.html" title="Marvin Gaye">Marvin Gaye</a> in the book Divided Soul, Simpson did most of the vocals on the last album he did with <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tammi_Terrell_ce06.html" title="Tammi Terrell">Tammi Terrell</a>, "<a href="../../../e/a/s/Easy_%28Marvin_Gaye_Tammi_Terrell_album%29_6a46.html" title="Easy (Marvin Gaye/Tammi Terrell album)">Easy</a>," as a way of Tammi's family to have additional income.</p>
<p>Ashford &amp; Simpson's career as artists actually began in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a> when they recorded <i>"I'll Find You"</i> as "Valerie &amp; Nick." This was followed by several obscure singles Ashford recorded on the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glover.html" title="Glover">Glover</a>, <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verve.html" title="Verve">Verve</a> and <a href="../../../a/b/c/ABC_Records_f642.html" title="ABC Records">ABC</a> labels such as "It Ain't Like That", (later recorded by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martha_Reeves_%26_The_Vandellas_16c0.html" title="Martha Reeves &amp; The Vandellas">Martha Reeves &amp; The Vandellas</a>), "California Soul" and "<a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_End_Kids_fde9.html" title="Dead End Kids">Dead End Kids</a>" backed by his own version of "Let's Go Get Stoned," which the duo wrote with their early collaborator Joshie Jo Armstead. After concentrating on working with other artists, Simpson was the featured soloist on the songs "<a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridge_Over_Troubled_Water_a30c.html" title="Bridge Over Troubled Water">Bridge Over Troubled Water</a>" and "<a href="../../../w/h/a/What%27s_Going_On_5ac4.html" title="What's Going On">What's Going On</a>" on the <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quincy_Jones_c1bf.html" title="Quincy Jones">Quincy Jones</a> albums "Gula Matari" in 1970 and its followup, "Smackwater Jack." Simpson subsequently recorded two excellent solo LP's for <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motown.html" title="Motown">Motown</a>, Valerie Simpson Exposed in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>, and, the following year, the album <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valerie_Simpson_931d.html" title="Valerie Simpson">Valerie Simpson</a>, which included the single "Silly Wasn't I," which was sampled on <a href="../../../5/0/_/50_Cent_813c.html" title="50 Cent">50 Cent</a>'s "<a href="../../../b/e/s/Best_Friend_9944.html" title="Best Friend">Best Friend</a>", from the movie <i><a href="../../../g/e/t/Get_Rich_Or_Die_Tryin_b4d4.html" title="Get Rich Or Die Tryin">Get Rich Or Die Tryin</a></i>. Ashford &amp; Simpson left Motown in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>, after the albums Simpson recorded for the label received poor promotion and the company refused to release an album of the two of them recording a collection of their most famous songs for other artists. They first came to national prominence when they were featured singing selections from Simpson's solo albums on the <a href="../../../p/b/s/PBS_66e9.html" title="PBS">PBS</a> TV show Soul!, hosted by Ellis Haizlip in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>.</p>
<p>Around this time, they got married and in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>, they resumed their career as a duo with the Warner Brothers album "Gimme Something Real." This was followed by the hit singles, "Don't Cost You Nothin'," in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>, "It Seems To Hang On" in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, "Found A Cure" in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>, "<a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_Corner_a0ed.html" title="Street Corner">Street Corner</a>" in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, and their biggest hit, "Solid", which they recorded in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>. They recorded the album "Been Found" with poet <a href="../../../m/a/y/Maya_Angelou_560c.html" title="Maya Angelou">Maya Angelou</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>. A complete list of their albums can be found in the discography listed below.</p>
<p>On his own, Ashford produced, along with <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Wilson_e924.html" title="Frank Wilson">Frank Wilson</a>, the mammoth hit "<a href="../../../i/27/m/I%27m_Gonna_Make_You_Love_Me_f864.html" title="I'm Gonna Make You Love Me">I'm Gonna Make You Love Me</a>", which was recorded by <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diana_Ross_%26_The_Supremes_735e.html" title="Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes">Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes</a> in collaboration with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Temptations_2852.html" title="The Temptations">The Temptations</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>. He also appeared in the movie <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jack_City_bd9f.html" title="New Jack City">New Jack City</a> (1991), as Reverend Oates, an ordained minister who was part of Nino Brown's entourage.</p>
<p>Simpson's brothers were in the record business as well: Raymond Simpson replaced <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Willis_a14f.html" title="Victor Willis">Victor Willis</a> in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Village_People_301d.html" title="The Village People">the Village People</a> and their brother Jimmy Simpson, produced the group G.Q., (who had big hits with "Disco Nights" and "<a href="../../../i/_/d/I_Do_Love_You_71c8.html" title="I Do Love You">I Do Love You</a>"), and was in great demand as a mix artist during the disco era.</p>
<p>In recent times, Ashford &amp; Simpson have recorded and toured sporadically and in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, they opened the restaurant and live entertainment <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venue.html" title="Venue">venue</a> Sugar Bar in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, which has an <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_mic.html" title="Open mic">open mic</a> on Thursday nights where performers have included <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Latifah_dd14.html" title="Queen Latifah">Queen Latifah</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/l/Felicia_Collins_8355.html" title="Felicia Collins">Felicia Collins</a>.
