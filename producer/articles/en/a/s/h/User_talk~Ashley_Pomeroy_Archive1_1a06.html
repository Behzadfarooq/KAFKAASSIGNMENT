<p>Hi there. Just a random note to say that I very much like your user page. It is possibly the most entertaining self-description I've read on Wikipedia. BTW, I'm not sure what makes you think most Wikipedians are high-earning Nobel-laureate types; many of us are intelligent but unambitious. In fact, the unemployed are a pretty sizeable demographic here for reasons you can probably work out. Anyway I suspect you fit in here better than you think; we're all interested in knowledge. Besides, the project has plenty of Americans, who are generally much less conscious of social class than those of you across the Atlantic&#160;;-) <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 11:47, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, you endorsed the RfC on Everyking, and as you know, it's gone to arbitration. Some of us feel that the proposed decision against Everyking is insufficient and too weak for a user who has abused Wikipedia so badly. I hope you can weigh in at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Everyking_Proposed_decision_735f.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration/Everyking/Proposed decision">Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration/Everyking/Proposed decision</a> having read the proposed decision and discussion and share your opinion with us, whether it's that the decision is too strong, just right, or too weak.

<p><i>In general I tend to ascribe the basest and most venal of motives to the majority of people.</i> Uh-oh -- then you certainly won't like the way I <i>reverted</i> your scrupulously editorially-summarized chop of a chunk out of the "Sollog" talk page. Meanwhile, I think you had the best of motives in chopping it, but I just think the chopping was premature. If on second thoughts -- you decide that yes, your first thought was right, then just chop it again. You won't thereby get into a revert war with me, if only because to some extent I agree with the chop. Moreover, I'll try to make my own comments more concise in future, giving you less of an itch to chop. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 10:58, 2005 Jan 21 (UTC)</p>

<p>Nicely done; to answer your question, "Fortune" was the character with the railgun. In the trailers, her set-piece was set to a track by Harry Gregson-Williams named "Kill Me Now", but in the finished game, Hibino's similar "Yell Dead Cell" was used (presumably because all the other battles with Dead Cell used the music). <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESockatume_ba19.html" title="User:Sockatume">Socka</a><a href="../../../s/o/c/User_talk%7ESockatume_a9d2.html" title="User talk:Sockatume"><b>tume</b></a> 00:40, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Howdy, I just saw your edits at <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flowers_of_Romance_%28album%29_d5fb.html" title="Flowers of Romance (album)">Flowers of Romance (album)</a>. I visited the link and saw the label, as you mentioned in your edit summary (in fact I added that link but hadn't noticed this before). Maybe this is a difference between US and UK versions (as with the book <i>Naked Lunch</i> vs. <i>The Naked Lunch</i>)? My LP and CD both have "The" in the title. How about if I go back and make note of this? I also noticed that Wiki links are still pointing to the redirect page, I can take care of this though for all I know you're doing it right now... -- <a href="../../../g/y/r/User%7EGyrofrog_366a.html" title="User:Gyrofrog">Gyrofrog</a> <a href="../../../g/y/r/User_talk%7EGyrofrog_91bf.html" title="User talk:Gyrofrog">(talk)</a> 20:59, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>P.S. Wikipedia itself threw me for a loop, your edits are showing up in different chronological order on my watchlist. Also: my copy of the 12" single (from UK) of "Flowers of Romance" does indeed omit "The." -- <a href="../../../g/y/r/User%7EGyrofrog_366a.html" title="User:Gyrofrog">Gyrofrog</a> <a href="../../../g/y/r/User_talk%7EGyrofrog_91bf.html" title="User talk:Gyrofrog">(talk)</a> 21:09, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<p>(For anybody reading the page, the outcome was that the album <i>seemed</i> to have been released as 'Flowers of Romance' in the UK on Virgin records, definitely was released as 'The Flowers of Romance' in the US on Warner records - where, despite sounding like a wounded animal being attacked by an angry percussionist, it surprisingly failed to reach the top ten - and latterly absolutely definitely re-released on CD as 'Flowers of Romance' in the UK on Virgin, and as 'The Flowers of Romance' on Warners in the US, and the title track is just 'Flowers of Romance' and therefore on the balance of probabilities, which can alternatively be stated as showing a reasonable likelihood of persecution under Article 4 of the Immigration Acts, that the album is generally '(The) Flowers of Romance'.

<p>Thank you! Perhaps PiL can reissue a couple of tracks on a single in the UK, call it 'The,' and make up the difference. Come to think of it, you had all those records by 'The The' on the charts there, so you're still ahead by one. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuto_movil_93b4.html" title="User:Auto movil">Auto movil</a> 18:15, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Ashley, I just read your comment about you contacting Howard Altman. That's great! I had contemplated doing that before, but figured he might sooner or later stumble across Wikipedia anyway. If you're in touch with him, could you point him to the article we have about him? There is some factual information that's unclear or missing, which he may be able to fill in. You can also email me via the "E-mail this user" link, if you think that's better.

<p>Your latest edit notes a song titled "Tomorrow Never Lies" being on the <a href="../../../t/h/i/This_Is_Hardcore_b57c.html" title="This Is Hardcore">This Is Hardcore</a> album, but the page doesn't list this as a track. Was it renamed or was it on a different album? Just curious <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 19:19, May 4, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the clarification, I was wondering. About "The Bond Files", actually I don't own it. I'll probably pick up a few of reference-type books in a while. I'm currently on a kick to read all the James Bond books (currently done with Fleming, Higson). The only reference book I've read is actually <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_James_Bond_Bedside_Companion_afce.html" title="The James Bond Bedside Companion">The James Bond Bedside Companion</a> which is a great book, interesting anyway since a good portion of the book is made up of comments by Raymond Benson who became an official author. <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 20:03, May 4, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>And for the curious, "Tomorrow Never Lies" was Pulp's alternative theme song for the 1997 James Bond film "Tomorrow Never Dies" (which was originally to have been called "... Lies"). It wasn't accepted by the producers, and ended up as the b-side to <i>Help the Aged</i>, and appeared as a bonus track on the vinyl version of <i>This is Hardcore</i>. Which means that nobody got to hear it.

<p>I seem to recall that there was at one point some display of evidence for Sollogfan's sock puppetry, but I notice that currently there is a sollog template there without the appropriate url parameter. Could you please insert an appropriate pointer there? I have edited the sollog template so that it passes the "evidence" parameter through to the "sockpuppet" template correctly.</p>

<p>My apologies in commenting out your amendments too - I hadn't realised that there had been further edits when I pressed the save button. I think we are on the same wave length as far as verifiability of this sort of information. I do not wish to deny the sorts of assertions made by the eiditor but it is too easy to be emotional and I think accordingly the sorts of comments made about the population need to be particularly well-referenced. Your pursuit of references for the proportion of aborigines in the population was exactly what I had in mind.

<p>It took me a few moments to figure out the intent of the emphasis in your reference to the rainbow on your forehead.

<p>Hi! I came across your picture on your user page. It's a great photo! Did you take it yourself? If so, you really should release it under the GFDL or into the public domain for use on Wikipedia -- fair use claims are sketchy in general, but for an image you took yourself, it's just needless. Releasing the photo under the GFDL is easy; edit the image's page and type in {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}}. If you want to release it into the public domain, type {{<a href="../../../p/d/_/Template%7EPD_b356.html" title="Template:PD">PD</a>}}. And please also mention on that page that you took it, if that's the case. For further information about these tags, check out <a href="../../../i/c/t/WP%7EICT_6197.html" title="WP:ICT">WP:ICT</a>.

<dd>Hi! You're perky, aren't you? I always feel a little edgy when someone opens a conversation with a big smile and a kind word; such conversations usually end with "and that's why we have to let you go, I'm afraid" or "if you point that camera at my kid again, you're dead", that kind of thing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's a <i>good</i> photo, but not a <i>great</i> photo, because it doesn't have any meaning or resonance beyond being a technically impressive and digitally unaltered image of my face. If you knew what I looked like in real life you would be doubly impressed. However, the photograph doesn't encapsulate anything, say anything, express anything. It's like a Stanley Kubrick film, a lot of clever images but no substance.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for releasing it under the GFDL, ah. I have uploaded images freely to Wikipedia, but this is different, because it is a picture of my face. It's not a picture of a monument, or a building, or an aeroplane; it's me. I don't like the idea of a picture of my face being freely available. The existence of a 'fair use' tag suggests strongly to me that Wikipedia tolerates 'fair use' images, and that is how I would prefer it to remain.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If this becomes a festing sore I can always replace the picture with the image I use on Everything2, which is a shot of a shack at the foot of <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Sarum_7d21.html" title="Old Sarum">Old Sarum</a>. It's in a tiny triangle of land between a road and a footpath, but because it goes uphill it looks like a vast plain.-<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Pomeroy_6ac2.html" title="User:Ashley Pomeroy">Ashley Pomeroy</a> 09:37, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is regarding the following pair of sentences which I added to the article on <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegemite.html" title="Vegemite">Vegemite</a>: "<i>the product was known from 1928 to 1935 as "Parwill", in a convoluted play on words; advertising slogans suggested that "<b>Ma</b>rmite not like the taste, but I'm sure <b>Pa</b>rwill", utilising the British Commonwealth use of "Ma" and "Pa" as synonyms for "Mother" and "Father" (or, in American usage, "Mom" and "Pop")</i>". <a href="http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/VegemiteHistory.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/VegemiteHistory.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></dd>

<p>Hi Ashley. I appreciate you attempts to clean up the anschluss example. Let me clarify it here, and then maybe you can transform it into better prose to avoid any future misunderstandings.</p>
<p>There is an <i>English</i> word, <b>anschluss</b>. That's how it's spelt. (Although I have seen <i>one</i> dictionary that actually allows <b>Anschluss</b> and <b>anschluss</b>). The notable thing is that the <i>German</i> spelling has gotten closer to the English one. But maybe that's too subtle a point and we should drop it after all. Clearly, the current entry is confusing. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbor_06ec.html" title="User:Arbor">Arbor</a> 13:07, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

I was just particularly enthused by this piece as it's a subject that I'm very interested in, and I'm glad that others seem to like it. You raise a good point about some of the unqualified praise of shows included in the prose, but hopefully the individual articles on these shows do demonstrate why this is the case, at least mostly.

<dd>The contrast between most of the Featured Article Candidates and professionally-written books etc is oftentimes depressing; if these are really the best of the lot, Wikipedia is a menace to the future of humanity. Your article was of a professional standard. Wikipedia's free-for-all model is excellent for the kind of mechanical tasks undertaken by proofreaders, researchers, formatters and so forth - a legacy of its genesis in the world of computer programming - but as a means of creating well-written content it's inappropriate. I believe a model in which a single editor owns an article, and has approval on all subsequent edits, would be better. The editors would have to be chosen carefully, by <i>a lot more</i> than just a simple back-slapping vote of the kind at the top of this page; if Wikipedia is to be a serious endeavour it must hold itself to professional standards. -<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Pomeroy_6ac2.html" title="User:Ashley Pomeroy">Ashley Pomeroy</a> 21:39, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>I remember this. The first single of 1997 to spend more than a week at the top of the charts in the UK. I think it knocked Orbital's Satan off the top spot. It would probably have been a monster hit if the record company had released it later on in the year, but they snuck it out in the January graveyard because the group was unknown. Still, though, I have to oppose. The article is fairly good as far as it goes, but it's just too short. And the reason the article is too short is because there isn't enough to write about Don't Speak without resorting to padding of the "in Denmark, the single entered the chart on (date) before climbing to (position) on (date) and dropping to (position) a week later before leaving the chart altogether on (date)" variety. There's not enough meat to make a meal out of it. Although far from non-notable, the song just isn't-notable-enough; very few pop songs are worth more than a bare summary of dates, chart positions and personnel, especially as the 1980s and 1990s and 2000s has seen pop music - actual pop music singles, individual songs, rather than the phenomenon of pop stars - become such a trivial, tangental part of popular culture. You could write a lengthy article about, say, Do They Know It's Christmas or We Didn't Start the Fire or possibly even Men at Work's Down Under, but not this. The song is not about anything more than a lost love, it didn't play any part in a big cultural movement. And it doesn't really encapsulate 1997 or the late 1990s in any way. Unlike, for example, In the Air Tonight by Phil Collins, you can't write about how it has come to be an aural metaphor for its time period, either through association with popular television or literally because the production techniques were widely imitated. The guitar solo is pleasant. I'm petering out.</i></dd>

<dd>In this particular case I was opposing the nomination of Wikipedia's article on <i><a href="../../../d/o/n/Don%27t_Speak_77f4.html" title="Don't Speak">Don't Speak</a></i>, a popular song by modern-day pop band <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Doubt_c58c.html" title="No Doubt">No Doubt</a>, as a <i>featured</i> article, rather than as an article per se. I know enough about Wikipedia to keep out of policy discussions, because it's just a waste of effort. I believe that if you want to effect real, meaningful change, you have to take up arms. Only violent force and the credible threat of terrible repercussions, however distant, can make people do what you want, or cower them into silence with the same result. Wikipedia is not a good vehicle for this kind of thing, because firstly most Wikipedia editors hide behind pseudonyms and secondly most of them are not in Britain, and thus I cannot feasibly threaten them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My personal opinion is that time will solve the problem of Wikipedia being filled up with ephemera; a hundred years from now the article on <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Doubt_c58c.html" title="No Doubt">No Doubt</a>, if there is an article on No Doubt, will state that the band existed from this date to that date, had this many people in it and was particularly noteworthy for the popular standard <i><a href="../../../d/o/n/Don%27t_Speak_77f4.html" title="Don't Speak">Don't Speak</a></i>. It will be two paragraphs long, and that will be the extent of Wikipedia's coverage of No Doubt.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If Wikipedia had existed in 1952 in Britain it would probably have been filled with article after article about <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Dare_bc87.html" title="Dan Dare">Dan Dare</a>, his spaceship, his companions, his clothes, his boots, his favourite brand of cigarette etc, but now there is just <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Dare_bc87.html" title="Dan Dare">Dan Dare</a>. A hundred years from now there won't be articles on <a href="../../../k/l/i/Klingons.html" title="Klingons">Klingons</a> or the things Captain Kirk said in some fan-written novel, there will be a short article on <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a>, and that will be Wikipedia's coverage of that. All of Wikipedia's coverage of mobile phones, ringtones, "happy slapping" etc will be as forgotten, a hundred years from now, as the pranks which must have gone on when radio and morse code were new. If you want to make a persistent mark on Wikipedia, make some definitive edits to the articles on <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrogen.html" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> or <a href="../../../g/r/a/Granite.html" title="Granite">granite</a>. -<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Pomeroy_6ac2.html" title="User:Ashley Pomeroy">Ashley Pomeroy</a> 02:42, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry to butt in, but I have to say I'm not sure that'll quite be the case. While I certainly agree that there are such 'fads', as it were, I don't think those articles will shrink down or disappear – there's no reason for them to, really. They'll all still be there, unless server space starts to become a major issue (which in 100 years time probably it won't be – they'll all have the entirety of Wikipedia downloaded onto their digital watches by then) they simply won't be updated or added to much any more. That's my view on it, anyway. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngmering_21af.html" title="User:Angmering">Angmering</a> 21:31, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think that the user you refer to is the same as LJS/<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Henry_98cc.html" title="John Henry">John Henry</a>. For one thing he seems to be pushing the opposite point of view. Also the list of articles edited shows little similarity to the ones edited by LJS which do include the Abramoff article but he tends to focus on one article for several days at a time, apparently whatever article is on the Rush Limbaugh show that day. It appears he only found the Abramoff scandal this week, his mission seems to be to bend every story to a pro-Abramoff POV which is something of a challenge given the fact that the guy is involved in a mob casino takeover deal and Bouils, the guy Abramoff is indicted for cheating out of $23 million was murdered. I don't see your user on the Blanco, Nagin, Able Danger etc articles being edited by your guy. So I think they are different. Unfortunately one of the consequences of having what amounts to a DoS attack against the articles by the likes of LJS is that in the course of the revert wars (12 or more times in a day was common) many other edits get lost.--<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 04:07, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
