<dd>Good pick-up, Zoe. But in this case we should clearly go with the primary meaning rule: words that descend from other words (i.e., that are named after them) go to a subsiduary title.</dd>

<dd>For example, the bomber aircraft called "Canberra" was named after the city, so the city entry is <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canberra.html" title="Canberra">Canberra</a>, while the aircraft becomes <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Electric_Canberra_8bee.html" title="English Electric Canberra">English Electric Canberra</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In this case, the primary meaning is the <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashanti_people.html" title="Ashanti people">Ashanti</a> people of Africa (at a wild guess there would be 20 or 40 million of them). A band that chooses to name itself after the people thus becomes <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashanti_%28singer%29.html" title="Ashanti (singer)">Ashanti (singer)</a> or something similar.

<p>which song Ashanti hits G6?? Some singers have just their notes but I wanna know in what music they hit them... There's just the notes and octaves of some singers in their respective pages, but I would like to know in what songs they hit their highest and lowest notes...<br />
---<br />
I don't know if it's just me, but I found this section confusing. "Unlike many other singers with the ability, Ashanti, while possessing a clear, girly, coloratura soprano voice, has built a career singing in the lower and middle ranges of her voice." Sure, I'll buy that. But: "...as of late, Ashanti has used her head register so infrequently, many who ...would mistakenly classify her as a classic example of a soubrette." Reading soubrette says "In popular music...The term refers to a woman with a light, youthful voice."<br />
Is it just me, or can a person not "build a career singing in the lower and middle ranges" and be mistaken for a soubrette, who would be a higher-ranged singer? It seems to be contradictory.<br />
I don't know enough about vocals to correct it or even be sure it needs correcting. Even if this is right, I think it needs more clarifying. ~Garnet Avi</p>
<p>For clarification, a coloratura soprano is a soprano with an extensive range and ornate singing style, meaning a singer who can sing a many different notes and even at times access the whistle register. A soubrette has a limited voice and can't reach higher notes. Mariah Carey is an example of a dramatic coloratura soprano and Kiely Williams of 3LW would be the best example of a soubrette I can think of.<a href="../../../p/h/o/User%7EPhoenixPrince_d67f.html" title="User:PhoenixPrince">PhoenixPrince</a> 16:31, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay, I have a question also...what does her "slender appearance" have to do with her vocal abilities? <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELesanichelle_b6af.html" title="User:Lesanichelle">Lesanichelle</a> 06:15, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ashanti hit G6 when she was performing the National Anthem in high school. Go on www.youtube.com and type in Ashanti(National Anthem). There will be a video featuring clips of Ashanti performing the National Anthem. The G6 can be heard, but you have to listen carefully because people are cheering while she is doing it. It is near the end.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you're talking about when she sing "Free" then its not the whistle register. But she does hit Eb6 which is the first whistle note flat. The notes for free are: Bb5,C6,D6,Eb6,C6,D6,Bb5. I think this is enough to consider her a Coloratura. Shre really impressed me. I used to think she was a soubrette because she uses so little of her range, but she is obviously a coloratura soprano and should be able to sing in the whistle register but Eb6 is her highest recorded. If the G#6 is during brave then its not loud enough to varify. <a href="../../../m/y/k/User%7EMyke209_395a.html" title="User:Myke209">Myke</a> 07:09, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>if Ashanti is soprano than so is Aaliyah no way Aaliyah's an alot when she sings soprano so well and can access her full range way better than Ashnati can acess hers</p>

<p>"50 Cent would later mock Ja Rule as being soft and "not a true gangsta", citing the "Mesmerize" video and its pop-culture appeal as an example."<br />
- This is what drives me mad about hip hop culture; 50 Cent calls Ja Rule "not a true gangsta" as a CRITICISM?! That's a compliment!! 50 Cent (and all other human beings on this planet who believe that respect is only entitled to those who carry out horrific atrocities and are arrogant fools) is one twisted indvidual.</p>

<li>Hey, I was just trying to fix the page today and I wasn't logged in and 2 people (clean up people I guess) thought I was messing the page up. I have the CORRECT stats on all ashanti's singles and I was just trying to fix them.

And they are correct. I've fixed the page to how it was before it was messed up ( I actually read the tutorials lol). It still needs a cleanup but at least the info is right now. I also saved the data on this page.</p>

<p>There is <b>ZERO</b> pov about the section. No specific notes are named. Everything stated can be backed up to defs per other Wikipedia articles or published media. She has been derided for a lack of range. Early promo material has called her a soprano, despite a lack of singing to demonstrate. I put it back, if you don't like it, holler at me. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntares33712_1845.html" title="User:Antares33712">Antares33712</a> 22:30, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK first of all Ashanti is a HIP HOP singer not pop there is a big line between hip hop and pop. Pop is more along the lines of Hilary Duff and Jessica Simpson. Ashanti, Beyonce and Alicia Keys sing Hip Hop and R&amp;B so please correct that thank you</p>

<p>Pop stands for popular and last time I checked, all of those artists are popular.</p>
<p>that doesn't have anything to do with it she herself always describes herself as hip-hop and r&amp;b just like mary. pop songs are just for sales and have no real meaning she doesn t make that</p>

<p>Since someone tagged this a long time ago and it is still uncited to a reputable source (no, not the IMDB or other trivia sites, so don't get your hopes up), here it is pending a source: "Ashanti's father is of <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_American_7e72.html" title="Chinese American">Chinese American</a> descent and her mother is 1/4 African American and 3/4 <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominican_Republic_1b44.html" title="Dominican Republic">Dominican</a>." <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 05:48, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ashanti Is a R&amp;B, Hip Hop, and Pop Artist. It's very clear that she is a hip hop artist from her first cd and even on her third cd's intro she says "Concrete Rose because when you think of Hip-Hop, you think of something grimy and gritty, Concrete, But when you think of R&amp;B, You think Of Something soft and sensual, sorta like a rose. My Music is consider Hip Hop and R&amp;B, hence, Concrete Rose"</p>
<p>Also I found a VH1 interview:<a href="http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1494676/12092004/ashanti.jhtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1494676/12092004/ashanti.jhtml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>VH1: Why did you decide to call your new album Concrete Rose?</p>
<p>Ashanti: We chose the title because when you think of hip-hop you think of something grimy, raw, or from the gutter - something concrete. When you think of R&amp;B, you think of something soft and smooth and sensual like a rose. So with my music being hip hop and R&amp;B, hence, Concrete Rose.</p>

vocal range- can u say that ashanti can hit whistle register listen to the note she hits in the begining of this clip <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPMHYKKCStU" class="external free" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPMHYKKCStU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPMHYKKCStU</a> -<a href="../../../i/t/27/User%7EIt%27sOnlyU_c8a9.html" title="User:It'sOnlyU">User:It'sOnlyU</a></p>

Read the <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip_hop_music.html" title="Hip hop music">hip hop music</a> article if you are unaware of what the genre encompasses. Almost every current R&amp;B artist uses hip hop beats and collaborates with rappers these days. That does NOT make them hip hop musicians. Ashanti is not an exception to this. She is NOT a rapper, and she is NOT a DJ. Also, Ashanti is definitely pop as well as R&amp;B. She would not have had so many hit singles at mainstream radio if her music was pure R&amp;B. --<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusicpvm_88b6.html" title="User:Musicpvm">musicpvm</a> 22:47, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

YEs she is hip hop because she does rap. in the songs wonderful remix, a song that's unfamilar on jarule's pain is love abulm, the still on it remix, and i'm in love again remix. listen to all these songs and she is obviously rapping. She is purely r&amp;b with a pop appeal because pop songs have simple meanings whereas just like r&amp;b she mostly talks about love, life, and love making. if ashanti can be classified as pop so should Beyonce no bias Danotorious1jd 02:54, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>POP=POPULAR MUSIC. Ashanti is a pop artist also. Many Rnb artist have done pop songs including mariah and whitney. Rock Wit U/Happy were def. pop or had pop appeal. -<a href="../../../i/t/27/User%7EIt%27sOnlyU_c8a9.html" title="User:It'sOnlyU">User:It'sOnlyU</a></p>
<p>ashanti is not a pop singer, her music does not even play on those types of music stations. they play on hip-hop/r&amp;b stations.</p>
