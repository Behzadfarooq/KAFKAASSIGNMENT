<p>To Whom It May Concern&#160;: SENELEY GREEN was in existance in the mid sixteenth century, (actually, long before that). The founding of Ashton in Makerfield Grammar School took place in Seneley Green at that time. It was founded using a capital sum bequeathed by Robert Byrchall, in 1589, and a plot of land granted by Sir Thomas Gerard. There is nothing 'new' about it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.192.242.187.html" title="User:80.192.242.187">80.192.242.187</a> (<a href="../../../8/0/2E/User_talk%7E80.192.242.187.html" title="User talk:80.192.242.187">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.192.242.187_bb92.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.192.242.187">contribs</a>) 19:23, 12 November 2006.</small></p>

<dd>REPY: Until recent times Bryn was part of the district of Ashton-in-Makerfield. Nearly all the other 19th century chapels deleted form the article are in present-day Ashton. To omit, or brush over, the rich history of native Christian non-conformity from an article on Ashton would be ridiculous. Similarly, the history of coal mining in the area needs a substantial entry. <a href="../../../y/o/z/User%7EYozzer66_925d.html" title="User:Yozzer66">Yozzer66</a> 14:17, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To Whom It May Concern: Those who would like to re-write history by re-introducing the old boundaries of Lancashire are perfectly entiled to their views. However, to place these views (without substantial qualification) in an encyclopedic article on Ashton is inappropriate. <a href="../../../y/o/z/User%7EYozzer66_925d.html" title="User:Yozzer66">Yozzer66</a> 14:17, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Lancashire boundaries were never changed. A change of Governing Authority (local council) does not alter country, town or county boundaries.

<dd>REPLY: Where is the bigotry? It is a statement of fact that, historically, Christian Non-conformists found religious relics to be an anathema. Attempts at air brushing the rich non-conformist history of the Ashton area from history could be viewed as either ignorance, lay Catholic sectarianism or traditional Anglo-Catholic arrogance.

<p>St.Helens was home to two cotton mills in the 1800's. Ashton in Makerfield had one, so it was not the westerly extremity after all!</p>
<p>Repy: (1) QUESTIONS: The town or the district of Ashton? When you say the 1800s do you mean the ist decade of the 19th century or the whole century? (This is important because the heyday of the Lancs cotton industry was later than 1800 - 1810). (2) CONTEXT: Even if this comment were correct for the district of Ashton throughout the 19th century, it doesn't alter the fact that two mills in a large district like St Helens is not very significant - coal and glass still completely dominated. (Indeed, textile mills may have existed in isolation even further west). Whereas for a much smaller place like Ashton one mill could be a major employer and contributor to the local economy. The general point about the western extremity of a concentrated, economically important cotton industry surely remains? <a href="../../../y/o/z/User%7EYozzer66_925d.html" title="User:Yozzer66">Yozzer66</a> 17:41, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There were two cotton mills in St.Helens in the 1820's, therefore the statement about Ashton having the most westerly cotton mill is wrong. St.Helens wasn't a large district in the 1820's, however, if it was, it would not alter the true fact that there were two cotton mills there and that they were further west than Ashton. You can't beat the truth, no matter how you tart it up!</dd>

<dd>The heyday of the Lancs cotton industry was 90 years or so AFTER the 1820s. In the time of 'King Cotton', how many mills did the district of Ashton have in comparison with its then much larger neighbour, St Helens? Also, no one would ever call St Helens a cotton town, as they would Wigan. The question remains then: was Ashton the western extremity of the concentrated Lancs cotton industry? <a href="../../../y/o/z/User%7EYozzer66_925d.html" title="User:Yozzer66">Yozzer66</a> 11:01, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The fact that St.Helens DID have cotton mills means that it was a town, further west than Ashton in Makerfield, with cotton mills in it, and therefore the 'extremity' of the Lancashire cotton industry was beyond Ashton in Makerfield. However, Liverpool was the key place regarding the Cotton Industry, as it was from there that the Cotton Brokers supplied the rest of Lancashire with cotton via the Liverpool Cotton Exchange. Liverpool is further West than both. Who said that St.Helens WAS a cotton town, and who mentioned Wigan? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.192.242.187.html" title="User:80.192.242.187">80.192.242.187</a> (<a href="../../../8/0/2E/User_talk%7E80.192.242.187.html" title="User talk:80.192.242.187">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.192.242.187_bb92.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.192.242.187">contribs</a>) 11:46, 21 November 2006.</small></dd>

<dd>Ashton was only the western extremity of the Lancs. cotton industry, if you exclude any cotton industry that has anything to do with Liverpool/Merseyside as we know it today but is, like it or not, part of Lancashire. If you wish to include the word 'concentrated', then we can write Wigan and Ashton out of the equation as the 'concentration' started to thin out west of Bolton. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.192.242.187.html" title="User:80.192.242.187">80.192.242.187</a> (<a href="../../../8/0/2E/User_talk%7E80.192.242.187.html" title="User talk:80.192.242.187">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.192.242.187_bb92.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.192.242.187">contribs</a>) 19:33, 22 November 2006.</small></dd>

<dd>Take a look at the ‘Wikipededia’ entry 'Mill town' and try to identify ANY mill towns to the west of Ashton in south Lancashire... Despite the presence of textile mills, Liverpool, St Helens and Ormskirk were not mill towns. To continue the argument, there were Staffordshire towns that had potteries that are not included in THE Potteries. It is all a matter of the degree of importance the industry had in shaping the character of the location. (Incidentally, to deny that Wigan was an important cotton mill town is ludicrous). In regard to Ashton, at the peak of the Lancashire cotton industry, just before the First World War, the town had at least two sizable mills - the Record Mill (Spinning) situated in York Road, and the Makerfield Mill (the 'Weaving Shed') in Windsor Road. This was hugely significant for a town the size of Ashton. <a href="../../../y/o/z/User%7EYozzer66_925d.html" title="User:Yozzer66">Yozzer66</a> 13:03, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wouldn't take anything written in Wikipedia as fact, as most of it is written by those who have made the mistake of believing all they have heard, not having seen the half of it! Now then, Wigan 'was' a mill town. It says so in the article, because 'I' changed it to mill town, from mining town, which it was not. But compare Wigan with other mill towns further into the 'concentration'. Oldham 89 mills, Manchester 101 mills, Rochdale 63 mills, Bolton 56 mills, Wigan 21 mills. Then Preston 31 mills and Lancaster 8 mills. They laugh at Ashtons, and St.Helens' 2 mills apiece. So, I would tend to agree if it was said that 'Wigan was the south westerly extremity of the 'consentrated centre' of the Lancashire Cotton Mill Industry'. Like you say yourself, regarding towns in Staffordshire which are not included in the 'potteries' despite the fact that they may have had small pottery producing companies, Ashton, in the same context, cannot be included as a Lancashire cotton town. (Incidentally, far from denying the fact of Wigans importance as a mill town, I merely pointed to the 'concentration' of cotton mills thinning out further west of Bolton, as is proven by the figures shown above.)...

<li>I don't like the new infobox map, showing Ashton in Makerfield's location in Greater Manchester.

<dd>Excuse me, but there was already demand and consensus for using a Greater Manchester map in infoboxes before I found the infobox discussion.

I merely tried to improve the look of it. There was only one objection raised at the infobox talk page by a traditional counties advocate, who, upon making some valid and mature suggestions (which I took on), led to an improved look of the map.</dd>
