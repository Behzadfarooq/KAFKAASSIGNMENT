	    <p>I am proud to be the president of the Ashtyn Evans Fan Club. Ashtyn Evans is a well known technical writer that is moving into the creative arena. Born and raised in mid-Michigan the 27 year old author has been writing through her own company, DomAsh Designs, and for many Linux based educational course web sites.</p>
<p>As the head writer for a Network Marketing Solutions firm, Ms. Evans has shown remarkable talent. Some more noteworthy projects include the publication of articles for the well-known LearnSecurityOnline web site and newsletter and the newly established Linux Learning Zone .</p>
<p>Creatively, Ms. Evans is the author of a yet-to-be-released (in 2006) dark fantasy, vampire novel series called Crimson Twilight. Information on the book series is included at the Ashtyn Evans Online web site located at Ashtyn Evans Online <a href="http://www.ashtynevans.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ashtynevans.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Crimson Twilight - The First Novel</p>
<p><br />
CRIMSON TWILIGHT introduces readers to the world of the undead. The protagonist, Dominick Evans, is being evaluated by the Ancient Council of the Vampiric race who must decide if he is worthy of a spot on the council despite only being a vampire for 208 years. The council faces the prospect of war, and without Dominick, there is little chance to successfully prevent the dissention within the race.</p>
<p><br />
CRIMSON TWILIGHT is so much more then the typical fantasy novel. The vampires reflect the humanity they once possessed, allowing readers the chance to actually relate too many of the events that occur. They make human mistakes. They let mortal emotions rule them. The question as to why this occurs is simply because mortality is where they came from. In some instances they know no other way of life. Others choose to remain in the midst of the mortals. They cannot raise suspicion so for all intents and purposes they are mortal.</p>
<p><br />
In this novel, there are no campy vampire-isms though the one true ability that separates them from mortality is their true sense of diversity and acceptance that long goes unnoticed in the mortal world.</p>
<p><br />
CRIMSON TWILIGHT features multiple storylines. While the main plot focuses on the VOSC's (Vampire Observation and Security Council) decision to allow Dominick, and two others, onto the council and why they need to do this in the first place, the book also highlights the underlying romance between Dominick and his wife Ashtyn, the council's long held secrets, and the long held animosity those within the race hold for one another.</p>
<p><br />
CRIMSON TWILIGHT has the potential to become the next cult classic if given the chance.</p>
<p><br />
Crimson Twilight Book Series Synopsis Outline</p>
<p><br />
The series will consist of ten books. The books follow the life of the owner of Crimson Twilight, Dominick, his life, his family, and the many trials and tribulations that the Crimson Twilight residents must endure.</p>
<p>Book #1- Crimson Twilight – The unseen forces of the world are preparing the battle of a lifetime. The VOSC is a top secret organization that knows how to maintain order in this chaotic world. However, to do so they must rely on three unlikely individuals that possess virtues they need; strength, sustenance, and absolute control. Can the VOSC members put aside their differences with these young yet experienced vampires or will the balance of an entire race dangle in the hands of those who have only come to rely on themselves?</p>
<p><br />
Book #2- Abandoned Memories- Charming, wealthy Dominick Evans steps back in time to help find the key to solving his current problems. As Dominick’s tragic life is revealed the fate of the Vampiric World teeters precariously.

<p><br />
Book #3- Chaotic Dissention – As the battles rage on around him Dominick continues the story of his life from the moment the triplets were born. While Crimson Twilight continues to grow with the expansion to Dominick’s former New Orleans haven, readers will finally receive the answers to how Dominick has become the man he is today.</p>
<p><br />
Book #4- Hidden Secrets – A chance encounter with someone from Ashtyn’s past brings a ghost from Dominick’s closet into his life. The answers to the future seem to parallel the past as Dominick fights to save his beloved. Meanwhile, a skeleton in Kairos’ closet is finally revealed after more then four centuries. Can Julius handle the truth or is truly time for him to move on?</p>
<p><br />
Book #5- Heaven's Forgotten Child – The battle of Heaven versus the Vampires is set to begin. In the opinion of the Archangels, Dominick Evans has taken something that belonged to Heaven.

<p><br />
Book #6- Deceptive Illusions – Dominick has proven triumphant, but not without a price. Demons from the past have come back to haunt him, and new problems between Karsten and Dominick put a strain on the situation. As Lara finally learns the truth about her life it turns out to be not what she expected. Betrayal and loss set Mia off and destruction ensues for more then one member of the CT clan.</p>
<p><br />
Book #7- Conflict's Resolution – It is a pivotal point for Crimson Twilight as many conflicts come to a head. Can Dominick and Ashtyn, Karsten and Anoughtaiegh, Julius and Kairos, and Markus and the entire world work out their issues or will CT finally disband forever?</p>
<p><br />
Book #8- A Divided Front - The sequel to Crimson Twilight. The opposing covens are given a proposition by the VOSC; fight and earn a place on the VOSC council if you win. A series of Tournaments are to be held. Members of Crimson Twilight must fight against every single coven. Dominick, the reigning champion of fighters, has been picked to battle more than once. However, Ashtyn, who has extensive healing powers and no will or wish to fight, is forced to the battlefield as well. In this all or nothing showdown who will win?</p>
<p><br />
Book #9 - Desired Vengeance – In Desired Vengeance two young souls are left behind. Christian Evans wants to feel the power his brother, Young Dominick, possesses. He’ll stop at nothing to achieve this even as his destructive methods hurt those he cares about the most. In an inevitable twist, Dominick does something that could widen the gap between Karsten and himself forever. Can Karsten ever forgive him or will his loyalty move from Crimson Twilight to more deceptive ventures?</p>
<p><br />
Book #10- Crimson Destruction - The world has gone to hell. There is nothing Dominick or Anoughtaiegh can do about it. As the covens pair off to fight a vampiric war some will side with Crimson Twilight, and some will fight against it. This has been the moment in time that all of the events in Dominick's life have led up to. Will Crimson Twilight finally fall or can the Evans and the Ancients hold on to the home they have come to know and love for so many years?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Thriller Novels</p>
<p>Ashtyn Evans also has several thriller novels in the works. As a student of Criminal Justice the subject of Serial Killers and other deviance within society is definitely a major interest for the author. Upcoming projects include:</p>
<p><br />
Vicissitude - (with Dominick Evans) A top secret project by a special forces unit of the FBI leads to unlawful experimentations on serial killers and other dangerous criminals. The long term effects of such actions are unknown as the world is once again put into the hands of danger, yet this time it’s with the help of the agency that they believed would protect them.</p>
<p><br />
Untitled - (with Dominick Evans) The deadliest crime wave of the century has hit the nation. It is up to the collaborative efforts of three FBI branches: Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and the main headquarters in Quantico, Virginia to discover who the incredibly sadistic serial killer is. Yet, their discovery of the answers they seek gives them much more then they ever bargained for.</p>
<p><br />
Reflections of Evil- Conner Donovan the resident psychologist at Kramdyn University, has always loved studying the complexity of the mind. During his case studies he concluded that perception of an individual in a societal situation can cause them to react in certain ways. Conner notes the case of his own twin brother, Carson. Carson has always looked suspicious and society has always pointed the finger at him. This has caused Carson to lead a life filled with petty crime, and stints in and out of jail. As Conner probes deeper into the intricacies of the mind the town surrounding Kramdyn is struck with fear. There is a serial killer on the loose, and no one is safe. The attacks appear to be random, yet pre-meditated, and there is no set M.O. for the victims. Conner is the only one who can help capture this elusive killer. Will he be too late, or is Conner the next victim on this cunningly, terrifying killer's list?</p>
<p><br />
