</div>
<p>According to Buddhist tradition, described in the 2nd century "<a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashokavadana.html" title="Ashokavadana">Legend of Ashoka</a>", the birth of Ashoka was foretold by the Buddha, in the story of "The Gift of Dust":</p>
<dl>
<dd>"A hundred years after my death there will be an emperor named Ashoka in Pataliputra. He will rule one of the four continents and adorn <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jambudvipa.html" title="Jambudvipa">Jambudvipa</a> with my relics building eighty four thousand <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stupas.html" title="Stupas">stupas</a> for the welfare of people. He will have them honored by gods and men. His fame will be widespread. His meritorious gift was just this: Jaya threw a handful of dust into the <a href="../../../t/a/t/Tath%C4%81gata.html" title="Tathāgata">Tathāgata</a>'s bowl." Ashokavadana<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>Following this prophecy, the "Legend of Ashoka" further states that Ashoka was finally born as the son of the <a href="../../../m/a/u/Mauryan.html" title="Mauryan">Mauryan</a> Emperor <a href="../../../b/i/n/Bindusara.html" title="Bindusara">Bindusara</a> by a relatively lower ranked queen named Dharma. Dharma was said to be the daughter of a poor Brahmin who introduced her into the harem of the Emperor as it was predicted that her son would be a great ruler. Although Dharma was of priestly lineage, the fact that she was not royal by birth made her a very low-status consort in the harem.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ashoka had several elder half-brothers and just one younger <a href="../../../s/i/b/Sibling.html" title="Sibling">sibling</a>, Vitthashoka, another son of Dharma. The princes were extremely competitive, but young Ashoka excelled in the military and academic disciplines in which the boys were tutored. There was a great deal of sibling rivalry, especially between Ashoka and his brother <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susima.html" title="Susima">Susima</a>, both as warriors and as administrators.</p>

</div>
<p>Developing into an impeccable warrior general and a shrewd statesman, Ashoka went on to command several <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regiment.html" title="Regiment">regiments</a> of the Mauryan army. His growing popularity across the empire made his elder brothers wary of his chances of being favoured by <a href="../../../b/i/n/Bindusara.html" title="Bindusara">Bindusara</a> to become the next emperor. The eldest of them, Prince <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susima.html" title="Susima">Susima</a>, the traditional heir to the throne, persuaded Bindusara to send Ashoka to quell an uprising in the city of <a href="../../../t/a/x/Taxila.html" title="Taxila">Takshashila</a> in the north-west province of <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sindh.html" title="Sindh">Sindh</a>, of which Prince Susima was the governor. Takshashila was a highly volatile place because of the war-like <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Greek_0380.html" title="Indo-Greek">Indo-Greek</a> population and mismanagement by Susima himself. This had led to the formation of different <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militia.html" title="Militia">militias</a> causing unrest. Ashoka complied and left for the troubled area. As news of Ashoka's visit with his army trickled in, he was welcomed by the revolting militias and the uprising ended without a fight. (The province revolted once more during the rule of Ashoka, but this time the uprising was crushed with an iron fist).</p>
<p>Ashoka's success made his half-brothers more wary of his intentions of becoming the emperor, and more incitements from Susima led Bindusara to send Ashoka into exile. He went into <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orissa.html" title="Orissa">Kalinga</a> and stayed incognito there. There he met a fisherwoman named <a href="../../../k/a/u/Kaurwaki.html" title="Kaurwaki">Kaurwaki</a>, with whom he fell in love; recently found inscriptions indicate that she went on to become his second or third queen.</p>

</div>
<p>Meanwhile, there again was a violent uprising in <a href="../../../u/j/j/Ujjain.html" title="Ujjain">Ujjain</a>. Emperor Bindusara summoned Ashoka back after an exile of two years. Ashoka went into Ujjain and in the ensuing battle was injured, but his generals quelled the uprising. Ashoka was treated in hiding so that loyalists in Susima's camp could not harm him. He was treated by Buddhist monks and nuns. This is where he first learned the teachings of the <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gautama_Buddha_da04.html" title="Gautama Buddha">Buddha</a>, and it is also where he met the beautiful Devi, who was his personal nurse and the daughter of a merchant from adjacent <a href="../../../v/i/d/Vidisha.html" title="Vidisha">Vidisha</a>. After recovering, he married her. Ashoka, at this time, was already married to Asandhimitra who was to be his much-loved chief queen for many years until her death. She seems to have stayed on in <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pataliputra.html" title="Pataliputra">Pataliputra</a> all her life.</p>
<p>The following year passed quite peacefully for him and Devi was about to deliver his first child. In the meantime, Emperor Bindusura took ill and was on his death-bed. A clique of ministers lead by Radhagupta, who hated Susima, summoned Ashoka to take the crown, though Bindusara preferred Susima. As the Buddhist lore goes, in a fit of rage Prince Ashoka attacked <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pataliputra.html" title="Pataliputra">Pataliputra</a> (modern day <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patna.html" title="Patna">Patna</a>), and killed all his brothers, including Susima, and threw their bodies into a well in Pataliputra. It is not known if Bindusara was already dead at this time. At that stage of his life, many called him Chand Ashoka meaning murderer and heartless Ashoka. The Buddhist legends paint a gory picture of his sadistic activities at this time. Most are unbelievable, and must be read as supporting background to highlight the transformation in Ashoka which Buddhism brought about later.</p>
<p>Ascending the throne, Ashoka expanded his empire over the next eight years: it grew to encompass an area extending from the present-day boundaries of <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh.html" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> and the Indian state of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assam.html" title="Assam">Assam</a>, in the east, to the territory of present-day <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a> and <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, in the west, and from the <a href="../../../p/a/m/Pamir_Mountains_8929.html" title="Pamir Mountains">Pamir Knots</a> in the north almost to the peninsular tip of <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_India_4724.html" title="Southern India">southern India</a>. At that stage of his life, he was called <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chakravarti.html" title="Chakravarti">Chakravarti</a> which literally translates to "he for whom the wheel of law turns" (broadly meaning the emperor). Around this time, his Buddhist queen Devi gave birth to two children, Prince <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahindra.html" title="Mahindra">Mahindra</a> and Princess <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanghamitra.html" title="Sanghamitra">Sanghamitra</a>.</p>

<p>The early part of Ashoka's reign was apparently quite bloodthirsty. Ashoka was constantly on the war campaign, conquering territory after territory and significantly expanding the already large Mauryan empire and adding to his wealth. His last conquest was the state of Kalinga on the east coast of India in the present-day state of <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orissa.html" title="Orissa">Orissa</a>. Kalinga prided itself on its <a href="../../../s/o/v/Sovereignty.html" title="Sovereignty">sovereignty</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">democracy</a>; with its monarchical-parliamentary democracy, it was quite an exception in ancient Bharata, as there existed the concept of Rajdharma, meaning the duty of the rulers, which was intrinsically entwined with the concept of bravery and <a href="../../../k/s/h/Kshatriya_dharma.html" title="Kshatriya dharma">Kshatriya dharma</a>.</p>
<p>The pretext for the start of the <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalinga_War_6170.html" title="Kalinga War">Kalinga War</a> (<a href="../../../2/6/5/265_BCE_fbe1.html" title="265 BCE">265 BCE</a> or <a href="../../../2/6/3/263_BCE_0103.html" title="263 BCE">263 BCE</a>) is uncertain. One of Ashoka's brothers - and probably a supporter of Susima - might have fled to Kalinga and found official refuge there. This enraged Ashoka immensely. He was advised by his ministers to attack Kalinga for this act of treachery. Ashoka then asked Kalinga's royalty to submit before his supremacy. When they defied this <i>diktat</i>, Ashoka sent one of his generals to Kalinga to make them submit.</p>
<p>The general and his forces were, however, completely routed through the skilled tactics of Kalinga's commander-in-chief. Ashoka, baffled by this defeat, attacked with the greatest invasion ever recorded in Indian history until then. Kalinga put up a stiff resistance, but they were no match for Ashoka's powerful armies, superior weapons and experienced generals and soldiers. The whole of Kalinga was plundered and destroyed; Ashoka's later edicts say that about 100,000 people were killed on the Kalinga side and 10,000 from Ashoka's army; thousands of men and women were deported.</p>

<p>As the legend goes, one day after the war was over Ashoka ventured out to roam the eastern city and all he could see were burnt houses and scattered corpses. This sight made him sick and he cried the famous quotation, "What have I done?" Upon his return to Paliputra, he could, according to legends, get no sleep and was constantly haunted by his deeds in Kalinga. The brutality of the conquest led him to adopt <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> under the guidance of the Brahmin Buddhist <a href="../../../s/a/g/Sage.html" title="Sage">sages</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radhaswami.html" title="Radhaswami">Radhaswami</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manjushri.html" title="Manjushri">Manjushri</a><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> and he used his position to propagate the relatively new philosophy to new heights, as far as ancient <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a> and <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>. When the war against Kalinga ended, Asoka's warriors had killed over 100,000 people. He was filled with sorrow. He gave up war and violence being almost the exact opposite of his grandfather, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandragupta_Maurya_abf9.html" title="Chandragupta Maurya">Chandragupta Maurya</a>. He freed his prisoners and gave them back their land.</p>
<p>As legend goes, there was also another factor that lead Ashoka to Buddhism. A Mauryan princess who had been married to one of Ashoka's brothers (who Ashoka executed) fled her palace with a maid, fearing for her unborn child. After much travel, the pregnant princess collapsed under a tree in the forest, and the maid ran to a nearby <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashram.html" title="Ashram">ashram</a> to fetch a priest or physician to help. Meanwhile, under the tree, the princess gave birth to a son. The young prince was brought up by the Brahmins of the ashram and educated by them. Later, when he was around thirteen years old, he caught the eye of Ashoka, who was surprised to see such a young boy dressed as a sage. When the boy calmly revealed who he was, it seemed that Ashoka was moved by guilt and compassion, and moved the boy and his mother into the palace.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Queen Devi, who was a Buddhist, had brought up her children in that faith, and apparently left Ashoka after she saw the horrors of Kalinga. Ashoka was grieved by this, and was counselled by his nephew (who had been raised in the ashram and was more priest than prince) to embrace his dharma and draw away from war. Prince <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahinda.html" title="Mahinda">Mahindra</a> and Princess <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanghamitra.html" title="Sanghamitra">Sanghamitra</a>, the children of Queen Devi, abhorred violence and bloodshed, but knew that as royals war would be a part of their lives. They therefore asked Ashoka for permission to join the Buddhist monks, which Ashoka reluctantly granted. The two siblings established Buddhism in <a href="../../../c/e/y/Ceylon.html" title="Ceylon">Ceylon</a> (now <a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Lanka_9993.html" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>).</p>
<p>From that point Ashoka, who had been described as "the cruel Ashoka" (<i>Chandashoka</i>), started to be described as "the pious Ashoka" (<i>Dharmashoka</i>). He propagated the <a href="../../../v/i/b/Vibhajjavada.html" title="Vibhajjavada">Vibhajjavada</a> school of Buddhism and preached it within his domain and worldwide from about <a href="../../../2/5/0/250_BCE_dfa6.html" title="250 BCE">250 BCE</a>. Emperor Ashoka undoubtedly has to be credited with the first serious attempt to develop a Buddhist <a href="../../../p/o/l/Policy.html" title="Policy">policy</a>.</p>

The Stupas of <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanchi.html" title="Sanchi">Sanchi</a> are world famous and the stupa named Sanchi Stupa 1 was built by Emperor Ashoka. During the remaining portion of Ashoka's reign, he pursued an official policy of <a href="../../../n/o/n/Nonviolence.html" title="Nonviolence">nonviolence</a> or <a href="../../../a/h/i/Ahimsa.html" title="Ahimsa">ahimsa</a>.

Enormous resthouses were built through the empire to house travellers and pilgrims free of charge. Ashoka also showed mercy to those imprisoned, allowing them outside one day each year. He attempted to raise the professional ambition of the common man by building <a href="../../../u/n/i/University.html" title="University">universities</a> for study and water transit and <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irrigation.html" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a> systems for <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade.html" title="Trade">trade</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agriculture.html" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>. He treated his subjects as equals regardless of their religion, politics and <a href="../../../c/a/s/Caste.html" title="Caste">caste</a>. The weaker kingdoms surrounding his, which could so easily be overthrown, were instead made to be well-respected allies. In all these respects, Ashoka far exceeded even modern-day world leaders.</p>
<p>He is acclaimed for constructing <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospital.html" title="Hospital">hospitals</a> for animals and people alike, and renovating major roads throughout <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>. Dharmashoka defined the main principles of <i>dharma</i> (<i>dhamma</i> in <a href="../../../p/%C4%81/l/P%C4%81li.html" title="Pāli">Pāli</a>) as nonviolence, <a href="../../../t/o/l/Tolerance.html" title="Tolerance">tolerance</a> of all <a href="../../../s/e/c/Sect.html" title="Sect">sects</a> and opinions, <a href="../../../o/b/e/Obedience.html" title="Obedience">obedience</a> to parents, <a href="../../../r/e/s/Respect.html" title="Respect">respect</a> for the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmin.html" title="Brahmin">Brahmins</a> and other religious teachers and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest.html" title="Priest">priests</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal.html" title="Liberal">liberal</a> towards friends, humane treatment of <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servant_%28domestic%29.html" title="Servant (domestic)">servants</a>, and <a href="../../../g/e/n/Generosity.html" title="Generosity">generosity</a> towards all.

It has a <a href="../../../l/i/o/Lion_Capital_of_Asoka_0d84.html" title="Lion Capital of Asoka">four-lion capital</a> (four lions standing back to back) which was adopted as the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_emblem.html" title="National emblem">emblem</a> of the modern Indian republic. The lion symbolises both Ashoka's imperial rule and the kingship of the Buddha. In translating these monuments, historians learn the bulk of what is assumed to have been true fact of the Maurya Empire. It is difficult to determine whether certain events ever happened, but the stone etchings depict clearly of how Ashoka wanted to be thought and how he wanted to be remembered.</p>
<p>Ashoka's own words as known from his Edicts are: "All men are my children. I am like a father to them. As every father desires the good and the happiness of his children, I wish that all men should be happy always." Edward D'Cruz interprets the Ashokan <i>dharma</i> as a "religion to be used as a symbol of a new imperial unity and a cementing force to weld the diverse and heterogeneous elements of the empire".</p>

<p>Regarding the "Country of the <a href="../../../y/o/n/Yona.html" title="Yona">Yona</a>", Ashoka further specifies in his <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edicts_of_Ashoka_b2a5.html" title="Edicts of Ashoka">Edict No 13</a> (quoted hereafter), that most Hellenistic rulers of the period (<a href="../../../a/n/t/Antiochus_II_Theos_f838.html" title="Antiochus II Theos">Antiochus II Theos</a>, <a href="../../../p/t/o/Ptolemy_II_Philadelphus_239e.html" title="Ptolemy II Philadelphus">Ptolemy II Philadelphus</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antigonus_Gonatas_88f4.html" title="Antigonus Gonatas">Antigonus Gonatas</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magas_of_Cyrene_2f76.html" title="Magas of Cyrene">Magas of Cyrene</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_II_of_Epirus_442a.html" title="Alexander II of Epirus">Alexander II of Epirus</a>) received the teaching of the "Dharma".

<p>Several of these countries are well attested recipients of Ashoka's missions (such as Sri Lanka and Thailand), lending credence to the historicity and the success of these missions. It is all the more surprising that no records of them have remained in the West. The only known record in that sense is that of the 2nd century <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origen.html" title="Origen">Saint Origen</a>, who stated that Buddhists co-existed with Druids in pre-Christian Britain:</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashoka_the_Great_a1f9.html" title="Edit section: Marital alliance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Marital alliance</span></h3>
<p>A "marital alliance" had been concluded between <a href="../../../s/e/l/Seleucus.html" title="Seleucus">Seleucus</a> and Ashoka's grandfather <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandragupta.html" title="Chandragupta">Chandragupta</a> in 303 BCE:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"He (Seleucus) crossed the Indus and waged war with Sandrocottus [Maurya], king of the Indians, who dwelt on the banks of that stream, until they came to an understanding with each other and contracted a marriage relationship." <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appian.html" title="Appian">Appian</a>, History of Rome, The Syrian Wars 55<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>The term used in ancient sources (<a href="../../../e/p/i/Epigamia.html" title="Epigamia">Epigamia</a>) could refer either to a dynastic alliance between the Seleucids and the Mauryas, or more generally to a recognition of marriage between Indian and Greeks. Since there are no records of an Indian princess in the abundant Classical litterature on the Seleucid, it is generally thought that the alliance went the other way around, and that a Seleucid princess may have been bethrothed to the Mauryan Dynasty. This practice in itself was quite common in the Hellenistic world to formalize alliances. There is thus a possibility that Ashoka was partly of Hellenic descent, either from his grandmother if Chandragupta married the Seleucid princess, of from his mother if Chandragupta's son, Bindusura, was the object of the marriage. This remains a hypothesis as there are no known more detailed descriptions of the exact nature of the marital alliance, although this is quite symptomatic of the generally good relationship between the Hellenistic world and Ashoka.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

<p>Information about the life and reign of Ashoka primarily comes from a relatively small number of Buddhist sources. In particular, the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> <i><a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashokavadana.html" title="Ashokavadana">Ashokavadana</a></i> ('Story of Ashoka'), written in the 2nd century, and the two <a href="../../../p/%C4%81/l/P%C4%81li.html" title="Pāli">Pāli</a> chronicles of <a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Lanka_9993.html" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> (the <a href="../../../d/i/p/Dipavamsa.html" title="Dipavamsa">Dipavamsa</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahavamsa.html" title="Mahavamsa">Mahavamsa</a>) provide most of the currently known information about Asoka. Additional information is contributed by the <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edicts_of_Asoka_6aad.html" title="Edicts of Asoka">Edicts of Asoka</a>, whose authorship was finally attributed to the Ashoka of Buddhist legend after the discovery of dynastic lists that gave the name used in the edicts (<i>Priyadarsi</i> – meaning 'favored by the Gods') as a title or additional name of Ashoka Mauriya.</p>
<p>The use of Buddhist sources in reconstructing the life of Ashoka has had a strong influence on perceptions of Ashoka, and the interpretations of his edicts. Building on traditional accounts, early scholars regarded Ashoka as a primarily Buddhist monarch who underwent a conversion to Buddhism and was actively engaged in sponsoring and supporting the Buddhist monastic institution.</p>
<p>Later scholars have tended to question this assessment. The only source of information not attributable to Buddhist sources – the Ashokan edicts – make only a few references to Buddhism directly, despite many references to the concept of <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dhamma.html" title="Dhamma">dhamma</a> (Sanskrit: <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dharma.html" title="Dharma">dharma</a>). Some interpreters have seen this as an indication that Ashoka was attempting to craft an inclusive, poly-religious civil religion for his empire that was centered on the concept of <i>dharma</i> as a positive moral force, but which did not embrace or advocate any particular philosophy attributable to the religious movements of Ashoka's age (such as the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindus</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/i/Jain.html" title="Jain">Jains</a>, Buddhists, and <a href="../../../a/j/i/Ajivika.html" title="Ajivika">Ajivikas</a>).</p>
<p>Most likely, the complex religious environment of the age would have required careful diplomatic management in order to avoid provoking religious unrest. Modern scholars and adherents of the traditional Buddhist perspective both tend to agree that Ashoka's rule was marked by tolerance towards a number of religious faiths.</p>

<p>Ashoka ruled for an estimated forty years, and after his death, the Maurya dynasty lasted just fifty more years. Ashoka had many wives and children, but their names are lost to time. <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahinda.html" title="Mahinda">Mahindra</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanghamitra.html" title="Sanghamitra">Sanghamitra</a> were twins born by his fourth wife, <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devi.html" title="Devi">Devi</a>, in the city of <a href="../../../u/j/j/Ujjain.html" title="Ujjain">Ujjain</a>. He had entrusted to them the job of making his state religion, Buddhism, more popular across the known and the unknown world.

So they were naturally not the ones handling state affairs after him.</p>
<p>In his old age, he seems to have come under the spell of his youngest wife <a href="../../../t/i/s/Tishyaraksha.html" title="Tishyaraksha">Tishyaraksha</a>.

But the official executioners spared Kunala and he became a wandering singer accompanied by his favourite wife Kanchanmala. In <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pataliputra.html" title="Pataliputra">Pataliputra</a>, Ashoka hears Kunala's song, and realizes that Kunala's misfortune may have been a punishment for some past sin of the emperor himself and condemns Tishyaraksha to death, restoring Kunal to the court. Kunala was succeeded by his son, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samprati.html" title="Samprati">Samprati</a>. But his rule did not last long after Ashoka's death.</p>

<p>The reign of Ashoka Maurya could easily have disappeared into history as the ages passed by, and would have, if he had not left behind a record of his trials. The testimony of this wise king was discovered in the form of magnificently sculpted pillars and boulders with a variety of actions and teachings he wished to be published etched into the stone.

<p>One of the more enduring legacies of Ashoka Maurya was the model that he provided for the relationship between Buddhism and the state. Throughout Theravada Southeastern Asia, the model of rulership embodied by Ashoka replaced the notion of divine kingship that had previously dominated (in the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angkor.html" title="Angkor">Angkor</a> kingdom, for instance). Under this model of 'Buddhist kingship', the king sought to legitimize his rule not through descent from a divine source, but by supporting and earning the approval of the Buddhist <i><a href="../../../s/a/n/Sangha.html" title="Sangha">sangha</a></i>. Following Ashoka's example, kings established monasteries, funded the construction of stupas, and supported the ordination of monks in their kingdom. Many rulers also took an active role in resolving disputes over the status and regulation of the sangha, as Ashoka had in calling a conclave to settle a number of contentious issues during his reign. This development ultimately lead to a close association in many Southeast Asian countries between the monarchy and the religious hierarchy, an association that can still be seen today in the state-supported <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism_in_Thailand_8150.html" title="Buddhism in Thailand">Buddhism of Thailand</a> and the traditional role of the Thai king as both a religious and secular leader.</p>
<p>Ashoka also said that all his courtiers were true to their self and governed the people in a moral manner.</p>
