<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashbury_College_3ba2.html" title="Edit section: Reputation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Reputation</span></h3>
<p>Ashbury has a reputation as being the premier university preparatory school in Ottawa, and one of the best in Canada. Students hail from Canada, The United States, Japan, Germany, and many other countries throughout the world. Ashbury is known for educating children of important political and diplomatic figures</p>

<p>Ashbury students are divided into four houses upon entering in ninth grade. Each house has rougly 30 students per grade and 120 in each house during any academic year. The houses are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Woollcombe House (for boarding students),</li>
<li>New House</li>
<li>Connaught House (known as C-House)</li>
<li>Alexander House (known as A- House).</li>
</ul>
<p>Students with older siblings or alumni parents are put in their "family" house and others are randomly assigned. Houses are permanent from 9th grade until graduation and identification is often through the house-specific neck-tie or commonly worn house t-shirts during P.E., house events or after 5pm when No. 3 (casual) uniform can be worn. The houses compete for the "Wilson Shield" which is awarded at the end of the academic year.</p>
<p>Each house is led by prefects, graduating students chosen for their leadership skills, involvement in school life and strong academic standing. Prefects organize house events, interhouse competitions, and fundraising activities under the guidance of a housemaster, a teacher at Ashbury affliated with each house. Prefects are easily identified by their burgundy blazers. One prefect is appointed school captain each year.</p>

<p>The liberal education provided by the Ashbury College Senior School teaches students to think, speak and write clearly, critically and creatively. It leads them to explore the core subjects that comprise our human heritage and are the hallmarks of an educated person. It develops a healthy body and illuminates the spirit by inspiring students to look beyond themselves towards the greater good. Teaching at the College is characterized by meaningful and respectful relationships between faculty and students, the teachers’ profound engagement with their disciplines, and a diverse range of pedagogical approaches. Ashbury graduates enter university with the knowledge, skills, integrity and compassion born of careful scholarship, richly rewarding faculty contacts, physical activity and spiritual reflection.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashbury_College_3ba2.html" title="Edit section: Junior School">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Junior School</span></h2>
<p>The Junior School is a division of Ashbury College for male students from grade four to grade eight. Unlike the Senior School's blue colors, Junior School uses green as its dominant color which is prevalent in many locations including the website and uniforms, for example. Junior School students all wear the same tie with maroon, grey, and green strips, while Senior School students wear a different school tie on Mondays and wear an appropriate tie of choice on other days of the week. Senior School students also have the option of wearing a house tie. Like the Senior School, Junior School students are placed into one of four houses upon their arrival: Dragons, Hobbits, Wizards and Goblins. These houses come from <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hobbit_6754.html" title="The Hobbit">The Hobbit</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_c961.html" title="The Lord of the Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a></i> by <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._R._R._Tolkien_236d.html" title="J. R. R. Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>. Houses compete extensively throughout the academic year in athletic (e.g. Track and Field Day), artistic (e.g. House Music Competition, Shakespeare Reading Contest), academic (e.g. Scholar Roll), and social (e.g. Honour Board) activities and house points are accumulated throughout the year. Students are identified by house in many situations, primarily athletic, where everyone sports a house shirt with varying colours for physical education activities. Students are also assigned a "home form", where there are presently one for each of grades four, five, and six, and three for both grades seven and eight.</p>
<p>Since 2003, the Junior School also features a leadership program called L.E.E.D. The program's goal is to develop leadership qualities in students. Students in grade 4 and 5 are introduced to the program at a young age. In grades 7 and 8, house captains, who are nominated or elected by the faculty and/or student body, serve as leaders and role models for the house. They are responsible for organizing activities and initiatives. For example, responsibilities include organizing inter-house sport activities and fund-raising for charities, with the ultimate goal of driving their house to win the annual competition. The arts programme is another area of focus of the Junior School. In the Junior school, classes of art, music and dramatic arts are offered to students. One of these courses is optional for students in grade 8. The arts program is very diverse and includes school play productions, inter-house music competitions, and the creation of personal artwork. Junior School students have participated in Theatre Ashbury production, and former Junior School students have often played major roles. Recently, the Junior School has presented musicals, beginning with "Rana's Pond" (2002), and continuing with two original productions. These were "News", (in 2004) directed by Ingrid Boyd, with words by Ingrid Boyd and David Polk, music by John Merritt and set by Elisabeth Arbuckle and, another original production ("Artifacts!") produced (2006) by Alex Menzies with words by David Polk and music based on established scores, and set design once again by Elisabeth Arbuckle. This production will be re-presented spring 2007. The Junior School is proud of the high level of professionalism that its Drama, Music, and Art Departments have shown in these productions.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashbury_College_3ba2.html" title="Edit section: Junior School Philosophy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Junior School Philosophy</span></h3>
<p>It is the aim of the Junior School to enable every boy to develop to his fullest potential in academic, athletic and social skills. The school provides clear standards and guidelines in work, play, sport, dress and behaviour.</p>
<p>Staff members play an important role in this process by: expecting the boys to do their best in work; by giving the necessary encouragement and stimulus in the area of study; by actively encouraging excellence and effort in all activities; by themselves conforming to the school's code of dress and behaviour; and, as important as any of these, by developing relationships based on mutual politeness and respect.</p>

<p>The Great Hall is Ashbury's cafeteria. Opened in 2004, the Great Hall now serves breakfast, lunch and dinner for boarders and lunch for day students (Junior and Senior school alike). The Great Hall offers selections for vegetarians as well as those with other needs. Ashbury is working towards becoming a "nut-free environment". Parents are welcome to join students for lunch. In addition to cash being tendered, many students are able to use a "Flex Card". Parents place money onto the Flex Card as needed and students swipe their Photo ID card to purchase items in the Great Hall. The Flex Card doubles as a library card.</p>
<p>The Great Hall is only a part of the new addition to the College that was completed in 2004. Other parts include a new double gymnasium, four new classrooms (equipped with SmartBoards), a student common area, a staff room, and offices.</p>
<p>The Great Hall was just re-named in 2006 as the Maclaren Hall in honour of an Alumnus Don Maclaren.</p>
