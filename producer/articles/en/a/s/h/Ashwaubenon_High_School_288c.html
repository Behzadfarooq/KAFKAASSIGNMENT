<p>Ashwaubenon High School is a reputable high school in its area. The school has had much success in their athletics programs including football, men's and women's basketball, swimming, softball, and bowling. The football team won the <a href="../../../w/i/a/WIAA_beb0.html" title="WIAA">WIAA</a> Division-2 state championship 4 times in 1996, 2000, 2001, and 2005. During the 2006 season, proper paperwork was not submitted to the <a href="../../../w/i/a/WIAA_beb0.html" title="WIAA">WIAA</a> regarding the age of one of team's players until after the first four games of the season (all wins). The <a href="../../../w/i/a/WIAA_beb0.html" title="WIAA">WIAA</a> penalized the school by forcing a forfeit for each of the four games. The team continued on to win the remaining four games. This spurred the "Best Undefeated 4-4 Football Team Ever" slogan the team's apparel sported for that year. The softball team had much success in the late 80s and early 90s winning multiple state championships. The school song is printed on a banner in the gymnasium, though the only words often sung are the final three. The song's lyrics are as thus:</p>
<p>We’ll cheer, cheer, cheer<br />
for Ashwaubenon<br />
We pledge our best to you.<br />
We’ll back our team<br />
till the game is won<br />
and victory shines through.<br />
We’re strong and mighty, loyal and true.<br />
We hold our banner high<br />
There’s none so fine as Ashwaubenon.<br />
You’re our team.<br />
We love you<br />
<br /></p>

<p>The Math Team at AHS has been very successful as shown in its undefeated 2004-2005 season and placing second in the 2005-2006 season. As of March 14, 2007, the current team is 1-3-1, finishing in third place just behind Bay Port by only a couple of points. The team is largely propelled by its two senior captains and its junior star, Karl "The Killer" who has placed first in his age group every year for the past 3 years, once for all age groups in the 2005-2006 season.</p>
<p>The Ashwaubenon Chess Team is clever and inventive in their play. Two players in the spring of 2005 invented "Teleporting Relay Kings with SuperKnights" in which the king can be used as a target for other pieces to move twice in one turn. The king is also able to teleport to any square occupied by an opponent's pawn in place of their turn. The SuperKnights have the ability to move in any L-shape, but cannot jump other pieces. The chess team is also known for its insults against the team's former advisor, Dan Newel. It originated in his inability to defeat a large portion of the team, but even after much practice in the summer of 2005, and his newfound chess-playing skill, the advisor still found himself the target of several jokes and jeers. It continues in large part due to his inexplicable lack of control in remaining advisor. The team suffered its largest embarrassment when playing against Green Bay <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preble_High_School_a35d.html" title="Preble High School">Preble High School</a> and Ashwaubenon's number-3 ranked player was defeated in six moves. The team regained its reputation however, when the number-1 ranked player declared victory. His match ended 12 moves later.</p>
<p>The Ashwaubenon Social Studies Academic games team is in the midst of building a dynasty. It racked up THREE Bay Conference victories and champions of the Social Studies portion of the competition. Under the tutelage of Mrs. Bunkleman, history teacher extraordinaire, the team has risen to an elite level. The team won their third championship in 2007 with a returning captain known as the black hole of useless geographical knowledge and a bevy of new members joining them in this "rebuilding" year, and will go for an unprecedented four-peat in 2008. With the graduation of the team's captain the past 3 years, the team will need to step up it's game, though a number of underclassmen will be returning, led by an advanced junior with a unique voice and a knack for convincing his teammates. The team is destined to prove that history will repeat itself. Fund raising efforts are underway to help purchase team uniforms.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashwaubenon_High_School_288c.html" title="Edit section: Technology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Technology</span></h2>
<p>Ashwaubenon High School has always been on the forefront of technology within the Bay Conference. As of the 2005-2006 school year, Ashwaubenon made a large computer purchase. They replaced their old Macintosh iMac generation three and four fleet with the new Dell Optiplex GX620 Desktops. At the beginning of the year, achieving a secure and proper technological environment was paramount. However, the IT staff was overwhelmed with manipulations of shared folders and obtained administration passwords.</p>
<p>A very drastic change to the learning environment occurred the third and fourth terms. Many students refer to this time as the infamous "Halo Scare". This era of technology mischief included the distribution of Halo: Combat Evolved through various shared folders located along the school's internal network. It was common to see groups of four or five students playing Halo during scheduled research or "lab" time. Many competitors would adopt aliases of well-loved teachers' names. Also, many students exchanged a common game referred to as "Ninja Training" via USB drives, and to the irritation of teachers around the school, many students played the popular song "Streamline" by techno-band Newton.</p>
<p>This period of technology misconduct was over before the start of the 2006-2007 school year. There has been a much larger crackdown on students playing games during the school day. The latest new craze is the Windows 95 version of Doom.</p>
