<p>Ash is a typical <a href="../../../s/h/%C5%8D/Sh%C5%8Dnen.html" title="Shōnen">shōnen</a> hero: very excitable, courageous, empathic, sometimes focused to the point of distraction, and clever when it comes to his obsessive interest; in his case, Pokémon training, though often clueless in other areas. He is also extremely valiant, he can be confident to the point where he is arrogant and is known for being very stubborn. He has quite the reckless streak, which has lead him to troublesome situations and even near death. In the episode, "Battling the Enemy Within", Ash gets himself possessed by an ancient evil king's spirit, because he just could not resist messing with the ancient artifacts.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> In the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Pok%C3%A9mon%7E_The_First_Movie_44a5.html" title="Pokémon: The First Movie">Pokémon: The First Movie</a>, he runs into the path of a pair of psychic attacks fired by <a href="../../../m/e/w/Mewtwo.html" title="Mewtwo">Mewtwo</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/w/Mew_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29_a9c8.html" title="Mew (Pokémon)">Mew</a>, and is turned to stone, but then brought back to life by the Pokémon's tears. Most fans have considered that Ash was killed by the blast as a character in the movie had previously said that the Pokémon's tears bring back "lives lost".;<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> Despite this, Ash also shows impressive stamina, having on several occasions been hit by Pokémon attacks without suffering any lasting harm, such as having his <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charizard.html" title="Charizard">Charizard</a> breathe fire on him,<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> though such events are usually used for comedic effect.</p>
<p>Ash was ten years old at the beginning of the series. In the episode "The Battle Of The Badge", Ash says that it was a whole year since he, Pikachu, and Misty first came to Viridian City, meaning that he would be 11 at that time. Also in the short called <i>Pikachu &amp; Pichu</i> in the third movie, (Ash said it was the day he met Pikachu) his age at that time would logically be around 12. Thus it can be logically deduced that at the end of each adventure through a region or challenge, Ash ages 1 year. At this point he is 15 when he enters Shinou.</p>

<p>Ash strongly considers all of his Pokémon to be his friends. As a Pokémon trainer, Ash carries six Pokémon with him that form his team's active roster. However, due to the anime not strictly conforming to the video games, there are Pokémon that are on Ash's team that have not been formally caught by Ash. This often allows Ash to be accompanied by more than six Pokémon, especially since Pikachu, the only permanent member of his active roster, never stays in a <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9_Ball_f5df.html" title="Poké Ball">Poké Ball</a>.</p>

<p>These are the Pokémon that Ash is currently carrying around with him in Sinnoh. The first two are ones that he has with him at the beginning of his adventure. Just like Hoenn, Ash only intended to bring Pikachu, but Aipom snuck on the ship to Sinnoh.</p>

<dd>Ash considers his best friend to be his Pikachu. In the first episode, Pikachu disliked him, and shows it by shocking him frequently. It still shocks him to wake him up in emergencies or when he is accidentally in the way of an electric attack. His Pikachu has the particular characteristic of hating <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9_Ball_f5df.html" title="Poké Ball">Poké Balls</a> so it always tags along with Ash. At the end of first episode, the two of them become best friends.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> Pikachu was the first Pokémon that Ash obtained, and the only one that has always been with him. After losing to <a href="../../../l/t/2E/Lt._Surge_6e00.html" title="Lt. Surge">Lt. Surge</a>'s <a href="../../../r/a/i/Raichu.html" title="Raichu">Raichu</a>, Pikachu decides not to evolve. Pikachu is often considered to be exceptionally powerful for its species, which makes it a consistent target for Team Rocket. Shortly before his first gym battle in Hoenn, Ash taught Pikachu the attack <i>Iron Tail</i> initially for use against the gym leader's Rock-type Pokémon, though it has proven very useful in many battles since then. In the Battle Frontier, it learned to use <i>Volt Tackle</i>, which has also become one of its signature attacks. Pikachu is also Ash's second Pokémon to have defeated a <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legendary_Pok%C3%A9mon_ac7f.html" title="Legendary Pokémon">Legendary Pokémon</a>, having defeated <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Frontier_Brains_4612.html#Brandon" title="List of Frontier Brains">Pyramid King Brandon</a>'s <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regice.html" title="Regice">Regice</a> in Ash's third battle against him.</dd>

However, after Ash found the Aipom, he quickly befriended it. Ash gave the Aipom his hat but it gave it back. It then follows Ash and turns up at the Grand Festival, where it steals his hat again. Near the end of the Grand Festival, Ash battles the Aipom and captures it. Like Bayleef before it, Aipom became jealous of Pikachu. Aipom is also occasionally seen on Ash's shoulder. Ash and Aipom show a very strong bond. Like when he left for Hoenn, Ash wanted to start his journey again for Sinnoh and so left behind all of his Pokémon with the exception of Pikachu, but Aipom stowed away on the ship. So Ash welcomed Aipom into his Sinnoh squad. It travels with him for the end of the Battle Frontier saga and so far the beginning of the Sinnoh saga. After watching May battle in the Grand Festival, Aipom seems to taken an interest in Pokémon Contests. When Ash decided to use it in a contest in Sinnoh, it pulled off a dazzling show, but didn't make it to the final round.</dd>

<p>As Ash can only carry six Pokémon around at once, he often leaves his Pokémon with Tracey and Professor Oak (this is similar to the video games, in which extra Pokémon are stored in a computer). The scriptwriters have adopted this as a device to get Ash new Pokémon without having to lose his old ones. These Pokémon even appear in the episodes of <i><a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_Chronicles_8aea.html" title="Pokémon Chronicles">Pokémon Chronicles</a></i> that are set at the laboratory, and Ash always visits them when he is between regions.

Since then, it has been on Ash's team throughout the entire <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanto_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29_f874.html" title="Kanto (Pokémon)">Kanto</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange_Islands_51b8.html" title="Orange Islands">Orange Islands</a> sagas, and part of the <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johto.html" title="Johto">Johto</a> saga, helping out with various Gym battles. It is a leader and mediator, preferring peaceful resolutions to conflicts over fighting. It had a chance to evolve in the Kanto saga, but it chose not to until it was ready and succeeded in staying a Bulbasaur. Later in the Johto saga, Prof. Oak needed it to help mediate the rivalry between the Grass-type Pokémon at his lab, so Ash sent it over. Its mediation skills still keep the peace between the many Pokémon that reside in Professor Oak's lab. May's Bulbasaur apparently has a crush on Ash's Bulbasaur, and the feeling appears mutual. Bulbasaur's last appearance was in a battle against Brandon.</dd>

<dd>In order to show Misty and Brock he could properly catch more Pokémon, Ash found Krabby on a nearby beach and caught it without any effort.

Krabby remained in Pallet Town until the first match of the Indigo League championships, where it evolved into a Kingler in its first battle. At the same time, it won the first round all by itself, defeating an <a href="../../../e/x/e/Exeggutor.html" title="Exeggutor">Exeggutor</a>, a <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seadra.html" title="Seadra">Seadra</a>, and a <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golbat.html" title="Golbat">Golbat</a>.

In Johto, Snorlax was used in a sumo contest, and later against the Pokémon of the final Gym Leader Clair. After Ash's adventures in Hoenn, May's <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munchlax.html" title="Munchlax">Munchlax</a> and his Snorlax got to be friends.

However, despite its newfound size and power, Donphan still has the personality of a playful young child, sometimes to the dismay of smaller Pokémon that it attempts to play with. Despite its childish nature and the fact that it wants to play with Pokémon that are smaller than it, Ash has used Donphan in a number of battles, including his Battle Frontier match with Pike Queen Lucy and her Seviper.

Its most notable appearance was in Ash's sixth Gym Battle where it had to face a Shiny Swellow that knew Aerial Ace. After a lot of practice shortly after, Ash's Swellow mastered the move as well. Swellow has also been able to withstand electric attacks that would normally harm it severely, either because of great stamina or simply extreme determination. It is also well known for its staying power in major battles, often being able to defeat multiple opponents despite taking huge amounts of damage. Swellow was also one of Ash's six Pokémon to compete in the Hoenn League. Coupled with its impressive speed and admirable aerial maneuvers, Swellow is considered to be one of Ash's strongest and most valuable team members to date.

<dd>Since Ash captured it as a Treecko, it has been one of the eldest Pokémon in Ash's Hoenn team. Treecko tended to be a loner, preferring its moments of solitude up atop a tree to the company of the rest of its team. Surprisingly, Treecko didn't know any actual Grass attacks when it joined Ash's team, but Ash later taught it <i>Bullet Seed</i>. A notable feature is a twig from the tree it used to live in Petalburg Forest. It often carries the twig around and puts it in its mouth as a sign of defiance to opponents. After evolving into Grovyle during a battle with a trainer's Loudred, its first act was to use its new <i>Leaf Blade</i> attack to slice off a larger twig from a nearby tree. Grovyle helped Ash defeat Norman and his Slaking for his fifth Hoenn Badge, and was another one of the six Pokémon he used in the Hoenn League. Then, during a rematch against a wild Tropius in the Battle Frontier saga, Grovyle defeated the Pokémon but later found out that Nurse Joy's Meganium, whom it had a crush on, was in love with the wild Tropius. This crushed Grovyle's spirit but when Team Rocket attacked Meganium, it evolved into Sceptile to protect it, making it the fourth Stage 2 Pokémon Ash has had, after Butterfree, Charizard and Pidgeot. This evolution, and its rejection of love from Meganium, caused mental shocks that prevented Sceptile from being able to use its attacks. Luckily, a few episodes later, Ash and co. met Spenser of the Battle Palace. His involvement enabled Sceptile to regain its full strength, and during their battle for the Spirit Symbol, it was revealed that Sceptile could use the Solarbeam technique, which it used to defeat Spenser's Claydol. Sceptile has since become one of Ash's most powerful Pokémon, even strong enough to hold it's own in battle against certain Legendary Pokémon.

After recovering, Charmander eventually rejected his old trainer for Ash. At this stage, it was a very happy and very loyal Pokémon. Yet, for some reason, when it evolved into a Charmeleon, it underwent a severe attitude change, only wanting to fight strong opponents, and dismissing Ash completely (this is similar to a feature of the Pokémon video game series, in which high-level Pokémon occasionally disobey the player's commands if the player doesn't have the right gym badges).</dd>

<dd>Charizard is one of the stage two Pokémon Ash has used so far, and is by far the most powerful <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_types.html#Fire-type" title="Pokémon types">Fire Pokémon</a> Ash has ever had, also being able to use <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_types.html#Dragon-type" title="Pokémon types">Dragon</a> attacks. Its signature finishing move in battle is the use of <i>Seismic Toss</i>, and very few Pokémon have ever been able to escape it. Charizard is also unique in that he is one of only two non-Legendary Pokémon in the series to ever defeat a Legendary Pokémon, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Articuno.html" title="Articuno">Articuno</a>, in a one on one battle in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_Frontier_f540.html#Battle_Factory" title="Battle Frontier">Battle Factory</a> with <a href="../../../n/o/l/Noland.html" title="Noland">Noland</a>. This battle gave Charizard the chance to use one of the most powerful Fire-type attacks of all, <i>Overheat</i>. Before it left to train in the Charicific Valley Charizard was a senior member of Ash's team, often sleeping in the sun and enjoying solitude while the other Pokémon were having fun.</dd>

<dd>Notably, whenever Charizard does come back to Ash, it uses its <i>Flamethrower</i> on him. A rivalry with Tracey's elderly <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scyther.html" title="Scyther">Scyther</a> was briefly touched upon during the Orange Islands saga. Charizard, along with Squirtle and Bulbasaur, made a return in Ash's rematch against Brandon, the leader of the Battle Pyramid.</dd>

<dd>Having been abandoned by another trainer, when Ash first saw Squirtle, it was the tough leader of a rogue group called the “Squirtle Squad”, comprised abused and abandoned Squirtle who committed acts of mischief. Initially distrustful of humans, Squirtle was moved when he saw how much Ash cared for Pikachu. After the Squirtle Squad saved a nearby town from a forest fire, Squirtle joined Ash on his adventures while its fellow squad members formed the town's fire department. Later, in the Orange Islands, Squirtle met its match in a firefighting <a href="../../../w/a/r/Wartortle.html" title="Wartortle">Wartortle</a>, but the two Pokémon later became friendly rivals. In Johto, Squirtle reunited with its former comrades, and after seeing its squad members in bad shape due to lack of leadership, Squirtle returned to the Squirtle Squad. It later returned to Ash's side to help him in the Silver Conference, but left to once again lead the Squirtle Squad when the tournament concluded. Following the Conference, Squirtle was absent from the series until the fourth-to-last episode of Advanced Battle, when it returned to Ash (alongside Charizard and Bulbasaur) for his third and final match at the Battle Pyramid. Notably, Squirtle and its fellow squad members wear sunglasses. Squirtle only wears its sunglasses if getting into certain fights, or being heroic in some way. Squirtle has also been seen wearing the sunglasses when he and Ash, Misty, and Tracey's Pokémon encounter <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elekid.html" title="Elekid">Elekid</a> in the "Pikachu's Rescue Adventure" animated short.</dd>

<p>For various reasons, Ash has left behind many of the Pokémon that he has captured. Unlike the Pokémon at the lab, Charizard or Squirtle, these cannot be reclaimed with a phone call. Ash has promised to return to a number of the Pokémon he left, but has failed to reclaim any as yet. However, some of them have been featured in the 10th opening of <i>Pocket Monsters</i>, suggesting that he'll be seeing them again.</p>

<dd>The first Pokémon that Ash ever catches is a Caterpie. It is also the Pokémon that he caught without any effort. It evolved into a Metapod the following day. Metapod is next seen about a week later, when it was involved in a Pokémon Battle against another Metapod where the only attack that either could use was <i>Harden</i>. Soon after, it evolves into Butterfree, making it the first Stage 2 Pokémon Ash ever had at the time. Butterfree's main use is its arsenal of status-affecting moves. During his time on the St. Anne, Ash trade Butterfree for a Raticate but traded for it back later. Ash let it go during the Butterfree mating season along with its mate, a pink Butterfree, making it the first Pokémon Ash has released into the wild. Notably, it now wears a yellow scarf that Brock gave it before it left. It is possible that Ash will see it again sometime in the future as it is seen on one of the Japanese openings.</dd>

<dd>The second Pokémon that Ash captured was a Pidgeotto.

Shortly after Ash returned to Pallet Town, Pidgeotto evolved into a Pidgeot to protect a group of <a href="../../../p/i/d/Pidgey.html" title="Pidgey">Pidgey</a> and Pidgeotto from a group of <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spearow.html" title="Spearow">Spearow</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/a/Fearow.html" title="Fearow">Fearow</a> that was terrorizing them.

Shortly after Ash won the Orange League Championship, Ash found the Lapras' pod, and returned it to its family. Lapras returned once since its departure, by which time it had gained the leadership of the pod thanks to its bravery. When Ash did see Lapras, he almost didn't recognize it, and was surprised that it had grown so much.
