<p>I added those four over breakfast, and there were to be others coming which would outrank them, i.e. Graham, Moresby, Princess Royal are all inhabited, but larger than the Gulf Islands; I'll wait until I have the entire BC list done and then compare and insert appropriately. I thought this was about population ranking, not pure size (otherwise where's Banks Island, for example - where Resolute is)? Saltspring is on the current list, and while it may be the most populous of BC's islands (other than Lulu/Richmond) it certianly isn't the largest (not even in the Gulf, where it is exceeded - I think - by Texada and Quadra in size.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 20:30, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>For those who may notice an odd trend in my editing lately, I've been working on a number of Demographics sections for different populations (provinces, cities) in Canada. I found a number of the sections contained "fiddled" statistics that artificially bundled together a number of different groups and called them "White" (Canadian = white? I don't think so), bundled together African and Caribbean origins and called them "black", etc. We all know that discussions of ethnic origin are much more complex situations than that, and that, if done improperly, they can be very harmful.</p>
<p>As a result, I've taken the step of putting tables in to replace this information in a number of the articles that are effectively regurgitation (referenced, of course) of the 2001 Census data for those places. I believe that using Statistics Canada's descriptors and data is the most NPOV and respectful way to do this challenging task.</p>
<p>However, I would like to add the footnote that, in a number of these situations, I don't think that these numbers are really needed AT ALL. I put them in place because I don't like deleting entries outright, so I figured this was the least harmful substitute. However, I would be happy to have someone delete the ethnic origin information completely so we can get back to discussing culture and cultures, rather than race. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshleyMorton_4612.html" title="User:AshleyMorton">AshleyMorton</a> 21:46, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I saw your comments on the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_90ec.html" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a> talk page. As far as I am concerned, you are absolutely and totally correct in what you are doing. This is the only referenced &amp; NPOV way to go: use the straight Statistics Canada self-reported numbers on ethnic origin rather than fiddling with numbers to meet some USian or other concept of "race". Keep up the good work. <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuigizanasi_db83.html" title="User:Luigizanasi">Luigizanasi</a> 05:37, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I saw your revision of the Saint John, N.B. article. Good job. Those earlier stats really weirded me out. I'm not totally in favour of the StatsCan ones either, but as you wrote, it's a compromise of sorts. I think if StatsCan is asking those questions in the first place, why Is Canadian a choice? Or American? Maybe the purpose is to blur the lines. I don't know. Anyway, I like what you have done. <a href="../../../d/d/d/User%7EDDD_DDD_0d37.html" title="User:DDD DDD">DDD DDD</a> 01:51, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regarding your userpage - I agree with your principle, but you give the example of muddling together African and Caribbean to get Black - as far as I know, <i>Black</i> is the prefered term at Statscan ... do you have some reason to believe this is not the case? The 2001 census data for <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scarborough%2C_Ontario_7c7b.html" title="Scarborough, Ontario">Scarborough, Ontario</a> lists <i>Black</i> as an ethnicity <a href="http://www12.statcan.ca/english/profil01/CP01/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=CSD&amp;Code1=3520001&amp;Geo2=PR&amp;Code2=35&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=scarborough&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;B1=Population&amp;Custom=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www12.statcan.ca/english/profil01/CP01/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=CSD&amp;Code1=3520001&amp;Geo2=PR&amp;Code2=35&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=scarborough&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;B1=Population&amp;Custom=" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and I've been sorely tempted to move the current <i>African + Caribbean</i> currently listed to <i>Black</i>, but a bit nervous about one of the contributors there getting uppity about it. Anyways, in the spirit of this, and with your apparent interest in the issue, I wondered if you'd give me an opinion on the issue. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 17:26, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry for intruding.., but don't confuse ethnicity and <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visible_minority.html" title="Visible minority">visible minority</a> status. They are two different things. If you look at the <a href="http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/Products/Reference/2001handbook/pdf/2B.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/Products/Reference/2001handbook/pdf/2B.pdf" rel="nofollow">2001 Census questionnaire (PDF)</a>, Question 17 asks: "To which ethnic or cultural group(s) did this person’s ancestors belong?" This is what determines the "ethnicity" data. The detailed responses to that question are <a href="http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/standard/themes/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?Temporal=2001&amp;PID=62911&amp;APATH=3&amp;GID=431515&amp;METH=1&amp;PTYPE=55440&amp;THEME=44&amp;FOCUS=0&amp;AID=0&amp;PLACENAME=0&amp;PROVINCE=0&amp;SEARCH=0&amp;GC=99&amp;GK=NA&amp;VID=0&amp;FL=0&amp;RL=0&amp;FREE=0" class="external text" title="http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/standard/themes/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?Temporal=2001&amp;PID=62911&amp;APATH=3&amp;GID=431515&amp;METH=1&amp;PTYPE=55440&amp;THEME=44&amp;FOCUS=0&amp;AID=0&amp;PLACENAME=0&amp;PROVINCE=0&amp;SEARCH=0&amp;GC=99&amp;GK=NA&amp;VID=0&amp;FL=0&amp;RL=0&amp;FREE=0" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Visible minorities are determined by a completely different question, No. 19, which asks: "Is this person: White, Chinese, South Asian, Black, etc.". Data on visible minorities is <a href="http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/standard/themes/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?Temporal=2001&amp;PID=62912&amp;APATH=3&amp;GID=431515&amp;METH=1&amp;PTYPE=55440&amp;THEME=44&amp;FOCUS=0&amp;AID=0&amp;PLACENAME=0&amp;PROVINCE=0&amp;SEARCH=0&amp;GC=99&amp;GK=NA&amp;VID=0&amp;FL=0&amp;RL=0&amp;FREE=0" class="external text" title="http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/standard/themes/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?Temporal=2001&amp;PID=62912&amp;APATH=3&amp;GID=431515&amp;METH=1&amp;PTYPE=55440&amp;THEME=44&amp;FOCUS=0&amp;AID=0&amp;PLACENAME=0&amp;PROVINCE=0&amp;SEARCH=0&amp;GC=99&amp;GK=NA&amp;VID=0&amp;FL=0&amp;RL=0&amp;FREE=0" rel="nofollow">here</a>. So the two sets of numbers are completely unrelated. You can't add <i>African + Caribbean</i> to get <i>Black</i>, or make any assumptions about the relation between people's ethnic origin and "Visible minority" status. On the page you linked, "Black" referes to people who have said they are a member of that visible minority, not to people who are ethnically "Black", whatever that means. <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuigizanasi_db83.html" title="User:Luigizanasi">Luigizanasi</a> 00:08, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, sorry to talk here on your userpage, Ashley, but I think this is mostly the answer I was looking for ... that my language was imprecise. But doublechecking Scarborough, I see we explicitly say both <i>Visible Minority Group</i> and <i>Caribbean and African-Canadian</i> in a way that likely needs work. Thanks, such as it is. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 00:35, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the concept I believe in has been clarified above - that is to say that you can use "visible minority status" if you want (as long as you use that term), but I believe "ethnic origin" is much more valuable, for several reasons. Here are some:</p>
<ul>
<li>The StatsCan statistics do not include aboriginal-identity people as "visible minorities". I believe this is because they are generally trying to track immigrant populations, but you end up with the "non-visible-minority" category lumping together "white" and "aboriginal" - a weird combination, in my mind, when you are still going to specify black, Asian, etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The StatsCan stats separate out Korean, Japanese and Chinese, while lumping together all of "Black" and all of "Latin American". I don't understand the justification of this - some sort of analysis that Korean and Japanese facial features can be distinguished on the street while, say, Somalian vs. Ghanian can't be? I don't believe that the category choices are appropriate or neutral (not that I'm even sure what they're trying to prove, just that they don't seem appropriate to me.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Many Canadian cities are &gt;90% "White". To have a stat that says "97% White, 3% Other" is useless. As a result, the "Ethnic Origin" data give at least <i>some</i> hints as to the background of the city, in those cases.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you want to know "racial" information, you can, to a great degree, discern it from "ethnic origin" stats. The converse can not be said.</li>
</ul>

<p>A new article <b><a href="../../../s/s/_/SS_Florizel_350c.html" title="SS Florizel">SS Florizel</a></b> of Newfoundland and Labrador context has been created and we invite you to contribute to the article to firstly get it up to DYK status and hopefully to feature article status. The article is about a bit of Newfoundland's marine history and the sinking of the <a href="../../../s/s/_/SS_Florizel_350c.html" title="SS Florizel">SS Florizel</a> and it’s many passengers including a little girl Betty Munn. If you have any knowledge of the subject please pitch in add/edit and if not specific knowledge of the article if you could help by generating articles on any of the red-ink (wikified) topics, would be great. Thanks so much to help on this article. As a suggestion, maybe every Monday we could offer up a new topic to collaborate on and then pool our talents on that one.

<p>Thanks for your help with the religion stats on <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberta.html" title="Alberta">Alberta</a>!

The groups listed in the demographic tables should link to information about <i>xxxx-Canadian</i> (or some such) because it is more specific, <i>even if it is a red-link</i> because tells readers (and potential editors) where WP has holes that need to be fixed, it's also more consistent, and allows a new article on, for example, Togolese Canadians to be instantly linked to from relevant articles.

<p>Thanks for backing me up, if we were to change the name east Indian to something else or just Indian it would add to the confusion and then we'd also have to change every other page where we used stats can anyways. It wouldn't really make sense. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETotallyTempo_9b6f.html" title="User:TotallyTempo">TotallyTempo</a> (<a href="../../../t/o/t/User_talk%7ETotallyTempo_5ad8.html" title="User talk:TotallyTempo">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TotallyTempo_3516.html" title="Special:Contributions/TotallyTempo">contribs</a>) 18:37, 9 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>I agree, a pic with his eyes open would be fantastic. However, there's a bunch of people enforcing a rule that says fair use images should never been used to illustrate living people. They've been slash burning a bunch of the premiers, from PEI to Nunavut. I don't personally agree with this, but I've been preemptively trying to make sure every important politican has a free image, by begging people on Flickr to license their images as <a href="../../../c/c/-/CC-BY_6f19.html" title="CC-BY">CC-BY</a>. I expect the people to come hacking through Danny's article in the next couple of months, so when they do, we do have a lesser pic to replace. -- <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanimum_8561.html" title="User:Zanimum">Zanimum</a> 19:06, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
