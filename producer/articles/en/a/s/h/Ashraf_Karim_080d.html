<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashraf_Karim_080d.html" title="Edit section: Background">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h2>
<p>Ashraf came to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">Britain</a> from <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh.html" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a> and was already betroved to Sufia, who was still a child in Bangladesh. Before he returned to Bangladesh to be married to Sufia, he met and had a fling with Stella, a young <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippy.html" title="Hippy">hippy</a>, and their relationship continued on and off after Sufia emigrated to Britain to be with her husband in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>. Sufia knew about Stella, and suspected other affairs and found them all distressing.<sup id="_ref-EEHandbook_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EEHandbook" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the beginning, Ashraf worked in a car maufacturing plant in the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midlands.html" title="Midlands">Midlands</a>. Later on, relatives in <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walford.html" title="Walford">Walford</a> offered him a job in one of their corner shops and he, Sufia and their two small children, Shireen and Sohail, came south to live. He soon saved enough money to open a business of his own, although <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racist.html" title="Racist">racist</a> taunts and attacks made life difficult for him. Even so, by putting in long hours he finally made a success of running his third shop in Walford High Street.<sup id="_ref-EEHandbook_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EEHandbook" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ashraf was the second cousin of <a href="../../../s/a/e/Saeed_Jeffery_eed2.html" title="Saeed Jeffery">Saeed Jeffery</a> and upon Saeed's return to Bangladesh in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> he took over ownership of the flat above the Jeffery's grocery store, 'The First Til Last'. Ashraf's first appeared in July <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>, when he came to inform the tenants, <a href="../../../s/u/e/Sue_Osman_cb22.html" title="Sue Osman">Sue</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_Osman_7c6d.html" title="Ali Osman">Ali Osman</a>, that he was selling the flat. Ali wanted to buy it but couldn't afford it and so the flat was sold to <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_McIntyre_%28EastEnders%29_5987.html" title="Alan McIntyre (EastEnders)">Alan McIntyre</a>.<sup id="_ref-EEHandbook_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EEHandbook" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In January <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>, Ashraf employed cousins in his shop in Walford, which left him free to buy and run 'The First Til Last' in Bridge Street, which was owned by Saeed's wife <a href="../../../n/a/i/Naima_Jeffery_1460.html" title="Naima Jeffery">Naima</a> and had been run by her cousin <a href="../../../r/e/z/Rezaul_Gabir_1ab4.html" title="Rezaul Gabir">Rezaul Gabir</a> until the Karims arrival. The Karims then moved into a house in Victoria Road, which was owned by the hair dresser, <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julie_Cooper_%28EastEnders%29_6515.html" title="Julie Cooper (EastEnders)">Julie Cooper</a> and Ashraf sent his two children to private school.<sup id="_ref-EEHandbook_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EEHandbook" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Life_in_Walford" id="Life_in_Walford"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashraf_Karim_080d.html" title="Edit section: Life in Walford">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Life in Walford</span></h2>
<p>The first thing Ashraf did was hire <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Fowler_261a.html" title="Arthur Fowler">Arthur Fowler</a> to work in 'The First Til Last'. However problems arose when Arthur managed to offend one of their Asian customers by including a meat product in her delivery. Ashraf decided to punish Arthur by giving him the humiliating task of being the paper delivery boy. After much teasing from the Walford residents Arthur dumped the papers without delivering them, causing many angry complaints from irate customers. Ashraf then decided that Arthur had to write each customer a letter of apology and personally deliver them, further humilating him. Animosity between the pair only worsened and by July that year Arthur had been sacked.<sup id="_ref-first10years_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-first10years" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Karims kept themselves to themselves, and Ashraf was particularly protective of his daughter, Shireen. He became extremely concerned when she started spending a lot of time with <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricky_Butcher_eb03.html" title="Ricky Butcher">Ricky Butcher</a> and he tried to nip their blossoming relationship in the bud. However Shireen contuned to see Ricky behind his back and when her troublesome brother, Sohail, revealed the relationship, Ashraf was furious. He banned her from seeing him and banned Ricky from his shop. Ashraf then decided that the only way to stop her from fratinising with undesirable men was to marry her off to an eligible <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> suitor - much to Shireen's dismay. Muslim culture dicates that betroved women must be <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin.html" title="Virgin">virgins</a> before marrying and so in the light of her dalliance with Ricky, Ashraf decided that Shireen had to have a viginity test performed. He marched her off to <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Harold_Legg_bc12.html" title="Dr. Harold Legg">Dr. Legg</a> and demanded that he perform one, but was refused. Ashraf became incensed at Dr Legg's refusal and was even more enraged when he had the audacity to suggest that he should put aside his traditional values and embrace western ones.</p>
<p>As well as problems with his children, Ashraf was involved in a feud with the market trader <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Beale_33ff.html" title="Pete Beale">Pete Beale</a>. Ashraf was unhappy that Pete's stall was obstructing his deliveries for his shop. The two were involved in regular altercations, with Pete often resorting to racist remarks.</p>
<p>In November 1989 Sufia discovered that Ashraf was still carrying on with his mistres, Stella. Sufia decided to pack her things and threatened to leave. However Ashraf managed to talk her into staying and promised that his affair was over, which was true as Stella had grown tired of being his mistress and called time on their relationship.<sup id="_ref-EEHandbook_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EEHandbook" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ashraf then set about arranging a marriage for his daughter. Despite Shireen's misgivings she was actually pleasantly surprised when she met her suitor, Jabbar Ahmed. Jabbar was charming and enlightened and the pair became genuinely attached. Meanwhile Ashraf had managed to talk Stella into reigniting their affair and he would regularly sneak away to be with her. Sometime later, though, Jabbar's uncle spotted Ashraf with Stella, in a <a href="../../../r/e/s/Restaurant.html" title="Restaurant">restaurant</a>, and realised the Karim family were not as honourable as they seemed. The uncle cancelled the engagement and Shireen was left mystified and upset, while Sufia felt angry and betrayed at Ashraf's renewed adultery. Ashraf then decided that the only solution was to leave their shop in the hands of his cousins and move the family to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol.html" title="Bristol">Bristol</a>.<sup id="_ref-first10years_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-first10years" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Happily, before they left, Shireen's mother and the women of Jabbar's family helped the young couple to meet secretly to keep the engagement going. Whether it took place or not was never stated as the Karims left town soon after. The Karims' last appearance was in June <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>.<sup id="_ref-first10years_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-first10years" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<li>When Ashraf was first seen in 1987, he was referred to as the brother of Saeed Jeffery and was played by the actor Tony Wredden. However, this was later changed to assimilate Ashraf's history and incorporate his family. When the character returned in 1988 he was referred to as Saeed's second cousin and played by Aftab Sachak.</li>
