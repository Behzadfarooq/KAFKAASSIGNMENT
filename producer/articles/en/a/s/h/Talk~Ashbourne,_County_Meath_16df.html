<p>Does anybody know when was the English name Ashbourne put on Cill Dhéagláin? Was it a 'thank you' for the passing of the Ashbourne Land Act? Why Ashbourne? <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_Gringo_4363.html" title="User:El Gringo">El Gringo</a> 23:05, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it has somethig to do with the landlord who founded Ashbourne being called Fredrick Bourne <a href="../../../s/g/t/User%7ESgt_baker_324c.html" title="User:Sgt baker">Sgt baker</a> 18:23, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Excellent, Sgt. I never heard that before. That name allowed me to Google and I got this <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ak2/ashbourne/overview.html" class="external free" title="http://www.angelfire.com/ak2/ashbourne/overview.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.angelfire.com/ak2/ashbourne/overview.html</a> very informative history about Frederick Bourne.

<p>So you could say that our town has a 'Bourne' identity... Terrible, I know! --<a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENerroth_7535.html" title="User:Nerroth">Nerroth</a> 14:42, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bourne cos of Fred Bourne, and ash cos it was his favorite tree... He bought the townland in the early 1800 (1810 if memory serves), when he heard that a road would be built through it...so he bought the townland and then tolled the road...only thing was he had to have a toll house so he built an inn (the Ashbourne house) at the crossroads one thing lead to another.... other than that theres lots of history, such as william cromwells son (name slipt my mind for the moment) and the castle he built there....which no longer exists....Páidí ó donaghue (but thats really Curragha) 1798, the old church at the back of the town with its graveyard 500 r so yrs old includes a Dr Plunkett (brother of the Oliver Plunkett) his grave is pretty mmm ornate, skull and cross bones etc...ppl think he died of a plague r sometin... anyways plenty of history there.... someone shud do a nice summary of the history....(change the "1916 monument", to history of ashbourne....?)--83.61.164.102 16:36, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Fair play to whoever fixed up the vitriol about planning etc. in Ashbourne. I wrote a good bit of what's there now and while I'd love to launch into a rant about the lack of a Dublin Bus service in Ashbourne, I kept schtum (although it might come through a bit in the article all the same!).</p>
<p>Anyone know of other retail stores coming to Ash soon? I heard M&amp;S were looking at one of the large empty units across from Sasha, as were Penneys.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>That all depends on whether the backhanding culture carries on. You'll likey see a lot of stores you don't need, badly planned, and don't make any sense to anyone.</p>
<p>Just sit back on your couch to midweek football, shagg you wife, and pay off your morgage and die. That's the impression Thormey's gotton away with exploiting you under. Vitriol, is too clever a word for the meek. Why not just say 'bad' or barely make a grunt in reponse. As the powers that be rest easy, running a house trading racket I believe...</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I noticed that there isn't much of a description of Ashbourone's layout and its estates, though I don't spend much time here (having to commute all the time!) so could anyone help out with this part?</p>
<p>We've been in Asbourne since 1989, and I hardly recognise it anymore... --<a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENerroth_7535.html" title="User:Nerroth">Nerroth</a> 14:53, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Yeah, keep commuting.</p>

<p>Dividing the town into "estates" for descriptive purposes would need a lot more detail than four points; Ashbourne is fairly spread out and you'd be here all day trying to describe the various estates as each one is different.</p>
<p>I could give a little background about Garden City but others would need to go into similar detail about other parts of the town before you could do a whole section on it.</p>
<p>Garden City was built betwee the early to mid 70's, with a mixture of housing types from flat-roofed terraces with no driveways to traditional semi-d's and detached houses (many built by different developers on the same road) right up to Tara Lawns and Broadmeadow Green with Canadian-designed open-plan houses (balconies in the master bedroom looking out over the living room). All this was built on Ned Nulty's land, who died in the mid 90's and whose home is still in the centre of Ashbourne at the new bridge before O'Brien's off licence.</p>
<p>Crestwood wasn't included in Garden City as it was built in the early 80's but is often included with the rest these days. Garden City's shops were built just after the surrounding houses but weren't occupied for a number of years (the only shop was O'Sullivan's, across from the church). Victory Value opened a supermarket in the early 80's which then became a Centra, then a SuperValu and then back to a Centra. It remained the only group of shops in Ashbourne separate from the centre of town until Daybreak opened at John's Wood in 2005.</p>
