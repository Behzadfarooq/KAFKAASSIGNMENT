<p>He is not "dear to me," he is just an object of study. In any event, at the top of each page is a button which says "discussion." On the J. Robert Oppenheimer page, this leads to <a href="../../../r/o/b/Talk%7ERobert_Oppenheimer_1020.html" title="Talk:Robert Oppenheimer">Talk:Robert Oppenheimer</a>, which is what I meant by "talk." At the bottom of the page you'll see why I had problems with it. It's more that I don't find the anecdotes enlightening than I think that they are factually incorrect. But I'm willing to talk about it. My goal with the Robert Oppenheimer page is to make it better than most of the dull biographies of him on the internet which have all of his ex-students silly little stories about him in them. In short, I also find the speculation about his lack of a Nobel Prize to be somewhat worthless. And I additionally think the characterization of him as the "Hamlet of physics" is as wrong as it is inappropriate. But anyway, let us talk about it at <a href="../../../r/o/b/Talk%7ERobert_Oppenheimer_1020.html" title="Talk:Robert Oppenheimer">Talk:Robert Oppenheimer</a>, perhaps we can come to an agreement if you want to make a case for these additions!&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 19:02, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, do me a favor first and do not lecture me on what Wikipedia is <i>about</i>. I've been on here longer than you, and this is not an issue of "freedom of speech" (which does not exist on Wikipedia, by the way. You might want to read up on the policies of <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">Wikipedia:NPOV</a>. Wikipedia is a private enterprise and has the right to set its own content standards, which it does). Just a tip.</li>
<li>Wikipedia has a policy of neutral point of view. This is obviously a bit slippery but the point is the represent things in as "unbiased" a form as possible. I do not think that saying "there is no such thing as unbiased" is really getting at the spirit of this. Objectivity is, in general, more of a moral goal than it is a true thing, but that hardly makes the goal less worthy. Please take a minute to look up the entry on <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_peacock_terms_1e8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid peacock terms">Wikipedia:Avoid peacock terms</a>. These are terms which are overly flowery and lauditory. If someone is worth being called wonderful names, it should be obvious to the reader when they are reading their article. An encyclopedia does not need to say such things, it does not need to take an opinion on their worth.</li>
<li>The problem I have with the anecdotes is that different stories have different versions. I know of Bernstein's account, and of many, many other accounts, all of which differ in many ways. Unless they truly illustrate something interesting about the subject though, I don't have a lot of patience for them. The incident about Phillips in the hills is told in a variety of ways by different people involved. As I said on the Talk page, to tell it properly would take more space than it warrants as an anecdote, in my opinion. Saying, "people like anecdotes" doesn't really do much for me. There are enough anecdotes on any prominent figure to fill a book. The question is <i>which</i> ones ought to be included in a <i>brief</i> encyclopedia article. It is a question of <i>selection</i>, not censorship. If you think this particular anecdote reveals something in particular, then by all means, feel free to argue as such. Here is another tip: the ideal encyclopedia entry ought to read like a story. What aspects do you want to include in a story? Should you include every single anecdote and coincidence about your main character? Every element of the story should serve a purpose, there should be nothing in there just "to be there." In thinking about it in these terms, I don't really feel the anecdote does much good. But I'm willing to hear good arguments though, but "people like anecdotes" is not a good argument. People like sex scandals too but I don't think that necessarily means every taudry rumor should be included.</li>
<li>On the Nobel Prize: I find the speculation to be a bit dull but if you want to find a <i>brief</i> way to put it in these please try. In general the only people who have speculated much on such a thing are physicist friends of JRO's who wonder why Oppenheimer has no Nobel when all of his colleagues did. The verdict by all historians I have seen speak on this is that it is because he didn't do anything of Nobel quality. Which would itself not be surprising -- the vast majority of scientists, brilliant or not, do not win Nobel prizes -- except that so many of his associates had them. His primary scientific accomplishment, besides a few equations which bear his name, is in founding the American school of theoretical physics. Which is mentioned prominently in the article.</li>
<li>Being nominated for a Nobel Prize means that somebody who was consulted liked you or your work. Hundreds of people are nominated. Few win. That does not mean much, scientifically speaking, and the reasons for nominating particular people are often very idiosyncratic. To my knowledge Oppenheimer was never a serious contender.</li>
<li>Oppenheimer's interest in Hinduism was never deep and he was never a Hindu. The Hajiya article points this out well. I think that Hajiya goes a bit too far in reading all of Oppenheimer's life as being a set of Gita inspired decisions. He had little to no reservations about participating in the Manhattan Project, it was only after the bombs were used on Japan that he ever expressed any serious reservations. It is much easier to read him as being in it for the power and "glory" than anything else, but that's just my interpretation. And it is not in the encyclopedia entry on him, accordingly.</li>
<li>I do not think you have a very good sense of Oppenheimer's personality but that's neither here nor there. I haven't inserted the "sat on his head" into the article because it is obviously an interpretation (though admittedly, not mine: it was voiced by a number of scholars at a recent conference on Oppenheimer held this year which I helped to organize).</li>
<li>The Hamlet reference is nonsense. Have you read Hamlet? There is practically no basis for comparison. Oppenheimer was tortured by his actions a bit after the fact, but he never said that he regretted them. Ethically he was an incredibly inconsistent character in general. Sam Schweber's biography of him and Bethe shows this fairly well, as does Herken's book. He consistently ratted out friends and colleagues to save his own skin, he consistently intimated to create weapons and then later pretended that he was opposed to them. He opposed the H-bomb when it was technically infeasible, but after Ulam made his discovery then he supported created it. His trial transcript is a long list of him naming names and admitting he had lied to many people many times. You don't have to believe me, read it yourself. His life had little inevitability -- he made decisions and a lot of them bit him in the end. Additionally, Hamlet was not a Greek tragedy. He is only a "Hamlet of the atomic age" to people who want him to be a martyr. It is not a position which he holds very well if you know very much about him at all. If he had not lost his security clearance (which was set to expire in a few days anyway), he would be remembered as a traitor to his fellow physicists.</li>
<li>Don't tell me what I can "take out of a post." Wikipedia is a community of editors, and I am as allowed to make editorial decisions as anyone else. If you don't know how Wikipedia works, and it does not sound like you do, please take the time to read up on it before making further edits. I do not actually have an axe to grind -- you will notice that none of my opinions and interpretations above are reflected in the Oppenheimer article, because they are not appropriate for an encyclopedia entry, obviously -- in respects to Oppenheimer, but I know quite a lot about him and I would like the Wikipedia entry to be a bit better than the standard History Channel version which only can read him (and everything else) in terms of good and evil Cold War oppositions. He was a complicated character, and I am trying to reflect that accurately.</li>
<li>If you reinsert the text into the article, I will try to find time to edit the parts of it worth keeping into worthwhile contributions. I reverted them originally because you had an IP address almost identical to someone who was inserting a lot of similar bollucks into the Enrico Fermi article. If you are not the same person, I apologize for that.</li>
<li>I don't want to discourage you from Wikipedia. My goal is only to have quality articles, that's all. I'm sure you share it, in a way. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 21:14, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi, I'm going on vacation for a little while, I'll take a look at it when I get back. I do not have any real problems with the text you have recently inserted, though. I might edit it a small bit but for the most part it satisfies my little rule-book (every element contributes something to your overall understanding of the article, without too much fluff). Thanks. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 04:03, 21 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshujo_38da.html" title="Edit section: Druid?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Druid?</span></h2>
<p>I'm not sure what your native culture is but "Druid" is generally not taken as a terribly positive term in the USA (I practice no dark arts, thank you very much). I also resent the assumption that I have more time to spend on an article than you do. I spend 95% of my waking hours working; occasionally I play around with Wikipedia when I need to clear my mind out a bit. You have no idea about my schedule or workload. You know nothing about what I do. Please don't make ignorant presumptions.</p>
<p>If you're going to insist that I change a heading of yours from "gripes" (and they <i>were</i> gripes -- you were complaining about things I didn't even do), I'm going to politely ask you to reconsider whether or not a six paragraph essay on your user page about a disagreement we had is really the most harmonious to your goal of collaboration without friction. It's just something to think about.</p>
<p>As a final point: most of my disagreements with your edits are factual in nature, and the others are usually matters of encyclopedic style. And as you've probably seen, I'm not actually adament in having things "my way" -- you've actually been more adament on a number of points, even when facing disagreement from a number of users over your stylistic decisions. But anyway, I digress. I'm still waiting for you to turn the <a href="../../../e/n/r/Enrico_Fermi_bd69.html" title="Enrico Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a> article into something worth reading. As far as I can tell you haven't added anything to it of substance since you agreed to my little suggestion that if you want to show your admiration of Fermi, it'd be better served by giving him a good article than it would trying to hunt down every quote of admiration anyone ever said of him. Just something I'd noticed. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 00:33, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>You seem to have misunderstood me again. My point is that I find the little "story" on your user page to be somewhat offensive, purposeful or not (the name is just part of the chosen problem). For someone who complained about the word "gripes", I find it somewhat surprising that you are willing to be so disharmonious. But anyway, it is your choice. But it is certainly not going to make disagreements between us any smoother, as it certainly predisposes me to thinking that you are attempting to be disrespectful. As for the "work", you have written on your page: "Druid is someone who is getting an entire PhD. in the history of science, and so obviously he has a lot more time and patience to spare on the article than I have, even though I too am deeply interested in the subject and have read about it for a verylong time." Which certainly sounds like an implication that I have a lot of free time. I do not have more free time, but I do happen to know quite a bit about what I write about. I generally do not have to do new research in order to contribute to the articles which I work on. Perhaps you ought to clarify what you mean by that a bit better. I am not sure if English is your first language or not but your current use of it has many negative connotations. If those are not what you are trying to give off, you might consider editing it a bit. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 17:20, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I didn't understand the message you left on my page. I'm aware that Teller was involved in the early analysis of Monte Carlo methods, but I've never seen him listed as an originator of it (it is usually Ulam, Metropolis, and Von Neumann, sometimes with reference to Fermi). I'm happy to say he helped develop analysis of the approach if that's what he did. I only came across this because I recently wrote a paper which involved the early history of pseudorandom number generators, so I ended up reading a bit of the early Monte Carlo literature. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 01:40, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
