<p>I've tried reading up on <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a>, but fail to understand exactly how to report the vandalism of User:81.228.180.110.

<dl>
<dd>I've removed the "She hates Celery" sentence. It was added by the same person who added some other defacement. I've not been able to find any source that claims Her birth year is verifiable by going to http:// . tisdale.com/interviews/herald/Miami_Herald.jpg and looking at the talk and contrib pages for details. You might consider reverting their edits to this talk page, etc. <a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlimpguy_3410.html" title="User:Blimpguy">Blimpguy</a> 01:37, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This concerns the issues regarding her birth location. Her <a href="http://ashleytisdale.com/interviews/herald/Miami_Herald.jpg" class="external text" title="http://ashleytisdale.com/interviews/herald/Miami_Herald.jpg" rel="nofollow">official site</a> seems to verify that she was born in Monmouth County, New Jersey. The very fact she posted that news article on her site seemingly verifies it. However, as someone cited the <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/entertainment/movies/14646285.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/entertainment/movies/14646285.htm" rel="nofollow">Mercury News</a> as a source for the West Deal birth location (which although is in Monmouth County, doesn't necessarily prove she was born in that city, if a city at all.), it doesn't necessarily prove it. That's the only url. I contacted the author of that article, and received a reply stating that it was verified with IMDB.com and other sources. I am awaiting to find out which other sources if the person replies at all again. IMDB.com isn't reliable as I've found out in the past. --Doomstars</p>
<dl>
<dd>I added the reference and I will note that the IMDB isn't reliable for anything at all and shouldn't be used as a source, so if a writer cited that as a source that's not good news. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 07:53, 10 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The author from the Mercury News said he used "found the information on IMDB.com" and then "verified it with other sources". Like I said, I'm waiting to see if he will tell me the other sources. The issue I have is how the West Deal thing got put on IMDB.com. Unlike Wikipedia, IMDB.com doesn't PUBLICALLY list the sources of the information that are used in conjunction of submitting the information. Secondly, since Ashley Tisdale's official website had a screenshot (or whatever the appropriate word is to use) of a newspaper/magazine article listing "Monmouth County" as her birth location, that is what it should go by until we find something on her official site stating West Deal. (I find it unlikely for her official site to ever intentionally post inaccurate information, lest it be an embarrassment to the web author.)--Doomstars 09:35, 10 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>They don't publically list the sources because a lot of the time there are none.&#160;:) Anyway, in agreement with you I'll remove the birth place until the author responds with the other sources. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 16:32, 10 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I received a reply about the other source. The author mentioned that High School Musical's PR (public relations?) was contacted, so that's a good enough source to change the information to West Deal.--Doomstars 00:23, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article currently says: <i>Ashley wanted the part of either Maddie or London because she wanted to work with Brenda Song and Dylan and Cole, the Sprouse twins.</i> How could she have known she was going to work with Brenda Song, who plays London, if the role of London hadn't been cast yet? --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 06:20, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>See <a href="../../../u/p/l/Wikipedia%7EUploading_images_aa69.html" title="Wikipedia:Uploading images">Wikipedia:Uploading images</a>. Keep in mind, if you did not create the image, the image must be <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">fair use</a>. You must also know who the copyright holder is and where the image came from, as well as cite that information on the image page. You must provide a reasonable, accurate, and detailed fair use rationale for each intended use of the image on Wiki. If you don't do this, you'll quickly find the image deleted.

<p>Hi, I originaly replaced an image that was unsourced with a new promotional photo. Since doing that, it appears that it has been changed to a different image, also with no source information (Thought it appears to be promotional). If the image is tagged properly by the uploader, I'm fine with leaving it in the article, but I don't think it displays Ashley as best we could. The current image on (top right) is a werid view, while the one I added a few days ago is straight on, and is a good picture of her entire face. I'm bringing this to the talk page as to not start an edit war&#160;:P What picture do you guys feel should be used? --<b><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#666666">light</font></a><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#000000">darkness</font></a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELightdarkness_7a78.html" title="User talk:Lightdarkness">talk</a>)</sup> 03:39, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Two of her unreleased album tracks, "Good to Me" and "He Said, She Said" were recently in rotation on "promosquad.com". Should this be included in the article? I don't want to take up any more space than there already is.</p>
<p>Also, the part about her career is extremely messy, with all the superscripted notes and long sentences. I'll split parts of it into paragraphs to make for easier reading.

<dd>Hmm... reading your changes, I think you've gone too far with splitting it out. Now all the paragraphs are one to two sentences, making it feel very fragmented.

<p>Really, that's not uncommon. Not my preference, but that's because often if they want an adolescent boy playing a high-school freshman, for example, they are likely to cast a 16-year old (in that case, to prevent the likely of the actor's voice possibly cracking in the middle of a scene).</p>

<p>I added a trivia sectuion a while back but someone rmoved it citing "reverted" i saw an interview of her on Conan O'Brian where she mentioned that her family made her work as a teenager, not uncommon in Jewish families where work-ethic tends to be somthing that is culturally nurtured. She stated that she has worked as a salesperson at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Hollister, and Wet Seal. She said she chose those places becuase to liked to work at the places she liked to buy clothes at, at whatever given time so as to receive the discount. When O'Brian asked that if her family wanted her to work to "learn the value of the dollar," she agreed. It was also mentioned that she is the niece of <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Popeil_24b3.html" title="Ron Popeil">Ron Popeil</a>, somthing that is mentioned on his article. Popeil is famous for selling gadgets though infomertials, in the interview she stated that she owned every single of her uncle's inventions, however she did not know if they worked because she has never used any of them. In the same interview O'Brian asked her about turning 21 and she said she spent it at home with family and that she has never dranken. The interview was only a few months ago, so she is definatly 21. I am going to readd this information, it would be helpful if anyone knows how to get a transcript of that show to set this all in stone.<a href="../../../q/r/c/User%7EQrc2006_905d.html" title="User:Qrc2006">Qrc2006</a> 21:39, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>funny fact: Ashley Tisdale shares her birthday with another child star/disney star- the star is Lindsay Lohan, also born July 2- but Ashley Tisdale is older than her by one year as Ashley was born in 1985 as Lohan on the other hand, was born in 1986.</p>
