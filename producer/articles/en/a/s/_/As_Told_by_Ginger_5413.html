<p><i><b>As Told By Ginger</b></i> is an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animated_series.html" title="Animated series">animated series</a> that appeared on <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nickelodeon.html" title="Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a> in October 2000. The show focuses on Ginger Foutley and her adventures at Lucky Jr. High, as she records them in her diary. The series was noted for its storylines, character development, and the fact that the characters change outfits each time a new day comes.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, about half the episodes of the third and final season remain unaired. Also, a hand full of episodes that were once available through reruns have been taken out of the rotation. <i>As Told By Ginger</i> can be seen currently on Nicktoons Network weekdays at 12:30 pm (Eastern). This came as a disappointment to fans during its inital run.</p>

<p>The show's only <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> airings on the main Nickelodeon channel in the US were on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_2.html" title="January 2">January 2</a> with "Blizzard Conditions" (the only non-holiday airing in 2005), <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_27.html" title="March 27">March 27</a> with "The Easter Ham" (it was <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter_Sunday_e163.html" title="Easter Sunday">Easter Sunday</a>), <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_8.html" title="May 8">May 8</a> with "Mommie Nearest" (shown as part of a <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother%27s_Day_d171.html" title="Mother's Day">Mother's Day</a> marathon), <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_30.html" title="October 30">October 30</a> with "I Spy A Witch" (a <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween.html" title="Halloween">Halloween</a> special), and <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_25.html" title="December 25">December 25</a> with "An Even Steven Holiday Special" (it was <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_Day_0d60.html" title="Christmas Day">Christmas Day</a>). At this point, "Heat Lightning" was the last episode to have premiered on Nick US, on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_27.html" title="June 27">June 27</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>. Seven episodes (plus one telefilm, see below) remain unaired on Nick. ("Ten Chairs", the show's <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thanksgiving_%28United_States%29_7e49.html" title="Thanksgiving (United States)">Thanksgiving</a> episode, was aired on the digital <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicktoons_Network_f48f.html" title="Nicktoons Network">Nicktoons Network</a> on Thanksgiving 2004, however.) However, Nickelodeon gave the show a regular slot, at 6:30 a.m. weekdays, in late 2005, starting with <i>Fast Reputation</i>. By March 2006, Nickelodeon began repeating episdes.Those airings were in turn pushed to 6:00 am on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays after a few months, but starting <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_29.html" title="May 29">May 29</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dora_the_Explorer_4d2f.html" title="Dora the Explorer">Dora the Explorer</a> took its place. The show had a regular slot on at 5:30 p.m. on Sundays during this time, but again the show was replaced by TeenNick shows. Nickelodeon, however, would still air holiday-themed episodes during the appropriate season and aired <i>An 'Even Steven' Holiday Special</i> on Christmas Day in 2006.</p>
<p>Starting on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_13.html" title="November 13">November 13</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, Nicktoons Network began showing the show every weekday morning at 7:30 a.m. ET. The first episode to air was <i>About Face</i>. Nicktoons originally planned to air the remaining episodes on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_17.html" title="November 17">November 17</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_20.html" title="November 20">November 20</a>-<a href="../../../n/o/v/November_23.html" title="November 23">November 23</a> but were replaced at the last minute (but they did air one, <i>Stuff'll Kill Ya</i>). On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_3.html" title="January 3">January 3</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>, episodes began repeating, starting with <i>Stuff'll Kill Ya</i>. Since this episode remained in the rotation, it proved that Nicktoons had no problem with the high school episodes, but the others still have yet to air. Some episodes of the series (<i>Cry Wolf</i>, <i>The Right Stuff</i>, <i>Piece of My Heart</i>, <i>Gym Class Confidential</i>, <i>Fast Reputation</i>, <i>Losing Nana Bishop</i>, and <i>Next Question</i>) that has been shown on Nicktoons and Nickelodeon before had been taken out of the rotation. This may be due to the fact that they all deal with mature themes (such as death, puberty, and high school parties). By April, these episodes gradually started to air again. Starting on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_5.html" title="March 5">March 5</a> of 2007, the show moved to a new timeslot on Nicktoons: 12:30 p.m. eastern. Nickelodeon soon began airing early episodes of the show at 6:00 a.m. on Saturdays starting on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_7.html" title="April 7">April 7</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/_/As_Told_by_Ginger_5413.html" title="Edit section: Character development and continuity">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Character development and continuity</span></h2>
<p><i>As Told By Ginger</i> has been recognized by fans and Nickelodeon alike for its character development, most of which is unusual for a cartoon.</p>
<p>In the first season, Ginger's age group is hinted as being in seventh grade. By the second season, they move up to eighth grade rather than remaining the same age. They graduate Jr. high in the third season and move on to becoming freshman in high school. Carl's age group works in a similar way, as they become Jr. high students by the third season. Also in the second season, Darren had his unwieldy <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodontia.html" title="Orthodontia">orthodontia</a> that he had been wearing for the entire first season removed, which resulted in rising popularity. Also, many episodes (mostly seasons two-three, although season one did this too) have references to previous episodes, giving the episodes a definite order.</p>
<p>One of the more noticeable development is the fact that the characters change clothes each time a new day comes. Many cartoons have their characters remain in the same outfits to save time and money. The girls in Ginger's age group (Dodie, Courtney, Macie, Miranda, and herself) were at first the only ones to do this. But after Darren got his orthodontia removed, he changed clothes as well. Carl's age group only changes clothes so often, most of the time with little changes. Hoodsey's coat rack has identical purple hooded-sweatshirts, mocking cartoons that always remain in the same outfits. Also, while live-action show characters only wear an outfit once, <i>As Told By Ginger</i> characters wear their outfits in rotation, and new outfits are added every few episodes.</p>
<p>The show also deals with many deep themes. In <i>Wicked Game</i>, Ginger's two best friends betray her after feeling jealousy toward her new boyfriend, Darren. In <i>And She Was Gone</i>, the staff and students at school think Ginger is depressed after she writes a disturbing poem. Also in that episode, Carl's pranks cause his teacher to retire. After she agrees to come back, Mrs. Gordon passes on. In actuality, the voice actress, <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathleen_Freeman_1b69.html" title="Kathleen Freeman">Kathleen Freeman</a> died and the episode was dedicated to her. <i>A Lesson in Tightropes</i> has Ginger going through an emotional break-up with Darren while, at the same time, having to get surgery for her acute <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appendix.html" title="Appendix">appendix</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Originally the theme song was sung by Melissa Disney, the voice of Ginger. She was soon replaced by voice artist/singer <a href="../../../c/r/e/Cree_Summer_13ad.html" title="Cree Summer">Cree Summer</a>, who also does the voice of character Miranda Killgallen for the show. She was later replaced by R &amp; B Artist <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macy_Gray_4c76.html" title="Macy Gray">Macy Gray</a>.
<ul>
<li>In the US, the Melissa Disney version of the theme was never used; the first several episodes had the Summer version. Later, when the Gray version became available, Nick used it in <b>all</b> episodes, including those that had the Summer version previously. Overseas and Canadian airings featured all three versions regularly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The three schools in the series are Lucky Elementary, Lucky Jr. High, and Lucky High. They all share Lucky Auditorium. All four buildings are located next to one another. It's not clear whether these are the only schools in the district. However, the fact that Lucky High is much bigger than the other two suggests that it has more than one 'feeder'-school. Also there are a lot of new faces when Ginger starts high school (see "Stuff'll Kill Ya").</li>
<li>The Foutley family, along with Dodie and Macie's families, live in Sheltered Shrubs. Courtney lives in the gated community of Protected Pines. Ginger's father, Jonas, lives in a town close nearby called Brittle Branches. The towns are fictional, but are set in the state of Connecticut. Sasha, Ginger's crush from <i>Summer of Camp Caprice</i> lives in a town called Heathered Hills, approximately 120 miles away.
<ul>
<li>It was originally stated (not on the show) that Courtney lived in Secluded Shrubs.</li>
<li>It is rather unusual for a cartoon to be situated in a particular US state.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In 2005, Cooltoons released their annual April Fool's newletter stating that a live-action <i>As Told By Ginger</i> movie was in the works. It said that it would star <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Hilton_9740.html" title="Paris Hilton">Paris Hilton</a> as Courtney. But, being the April Fool's edition, this story was fake.</li>
<li>Since Ginger's Junior High School graduation, as according to the <i>No Turning Back</i> movie and the time of cancellation, occurred in 2004, this would make Ginger and the older kids a part of the High School Class of 2008.</li>
<li>It was rumored on the internet that Nickelodeon was going to air all the remaining episodes plus some unseen episodes of <i><a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Grown_Up_199f.html" title="All Grown Up">All Grown Up</a></i> on <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Years_Day_0b64.html" title="New Years Day">New Years Day</a> in 2006. By mid-December 2005 when no word was announced officially by Nickelodeon, all rumors faded.</li>
<li>It is one of few cartoons to have different attires almost every episode.</li>
<li>The character of Miranda was originally white. The creators thought that one black character (Darren) was enough, but they changed that when Cree Summer got the role of Miranda.</li>
<li>This show contains another example of an extremely wealthy girl (Courtney) who seems to attend a public school for reasons not revealed (another example is Rhonda from the show Hey Arnold). Courtney's brother, Blake, also attends a public school.</li>
<li>Hoodsey has also been referred to as Robert or Robert Joseph (his first and middle names), most of the time by his mother. Dodie, his sister, is often called Deirdre Hortense by her mother.</li>
<li>In the first episodes Courtney is calling Dodie "Potie" and Macie "Stacey" or "Kacie", this disappears as she gets to know them better. Miranda usually refers to them by their last names, Bishop and Lightfoot, respectively. Early on, Blake also refers to Hoodsey as "Woodsey".</li>
<li>Mipsy started becoming a more featured role in the second season and had a big impact in early season three episodes.</li>
<li>Dodie and Hoodsey's mother attended Lucky Jr. High back in her day, meaning she's lived in Sheltered Shrubs her whole life. Their father implies he attended the school as well.</li>
<li>The girls in Courtney's inner circle (not all at once) have included Courtney, Miranda, Mispy, Missy, Mindy, Traci, Stacey, Kacie, Donna, Diva, Dinah, Heather, Lonnie, and Hope.</li>
<li>Emily Kapnek, the creator, based the character of Ms. Zorski off of one of her own teachers. Kapnek also provided the voice of Carl's girlfriend, Noelle Sussman.</li>
<li>Macie's parents are named Bobby and Bobbie, and they are Ph.D's.</li>
<li>Ginger considers herself one-fourth <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a>.</li>
<li>The older lady with whom Carl loves is similar to that of Harold's - from the movie - <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_and_Maude_ec2b.html" title="Harold and Maude">Harold and Maude</a>.</li>
<li>This was the first cartoon series to depict an interracial relationship.</li>
<li>The pilot episode, entitled <i>The Party</i>, had a similar plot to the first episode, <i>Ginger the Juvey</i>. In the pilot, Ginger is invited to her first Courtney party, but is worried about making a good impression. In <i>Ginger the Juvey</i>, Ginger is invited to her first Courtney party, and is worried about what to get her as a gift. Obviously, the pilot's plot was further developed to make the first episode.</li>
<li>The pilot also featured different looks for the characters.</li>
<li>The episodes <i>I Spy a Witch</i>, <i>Deja Who?</i>, <i>An "Even Steven" Holiday Special</i>, and <i>Piece of My Heart</i> were all made for the first season line-up, but aired during the second season.</li>
<li><i>Piece of My Heart</i> was dedicated to <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewis_Arquette_e394.html" title="Lewis Arquette">Lewis Arquette</a>, who died on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_10.html" title="February 10">February 10</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>.</li>
<li><i>Never Can Say Goodbye</i>, <i>Gym Class Confidential</i>, <i>Fast Reputation</i>, and <i>The Nurses' Strike</i> all aired in the same week during the TeenNick block. They aired <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_11.html" title="February 11">February 11</a>-<a href="../../../f/e/b/February_14.html" title="February 14">February 14</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> (which were the days between Monday and Thursday.)</li>
<li>The episode <i>No Hope For Courtney</i> was dedicated to <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathleen_Freeman_1b69.html" title="Kathleen Freeman">Kathleen Freeman</a>, voice of Mrs. Gordon, who died on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_23.html" title="August 23">August 23</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>. As a result of this, Mrs. Gordon was killed off the show.</li>
<li>In the TV movie, <i>Far From Home</i>, Mipsy claims to have a Bat Mitzvah bank account. But in <i>Family Therapy</i>, when Mipsy turns 13, she has a party rather than a <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bat_Mitzvah_f68c.html" title="Bat Mitzvah">Bat Mitzvah</a>. Note that this may have to do with the broken continuity in the second season: it is never clear whether the girls are in seventh or eighth grade but when Chet Zipper announces their birthdays, he says they're turning "the big one-three".</li>
<li>The episode <i>Never Can Say Goodbye</i> ended with a song called <i>Wrong</i>, sung by voice actor <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenny_Blank_acc0.html" title="Kenny Blank">Kenny Blank</a> as Darren Patterson. This was one of the few times that the show ended with something other than the instrumental of the theme song. The song refers to a boy rethinking his relationship with a past girlfriend. It was then theorized and later proven that this song was about Darren's feelings for Ginger, In the episode <i>Dare I, Darren?</i>, Darren told Ginger he thought of her as a sister and not as a possible girlfriend.
<ul>
<li>More episodes have followed this pattern. The episode <i>And She Was Gone</i> ended with a musical version of Ginger's poem during the end credits. The episode <i>Come Back Little Seal Girl</i> featured the songs <b>Courtney's World</b> and <b>The Little Seal Girl</b> blended together. In <i>About Face</i>, the episode ends with a song called <b>Diamonds Are Expensive</b>, presumably sung by the engaged Lois and Dr. Dave. <i>Next Question</i> ended in <b>The Teen Seal Girl</b> song. <i>And She Was Gone</i> did not end a song at all.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the episode <i>Wicked Game</i>, Ginger never patches things up with Dodie and Macie. But in the next episode, entitled <i>The Easter Ham</i>, the three are friends again. However Courtney does refer to Dodie's betrayal.</li>
<li>The episodes <i>Detention</i>, <i>Kiss Today Good-bye</i>, <i>A Lesson In Tightropes</i>, <i>Dodie's Big Break</i>, and <i>Battle of the Bands</i> are all high school episodes that have yet to air in the United States. They were originally scheduled to air during the second week of <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_2006.html" title="November 2006">November 2006</a>. But they were immediately removed from the schedule after the first high school episode, <i>Stuff'll Kill Ya</i> was aired. In most other countries they are part of the common re-runs.</li>
<li>In the TV movie <i>The Wedding Frame</i>, when the Foutley's are driving to their soon-to-be home, they pass a cemetery park. One tombstone reads "ATBG" while the other reads "RIP". ATBG is short for As Told By Ginger and RIP is short for Rest In Peace. This is a nodd to the fact that this movie is the series finale.</li>
<li><i>Ginger's Solo</i> and <i>Sleep On It</i> have aired in the past, but Nickelodeon stopped showing during reruns. Nicktoons Network has yet to show them. Some believe that Nickelodeon considers them inappropriate. Hoodsey urinates on Courtney's carpet in <i>Sleep On It</i>, which Nick could see as being inappropriate. Why they may consider <i>Ginger's Solo</i> inappropriate is still unknown.</li>
<li><i>Piece of My Heart</i> aired in the month of December, but since then has been known as a Valentine's Day special.</li>
<li>The series finale takes place many years in the future, some details include, Ginger and Darren are married and have a child, Dodie and Chet Zipper are married and have a daughter, Lois and Dr. Dave are still together, Ginger has become a somewhat successful writer, and <a href="../../../c/o/u/Courtney_Gripling_955b.html" title="Courtney Gripling">Courtney Gripling</a>'s family ending up with the arrest of Prescott Gripling, Courtney's father, because of <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insider_trading.html" title="Insider trading">insider trading</a>. The book cover reads <i>As Told By Gingers: A Collection of Short Stories by Ginger Foutley</i> and features a picture of the pilot episode model of Ginger.
<ul>
<li>Nickelodeon originally asked the creators to change the ending to something less conclusive in case they decided to renew the show for another season. These chances were highly unlikely, so the ending stayed.</li>
