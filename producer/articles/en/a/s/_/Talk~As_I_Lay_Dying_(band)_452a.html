<p>Mallcore...</p>
<p>Interesting you should say that. Because it could very well be true. Oh well. I only know three songs so it don't matter to me what classification. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearAwayTheFunerealDress_03d9.html" title="User:TearAwayTheFunerealDress">TearAwayTheFunerealDress</a> 15:30, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I really disagree with the usage of the term "mallcore" in Wiki articles. It seems to me that it inherently breaks NPOV guidelines, so should be left out of band entries, regardless of the author's opinion. City 07:23, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Changed the musical genre of their albums to Metalcore, since Metal-Archives has recognised it as such, and the the christianity is not really apparent in their songs --<a href="../../../s/e/p/User%7ESePPach_812f.html" title="User:SePPach">SePPach</a> 21:08, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I notice someone has added numerous more members to the former members page. I have read before that they have had numerous guitar players, but nothing about another drummer. Who is this Anthony L. Watson or whatever? On the band website Tim claims that he and Jordan formed the band. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrowlnotscream_fb8a.html" title="User:Growlnotscream">User:Growlnotscream</a> 7:21, March 30, 2006</p>
<p>Before I edit it, I just want to establish that the band did get their name from the book titled "As I Lay Dying," but, there is no correlation between the book and the band's lyrics. Tim has said in many interviews that the band did indeed get their name from the book. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrowlnotscream_fb8a.html" title="User:Growlnotscream">User:Growlnotscream</a> 11:00 April 12 2006</p>
<p>I just noticed a change to the genre that wasn't mentioned here in the discussion page. Someone added "Swedish Metal" influence. Not sure about that... -- <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrowlnotscream_fb8a.html" title="User:Growlnotscream">User:Growlnotscream</a> 9:55 April 28 2006</p>

<p>they do indeed have "Melodic Death Metal" influences as do many metalcore bands but swedish metal is not a term, Melodic Death Metal is not exclusively swedish,(I am from sweden myself) nor is that it's real name. I am changing it to simply Metalcore as enough metalcore bands feature Melodic Death Metal influences for a reader to be able to assume this. Also I don't agree on calling them a christian metal band. They are christian, they are a metal band and the lyrics are perhaps christian but that's not an actual genre. they are no different than other metalcore bands simply because their lyrics are about christian things.</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Metal_35a0.html" title="Christian Metal">Christian Metal</a> is definitely a genre, and their lyrics definitely have to do with it (read The Darkest Nights or Forever). <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheunknown42_8bac.html" title="User:Theunknown42">Theunknown42</a> 14:45, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Metal_35a0.html" title="Christian Metal">Christian Metal</a> certainly is a legit subgenre, and it is an important enough classification for the band to mention many times in interviews and such that their faith is their motivating force behind why they do what they do. Also, lyrics are up for interpretation, so it isn't really up to you to decide whether the songs are about Christianity or not, frankly, and Tim Lambesis has been quoted as saying that that is in fact what the songs are about. So, I believe there is enough reason to classify them as a "Christian" metalcore band. City 07:41, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Forever" is a love song. Bad example. Yes some of their lyrics are Christian, but honestly I'd say maybe under half. A lot of them are about personal relationships. - <a href="../../../r/a/z/User%7ERazorhead_4e38.html" title="User:Razorhead">Razorhead</a> 10:52 AM, 3 August 2006</p>
<p>The band has said in interviews and on their FAQ that their lyrics are not intended to be Christian, but could certainly be interpreted as so. Also, the re-release was released in June, not May. Haha. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrowlnotscream_fb8a.html" title="User:Growlnotscream">User:growlnotscream</a> June 21, 2006 9:50 AM</p>
<p>There I changed it to just metalcore. It's probably best to leave it as that since no one can agree on anything else (I changed it to metalcore and melodic death metal at one point). - <a href="../../../r/a/z/User%7ERazorhead_4e38.html" title="User:Razorhead">Razorhead</a> 10:55 AM, 3 August 2006</p>
<p>Taken from the FAQ page on AILD's website which was written by Tim Lambesis, "I'm not sure what the difference is between five Christians playing in a band and a Christian band. If you truly believe something, then it should affect every area of your life." Don't say they don't want to be labled as a Christian band! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by N7ghtwolf (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_N7ghtwolf_bc4f.html" title="Special:Contributions/N7ghtwolf">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>AILD is simply metalcore. They are not "Swedecore" or considered Chiristian metal. AILD's lyrics are not Christian based. If you read the lyrics, they are singing about every day life and the struggles we go through. Just because Tim is Christian, does not mean the band is Christian metal. Everyone can agree on metalcore, so leave it at that. Bushy33 05:06, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As someone already pointed out, their <a href="http://www.asilaydying.com/band_faq.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.asilaydying.com/band_faq.htm" rel="nofollow">own FAQ</a> states that <i>every member</i> of the band is Christian, that all of their songs are written from the perspective of a Christian, and that the goal of the band is to "intelligently represent a faith that has been very misrepresented in the entertainment industry." And again, like quoted above, it states, "I'm not sure what the difference is between five Christians playing in a band and a Christian band. If you truly believe something, then it should affect every area of your life." <a href="../../../j/p/e/User%7EJpers36_e079.html" title="User:Jpers36">Jpers36</a> 07:02, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, I was just wondering, but why doesn't anyone add "Beneath The Encasing Of Ashes" to the discograpy list? I mean, it <i>was</i> an offical CD release, even though it was re-released, right? OmniAngel 23:00, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes he has actually he left the band because he wanted to spend more time with his wife. pick up the issue of revolver magizine with as i lay dying in it</p>
