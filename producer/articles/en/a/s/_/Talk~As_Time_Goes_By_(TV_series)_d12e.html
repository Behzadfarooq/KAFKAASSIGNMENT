<p>I didn't want to preemptively disambiguate ATGB (since the song isn't even mentioned on the Casablanca page let alone Wiki'd), but now I will since it's already been brought up. <a href="../../../m/r/w/User%7EMrwojo_bb68.html" title="User:Mrwojo">Mrwojo</a> 17:38 Sep 27, 2002 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see your point, but I did what I did because I think if there's going to be an article entitled "As Time Goes By", it should mention the song because it a) is very famous and b) came first. --<a href="../../../b/t/h/User%7EBth_f25f.html" title="User:Bth">Bth</a></dd>

<dd>Do you think a full-blown disambiguation (<b>As Time Goes By (song)</b> and <b>As Time Goes By (TV)</b>) would be a good idea?

<dd>I don't think it's necessary right now. But if someone who knows about it comes along and writes a whole load of interesting stuff about who wrote the song and stuff then maybe it should. Given that the TV series draws on the song, I think it's fair to have the two in the same article. --<a href="../../../b/t/h/User%7EBth_f25f.html" title="User:Bth">Bth</a></dd>

<dd>Given that there is also now a book of the same name (a sequel to <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casablanca_%28film%29.html" title="Casablanca (film)">Casablanca</a> and an unrelated movie, perhaps it's getting nearer to time for a disambig? Four separate (if related) uses. Or perhaps we could just keep this page for the song (which is the primary), and spin the other three off to disambig'd pages, something like what was done with the various <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mystic_River_afe0.html" title="Mystic River">Mystic River</a> pages? The only issue I can see with that is that the song article would be a stub. <a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokicarbis_808b.html" title="User:Lokicarbis">Lokicarbis</a> 04:54, Apr 16, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>...Well a couple of simularities. I'd hesitate to say anything without some evidence from people associated with the show. -<a href="../../../d/h/o/User%7EDhodges_406c.html" title="User:Dhodges">Dhodges</a> 17:10, 25 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>To say that one is based on the other solely due to the use of "comedy of errors" tropes to keep two characters apart for decades is a pretty thin argument; you'd have to then say that half of Western literature is related as well. The book focuses on the effects of war and brutality toward women in captivity, and about two people intentionally trying to find each other afterwards and falling in love. The show doesn't really say anything about war at all (it's a mcguffin in the backstory, not part of the show itself) and is about two people who were lovers who run into each other accidentally decades later. As for the character's names being similar, they really aren't. The heroine of the book is Jean Paget, and both "Jean" and "Paget" are very common names. "Pargetter" is not a common name, and has a different etymology than "Paget". I'm not aware of any other character names from the show or book that are in any way similar. So, no, an argument that the show is based on the book (or one of the two film adaptations of it) won't stand up to scrutiny. Were the producers going for the same sort of feel of two people separated by war who find each other again? Probably. But that's not the same thing as saying "the premise for this series mostly based on Nevil Shute's novel." The feelings evoked are the same (the same thing can be said about dozens of films and shows that you wouldn't bother trying to link to this book), the premise is entirely different. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanonblack_67f7.html" title="User:Canonblack">Canonblack</a> 12:09, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I'm not quite sure I agree with you here - having a separate cast list works if you have character descriptions, but otherwise it makes the article less clear - it's much better to have the plot show who is playing particular characters in the context of the description, rather than as a redundant separate section - if people want to find that out, they can just look at IMDb. As I said, <i><a href="../../../o/n/l/Only_Fools_and_Horses_4892.html" title="Only Fools and Horses">Only Fools and Horses</a></i>, which is one of the best British sitcom pages on here, has the cast names integrated in the text, as do all of the other TV featured articles and all the GA sitcoms pages. <b><a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_Castle_6920.html" title="User:Bob Castle">Bob</a></b> <small><b><a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBob_Castle_7101.html" title="User talk:Bob Castle">talk</a></b></small> 13:16, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree it makes the article less clear. Straight away the reader is told who plays who, and then the plot is not cluttered by brackets saying who played who. In addition, having the two merged you deleted the information on what series the characters appeared, the fact the Harry was played by a second actor in 2005 and middle/maiden name info of some characters. Putting in this information would clutter the Plot section even more. I feel that when someone is reading the Plot they don't want to know who played who they just want to know what the programme was about. --<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerks105_514e.html" title="User:Berks105">Berks105</a> 13:22, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maybe, but those generally work only when there's some character descriptions. That said, if you're planning to write some in the future, then that's excellent. <b><a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_Castle_6920.html" title="User:Bob Castle">Bob</a></b> <small><b><a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBob_Castle_7101.html" title="User talk:Bob Castle">talk</a></b></small> 13:25, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I may butt in, I prefer the article with the cast list section, rather than having the actors' names introduced in brackets in the plot section.
