<p>The play is set in a <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duchy.html" title="Duchy">duchy</a> in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, but most of the action takes place in a location called the '<a href="../../../f/o/r/Forest_of_Arden_6d2e.html" title="Forest of Arden">Forest of Arden</a>', which is most likely a <a href="../../../t/o/p/Toponymy.html" title="Toponymy">toponym</a> for a forest close to Shakespeare's home town of <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stratford-upon-Avon_8315.html" title="Stratford-upon-Avon">Stratford-upon-Avon</a>. The Oxford Shakespeare edition rationalizes this geographical discrepancy by assuming that 'Arden' is an <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglicisation.html" title="Anglicisation">anglicisation</a> of the forested <a href="../../../a/r/d/Ardennes.html" title="Ardennes">Ardennes</a> region of Belgium, and alters the spelling to reflect this. Other editions keep Shakespeare's 'Arden' spelling, since it can be argued that the <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pastoral.html" title="Pastoral">pastoral</a> <a href="../../../m/o/d/Mode.html" title="Mode">mode</a> depicts a fantastical world in which geographical details are irrelevant. The Arden edition of Shakespeare makes the suggestion that the name 'Arden' comes from a combination of the classical region of <b>Ar</b>cadia and the biblical garden of E<b>den</b>, as there is a strong interplay of classical and Christian belief systems and philosophies within the play.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Shakespeare's mother's name was Mary Arden, and the name of the forest may also be a pun on that.</p>

<p>Frederick has usurped the Duchy and exiled his older brother, Duke Senior. The Duke's daughter Rosalind has been permitted to remain at court because she is the closest friend and cousin of Frederick's only child, Celia. Orlando, a young gentleman of the kingdom who has fallen in love at first sight of Rosalind, is forced to flee his home after being persecuted by his older brother, Oliver. Frederick becomes angry and banishes Rosalind from court. Celia and Rosalind decide to flee together accompanied by the jester Touchstone, with Rosalind disguised as a young man.</p>
<p>Rosalind, now disguised as <a href="../../../g/a/n/Ganymede.html" title="Ganymede">Ganymede</a> ("<a href="../../../j/u/p/Jupiter_%28mythology%29.html" title="Jupiter (mythology)">Jove</a>'s own page"), and Celia, now disguised as Aliena (<a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_language.html" title="Latin language">Latin</a> for "stranger"), arrive in the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arcadia_%28paradise%29.html" title="Arcadia (paradise)">Arcadian</a> <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forest_of_Arden_6d2e.html" title="Forest of Arden">Forest of Arden</a>, where the <a href="../../../e/x/i/Exile.html" title="Exile">exiled</a> Duke now lives with some supporters, including "the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melancholy.html" title="Melancholy">melancholy</a> Jaques", who is introduced to us weeping over the slaughter of a <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deer.html" title="Deer">deer</a>. "Ganymede" and "Aliena" do not immediately encounter the Duke and his companions, as they meet up with Corin, an impoverished <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenant.html" title="Tenant">tenant</a>, and offer to buy his master's rude cottage.</p>
<p>Orlando and his servant Adam (a role possibly played by Shakespeare himself, though this story may be apocryphal <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>), meanwhile, find the Duke and his men and are soon living with them and posting simplistic <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love_poem.html" title="Love poem">love poems</a> for Rosalind on the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Tree.html" title="Tree">trees</a>. Rosalind, also in love with Orlando, meets him as Ganymede and pretends to counsel him to cure him of being in love. Ganymede says he will take Rosalind's place and he and Orlando can act out their relationship.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the shepherdess Phoebe, with whom Silvius is in love, has fallen in love with Ganymede, though Ganymede continually shows that he is not interested in Phoebe. The cynical Touchstone has also made an amorous advance on the dull-witted goatherd girl Audrey, and attempts to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">marry</a> her before his plans are thwarted by the intrusive Jaques.</p>
<p>Finally, Silvius, Phoebe, Ganymede, and Orlando are brought together in an argument with each other over who will get whom. Ganymede says he will solve the problem, having Orlando promise to marry Rosalind, and Phoebe promise to marry Silvius if she cannot marry Ganymede. The next day, Ganymede reveals himself as Rosalind, and since women are not allowed to marry women, Phoebe ends up with Silvius.</p>
<p>Orlando sees Oliver in the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forest.html" title="Forest">forest</a> and rescues him from a <a href="../../../l/i/o/Lioness.html" title="Lioness">lioness</a>, causing Oliver to repent of mistreating Orlando. Oliver meets Aliena (Celia's false identity) and falls in love with her, and they agree to marry. Orlando and Rosalind, Oliver and Celia, Silvius and Pheobe, and Touchstone and Audrey all are married in the final <a href="../../../s/c/e/Scene_%28fiction%29.html" title="Scene (fiction)">scene</a>, after which they discover that Frederick has also repented his faults, deciding to restore his legitimate brother to the <a href="../../../d/u/k/Dukedom.html" title="Dukedom">dukedom</a> and adopt a religious life.</p>

<p>Critics from <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Johnson_4852.html" title="Samuel Johnson">Samuel Johnson</a> to <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Bernard_Shaw_f7b2.html" title="George Bernard Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a> have complained that <i>As You Like It</i> is lacking in the high artistry of which Shakespeare was capable. Shaw liked to think that Shakespeare wrote the play as a mere <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/crowdpleaser" class="extiw" title="wikt:crowdpleaser">crowdpleaser</a>, and signalled his own middling opinion of the work by calling it <i>As <b>You</b> Like It</i> — as if the playwright did not agree. <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leo_Tolstoy_eb79.html" title="Leo Tolstoy">Tolstoy</a> objected to the <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immoral.html" title="Immoral">immorality</a> of the characters, and Touchstone's constant clowning. Despite these high-profile naysayers, the play remains one of Shakespeare's most frequently performed comedies.</p>
<p>The elaborate gender reversals in the story are of particular interest to modern critics interested in <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender_studies.html" title="Gender studies">gender studies</a>. Through four acts of the play, Rosalind — who in Shakespeare's day would have been played by a boy — finds it necessary to disguise herself as a boy, whereupon the rustic Phoebe (also played by a boy), becomes infatuated with this "<a href="../../../g/a/n/Ganymede.html" title="Ganymede">Ganymede</a>", a name with <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homoerotic.html" title="Homoerotic">homoerotic</a> overtones. In fact, the epilogue, spoken by Rosalind to the audience, states rather explicitly that she (or at least the actor playing her) is not a woman.</p>

<p>Act II, Scene 7 features one of Shakespeare's most famous monologues, which states:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"All the world's a stage</dd>
<dd>And all the men and women merely players;</dd>
<dd>They have their exits and their entrances,</dd>
<dd>And one man in his time plays many parts,</dd>
<dd>His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,</dd>
<dd>Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms:</dd>
<dd>And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel</dd>
<dd>And shining morning face, creeping like snail</dd>
<dd>Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,</dd>
<dd>Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad</dd>
<dd>Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,</dd>
<dd>Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,</dd>
<dd>Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,</dd>
<dd>Seeking the bubble reputation</dd>
<dd>Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,</dd>
<dd>In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,</dd>
<dd>With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,</dd>
<dd>Full of wise saws and modern instances;</dd>
<dd>And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts</dd>
<dd>Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,</dd>
<dd>With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,</dd>
<dd>His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide</dd>
<dd>For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,</dd>
<dd>Turning again toward childish treble, pipes</dd>
<dd>And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,</dd>
<dd>That ends this strange eventful history,</dd>
<dd>Is second childishness and mere oblivion;</dd>
<dd>Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything."</dd>
</dl>
<p>This famous <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monologue.html" title="Monologue">monologue</a> is spoken by the melancholy Jaques.</p>
<p><i>As You Like It</i> also features much humorous and clever wordplay, occasioned by chance encounters in the forest, and several entangled love affairs, all in a serene pastoral setting which makes it often especially effective staged outdoors in a park or similar site.</p>

<p>The theme of pastoral comedy is love in all its guises in a rustic setting, the genuine love embodied by Rosalind contrasted with the sentimentalized affectations of Orlando, and the improbable happenings that set the urban courtiers wandering to find exile, solace or freedom in a woodland setting are no more unrealistic than the string of chance encounters in the forest, provoking witty banter, which require no subtleties of plotting and character development. The main action of the first act is no more than a wrestling match, and the action throughout is often interrupted by a song. At the end, <a href="../../../h/y/m/Hymenaios.html" title="Hymenaios">Hymen</a> himself arrives to bless the wedding festivities.</p>
<p>The stock characters in conventional situations were familiar material for Shakespeare and his audience; it is the light <a href="../../../r/e/p/Repartee.html" title="Repartee">repartee</a> and the breadth of the subjects that provide texts for wit that put a fresh stamp on the proceedings. At the centre the <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optimism.html" title="Optimism">optimism</a> of Rosalind is contrasted with the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misogyny.html" title="Misogyny">misogynistic</a> melancholy of Jaques. Shakespeare would take up some of the themes more seriously later: the usurper Duke and the Duke in exile provide themes for <i><a href="../../../m/e/a/Measure_for_Measure_b069.html" title="Measure for Measure">Measure for Measure</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Tempest_%28play%29_45cb.html" title="The Tempest (play)">The Tempest</a></i>.</p>

It went over the air in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a>.</p>
<p><i><a href="../../../a/s/_/As_You_Like_It_%281936_film%29_19be.html" title="As You Like It (1936 film)">As You Like It</a></i> was <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurence_Olivier_615b.html" title="Laurence Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>'s first Shakespeare film, though he only acted in it, rather than producing and directing. Made in the <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_7642.html" title="UK">UK</a> and released in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>, the film also starred director <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Czinner_40e8.html" title="Paul Czinner">Paul Czinner</a>'s wife <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Bergner_3b58.html" title="Elizabeth Bergner">Elizabeth Bergner</a>, who played Rosalind with a thick <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a> accent. Although it is much less "Hollywoody" than the 1930's versions of <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i> and <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, and although its cast was made up entirely of Shakespearean actors, it was not considered a success by either Olivier or the critics.</p>
<p>In 1992 Christine Edzard made another film adaptation of the play. It features James Fox, Cyril Cusack, Griff Rhys Jones and Ewen Bremner. The action is transposed to a modern and bleak urban world.</p>
