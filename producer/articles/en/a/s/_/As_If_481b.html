<p>The series focused on six young adults (henceforth: the group) who lived in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. Each episode was presented from a different character's point of view, which was never done before in a teen <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dramedy.html" title="Dramedy">dramedy</a> television show. The show had a significant <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_television.html" title="Cult television">cult</a> following and critical acclaim. It was considered groundbreaking and was often referred to as a "cooler", more sophisticated version of another British teen <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soap_opera.html" title="Soap opera">soap</a>, <i><a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollyoaks.html" title="Hollyoaks">Hollyoaks</a></i>. Ironically, soon after <i>As If</i> had finished, <i>Hollyoaks</i> began using story telling and filming techniques similar to the ones used <i>As If</i>.</p>
<p>Part of the show's identity was the style, such as surreal fly-on-the-wall style camera work, fast camera transitions, wacky sound effects added to some scenes and the distinctive theme music (the tune "Would you..." by the band <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Lowe_3610.html" title="David Lowe">Touch 'n' Go</a>). Episode four of the first series was awarded an <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Television_Society_5bd7.html#Awards" title="Royal Television Society">RTS Television Award</a> for Best Tape or Film Editing - Drama.</p>

<dd>The <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joker.html" title="Joker">joker</a> of the group, he was a well-meaning pleasant guy, but had a tendency to get himself into trouble due to his rather naive behavior. He had an optimistic outlook and was content to play the role of the group's clown. Despite the foolish mistakes he sometimes made, he was well liked by the group as his heart seemed to be in the right place.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>During the first series, we follow Jamie as he enjoys the freedom of single life: he dates an older, married woman he met over the internet; idealizes Nicki, courts her and fails miserably; and eventually ends up kissing Sooz in the last episode. The second series follows the Jaime-Sooz relationship turmoil: from the problematic beginning, to the outing and eventually end of the relationship as Sooz ends it. Jaime ends up with Nicki for a <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_night_stand.html" title="One night stand">one night stand</a>. The third series follows Jaime's undying love and sacrifice for Sooz, his coping with her coma, and eventually the distance torn between them due to her suicide attempt. The fourth series focuses primarily on Jaime's academic career or the lack of such: he fakes his leaving to <a href="../../../u/h/i/UHI_Millennium_Institute_dd98.html" title="UHI Millennium Institute">Inverness</a>; attempts to retake the qualifying tests and eventually is accepted to study <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychology.html" title="Psychology">psychology</a>. Sooz and Jamie are together through out most of the fourth series, but end up breaking up after Sooz is unfaithful. The series ends in an optimistic note as the last scene where Sooz and Jamie appear in shows them talking to each other on the phone, but saying nothing: Sooz eventually asks "Are you still there?" and Jaime answers: "Of course I am". They both smile, and that's all we'll ever hear of them.</dd>
