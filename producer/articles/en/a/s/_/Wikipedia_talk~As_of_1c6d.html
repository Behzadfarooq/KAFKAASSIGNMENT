<p>I think "As of" should only be used to give information meant to describe the contemporary world, when that information is likely to change somewhat rapidly. For example, one should say that "As of 2006", there are 1000 (just an example) languages spoken in Africa. However, one should <i><b>not</b></i> say "As of 1950", there were 25 colonies in Africa. Rather, just say, "In 1950" or present the information in a different way. Do people understand my objection? No one is ever going to (or should) come back to the 1950 one and change it. It will always be true (and useful information). However, the language factoid should be updated. Essentially, no one should ever use the past tense with "as of." Thus, there should never be ancient pages like As of 1889. They should either be updated with the most current information, or the "as of" link eliminated. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperm401_861f.html" title="User:Superm401">Superm401</a> | <a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESuperm401_06a9.html" title="User talk:Superm401">Talk</a> 02:11, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>For similar reasons, I don't think there should be future as ofs, like "As of 2007" (As of 2006&#160;:) ) <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperm401_861f.html" title="User:Superm401">Superm401</a> | <a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESuperm401_06a9.html" title="User talk:Superm401">Talk</a> 02:54, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ideally, yes, but what if the most recent information available to us is from 1889? It's unlikely, but just the other day I read a statement that said something like "As of 1911, Lily's Latin Grammar was under perpetual crown <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> in the United Kingdom." This fact was mentioned in the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica, and apparently it is difficult to determine whether or not it is still the case. The "as of" is a marker that this information should be updated if possible. I agree that in your African colonies example the "as of 1950" is inappropriate, since it described a state of affairs in 1950 that is meant to be used as a historical snapshot. But there are situations in which "as of" is appropriate for such old years. —<a href="../../../b/k/e/User%7EBkell_6f8f.html" title="User:Bkell">Bkell</a> 06:54, 16 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's a valid point, though I don't think all of the historical ones fall in that category. However, would you agree that there should never be a future "as of"? <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperm401_861f.html" title="User:Superm401">Superm401</a> | <a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESuperm401_06a9.html" title="User talk:Superm401">Talk</a> 05:43, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, saying "as of 2008" in an article written today would be bizarre, and I can't really think of a reasonable use for something like that. —<a href="../../../b/k/e/User%7EBkell_6f8f.html" title="User:Bkell">Bkell</a> 22:34, 23 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I disagree. I think many articles could benefit from "as of" links in the future. For instance, right now, one article, <a href="../../../r/u/v/Ruvuma_River_6f8b.html" title="Ruvuma River">Ruvuma River</a>, has an "as of 2008" link, in the sentence:
<dl>
<dd><i>Construction is to finish in [[As of 2008|2008]] and will cost 28 billion USD.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>This seems a perfect use for future "as of" links to me. It sounds like you are suggesting this should be recast either as
<dl>
<dd><i>[[As of 2006]], construction is expected to finish in 2008 and cost 28 billion USD.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>or as:
<dl>
<dd><i>Construction is to finish in [[As of 2006|2008]] and will cost 28 billion USD.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Both reworkings seem bizarre and less elegant than the current one. I think using future "as of" links is perfect for the next few years (I would say, not beyond 2010 or so) when there is an extremely high probability that a) the fact being stated <i>will</i> be true at that time, and the only cleanup task will be to verify that it was actually true (and change tenses), and b) there is unlikely to be any further developments requiring a fact-check of the statement <i>until</i> that date arrives.</dd>

<dd>I think it would make perfect sense to put [[As of 2009]] into a statement about the next U.S. Presidential inauguration, for instance.

<p>"As of" is great for fact-checking, but because so many articles make use of it, it is hard to identify those articles which are actually due an update. Note that there are also very many "(Year) in (topic)" articles. My suggestion would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some topical "as of" links to topical year article e.g. in a cricket article [[As of 2006 in cricket|As of 2006]], with [[As of 2006 in cricket]] set as a redirect to [[2006 in cricket]] and also categorized in some way under "cricket" (not sure of the best way to do this though). Similarly [[As of 2006 in film|As of 2006]] in a film article, redirecting to [[2006 in film]].</li>
<li>Some regional "as of" links e.g. in a United States/African related article, [[As of 2006 in the United States/in Africa|As of 2006]], with [[As of 2006 in the United States/in Africa]] set as a redirect to [[2006 in the United States]]/[[2006 in Africa]] and appropriately categorized (again, open to suggestions as to how this should be done).</li>
<li>For large batches of statistics it may be better to have specific "as of" links e.g. [[As of the Statistics Norway Yearbook, 2004|As of 2004]] or [[As of the United States Census, 2000|As of 2000]]. I'm not sure what these should redirect to: if there is an article on the statistical batch (e.g. the U.S. census) it may be best to redirect there (it seems sufficiently intuitive that a casual reader clicking on the "As of 2000" in "As of 2000, the population is..." wouldn't be utterly shocked to end up at the 2000 census) but in other cases the redirect should probably simply be to the year itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is there support for these proposals? I think they would make updating significantly easier. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 14:22, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is there any reason not to delete pages for years such as 1975, and deprecated pages such as August 2001, etc.?</p>
<p>I can't see any reason not to delete deprecated pages which are no longer used, but I'm not sure about the full years.</p>

<p>Considering that the <i>as of</i> technique apparently violates Wikipedia conventions, can we use a template or something similar instead, to produce a more elegant result? Presumably, a template or similar technique can be mixed with regular text (to mark the right spot) without becoming visible.</p>

<p>I created a template to play with. So far, it looks like the best solution is to use the template to add the page to a category.

<dd>I don't understand what's wrong with your [[template:Update 2007]] technique, which leaves a reference to the template in the database (that can be found with what links here) but without anything visible in the article. There could be one of these templates per year, much like there's one "as of" redirect per year. Putting articles into a category is certainly possible, but seems wrong (since the categories are visible). -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 15:31, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have the [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:As_of&amp;action=edit|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:As_of&amp;action=edit|" rel="nofollow">Template:As_of</a>] template fairly well documented, including my objection to the space that is left; this space could be awkward in some cases, just as the current hotlinking is awkward.</dd>
<dd>As for the categories, what specifically is wrong with that? I see plenty of articles which are in admin-like categories. Although, I guess it's intended for stuff which is expected to be fixed eventually (in a perfect world).</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Hmm, I just re-checked, and I see that the template does indeed have a <i>what links here</i>, and the template itself, of course, does not need to return ANY text (can be completely empty aside from comments).</dd>
<dd>Thought: is it possible for a template to return a value only if a user is logged in (therefore is probably an editor)? Could then have a marker of some type appear where the template is. This would have the advantage of:
<ol>
<li>Let editors know whether an item is already marked as needing update at some time in the future.</li>
<li>Let editors know where to look to see if something needs updating.</li>
<li>People who are not logged in (and therefore presumably just readers/users) will see nothing special.</li>
<li>The mark could link to the template page, which would have a comment describing what the mark is for, for those unfamiliar with it. If can't have a mark that only shows up for people who log in, then a non-invasive mark would probably be ok for readers as well. I think there should be SOME mark, even if it can't be hidden from readers.</li>

<dd>My issue with "as of" categories is that if this technique catches on, I think there will be "as of" notes essentially permanently on hundreds of thousands of articles (every current political officeholder in the officeholder's article and the geographical article about the place, every sports team's current roster, every article about any annual award, ...). I think most of the current "administrative" categories are not meant to be permanent. Re visibility - perhaps the note should be invisible until it "expires" and then turn into a "please update me" tag of some sort. This would be possible with a template using <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/ParserFunctions" class="extiw" title="m:ParserFunctions">m:ParserFunctions</a> (if the currentyear is greater than or equal to the update year, then show the tag). -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 17:33, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've been fiddling with [[Template:Update 2007]]; I have it documented and have a "{{Update 2007}}" as the marker. I was intending to use a magic word to insert the template name into the link (so that the template can be copied to other years without modification), but I couldn't figure out how to make that work. I also checked to see if <i>What links here</i> will work with individual page topics, but apparently not. Would using a subpage be better for all of the years?</dd>

<dd>If using a "please update me", then probably should have a flag indicating low-priority and high-priority stuff; hgh-priority for things which you know will change, and low-priority for things which may change and/or it's not critical. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_McNay_5b57.html" title="User:Scott McNay">Scott McNay</a> 17:52, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Articles can't be automatically added to a category by a template at a later time, the cateogry addition has to happen when an edit to the article is made. We could set it up so if the time has expired and anyone edits the article it is added then, but there's no way to auto-add when the timer expires. Rather than "as of" this is more of an update reminder - perhaps the name should be more reflective of this purpose. Note that with a template doing a date comparison, the comparison could be to the month or even to a specific day with the "expiration" month/day included as (probably optional) parameters. I'd be OK with the note looking sort of like what <a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">template:fact</a> produces, i.e. <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> (which does not appear on printed copies). Perhaps it could be <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs to be updated." class="noprint">[<a href="../../../u/p/d/Wikipedia%7EUpdating_information_969a.html" title="Wikipedia:Updating information"><i>update&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>. Note that there is an existing <a href="../../../u/p/d/Template%7EUpdate_1c46.html" title="Template:Update">template:update</a>, which produces a much more intrusive flag.

<p>1. Well, it shows the category at the bottom of the page when I change the year in the template from 2007 to 2006; maybe that's due to the cache flushing (which would be a way to force all aged articles to join the category, once someone simply views the page). I suppose can leave the conditional category in for now, and see how annoying it is, and take it out later if it's excessively so.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>It might display even though the article doesn't actually appear in the category listing. Changing the template causes the article to be re-rendered when it is next viewed. My guess is the renderer shows it as in the category but the category database record is not updated.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>2. I think it might be better to have two different templates, one for "update needed" and one for "review needed" (this would also lack the category), thus giving two different priority levels.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The difference being "update" means the article is for sure stale (e.g. Bush being listed as president and the date being after Jan 2009) and "review" means only that the content might be stale (any incumbent politician after the next election)? I think it might be worth worrying about "update" first and seeing how it goes.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>3. What do you think of using subpages for months, as in "Update needed on 2006/07/31"</p>

<p>4. I dislike hardcoding the year, but I can't think of a way to do that AND have a separate template for each year (and maybe month). Maybe have a higher-level template which creates the year templates?</p>

<dd><i>I think separate template by year is fine (and hardly worth creating a meta-template for). I'd prefer the month to be a parameter. There could be categories for each month.</i></dd>

<p>Ok, I've NOINCLUDEd the "*" mark (which was almost invisible) and the category code.</p>
<p>I don't see how to make the months work in <b>What links here</b>, so that one knows that a particular article is "expiring" in a particular month.</p>

<dd>This is good! BTW - I think adding the articles to a category would be good as well, even if they only truly show up in the category listing the next time they're edited after the expiration date. Before going too public with this we should add at least a month option if not month and day. This <i>could</i> all be done in one template at the expense of an extra space (linked to an "update needed on year/month/day" article. I've extended your [[Template:Update 2007]] to include a mandatory year parameter with optional month and day params at <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_update_after_a6b2.html" title="User:Rick Block/update after">User:Rick Block/update after</a>.

<p>Looks good.</p>
<p>Why the space that you mention? If not going to have something which is visible, then might as well not have anything which is mostly invisible, either. (later) Oh, I guess the space is there for the same reason that I had it; gotta have SOMETHING there. Can you put a comment there?</p>
<p>As a programmer, I find the duplicate code annoying, yet, as someone new to templates, I find it hard enough to understand as it is. &#160;:) Maybe we can merge it once the fine-tuning is done.</p>
<p>I guess we were pretty much looking at different sheets of the same music, with our talk about parameters and subpages. So, we're getting the best of both this way, looks like.</p>
<p>We'll probably want to put month links in the year pages, and year links in the main page.</p>
<p>Having it all nested in subpages feels better to me than each on its' own independent page.</p>

<dd>Like you surmise, if you want the article to show up in "what links here" you have to have something "visible" to attach the HTML anchor to, and it doesn't look like a comment is sufficient. As long as the invocation is adjacent to blank space, it will be invisible until the appointed date.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The code isn't exactly duplicated, but I do know what you mean. If you looked at the history you might have noticed I struggled a bit to get it actually working. We can work on it more, if you'd like, to try to make it more readable (most of the really weird stuff is to escape line feeds) and to eliminate code redundancies (I'm not big on redundant code either).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes to both subpages and parameters. Thinking about it, perhaps "by day" subpages are overkill (we could use just the month if a specific day is given).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There isn't anything automatic (yet) that will create the year or month (or day, if we have them) "update needed" articles. These could perhaps all be subpages of <a href="../../../u/p/d/Wikipedia%7EUpdating_information_969a.html" title="Wikipedia:Updating information">Wikipedia:Updating information</a>, with the "update needed" text being a link to the specific subpage (rather than the general one). When we start creating these, I agree the months should link to the years. I'd probably make both months and years link to the main page and have next/prev links as well. We could probably make a template for the content of these pages as well&#160;:).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, and btw, I think we should include some pretty strong "use of this template should be considered only in cases where there really isn't any other alternative" sort of statement with a reference to <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_statements_that_will_date_quickly_074a.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid statements that will date quickly">Wikipedia:Avoid statements that will date quickly</a> (which I don't think is currently strongly worded enough either, but that's another matter). The point is this template should not be used if there's a way to write an "ageless" statement instead.

<p>I see that someone, earlier today, created a link to <i>As of 1900</i> in the main article, which indicates that a number of editors are totally missing the point about how to use it, which in turn implies that it is used more often than it should be. If data is over a century obsolete, then there is definitely no rush in reviewing it. <i>As of</i> needs to go if only because it is misused so often, and thus wastes or discourages a lot of sincere effort.</p>
<p>The problem that needs to be dealt with is that there is a lot of forward-looking prose, much of it for good reasons, and, if nothing else, the tense needs to be changed once the date has passed; depending upon the context, it's often hard or impossible to write tense-free prose that doesn't sound odd.</p>
<p>I'm not sure of the day is overkill or not; there are cases where an event will occur on a specific day, and such events may be documented in an article which is not reviewed very often; if it can be updated that day, it may help WP (or at least that one article) look like someone is actively maintaining it. Also, having it by day may encourage people to review/update the articles, since instead of having a lengthy list of hundreds of articles to slog through for the year (and getting the feeling of a too-large problem), one only has a (relative) handful to look at each day. The problem that I see is with doing the day pages; you'd need 31 of them for each month, and THAT does seem excessive. I'll see what I can come up with.</p>
<p>I see that the <b>As of</b> pages deprecate the use of months (and forget about days), but that's possibly a reaction to misuse.</p>
<p>I edited your template to include strong language.&#160;:) I even considered adding "incompetence", but decided that was a bit too strong, as it may be simple ignorance, or judgement call.&#160;:).</p>

I've created Template:Update after2, which creates month pages and Template:Update after3, which creates day pages.

<p>Thinking about the code redundancy issue, using an algebraic comparison to figure out if the designated date has past might be a simplification.

<p>where &lt;current year, month, day&gt;, and &lt;subpage&gt; are the appropriate expressions (lots of curly braces).

I imported it into the main template, and then fiddled with it to see if I could get rid of the space. I discovered that I could get rid of it by using <b>&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;</b> (this might be useful for future reference). THEN, I realized that that the entire #IFEXPR wasn't even necessary; it was just there for the now-gone asterisk. I removed the entire line, and now not only is the space gone, but the template has been simplified a bit more. Go to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_presidential_election%2C_2008_b6e0.html#Later_events" title="United States presidential election, 2008">United_States_presidential_election,_2008#Later_events</a> and fiddle with it and preview it to see what it looks like. I like your in/on conditional. Better watch out, people might think it looks professional! &lt;grin&gt;</p>
<dl>
<dd>But now there's no reference to the appropriate updating information subpage until after the indicated date. For example, <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Wikipedia%7EUpdating_information_2008_8_25_ac01.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Wikipedia:Updating information/2008/8/25">Special:Whatlinkshere/Wikipedia:Updating_information/2008/8/25</a> should show <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_presidential_election%2C_2008_b6e0.html" title="United States presidential election, 2008">United States presidential election, 2008</a> (right?), but doesn't.</dd>

<p>Also, I'm going to merge the <a href="../../../u/p/d/Template%7EUpdate_after_0aa9.html" title="Template:Update after">Template:Update after</a> documentation into <a href="../../../u/p/d/Wikipedia%7EUpdating_information_969a.html" title="Wikipedia:Updating information">Wikipedia:Updating information</a>, so that everything is kept in one place.

<p>P.S. Is there a way for users to receive a notification of some kind (I don't mean by email or whatever) when the event occurs? At present, the people noticing are those who look at the linked date pages, or readers who see the "update needed" message. I was thinking of something like the message that you see when someone has updated your talk page. That way, if the editors on the date pages haven't fixed the article already by the time you log on, you'll see the notice and be reminded to update the article. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_McNay_5b57.html" title="User:Scott McNay">Scott McNay</a> 04:17, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I can't think of a reasonable way for any sort of notification like this to work. I don't even think the rendering difference (when "update needed" first shows up) will cause the article to show up on the watchlists of folks watching it.</dd>
</dl>
<p>P.P.S. I don't think that the above can be done, but perhaps can have the page linked to a parameter-specified topical category, such as "Category: U.S. Political Articles Needing Updates", or something else along those lines, so that the article can be updated by someone who likely knows something about the subject or knows someone else who does. I'll tinker with that later if you don't beat me to it. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_McNay_5b57.html" title="User:Scott McNay">Scott McNay</a> 04:49, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This one's possible, but I think I'd keep it simple (without this) for now. I think the updating information subpages need to be a little more user friendly. Since the "update needed" link leads to these pages, they may very well be visited by folks who've never edited before. I'll take a stab at some rewording. I think this is nearly ready to invite broader comments.

<dd>You'll have to show me what you mean; sounds like you're referring to having two links in the article, one tied to "update needed" for people who want to know what it means, and perhaps another which uses &lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; to hide the link.</dd>

<dd>P.S. If articles 100% need updating, then we should not let the month and day be optional. That would be appropriate for a future <b>{{Review after}}</b> template, but not for <b>{{Update after}}</b>. Even if we can't think of a situation where it doesn't matter exactly when, as long as it's in the specified year or month, it shouldn't be a hardship for any editor to be forced to pick a specific day (by throwing a dart at a calendar, if necessary) in such a case. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_McNay_5b57.html" title="User:Scott McNay">Scott McNay</a> 19:10, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What I mean is have the template always generate an invisible link to a year/month subpage of <a href="../../../u/p/d/Wikipedia%7EUpdating_information_969a.html" title="Wikipedia:Updating information">Wikipedia:Updating information</a>, and show <sup>[<i><a href="../../../u/p/d/Wikipedia%7EUpdating_information_969a.html" title="Wikipedia:Updating information">update needed</a></i>]</sup> (linked to the main page, not a subpage) only after the selected date. The update needed text will always show up on a specific day, so whatever month that day is in should be the target of the "invisible" link. Perhaps some examples might help.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if you noticed my comment above about the current version not generating links to the subpages (in the case the date is still in the future). I don't understand your comment above about using &lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to make this link "invisible". To get the link to show up in the "what links here" database, I think there needs to be some text the HTML anchor is attached to (minimally, a space character, although perhaps a Unicode <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/200b/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/200b/index.htm" rel="nofollow">zero width space</a> would also work). We do want the links to show up before the specified date (right?).</p>
<p>I think the main reason not to have links to "by day" subpages is it makes it much more tedious to find the invocations (and would make the nice tidy little table at <a href="../../../u/p/d/Wikipedia%7EUpdating_information_969a.html" title="Wikipedia:Updating information">Wikipedia:Updating information</a> way bigger). I suppose we could generate links to the specific day, <b>and</b> month, <b>and</b> year if all are given, and only month/year otherwise. This would allow "what links here" for a specific day to show the invocations specifying the day, while "what links here" for a month would show any day that month as well as invocations only specifying the month. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 20:07, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>1. HTML doesn't care if the link is empty or not; the problem is WP attempting to prevent people from creating empty links. WP just treats as text anything that it doesn't recognize, which includes valid HTML such as &lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;s/&gt;. Yes, I figured out what &lt;s/&gt; meant the other day when I used it on the <a href="../../../u/p/d/Wikipedia%7EUpdating_information_969a.html" title="Wikipedia:Updating information">Wikipedia:Updating information</a> page to cross out the obsolete/unused months.</p>
<p>2. Yes, I was already doing all that... or trying to. A visible link to the main page, and invisible links to year, month, and day. This will let things work both ways, with the small and simple month/year linked table (without the size and kludginess of individual days), and the quick-n-dirty links for today, yesterday, this month, etc., for those who want a daily task which is small enough not to be overwhelming. I hadn't realized that the update link wasn't linking until the day in question. I don't recall now if I read your msg first or noticed it in the template first.&#160;:)</p>
<p>3. If you're going to be 100% certain that the article needs an update, then you should also know WHEN that event will occur, and I think it's best to not permit people to be sloppy; we have that already with <a href="../../../a/s/_/Wikipedia%7EAs_of_1bbb.html" title="Wikipedia:As of">Wikipedia:As of</a>. Forcing an editor to specifically list the month and day reduces the number of brackets and pipes in the template, which makes it simpler to work with (not that that's been helping at the moment).</p>
<p>4. I'm replacing <a href="../../../d/a/t/Template%7EDatecnum_471d.html" title="Template:Datecnum">Template:datecnum</a> with <a href="../../../j/u/l/Template%7EJULIANDAY_aa1f.html" title="Template:JULIANDAY">Template:JULIANDAY</a>, which comes with a complete set of sibling templates for doing date arithmetic. Thus, this can be used to cause the message to appear a specific number of days late (but I'm leaving it at 0 for now), giving daily update editors a chance to fix it before readers see it. It can also be used on the updating page for the yesterday, last month, last year links. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_McNay_5b57.html" title="User:Scott McNay">Scott McNay</a> 05:10, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The template appears to be ready for testing, review, and approval. The visible parts have been simplified to the point that they do not need any maintenance; all that is needed is that editors click on the links at <a href="../../../u/p/d/Wikipedia%7EUpdating_information_969a.html" title="Wikipedia:Updating information">Wikipedia:Updating information</a> and update the articles listed. There are links for articles needing update today, yesterday, this month, last month, this year, and last year; that should be plenty of time to get a page updated one way or another.

<p>I suspect this will not work correctly for anonymous users due to page caching, and other caches such as the translated HTML cache may also interfere with its dynamic appearance. Considering that part of the point of "as of" is to indicate to a reader that a fact may be out of date, unintentional hiding of this sort could be quite detrimental to accuracy. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 20:37, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It redirects here because it's not official yet; will un-redirect after it becomes accepted. If caching were a problem, there should have been repercussions well before now.

<dd>I've wondered about this as well. The main page uses a date sensitive transclusion (and apparently works) so I think this should work, too. I don't quite understand how it works, but it seems to. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 01:50, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On the client side, the icon is cached for a week, and the CSS and images are cached for a month. The page itself appears to be set to "not specified", which generally means "check to see if a newer version is available". I don't recall if IE shows this info, but FireFox does. As for the WikiMedia software (which runs Wikipedia, as well as many other wikis, such as my own), my understanding is that it checks all transcluded items, and if any of them has a newer timestamp (such as {{CURRENTSECOND}} would have every second), the page is rebuilt, and it's up to the client to detect that there's an updated page available. Things like the user name/IP are handled by CSS, if I'm not mistaken, which is entirely separate, so it's possible to have customized pages without ruining the cache. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_McNay_5b57.html" title="User:Scott McNay">Scott McNay</a> 02:55, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've asked about this at <a href="../../../v/p/t/WP%7EVPT_113f.html" title="WP:VPT">WP:VPT</a>. After they're generated by mediawiki running on an Apache server, the pages are cached (usually in memory!) in the front end squids. I'm not exactly sure how the squid caches are managed, but I think when a page is saved the caches are actively invalidated (without waiting for the next fetch request). I'm pretty sure the squids don't check timestamps for every transclusion on every fetch (I could be wrong, but I think extraordinary efforts are made to optimize the squid performance - they serve something like 80% of the total hits). In any event, I think we'll get a definitive answer fairly soon. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 03:35, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No developer responses yet (and I haven't broken down and looked at the code&#160;:) ), but responders so far are under the impression there's no automatic squid cache purge for these time sensitive variables (the assumption is the main page is manually purged from the cache every day at GMT midnight, perhaps by a bot). I don't think this is a killer for <i>update after</i>, it just means the note may not appear quite as timely as it should. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 02:51, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_McNay_5b57.html" title="User:Scott McNay">user:Scott McNay</a> and I worked out a pretty sophisticated template (<a href="../../../u/p/d/Template%7EUpdate_after_0aa9.html" title="Template:Update after">template:update after</a>) that can be used as a marker for content that is known to require updating at some future date.
