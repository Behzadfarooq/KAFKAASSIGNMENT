	    <p>There seems to be some confusion here. Assistive technology is technology that is used in addition to regular technology to enable a disabled user to access, ideally with normal speed and in an integrated manner, what non-disabled people can access without such technology.</p>
<p><br />
For using the internet, asistive technology includes voice-enabled web browsersand read-back devices, braille readers and output devices, voice inout browsers, magnigying screen readers, etc.</p>
<p><br />
The other side of the coin is what web developers can to do make their content more accessible. In software design, this is called <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_access.html" title="Universal access">universal access</a> design. This does not necessarily require the disabled user to acquire any assistive technology. Items included here are keyboard-only navigation, possible in Microsoft Windows and most of their other software, as well as, the Opera browser, proper formating of links, atlernate attributes in tags for images etc. Many of these design principles, however, do assume some assistive technology on the part of the disabled user, and try to insure that such assistive technology is allowed to function properly. For exampled, for a blind internet user, it is assumed that he/she will be using some assistive technology like a voice enabled browser, at least. Then, some of these principles of universal design, like alternate attributes on images, do assume assistive technology. There are always additional advantages to such design, however, There are people with old enough, or weak enough computers that they can only access text only content. For them, such explanations of what an image describes is useful too.</p>
<p>In summmary, assistive technology should only include technology that supplements what the non-disabled user needs to access software, or even their computers at all. Another example-for those with with extreme mobility-impairments, breath-enabled controls for computers are available. (Opinion-If I am reaching a point that even one person is "beginning to feel uncomfortable at these details," I say, good!!!)</p>

<p>The example stating, "the modern telephone is, except for the deaf, universally accessible" misses the mark, especially when one considers the following example, the calculator.</p>
<p>The very same mobility impairments (not deafness) cited as challenges to a person's ability to use a calculator can preclude effective use of a "standard" telephone; reach, fine motor control, etc. Further, the same solution offered for calculator access is available for telephones: voice-based control.</p>

<p>The following paragraph was recently added to the article. It obviously specific to some country (or other, smaller political jurisdiction) but does not give its context, so I've cut it, because that lack of context renders it meaningless.

<dd>Assistive Technology is becoming very evident in K-12 Education. With the passage of IDEA 1997, all students with disabilities that are eligble for special education are required to be considered for assistive technology. In this way, assistive technology can be used to help compensate for skills that are yet to be developed by an individual student so that the student can continue to access the content of the school curriculum.</dd>

<p>I agree that universal design should be a separate topic, and so should be telecare.</p>
<p>Telecare for the person being monitored is not assistive technology-- but rather a medical technology used to monitor them from a remote location. However, if there is a medical provider that is unable to travel due to their disability, then perhaps telecare could be considered an assistive technology to the healthcare provider.</p>
<p>Telephones are not universally accessible to people with visual impairments either--they have various lights, displays, buttons other than the number pad, unique number pad arrangements, etc. I am taking that "universally accessible" phrase out. --141.157.54.195 16:06, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Quite a few are prominent non-profits with ad-free sites, and I think those are appropriate, but I wouldn't mind seeing it winnowed. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 03:30, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's a good point. Two things: (1) They'll get added back regularly (not that that makes you wrong, just a problem) and (2) If we winnow it, what criteria do we use? Most famous? National? Oldest? Agree a list? The last seems the most fruitful, but it may be heated. I tried to resolve a similar problem on the <a href="../../../s/c/r/Screen_readers.html" title="Screen readers">Screen_readers</a> page by removing the growing list of screen readers to a separate <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_screen_readers.html" title="List of screen readers">List_of_screen_readers</a> page, but they keep getting added back in to Screen readers and I'm not sure that a page of links was in compliance with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Not a directory</a> anyway.

<dd>I think it is important to remember that these articles are for informing readers about the topics. For this topic, I'd favor links to government-run organizations and government-provided resources, which I'd hope would have lists of other organizations, lists of technologies, etc. Beyond those, I'm not sure. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 18:20, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
