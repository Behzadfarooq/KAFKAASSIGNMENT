	    <p>This is David Gries. I am going to change the definition of assertion to include its more general definition: a true-false statement placed in a program (often as a comment) to indicate that that true-false statement is true at thyat place. This word is used in a discussion of the Hoare triple in this general sense (and has a link to the assertion definition), and it has been used this way since 1969. This will take me a bit of time since I am new to editing Wiki pages and I want to do it right, so please hold off on changing anything until I finish it.</p>

<p>Why not assertion? I am sure the name of functions is typically assert but the functionality should be called assertion.

<dd><b>an assertion is a programming language construct which immediately aborts program execution if a certain condition or expression is false</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>This is often the case, but not always: writing a warning and continuing, or simply ignoring the assertion are possible reactions to failed assertions at runtime. Often one is not really all that interested in assertions at runtime, but regard them as a piece of information for compilers or program analysers. ---- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 14:47, 21 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article states:</p>
<dl>
<dd>For example, following the dynamic allocation of memory in a programming language such as C, a pointer may be checked to ensure that it is not null before proceeding. Without such an assertion, a reference may occur later that would cause an error.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is a bad idea. <code>malloc</code> may fail when the system is OOM, under heavy load, or really at the whim of the implementator of the C standard library. A well-written program should not hit an assertion failure when this occurs — it should recover from the error condition, to the extent that is possible. If error recovery isn't possible, the program can emit an error message and exit. This is different from an assertion failure, which indicates that a logically-impossible situation was reached (i.e. a likely logic bug in the program). This isn't the case: OOM is certainly a logically-possible situation.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, there is little point checking that a pointer is not <code>NULL</code>. If there were some canonical way in C to ask "is this pointer valid?" that would be one thing — but there isn't. A non-NULL pointer can easily be invalid, so the check is incomplete. Furthermore, dereferencing a NULL pointer leads to an immediate access violation on any modern modern I'm aware of — in other words, the effect of stopping the program immediately can easily be achieved without needing an assertion. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeilc_4027.html" title="User:Neilc">Neilc</a> 17:23, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't necessarily concur with you in every bit, but I can certainly see your points. Do you know any better example that makes sense without one knowing context? -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 18:17, Mar 27, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>After looking around a bit, I think an example from the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/lang/assert.html" class="external text" title="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/lang/assert.html" rel="nofollow">Sun page on assertions in Java</a> is pretty good:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
    if (i % 3 == 0) {
        ...
    } else if (i % 3 == 1) {
        ...
    } else {
        assert i % 3 == 2 : i;
        ...
    }

Note, incidentally, that the assertion in the above example may fail if i is negative,
as the % operator is not a true modulus operator, but computes the remainder,
which may be negative.
</pre>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>so the assertion documents the assumption that <code>i</code> is non-negative. Once we resolve the dispute about which version of the page is better, I'll add an example similar to the above. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeilc_4027.html" title="User:Neilc">Neilc</a> 02:39, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I suggest that waiting till the pointer is dereferenced is definitely inferior to asserting that the pointer is not null. The assertion gives a clearer indication of the true point of failure. Of course higher quality code needs error-handling, but in some circumstances the assertion may be more cost-effective, e.g. when writing a one-off tool for ones own use. <a href="../../../p/j/t/User%7EPJTraill_4845.html" title="User:PJTraill">PJTraill</a> 01:31, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Reverting a major change to a page without discussion isn't <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikilove_b832.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikilove">nice</a>, and isn't consistent with <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiquette_3717.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiquette">Wikiquette</a>. Although I think my changes were definitely an improvement, I'll argue for them here rather than childishly re-reverting the page.</p>
<p>Why should we not talk about what is good practice? Simply because it is a source over which people can disagree is not a reason not to discuss it — if that were grounds for not including content, we wouldn't have articles on many, many subjects. If there are alternative points of view about the proper use of assertions, we can discuss those as well. Talking about <i>how</i> one should use assertions is pretty important to defining <i>what</i> an assertion is — an assertion is a programming tool, and providing a detailed discussion of a tool entails explaining when the tool is appropriate, and when it is inappropriate. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeilc_4027.html" title="User:Neilc">Neilc</a> 02:32, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am sorry if I was not careful in reverting your edit. Since you really altered the article in the fundamental way, I can't do anything but revert. But I hope you do realize that you also remove some points, which is not <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikilove_b832.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikilove">nice</a> either. Since your new version in the page history anyway, we can work on it together. (Though I might not have time after Easter) If you think what I did is childish, (though I think that's just usual procedure in wikipedia), then so is yours maybe.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Anyway, to get to the point, my point is not we should avoid the matters that are the source of dispute. And I don't disagree that we should mention <i>how</i> to make points on <i>what</i>. Indeed this old version says it is a bad practice to use assertion to do error checking. What I am saying is that we have to say this before saying why some code has assertions and some don't. That is, we are giving the reasons why assertions are often removed.</p>
<dl>
<dd>(1) Assertions may slow the program.</dd>
<dd>(2) Since assertions are usually not used for error checking, it is usually expected that the removal of them does not change the semantics.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The mention of how per se is ok, but the problem is the way it is said. Now let's go back to your version. How about this one:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Using assertions is often considered good practice.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This may be true or may be not. But what is the <i>point</i> of saying this? Again saying this per se is not a problem at all. In fact, I like sentences like "Assertions also simplify debugging: if an assertion no longer holds, the programmer would like to be informed immediately." So we can say like a number of programmers find the use of assertions helpful, and indeed some languages like Java have built-in assertion mechanism. In short, why do we concentrate on how programmers use assertions (e.g., simplifying debugging) instead of how they should use (e.g., using assertions is good.) Your version smells like a book about how to write good code, and this is usually a bad sign.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Just to be clear, I was saying it would have been childish of me to re-revert the page without discussion, not that the original revert was childish.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think we should talk about both what an assertion is and how assertions are used, since the latter is pretty important to having a clear understanding of the former. If we're going to describe how assertions are used, it only makes sense to me to differentiate between uses of assertions that are considered "good practice", and those that are not. Anyway, I've modified the article to preach less about what the user should do, and to talk more about the difference between assertions and other forms of handling exceptional situations. Let me know if the new version is ok. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeilc_4027.html" title="User:Neilc">Neilc</a> 07:17, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I went ahead to rewrite the article to make points instead of replying to you here. (By the way by doing this I never mean to be sarcastic.) If my writing makes sense, this version tells how assertions help programmers, and how they are typically implemented. Hence, the article is divided into two sections. I think we have some idea about assertions, but we just take a different approach to tell the idea. I think the way this version is written is the way articles in wikipedia are written if not the way of the textbook or typical programming books. Since I rewrote the article to make points, please do not hesitate to rewrite it or even revert it. I hope you can see what I am trying to say. -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 17:07, Mar 28, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am sorry about bad English (more like <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engrish.html" title="Engrish">Engrish</a>). But thank to you and others, the current version, I think, is quite good. The third section (comparison with error handling) simply says it is a bad idea to use assertions for error handling. And I think this is a good idea since we are not talking like this is how you should use assertions, and how you should implement them. -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 17:18, Mar 29, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The following has been removed:</p>
<dl>
<dd>In some cases, assertions may be configured so that when they fail they do not terminate the program, but leave a log entry. This is often the case when the program involves access to networks or intricate caching or concurrent executions. In those cases, it is often difficult to reproduce the same execution path, thus the assertions failure.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The current version of the article talks about the various ways of handling assertion failure (ignore it, halt program, print information about the error, etc.), so I think the content of the first sentence is still in the article. The second and third sentences don't make sense to me — I'm not sure why a concurrent program would be more or less likely to dump core when an assertion failure occurs. Part of the point of halting the program immediately (in languages like C) is getting a stack trace, which can be particularly useful in concurrent programs. If you want to discuss how different kinds of programs handle assertion failure in different ways (in general), that's fine with me -- I'm just not sure how broadly you can generalize here. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeilc_4027.html" title="User:Neilc">Neilc</a> 07:04, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I think that "Can't happen" should just redirect here. The entire "Can't happen" article consists of these two paragraphs:</p>
<dl>
<dd>In computer programming, "can't happen" refers to code often inserted by a programmer in order to report if there is a fault in the program and the "can't happen" does happen.
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../p/j/t/User%7EPJTraill_4845.html" title="User:PJTraill">PJTraill</a> 19:52, 2 April 2006 (UTC) OK, let's mention that somewhere</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Assertions" are a variation on this — code that "asserts" that a situation must be true and reports if it is not so. For example, in a medical application a database must never link a treatment to the wrong patient, as this could have serious effects. To be certain that an unforeseen situation will never produce an undetected error, a programmer may separately record the Patient ID on every treatment, and on recalling it check that the treatment has that Patient ID, and if not so then suppress the display of the offending record labelling it as "unrecallable". This is "can't happen" code in one sense, but "shouldn't happen" code in another sense and can be used to ensure very high reliability.
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../p/j/t/User%7EPJTraill_4845.html" title="User:PJTraill">PJTraill</a> 19:52, 2 April 2006 (UTC) We don't need any of this. The example is actually not bad, if rather specific, but I don't like the "unrecallable" idea. It is fortunately irrelevant, but it illustrates a dishonest or misleading interface – you should say there is an error in the DB. The last sentence seems dubious as far as I understand it: assertions do not of themselves ensure that code is reliable (unless verified at compile-time), they just help the programmer to make it reliable by improving the effectiveness of testing.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Please do merge. "Can't happen" sounds silly and unscientific, especially when an equivalent widely used term (assertion) is available. <a href="../../../w/l/i/User%7EWlievens_2d8b.html" title="User:Wlievens">Wouter Lievens</a> 12:11, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
