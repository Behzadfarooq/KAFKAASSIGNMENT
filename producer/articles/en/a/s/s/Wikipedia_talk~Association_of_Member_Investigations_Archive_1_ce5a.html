<h2><span class="mw-headline">Great idea</span></h2>
<p>I really like this idea, although I hate the name (sorry <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a>). Lately I had been thinking of proposing something similar to this because I thought that it was a missing piece in the Wikipedia <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">dispute process</a>. However the model that I was thinking of, rather than being like a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">US</a>-style <a href="../../../d/i/s/District_Attorney_151f.html" title="District Attorney">District Attorney</a> or even <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney_General_303a.html" title="Attorney General">Attorney General</a>, was something more on the line of the type of Investigating <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judge.html" title="Judge">judge</a> or <a href="../../../i/n/v/Investigating_magistrate.html" title="Investigating magistrate">Investigating magistrate</a> that some European countries have (for example, Spain's <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltasar_Garz%C3%B3n_b3cc.html" title="Baltasar Garzón">Baltasar Garzón</a>). I think that this would be in better keeping with WikiSpirit, since it is based upon an <a href="../../../i/n/q/Inquisitorial_system.html" title="Inquisitorial system">inquisitorial system</a>, rather than an <a href="../../../a/d/v/Adversarial_system.html" title="Adversarial system">adversarial system</a>.

<dd>Hm. I see your point, and it's a good one. I had concieved of the primary function being dealing with arbcom cases, but you're probably right that the current name is too adversarial. I'll mull on it while I travel over the next few days.

<p>I ran across a link to the DAO by coincidence on <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze">Blankfaze's</a> user page. I think what you're doing here is (in general) a good idea, but I have some qualms about the same. 'District Attorney's Office' (or <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse">BlankVerse's</a> suggested 'Office of Wikipedia Investigations') might seem to imply some sort of official sanction or formal, policy-based authority.

<dd>I don't think that the Ownership guideline is really meant to apply to organizations within the Wikipedia structure, so much as to article ownership.

<p>This idea is appalling - officially empowering some users to hound and persecute other editors (well, I say editors, but neither of the two protagonists in this, Snowspinner and Grunt, have a history of actually writing encyclopaedia articles anyway).</p>
<p>We are here to contribute to an international encyclopaedia - not as part of some grand social experiment where some users have an elevated status that allows them to bully others and force their views through regardless of the aim of writing an encyclopaedia.</p>
<p>And a warning - these constant attempts by some Wikipedians to make our dispute resolution process like a lawsuit will only end up with us getting sued in real life sometime. The proposal is an unreasonable attempt by some users, including one Arbitrator!, to hound users they personally dislike. This is a dangerous step forward - we should be developing an encyclopaedia, not an archocracy, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 19:46, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is a reason that <a href="../../../a/n/n/Wikipedia%7EAnnoying_users_4e44.html" title="Wikipedia:Annoying users">Wikipedia:Annoying users</a> became <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProblem_users_555a.html" title="Wikipedia:Problem users">Wikipedia:Problem users</a> became <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflicts_between_users_62dc.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflicts between users">Wikipedia:Conflicts between users</a> became <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comment</a>. I do not deny that troublesome editors exist, but singling people out as "problem users" who need to be "dealt with" is a really really bad way to work out peaceful resolutions. Peaceful resolutions are often difficult, but are absolutely necessary to the building of a proper neutral encyclopedia; banning or otherwise restricting one user ends the dispute, yes, but is a less-than-ideal solution. An organization dedicated to dealing with problem users is just going to encourage the latter course of action.</p>
<p>People who are targeted as "problem users" who need to be "dealt with" are going to feel attacked and are going to respond in kind. The majority of cases are going to be followed by counter-cases, and if this organization wants to be seen as a fair aid to dispute resolution, rather than a bunch of goons for hire, it is going to have to accept these counter-cases.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_1_back"><a href="#fn_1" title="">1</a></sup></span></p>
<p>The other problem is that there is already a large, well-established, and respected organization dedicated to helping people through the dispute resolution process: the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssociation_of_Members%27_Advocates_d8b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Association of Members' Advocates">Wikipedia:Association of Members' Advocates</a>. If this "office" is to have a substantially different focus—dealing with problem users, rather than aiding anyone who asks in dispute resolution—then it should not exist, for reasons I hope I have explained above. If it is to do what the AMA does—simply help people with dispute resolution—then it will be a pointless duplication of effort. Either way, it should not exist.</p>
<p>I welcome explanations of how and why I'm wrong, of course. —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Charles</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;P.</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mirv_1dda.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mirv">&#160;<sup><small>(Mirv)</small></sup></a> 04:32, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><cite id="fn_1"><a href="#fn_1_back" title="">Note 1</a>:</cite> Here is a problem with the current setup (key parts <i><b>emphasized</b></i>):</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Out of concern for the existence of <b>this office being co-opted to mount harassing crusades against good users</b> . . . we reserve the right to decline any case <b>if we feel</b> it is not in the best interests of Wikipedia to pursue it.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Read this carefully. Digest its full implications. This office is equipped to deal with "problem users", but its actions, when taken against a "good user", could well be seen as a harassing crusade. "Well, okay,", you say, "but they're only going to deal with problem users, so this isn't so bad." But who decides who's a problem user and who's a good user? Why, this office reserves that decision to itself. How is it going to decide? Is it going to take evidence from each side, thus creating what would be, in effect, a self-appointed parallel arbcom that forwards cases that it's already decided to the community-selected real arbcom, just for the rubber stamp on the sentence? Or is it just going to use common sense and judgment (hoping that everyone will overlook the director's consistently controversial "common sense" and the open bigotry of the senior partner)?</p>
<p>So in effect, the organization's current rules could create an unaccountable clique of bullies; anyone who got on the bad side of any of its higher-ups would have to worry about being targeted by a "harassing crusade" and a probable arbcom case. I believe we've seen the first <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Everyking_2_c8d6.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Everyking 2">warning signs</a> of this already. —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Charles</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;P.</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mirv_1dda.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mirv">&#160;<sup><small>(Mirv)</small></sup></a> 06:17, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Without addressing specifics, I agree generally with a fair amount of what Mirv has to say here. While I wouldn't go so far as to say this organization should not exist, I think its origins will make it difficult for the group to be effective without polarizing the community. It would be better to start fresh, and I do agree that much of what this is about could be accomplished within the AMA context.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I appreciate that as part of the dispute resolution process, there is a need to have people who are willing to advocate for the Wikipedia community generally, in a quasi-prosecutorial role, rather than just assisting individual clients. I have done this myself on a few occasions. As a member of the AMA since its inception, I felt that this was within the scope of my work as an advocate, even if I didn't specifically identify myself as an AMA member as part of my efforts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Naturally, the AMA is not focused exclusively on handling cases on behalf of the community, but there is no reason it cannot include this element. I have been a little disappointed lately to see the AMA acquiring a reputation simply as defending individual users against charges of wrongdoing (although this aspect is still very important, and I admire and respect my AMA colleagues who have undertaken this work). I think it would be very appropriate, if people wish to represent community interests in the dispute resolution process, for them to join the AMA and organize their efforts within that framework. There is no need to be an outside counterweight, and this could help deal with the bad blood that has developed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A final piece of advice. In modern society, judges are not policemen. The Arbitration Committee has rightly determined that it will generally leave the implementation of its rulings up to administrators. Likewise, prosecutors are not policemen either, although they work more closely with them than judges do. When taking on a case, I think in most situations it would be best not to personally intervene in the matter with blocks, but to let your colleagues or other admins make that determination. Limit yourself to issuing warnings, then gather and present evidence for others to act on. When a prosecutor gets too involved in the enforcement end of things, the results can easily lead to legitimate concerns about entrapment. In that situation, you know exactly what you want to get the defendant in trouble for, so you set him up to do exactly that. This tends to destroy the credibility of the role. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 06:30, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Under what provision of Wikipedian guidelines or tradition does a group of users empower themselves to be a secret police? OK, not that secret? How about <i>Hitler Jugend</i>.

<p>Upon further advice that I think is well-taken, I've moved it to Association of Investigations. That said, I'm now irritated that it suggests the investigations comprise the members instead of the people volunteering. But I don't like Association of Investigators, because, well, I'm not an investigator. I'm a Wikipedian who's willing to look into disputes to see if there are signs of a real problem.

<li>"Association of Investigations" sounds awkward to me... like it's a group of investigations... Anyhow, I figure if we intend to counterpart the AMA, then a counterpartish name would work well... so "Association of Member Investigations"? <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size: 74%;">BLANKFAZE</b></a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size:90%;">(что</b><b style="font-size:70%;">??</b><b style="font-size:90%;">)</b></a> 23:18, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>If you drop the 's' it won't be an association of investigations any more.

<ul>
<li>Yeah, but I'm afraid dropping the 's' (thus making it "Association of/for Member Investigation") will give off the false impression that we are devoted to investigating members... i.e. some sort of <i>secret police</i> as has been suggested before. In actuality, we run investigations into <i>disputes</i> for members of the community. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size: 74%;">BLANKFAZE</b></a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size:90%;">(что</b><b style="font-size:70%;">??</b><b style="font-size:90%;">)</b></a> 23:45, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Just make it the Investigations Group of the AMA. <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar_association.html" title="Bar association">Bar associations</a>, the real-life analogue to the AMA (sorry, I'm adding another US-centric term to this discussion), have all kinds of specialty groups focused on different practice areas. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 23:47, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>A definite improvement, though still not ideal.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Completing the cleanup</span></h2>
<p>I voted "Delete" when the name was "District Attorney's Office". The renaming goes far to meet my objections, but I offer these additional suggestions, which I hope are consistent with the attitude reflected in the renaming:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finish fixing the text. The first paragraph still refers to "Office of Investigations", one of the interim names. There's at least one "OI" later on.</li>
<li>In a comment above, Blankfaze says, "It was created to as a resource for users who are having a conflict with another user but to whom the task of compiling an RfC or ArbCom case seems daunting." That explanation helps to make clear that this entity has no "official" status in the sense of being empowered to make any binding decisions, other than the decision about which cases its volunteer members will choose to work on. The quoted sentence or one very like it should appear in the first paragraph. It's better than saying that the entity "exists to look into these cases", which still has at least some connotation of official empowerment.</li>
<li>Maybe I'm going too far in overreaction to the now-abandoned DAO title, but it would also help to include something to emphasize that this is a voluntary association of members, that our opinions carry no special weight in the dispute resolution process, and that anyone who wants to proceed through the various dispute resolution phases without consulting us is completely free to do so.</li>
<li>One drawback of the new name is the potential for confusion with the AMA. It might help to include an explanation of the difference -- not in the former terms, about whether democracy is too conciliatory (the removal of that passage is an improvement), but a more matter-of-fact statement addressed to an unsophisticated member who has a problem with a user, wants help, and isn't sure whether s/he's supposed to ask the AMA or the AMI for it.</li>
<li>I don't understand the current second sentence: "Sometimes this is because the problem goes unnoticed by the people who can or will deal with the problem." Does "deal with the problem" mean that they're ones trying to edit an article and encountering the problem user, or does it refer to the ones trying to assemble the RfAr or whatever? Or perhaps it means those who "could or should" deal with the problem? They don't notice it early enough? Perhaps: "Sometimes this is because the only contributors who are aware of the problem are not well versed in Wikipedia's dispute resolution process, so the problem continues because it's not known to those who could and should deal with it."</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't share some of the strong reactions of "Delete" voters to the AMI's structure, its members' unwillingness to work through the AMA, etc. I'd be willing to see it operate as a separate entity if there's no implication of "DAO"-type status and if the existence of this page doesn't sow confusion. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 00:48, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Organizational changes</span></h3>
<p>For reasons I have explained <a href="#further_commentary" title="">above</a>, I have changed a few things in the organization.</p>
<ol>
<li>I changed Snowspinner's title from "Director" to "Founder". His contribution should be recognized, but unilaterally assuming supreme authority bumps up against the longstanding tradition that nobody owns Wikipedia pages.</li>
<li>With the position of Director gone, I eliminated the distinction between "Partner" and "Senior Partner". To restate my reasoning: Having one person and his handpicked cronies decide who is a "problem user" and who is a "good user" is absolutely unacceptable and makes this group no better than a gang of bullying thugs. See <a href="../../../g/r/o/Groupthink.html" title="Groupthink">groupthink</a>, <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/wiki.phtml?title=echo_chamber" class="extiw" title="disinfopedia:echo_chamber">Disinfopedia:echo chamber</a>, etc.</li>
<li>With the distinction between "Partner" and "Senior Partner" gone, I eliminated mention of vetos. Instead, I empowered any partner or partners to take on any case they please, with the caveat that it is still possible that no partner will find any merit in a case.</li>
<li>I noted that any partner who takes on a case should notify the subject of that case, to alleviate concerns of stalking, entrapment, secret police behavior, and so forth.</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe this removes the very worst aspects of an organization like this. The focus on forceful dispute resolution is still worrisome, but as someone pointed out in the VfD, it's better to keep this sort of thing public and transparent than to have it take place in secret. —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Charles</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;P.</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mirv_1dda.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mirv">&#160;<sup><small>(Mirv)</small></sup></a> 05:20, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

I'd still like to hear articulated why the two can't be housed under one roof. I gather that there may be some reluctance to do this, but so far the suggestions to merge into the AMA have simply been ignored, so I can't tell whether the idea is opposed, why it might be opposed, or who opposes it. With a lack of response from one side, it's impossible to even discuss the issue. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 06:44, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd refer you to Ambi's comments below: <i>We have the AMA to defend people before the ArbCom - a prosecutorial office is the natural counterpart to this, and I'm not the only arbitrator to be fully in support of this measure. Ambi 01:52, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</i> — The AMA is sort of like the public defenders of Wikipedia. A member comes to the AMA wishing assistance in defending themselves. The AMI, on the other hand, a member (theoretically) would come to the AMI with a complaint, and the AMI would look into it and then assist the user in compiling and submitting a complaint to one of the dispute resolution outlets, i.e. a prosecutor. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size: 74%;">BLANKFAZE</b></a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size:90%;">(что</b><b style="font-size:70%;">??</b><b style="font-size:90%;">)</b></a> 07:48, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The AMA does not exist solely for the purpose of defending people in arbitration; that's a skewed perspective created by recent arbitration cases that have included advocate participation. The AMA gets requests both from people who want assistance defending themselves, and also quite often from people complaining about the actions of others. As I mentioned above, I'm an original AMA member, and I've done in the past exactly what the AMI apparently plans to do. I didn't make a point of identifying myself that way, but that's because the role depends on community support, not membership in a particular association. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 08:04, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, perhaps the AMA is drifting away from its original function. Either way I think that there should be <i>some</i> organisation to do this sort of work, and I think it should <i>probably</i> be a separate entity. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size: 74%;">BLANKFAZE</b></a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size:90%;">(что</b><b style="font-size:70%;">??</b><b style="font-size:90%;">)</b></a> 08:08, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In what sense is the AMA drifting? I always assumed that it responded to the requests it received, so the composition of its work might change from month to month depending on what sort of requests happen to come in. Is it alleged that people with complaints hesitate to seek the AMA's help because it's perceived as "defense-oriented"? Can you elaborate on why there should be separate entities? The AMA is more like a bar association than a law firm, so there shouldn't be a problem even if, in a particular arbitration proceeding, one AMA member is helping the complainant while another represents the respondent. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 08:15, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
