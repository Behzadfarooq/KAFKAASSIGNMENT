<p>I'm posting this here in the hope that the AMA will reflect upon the criticisms I am about to delineate and make a sincere effort to address them. What I'm about to say is going to be harsh, but I am consciously making an effort not to single out any AMA member in particular; I do not wish for anyone to take these criticisms personally.</p>
<p>To put it plainly, I believe most arbitrators hold the AMA in very low regard, myself included. ("The AMA is worse than useless - they are an impediment" are the exact words I used to describe it on the arbcom's mailing list this week). I formed this opinion based on observation of previous advocacies. Admittedly, some of these happened a while ago (around 2005 or early 2006), and I remember few of the specifics. However, the general feeling I came away with was that AMA members were not interested in presenting a coherent arbitration case, and instead choose to grouse about the mechanics and rules of procedure used by the arbitration committee. Such advocacy was always dismissed out of hand as the pettifoggery it was, and in the process, I have acquired a particularly low opinion of the AMA.</p>
<p>In addition to that problem (which I consider absolutely paramount), there are several other problems I think should be explicitly noted. I, and many (most? all?) other arbitrators consider Phil Sandifer's guide to presenting an effective arbcom case (<a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_How_to_present_a_case_7c83.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/How to present a case">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/How to present a case</a>) to be the last word on the subject. (We <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/How_to_present_a_case&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/How_to_present_a_case&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">did assist him in writing it</a>, after all). In a recent private discussion, one arbitrator commented that that essay should be required reading for AMA advocates. However, based on <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssociation_of_Members%27_Advocates_Meeting_December_2006_5bed.html" title="Wikipedia:Association of Members' Advocates/Meeting/December 2006">Wikipedia:Association of Members' Advocates/Meeting/December 2006</a>, I have come to suspect that most AMA advocates do not have a basic understanding of how the arbitration process.</p>
<p>To quote Phil's essay - "There are two very important things to realize about the Arbitration Committee and its members: 1. They do not have much time, and 2. They care much more about product than process." And yet, as I read the AMA-ArbCom Co-Op proposal, (in the "Other Business?" section), it seems that the AMA is naively unaware of this fundemental precept of the arbcom - that we already have enough on our plate without having to coordinate and attend organized meetings with the AMA (not to mention the rather non-trivial matter of a complete lack of interest on the arbcom's part in doing it - owing to, as I previously mentioned, a very low opinion of the AMA).</p>
<p>The 'Advocees demanding wikilawyering' section describes people who want AMA members to <i>"make their (incorrect) point of view be accepted"</i>. My criticism on this point has to do with the section heading -- calling this practice wikilawyering is to misunderstand what wikilawyering is. Advocating or not advocating a client's wrong position is not wikilawyering; grousing about the process is. (See <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiLawyering_098e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiLawyering">Wikipedia:WikiLawyering</a> for a fairly good defintion of the term.) Being that the AMA has been previously criticized for wikilawyering, I would hope that its member would know what it is (and is not) when they see it.</p>
<p>Another problem I have with the AMA as I read this meeting report is an overemphasis on trivialities: two sections on elections, and one each on the AMA bot, IRC channel, membership roll, logo, and a hypothetical "bar" to pass to become a member (which, given my previous criticism of its members not understanding the arbitration process, I find rather galling). However, no where do I see anything relating to my primary criticism - which is that the AMA's advocacy is insubstantial. This seems to me to be putting the cart before the horse.</p>
<p>Finally, recently the arbcom was asked what status, if any, the AMA has in an arbitration case. The answer is that its advocates have no special status - that they are the same any other third party in an arbitration case. I hope my comments here have made the reasons for this evident. However, if the AMA were to puts its house in order, and start being an asset to the arbitration process rather than a liability, I think the arbitration committee might (emphasis - *might*) be willing to reconsider this, if it saw potential benefits to the option. However, as I said, this is predicated on the AMA reforming itself first. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 05:01, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If I may respond, most of these problems are due to the fact that in the past, many members of the AMA were causing havoc by bringing cases that were far too young in the <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a> process to MedCom and ArbCom. This, in turn, was mostly due to two things: 1) Advocates who did not have enough direction or practical experience and 2) the fact that the AMA was practically inactive and running "on its own" without any sort of supervision or direction. People were "signing up" with no communication between members and no idea of what to do, the request system was horrific, and the previous Coordinator had resigned months earlier with no acknowledgment from the Association. (This is the state I found it in when I joined.)</dd>

<dd>Recently, with many Advocate efforts, there has been a resurgence in membership, structure and zeal, and now the AMA is back on its feet. We've kept the same goal (helping disputes on Wikipedia) yet have a very different way of going about things, and as a result we have <i>already</i> relieved ArbCom of dozens of cases by reducing the escalation of conflicts. I'm not saying that it's perfect yet, but we're getting better and I agree with Addhoc in that if you believe we need more time, we'll take it. The AMA is not looking for any special sort of status within ArbCom. We are looking for a working relationship to help fix problems. If it came off as anything else, there was either a misunderstanding or a mistake on our part.</dd>

</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I also completely agree that we need to add more material to our required reading, and also believe that we are moving in the direction of having minimum membership requirements for the sake of experience. Are there any materials other than the one that you mentioned that would be of use to us?</dd>

<dd>As for "wikilayering," I was the one who chose to robe the request to discuss said topic in that term. We've gotten a large number of cases where the advocee was making demands on Advocates as if they were lawyers (talking of demands and rights with full courtroom melodrama). It seemed like an appropriate word to use at the time, and its definition is not written in stone. (In fact, it's part of a project that anyone can edit, and lexical drift happens&#160;;-) ).</dd>

As I'm able to reclaim a few more hours here and there for working on the AMA, I'll do what I can to ensure that they are addressed adequately.

<dd>Hi Raul654 and thanks for your comments. In my own, very limited, experience of advocating, cases that involved negotiation, mediation or admin input, were more successful than those which went to ArbCom. Regarding the ArbCom essay, I would suggest that it should not only be required reading for advocates, but also their advocees, if the case involves arbitration. Regarding the suggested coordination meeting, I would comment this idea came about through some recognition of the problems you mention. If the AMA has to reform first, then ok, at least that gives us the necessary impetus. Regarding the correct usage of wikilawyering, I would comment that in many cases, someone, for example, involved in external link spamming would hope that his/her advocate would be able to argue the true meaning of <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> was completely different to that intended by the community, so that by my understanding would be covered by the term. However, overall I broadly agree with your comments. My own assesment is the AMA currently does useful work for the community as part of the dispute resolution process in the phases prior to ArbCom. <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddhoc_21d7.html" title="User:Addhoc">Addhoc</a> 13:15, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While no AMA Advocate has ever effectively presented his client's case to us, I stand ready to accept a competent Advocate as "mouthpiece" for their user client. I am also prepared to ignore and poke fun at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikilawyering_a5b4.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikilawyering">Wikipedia:Wikilawyering</a>. What is needed for effective advocacy is to focus attention on the relevant (relevant in terms of Wikipedia policy} issues and evidence. I typically spend hours locating diffs which demonstrate user behavior. An effective advocate would be advancing relevant diffs in a usable form and making proposals on the /Workshop page which could actually be used in the decision. I stand ready to discuss matters with the Advocates at any time. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 19:04, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Spurred by Raul, I thought I would lay out what I see as the primary problems with AMA interaction in <a href="../../../a/r/b/WP%7EARBCOM_80fd.html" title="WP:ARBCOM">arbitration proceedings</a>. I may follow up with some solutions later, but would love to hear people's thoughts.</p>
<p><b>General statement</b> In the best possible world, an effective advocate could do a few things to assist parties considering or involved in arbitration proceedings.</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Counseling:</i> Many advocees don't have a good understanding of the advocacy process. Ideally, advocates can offer <i>timely</i> advice on (1) what the process is all about, (2) the nitty-gritty of presenting the case statement and evidence, and (3) possible strategic options.</li>
<li><i>Advocacy:</i> Ideally, an advocate could actually present evidence, offer proposals in the workshop, and try to direct the arbitration to an outcome favorable to their advocee.</li>
</ol>
<p>In practice, both of these goals are difficult, for reasons that include the following.</p>

<dd><i><b>Steve's thoughts:</b></i> (This is the best format that I could think of to organize my thoughts, so I hope it isn't disruptive). These two points are strong and, off the top of my head, I cannot think of any others that wouldn't fall into those two categories. <small><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Thadman_6354.html" title="User talk:The Thadman">אמר</a></small> <tt><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_c314.html" title="User:The Thadman"><font color="#0033CC">Steve Caruso</font></a></b></tt> <sub><b><font color="#000000">(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_Desk_b02b.html" title="User:The Thadman/Desk">desk</a>/<a href="../../../a/m/a/WP%7EAMA_ced1.html" title="WP:AMA">AMA</a>)</font></b></sub> 22:33, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Problem 1: Lack of advocate expertise</b> Arb Comm is a very distinct process, and there is no guarantee that the advocate any particular requestor gets will be good at handling that process, either in terms of expertise or advocacy style.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i><b>Steve's thoughts:</b></i> Now, is this where we should investigate minimum membership requirements for practicality's sake? <small><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Thadman_6354.html" title="User talk:The Thadman">אמר</a></small> <tt><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_c314.html" title="User:The Thadman"><font color="#0033CC">Steve Caruso</font></a></b></tt> <sub><b><font color="#000000">(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_Desk_b02b.html" title="User:The Thadman/Desk">desk</a>/<a href="../../../a/m/a/WP%7EAMA_ced1.html" title="WP:AMA">AMA</a>)</font></b></sub> 22:33, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Problem 2: Inconsistent advocacy styles</b> I've talked about this before, and it's to some degree inherent in a volunteer project, but our styles range from consensus-builders, like me, who will often advise their advocees to try to compromise, to advocates (you know who you are), who tend to be much more aggressive, sometimes even regardless of the merits of their advocee's position. Again, which kind of advocate you get is just luck of the draw.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i><b>Steve's thoughts:</b></i> Should we come up with a standard questionnaire or sequence of procedure to act as a guide or rule of thumb for all Advocates? <small><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Thadman_6354.html" title="User talk:The Thadman">אמר</a></small> <tt><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_c314.html" title="User:The Thadman"><font color="#0033CC">Steve Caruso</font></a></b></tt> <sub><b><font color="#000000">(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_Desk_b02b.html" title="User:The Thadman/Desk">desk</a>/<a href="../../../a/m/a/WP%7EAMA_ced1.html" title="WP:AMA">AMA</a>)</font></b></sub> 22:33, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Problem 3: Time</b> IMHO, this is the biggest problem. Martin can offer more accurate statistics, but my observation is that it's not unusual for requests for advocacy to take days or even weeks to get filled, and then many advocacies are still slow processes, with the advocate and advocacy trading messages once or twice a day. If the arbitration has already started, that's way too long -- what a party in arbitration really needs is a few hours of solid attention, probably on a combination of IM and Wikipedia, to plan strategy and gather evidence, and he or she needs it within the first few days.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i><b>Steve's thoughts:</b></i> This is an important issue, but is one that is not easily solved. Given the completely volunteer nature of the AMA, <i>in general</i> the "easier" or "interesting" cases are generally snapped up while the cases that require more effort are left for weeks at a time. I cannot see how an Arb case could be effective if there is no "one on one" time between Advocate and advocee. <small><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Thadman_6354.html" title="User talk:The Thadman">אמר</a></small> <tt><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_c314.html" title="User:The Thadman"><font color="#0033CC">Steve Caruso</font></a></b></tt> <sub><b><font color="#000000">(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_Desk_b02b.html" title="User:The Thadman/Desk">desk</a>/<a href="../../../a/m/a/WP%7EAMA_ced1.html" title="WP:AMA">AMA</a>)</font></b></sub> 22:33, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Problem 4 - Advocees</b> The last problem is that we don't get the easy cases. Editors with realistic expectations and strong cases (1) typically don't end up in front of Arb Comm at all and (2) typically don't ask for an advocate when they are there.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i><b>Steve's thoughts:</b></i> Agreed. Most of the cases that immediately want to go to ArbCom that I have seen have not even gone through 2 steps of <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a>. In short, the advocee who falls into the ArbCom category is <i>generally</i>, more times than not, ignorant of how the <i>system</i> works and we need to be more diligent in explaining it to them. <small><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Thadman_6354.html" title="User talk:The Thadman">אמר</a></small> <tt><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_c314.html" title="User:The Thadman"><font color="#0033CC">Steve Caruso</font></a></b></tt> <sub><b><font color="#000000">(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_Desk_b02b.html" title="User:The Thadman/Desk">desk</a>/<a href="../../../a/m/a/WP%7EAMA_ced1.html" title="WP:AMA">AMA</a>)</font></b></sub> 22:33, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Neigel, exactly what I thought&#160;;-). It's probably not a *big* problem if we get the ball rolling rather than waiting for antoher meeting. TheronJ - I agree with all of your points, and it may be helpful for advocates willing to take ArbCom cases to make themselves available on IM (or IRC - #AMA-Wikipedia is free to use, if someone's there to set it -m). Of course, having an ArbCom taskforce isn't instantly going to solve the problems, but it will help all of the AMA to monitor the cases going to ArbCom, and pick up hints from where we're going wrong, as well as making sure that all those involved know the system.Personally, I'm one of those who thinks advocates should stive for compromise, by way of informal mediation and advocacy, but other have different ways of doing things. As TheronJ notes, we only get the hard cases (at least, at ArbCom level), where we're called upon to assist someone already heading for an unfavourable ruling. Our other cases, for the most part, are fairly trivial, and we seem to get quite a few from new users, who just need a helping hand - this makes it a very steep learning curve indeed. Finally, you can see how long cases are listed for <a href="../../../a/m/a/WP%7EAMAREQBD_775b.html" title="WP:AMAREQBD">here</a>, by checking through the history.

<p>Assigning an advocate at random seems inappropriate. A user is better off with nothing. Assigning an advocate without time to represent his client is also inappropriate, at a minimum it would take ten hours or so just to become thoroughly familiar with most cases. Counseling is very important. If your client is in the wrong, they need to admit it and change their behavior, not just continue to edit war and complain; although there are exceptions, some folks can get away with more than others. They also need to not continue to do whatever nasty thing they are doing on the arbitration pages, personal attacks, etc. I suppose some knowledge of how current arbitrators are likely to vote would be useful as well as some insight into how and why past cases were decided they way they were. I suggest signing your posts to the arbitration case in this form: [your username], advocate for [your client's username]. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 19:51, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Usually, assigning an Advocate is not so random as whoever is currently not on a case or busy.&#160;:-) I do believe that the team structure may work better in that regard, but in the end it will be ultimately what reaches you guys. What do you believe would be the best way for us to better get to know the whole of the members of ArbCom? (Also, not meaning to be rude or disrespectful, our standard terminology is "advocee" rather than "client" as we've had problems with the whole courtroom motif in the past that we are, sometimes, still diligently trying to stamp out.&#160;:-) ) <small><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Thadman_6354.html" title="User talk:The Thadman">אמר</a></small> <tt><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_c314.html" title="User:The Thadman"><font color="#0033CC">Steve Caruso</font></a></b></tt> <sub><b><font color="#000000">(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_Desk_b02b.html" title="User:The Thadman/Desk">desk</a>/<a href="../../../a/m/a/WP%7EAMA_ced1.html" title="WP:AMA">AMA</a>)</font></b></sub> 22:40, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(Finally, it seems we have a meeting!)

<p>I have had two Advocates now. The first one did not answer any of my emails nor answer my posting, nor respond to my questions. I gave up and dropped out of the AMA program as my stated abjectives in my application were clearly not going to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>My case was reopened and I was notified by another AMA member that he was my Advocate. I requested that we be in contact only by email because of my high profile, being the focus of a heated Arbitration case. He agreed and told me to have a cup of tea while he looked into my case. He then publically solicited opinions about me from many users also in the Arbitration. Those people publically replied. I sent him at least five emails. He did not answer them. I posted several times on his page with no response. Going to his page, hoping to see a response, I saw he had removed my name from his list of cases and removed my posts. I went to my AMA page and saw that he had withdrawn from the case. He did not inform me of this, he never asked my opinion about anything nor given my any feedback. He still has not answered my emails. He did not even notify me he had withdrawn.</p>
<p>I recommend that AMA have a policy that Advocates contact their Advocees, especially that they answer the Advocee's emails. Neither of my former Advocates did. The greatest help and source of information I received in this latest AMA episode was some general information and advice by email from someone else's Advocate who saw my plight because of the public posting of my Advocate on other users pages using my name repeatedly in headings and edit summaries.</p>
<p>I truly thank this other Advocate for his words to me as he is a most kind and helpful person --- the sort of person that is an ideal Advocate, an Advocate that treats the Advocee as a human being.</p>
<p>From my two experiences with AMA, I would never recommend AMA for a person anxious and unsure of what to do, or one who truly needs help. The only Advocate that I would ever trust is the helpful one described above. For the record, the kind, wonderful AMA Advocate is <a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a>. You need many more humane Advocates like him.

<dl>
<dd>I think some very good points are brought up there. I don't think <i>anyone</i> should see h(im|er)self in a "lawyer" type of role here-a lawyer is generally required to represent his or her client pretty uncritically, and while advising the client, to follow the client's instructions even if it's ridiculous. That might work in a real courtroom, but here, it should be a more informal relationship. Speaking for myself, if my advocee is acting in a way that's going to end badly, I'm going to tell them so. If they want to persist, I can't <i>stop</i> them, but I'm not putting my name to it, even in an "on behalf of" type way. Hopefully, after getting advice not to touch the stove, ignoring it, and getting fingers burned, they'll learn to think a little more carefully before acting next time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As to ArbCom, the goal with ArbCom cases should be true of advocates or anyone else-<i>you do not want things to end up there in the first place</i>. Part of the job of any good advocate will be to steer his/her client away from behavior that will land a case in front of the ArbCom, and to help the member in resolving the dispute without getting to such a drastic point. I see no problem in encouraging the client to use other means of dispute resolution, as a third opinion, <i>article</i> RfC (NOT user RfC), or request for mediation is often a good way to prevent escalation of a problem to the point that people get in trouble over it.</dd>

<dd>Of course, sometimes people (whether the advocee, others involved, or all of the above) are genuinely recalcitrant and unwilling to abide by the way we do things here. In that case, after rational discourse, discussion with the problem editor(s) about the problems, and community input have all failed, a binding decision from the ArbCom may turn out to be the only realistic solution. <i>Everything</i> should be tried before escalation to this point, and I would hope the ArbCom would reject any case as premature in which there's any realistic hope of peaceful resolution. However, if it gets to that point, I think a comparison to attorneys is appropriate here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While a lawyer has a duty to represent his/her client with competence and skill, that is only a <i>part</i> of the overriding duty the attorney has as an officer of the court. A lawyer is required to defend the client against accusations of breaking the law, but if the lawyer <i>actively assists</i> in that client's crimes, the lawyer is culpable as well. Similarly, everyone here (be they an advocate, a mediator, an admin, or even a member of ArbCom) is <i>first and foremost</i> responsible to be a good member of Wikipedia. Any other responsibilities given to or taken on by that person are subordinate to and only valid so far as they further that important primary one. As that applies to advocates, while an advocate might defend an editor who has broken the rules before ArbCom, present evidence of provocation and mitigating factors, and assist in showing evidence against others involved, that advocate <i>must not</i> cross the line into breaking the rules or damaging the project under the pretense of "representing a client". I believe this would be an important thing for an advocate to remember at <i>any</i> stage of resolving a dispute-and any advocate who doesn't remember this would be worse then unhelpful, they would in fact be contributing to the problem. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 11:03, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What is missing in arbitration cases is skilled presentation of evidence and argument. Usually both parties think what they are doing is good for Wikipedia (and their cause) so its not like you are representing an axe murderer. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 14:02, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're right Fred. Specially on the evidence argument. I try to make my advocees understand that the best is good evidence rather than lots of it; but what kind of argument would you see? I was warned very long time ago (I think it was in my 2nd case) because of being too overlegalistic, but I'm sure you want something solid enough... --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> 15:00, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think of the workshop page as akin to the closing argument in a court case. It's where the evidence is digested to arrive a series of findings of fact that, if well-written and to the point, make the outcome almost obvious. in some cases, only the arbitrators make significant contributions to the workshop, for example <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Elvis_Workshop_9009.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Elvis/Workshop">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Elvis/Workshop</a>. In other cases the parties get deeply involved. Look at some workshop pages, and see which proposals ultimately make it into the final decisions, and generate useful commentary that helps the arbitrators analyze the cases. Much workshop participation by the parties is self-serving, argumetative or retaliatory, which is certainly not helpful to arriving at a favorable conclusion. Third parties, whether declared advocates or just interested editors, are welcome to offer and comment on workshop proposals. I think if you read a few cases you'll be able to get an idea of the kinds of proposals that end up being usable and the kinds of proposals that do not. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 16:26, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>p.s.: I think there may be a problem. trying to instill fear into the conciousness of advocates is a bad idea. Saying:
<dl>
<dd>" If the lawyer <i>actively assists</i> in that client's crimes, the lawyer is culpable as well. Similarly, everyone here (be they an advocate, a mediator, an admin, or even a member of ArbCom) is <i>first and foremost</i> responsible to be a good member of Wikipedia.”</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The reason I say that is because, I can just see someone saying. This advocate made a bad faith nomination for ARB com and should be punished. When, in fact, the advocee agreed and in your mind, the advocate, your gathered evidence showed a strong possibility of injustice that could only be resolve by ARBcom. I agree that:
<dl>
<dd>“Part of the job of any good advocate will be to steer his/her client away from behavior that will land a case in front of the ArbCom,”</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>But if the situation is the opposite, and you think the conduct of others towards your advocee was wrong, I believe, if ever this was to become a guideline for advocates, it could be used against them. In the sence where, why did you try bringing this ARBcom?</dd>
<dd>Hence, I do not totally agree with the statement that advocates must:
<dl>
<dd>“… that advocate <i>must not</i> cross the line into breaking the rules or damaging the project under the pretense of "representing a client".”</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Yes, in principal it makes sense, but up to what level is damaging a project and violating rules? Is calling an RfC or going to Arbcom a violation of rules, as some of use would try to allude?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, if an advocate wishes to use professional advocacy techniques used by lawyers I personally see no problem with that. Perhaps, we should even have a moral spleen rule for advocates. In the Cplot case for example I was privileged to information showing the IP address from personal emails. Up to what point should I have released this information. Prior to going to RfC, during Arbcom, during the sockpuppet Check user test? Surely, even though I have clearly voiced an opinion that my advocee should stop sockpuppeting, as a lawyer or advocate I would not want damaging evidence to be released until the main issue is resolved. (In that case, it was the issue of being unfairly blocked even prior to doing sockpuppetteering.) Again, I believe that threatening advocates that they may be breaking wiki rules is a good thing if we want to avoid more Arbcom’s but I might not be a good thing for everything. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> (<a href="../../../c/y/c/User_talk%7ECyclePat_0aec.html" title="User talk:CyclePat">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CyclePat_7ba6.html" title="Special:Contributions/CyclePat">contribs</a>) 18:49, 25 January 2007 (UTC).</small>
<dl>
<dd>Good points made, I think. (I was just throwing ideas around of course, but from the negative reactions that ArbCom's seemed to have in terms of previous advocates, it would certainly seem that there should be some kind of changes.) I wasn't trying to say that an advocate should <i>never</i> take a page out of a lawyer's book, either-many of the ethics rules that apply to attorneys would also apply very well to advocates, for example. I think the roles are similar in many ways-going to court, to your average citizen, is a complex, confusing thing, with laws and internal rules and all sorts of thing that the person going in has never even heard of. The lawyer, however, knows how those things work, and can explain that to the client and give good advice based on that knowledge. I think we should be looking to do much the same-Wikipedia can be complex and confusing at first, it certainly was at first to me!</dd>
<dd>I also think you may've misunderstood about "if a case goes before ArbCom"-I acknowledged that sometimes, people are genuinely recalcitrant and just won't quit causing disruption, and ArbCom really is the only thing that's going to solve the problem. (If that weren't the case, we wouldn't need ArbCom in the first place!) If that happens, it happens-the blame still ultimately lies with the person(s) who made the choice to misbehave and keep misbehaving. However, in the majority of disputes I've seen, things can be settled peacefully before such drastic measures are necessary, and it should certainly be our goal to do that if it is indeed possible. <i>No one</i> in their right mind wants to end up before ArbCom, advocate or otherwise.</dd>
<dd>As to the IP address, it's not entirely to me to answer when you'd be <i>expected</i> to reveal that, of course, but as to when you <i>should</i> have revealed it, my answer would be never. This is not some case where someone's life is in danger or the like, and I can't think of very much that would happen on Wikipedia that would justify revealing someone's sensitive personal information that was given in confidence. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 21:28, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi everyone. I've (pending discussion) closed down the meetings system in the AMA. All of the pages are still there - the old main meeting pages all being redirects to the main AMA page now, with the details in the history. This is less than ideal, so anyone with a better idea to arthive the pages, please do it. In any case, we need to discuss this - based on community criticism of the AMA, I'm trying to reduce bureaucracy qucikly. I suspect that discussions can take place as and when they arise on this page (or the co-ordinators' noticeboard), without the need to wait until the next meeting (a system I find overly clumsy). If you disagree with what I've done, please don't revert just yet - discuss first!

<p>There seems to be a community perception that the AMA is doing more harm than good. Here are some ideas on what we could do to improve things.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Reduce bureaucracy:</b> A high bureaucracy/results ratio has been the doom of several recent wikiprojects. I don't think that the bureaucracy is choking AMA yet, but we probably should think about what works and what doesn't.</li>
<li><b>Track and publicize successes:</b> I know that advocees often rate their successes. Maybe if we had a page showing some statistics (average wait; percentage of advocacies where advocee filled out survey; average survey results; etc.) by month, we and the community could get a better idea whether we were doing any good.</li>
<li><b>Better result tracking:</b> I would personally like a system where the <i>advocate</i> also rates the outcome of the advocacy, as does a coordinator or the community. I'm not sure what to track yet, but I think the advocate often has an idea what happened (i.e., the advocacy "failed", "partially succeeded", or "succeeded", and, in each case, why).</li>
<li><b>Better advocate training and management:</b> This involves <i>more</i> bureaucracy, but we currently don't have a system in place to evaluate advocates prior to joining, train them after joining, or to evaluate how they're doing after tim.</li>
</ol>

<li><b>Better communication with Advocees.</b> My case has been "under investigation" now for a few months, and my newest Advocate told me to stop bothering him, that he would contact me.

<dd>A long time ago, I planned to run for AMA Coordinator (when there were no deputies), but I never talked about because more important things were to solve first. My "project" was to have a Coordination composed by a Coordinator, Vice-Coordinator and a Deputy and the rest of advocates distributed in teams leaded by consensus. Plus, meetings as the most important way to discuss issues. Coordination would have to coordinate this descentralized AMA; evaluation would be have done by the teams. Those were my past ideas. --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> 12:09, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't think it's the structure and bureaucracy that's the problem. The history of AMA in arbitration cases is poor, and some of the advocates see their job as uncritically supporting the user not helping the user to learn why what they do is a problem. This is a function at least in part of the name: advocate implies Wikilawyering. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 08:29, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Guy, I'm tired of telling arbitrators the same: Instead of talking, why not do the following?

And then, maybe with all of us. Arbs must understand that AMA passed from being a mere "name" (The former "Office of Member's Advocates" or OMA) to a growing-up collaborative association that seeks to be a stable part on the Disputes Resolution System! Honestly, you'll have to deal with more and more advocates and a solution will have to be given...

<dd>(In re Guy) The whole point of an advocate (okay, IMO) is to provide assistance to a regular member, particularly with navigating the sometimes complicated, unclear, and underavailable DR process, but IMO especially where they face an uphill climb versus an administrator bringing an action or up against the pro-admin tendency of the ArbCom. It is not to play parent or admonisher, but to support the member, aid them through the process, and aid with presenting their side of the matter. Otherwise, we may as well just dissolve into <a href="../../../a/d/o/WP%7EADOPT_c4e7.html" title="WP:ADOPT">WP:ADOPT</a> or something. Bottom line is, WADR, I really don't think ArbCom is the best group for determining what sort of help a member needs when there's a case brought against them. The goal of advocacy is not to set the user straight, but to help them acheive a good outcome from the DR process.</dd>
<dd>Like it or not, ArbCom proceedings in particular, with all the deliberations, accusations, questioning, demand for evidence in particular formats, and etcetera trappings, are an awful lot like judicial proceedings. The only thing that tends to be lacking -- because the ArbCom vilifies it with the pejoratively-used term "wikilawyering" -- are arguments of merit on policy, or about misconstruction of statements or actions, whether actions are within policies and guidelines or warranted by circumstances... etc., etc. But unfortunately, ArbCom proceedings are not about whether the accused was right, or justified; they are about who the ArbCom likes more. A little <a href="../../../r/u/l/Rule_of_law.html" title="Rule of law">rule of law</a> would be a Very Good Thing. Alas.</dd>

<dd>I also joined the AMA because I saw how sometimes a part of a dispute would have to face an uphill battle, where they eventually just quit Wikipedia, tired of the disputes of this place. Indeed it is not fun to go to war alone. I feel that most of the people I've been helping have been very grateful for my assistance. I did not want to advocate people to win cases. My so far only ArbCom case as an advocate was lost miserably, yet I believe that I at provided useful assistance to the part who needed it, and that was what I hoped to do.</dd>
<dd>I haven't taking on any case since then. I probably spent 20+ hours just on that case, and I don't have that much time any longer to fight for something that is just trivial and unimportant and could be solved in 20 minutes if the parties had assumed some good faith. Eventually my advocee was banned from editing the article in question (perhaps rightly so), and that's the last I've heard from him. Was the whole thing rewarding for me? I have to admit that I often felt that I was working against both the advocee, the ArbCom, and the other part. I didn't feel there was any guideline on how I should act as an advocate in an ArbCom case. I've realized that it is much more difficult than I thought to be an advocate. You get an advocee who tells you "see the talk page -- User:X is just rude all the time" , and you find yourself wading through 300 Kb of talk pages. And when you (after several hours) miss something out, your advocee tells you that you are not a good advocate.</dd>
<dd>Guy: I try to inform my clients about how they possibly breach policies. Yet I absolutely don't want to take on a role of being the one who "sets him straight". That's certainly not what an advocate is for! Isn't that what ADOPT, RFC and the AN are for? As an advocate I take pride in being of assistance to the advocee first and foremost. "An <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advocate.html" title="Advocate">advocate</a> is one who speaks on behalf of another". (albeit it goes wihtout saying that advocate should inform his advoceee if this behaviour will lead him to difficulties)</dd>
<dd>I agree with Theron that it might be benefitial to keep a better record on what the AMA is good at, and what it might not be good at.</dd>
<dd>Theron, Nr #2: None of my advocees filled out the survey. In one case, my advocee was blatantly wrong in his beliefs (in regards to our policies) and after I informed him about that, I never heard from him again. Other advocees have been "red link" usernames who were never that active. And sometimes the advocee just wants you to help him out, and doesn't regard your relationship as finished at any given moment.</dd>
<dd>Theron, Nr #3: I think it would be useful to facilitate better communication between advocates (is this done or IRC? I never go there). I also think it would be very useful to be able to read other advocates experiences of cases.</dd>
<dd>I am sorry that this post got so long. I just wrote down all my thought. I hope you found some part of it useful.</dd>

<dd>Arbitrators must understand that we're necessary because of the systems characteristic's. And also understand we just don't only work on ArbCom cases, there are also advocates doing their jobs in MedCom and we <b>never</b> received a complaint from there... Even more: MedCab asked us for advice and co-op when it was created. If mediators have thanked us our job, why arbitrators just don't like to accept that we work in arbitration cases?</dd>
<dd>You talk about wikilawyering... When we accept a case we do it because we believe what the advocee asks is right and fair; yes, we're humans and we can end defending a reiterative POV-pusher by mistake... to know what cases to choose and which not is a matter of experience and trial. My first cases were dissastrous, but I honestly think my last one was very good and that I helped ArbCom to not include a user into a dispute that he clearly wasn't part of. I do believe we can do good work and that we don't are useless...</dd>
<dd>We believe in defending people; because people must have a way to understand our complex arbitration system and feel they are not alone.</dd>
<dd>To understand eachother and avoid these discussions, we must start to cooperate. --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> 09:45, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Advocates aren't necessary, (IMHO, the Help Desk could take over about 85% of the advocates' function) and I suspect that in arbitrations, they're usually not even helpful. Hopefully, they're helpful in other circumstances. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 13:39, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have a "theory" and it's this: since the introduction of "Workshop" in arbitrations, parties had to enter more directly into the dispute. This implies to use proposals, comments an everything to push their vision and guard themselves from a punishment. And, of course, advocates accepting arb-cases must enter that game... I have advocated in arb-cases twice before "Workshop" existed (that time I was more in mediation and negotiation cases) and I honestly think it was much better for all of us and surely for arbitrators too: the parties had only to write a statement, present evidence and had the chance to comment the others evidence... discussions were on respective talk pages and were not considered in the arbitration case. It was lighter, better and also much quicker; we advocates did just evidence-backup with more evidence or clarifying the advocee's and contacted arbs when necessary. "Workshop", instead, was and keeps being a bad idea, at least at how it stands now: dispute are driven into the arbitration... and advocates must enter the dispute... and then it's very easy to be an obstacle. I would really appreciate to reform or to vanish Workshop. --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> 19:08, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Speaking as a multiple victim of AMA, I would like to encourge AMA to stay out of Arbitration. The last arbitration, Starwood Mediation, was rendered useless by the Advocate. The Advocate got the last remaining sockpuppet off the hook by (probably) advising him not to edit since January 15, therefore avoiding his being banned. Thus, although all the other sockpuppets are banned, the one that had an Advocate remains loose and undoubtedly will crop up in the future to cause future trouble (having had multiple sockpuppets/meatpuppets for over a year). The Advocate was just too much trouble for the Arbitrators to bother with, considering all the Starwood complications, so no one dealt with it. In this case, the Advocate, in my opinion, has done disservice to the Wikipedia community and the well-meaning people involved. My Advocate never did get involved in the Arbitration as he had the good sense (I hope that was the reason, rather than just forgetting about me) to realise that an outsider who had not experienced the abuse of the Starwood sockpuppets/meatpuppets for six months could not jump in without doing damage.

I suppose that is good, although he has not edited on Wikipedia since January 15, claiming to have "left" Wikipedia, in the middle of a Suspected Sockpuppet investigation of him and Frater Xyzzy, after which Frater Xyzzy did get blocked/banned. There was a huge fracas over Jefferson Anderson's trying to delete his talk page -- but I believe it was protected from deletion as "evidence" if he ever does come back and is detected. So, I guess that is a success. After all the sockpuppets were stopped, and Jefferson Anderson was gone, there was not much to arbitrate as that stopped the stalking etc. So, nothing got settles and everyone wasted their time.

<dd>First, before I say anything else, I am speaking <i>for myself</i> and I am not saying anything in any official manner with my position as the Coordinator of the AMA; I am leaving my position aside for a moment and speaking as an individual. With that out of the way, I must say Matisse, that overall you have not lent yourself to be helpful with the Starwood case, your Advocate, or anyone else within the AMA that you have interacted with. On the contrary, nearly <i>every person</i> who has touched your case has become almost immediately frustrated with your approach, attitude and demands. In repeatedly emailing me with things such as "Every day is agony" and various descriptions of how Wikipedia is ruining your life (which I, personally, find difficult to understand) I must admit that I, as a human being, have become nothing more than flustered at times, especially when my requests (which were for your sake) to calm down, take a step back and relax were staunchly ignored, along with my suggestions for reasonable plans of action that had reasonable chances of dealing with some of these issues. Volunteers only have so much zeal.&#160;:-) Now, speaking as the Coordinator I can tell you that we did what we could at the time you were having these problems given our resources at the time. We're currently in the middle of trying our best to improve our resources and abilities, so I find your discouraging comments only a reason for us to try harder to attain these goals. <small><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Thadman_6354.html" title="User talk:The Thadman">אמר</a></small> <tt><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_c314.html" title="User:The Thadman"><font color="#0033CC">Steve Caruso</font></a></b></tt> <sub><b><font color="#000000">(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_Desk_b02b.html" title="User:The Thadman/Desk">desk</a>/<a href="../../../a/m/a/WP%7EAMA_ced1.html" title="WP:AMA">AMA</a>)</font></b></sub> • <b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_Give_Back_Our_Membership_2940.html" title="User:The Thadman/Give Back Our Membership"><font color="#CC0000">Give Back Our Membership!</font></a></b> 04:17, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Steve</b>, I read your comment above: "I must say Matisse, that overall you have not lent yourself to be helpful with the Starwood case, your Advocate, or anyone else within the AMA that you have interacted with. On the contrary, nearly every person who has touched your case has become almost immediately frustrated with your approach, attitude and demands."</li>
</ul>
<p>Since this is the only feedback I have received in four months from AMA except "sit back and have a cup of tea", I must assume that my case "under investigation" is a farce. Hopefully AMA will be gone shortly and that will take care of my case "under investigation". I did not ask you to step in and "investigate." Why did you if I am such an awful person? Further, I reiterate that I did very well in the RFC/Mattisse and the Starwood Arbitration largely because other editors stood up for me and helped me out in many other ways.</p>
<p>I asked all my Advocates several times to give me feedback about my behavior and how it might be contributing to my problems. In fact, I believe that was in my original request also. None of them did, except you on this talk page now. Why did they not give me the feedback that I requested and why did you not give me the feedback before that which you gave me above. If my first or second or third advocate had honored my request and told me that my "approach, attitude and demands" were in need of change, that would have been helpful. Instead, no one explained anything. There was not the honesty I requested or expected.

<dd>Maybe tied up with the Inexperience aspect, apparent misunderstanding/misrepresentation of function with people believing this organisation can rule on issues. Apparent non-neutrality of advocates who end up just inserting themselves into the dispute rather than providing advice to the individual seeking help (assuming this isn't supposed to be rent a goon).

<dd>The project always seems to drift towards lawyering. Considering that "<i>advocacy may require directly involving oneself in the article involved in a dispute</i>", this doesn't seem surprising.

<dd>I'd generally tend to agree there. I've tried (generally successfully, so far) to stay out of personally getting involved in disputes, and try to play an advisory role instead. I can also certainly see the issue with "But the advocate said to do that!"-although one hopes that encouraging a new user to engage in disruptive behavior would, ultimately, be seen as more disruptive then the behavior itself. I think, in a lot of ways, it could probably be a lot looser, call for a lot less <i>personal</i> involvement of advocates in a dispute, and instead focus on an advisory role, and doing something people should be doing anyway-helping new users get accustomed, giving them a hand with translating the multitude of policy and guideline acronyms, learning to communicate effectively with other editors, and warning them when something they're thinking of doing is a Very Bad Idea(tm). <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a></sup></small> 18:39, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Take cases as a group, and excercise judgment as a group in the kinds of cases we take and the kind of help we give, rather than making such matters individual decisions.

I think one person could actually do all of that in 4 hours. But why bust our brains? I further propose that the meeting be held in a similar fashion as our anual meetings!

<p>(Withdrawn. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AAssociation_of_Members%27_Advocates&amp;diff=120196932&amp;oldid=120158873" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AAssociation_of_Members%27_Advocates&amp;diff=120196932&amp;oldid=120158873" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>)</p>
<p>Now that the MfD is gone (for now), I'll now describe my AMA Reform Proposal.</p>
<p><b>This proposal in a nutshell</b>: Association of Members' Advocates conceptual reform into a "<a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal.html" title="Federal">federal</a>" system based on autonomous teams.</p>
<p><b>Proposal in depth</b>: The idea is to descentralize, clean up and crop the AMA but also to create a flexible structure capable to support a potential growth in the number of advocates and cases. I think "lighter troops move quicker than a heavy one", so a team politic should be applied inmediately. Teams would have to organize themselves (however they like) and manage requests by themselves; direct consequences of this would be: faster request answering, more accurate service, and no more backlogs at a "central" request system. Teams should principally be based on "specialities" (Arbitrations, mediations, COI, NPOV or also, teams on controversial topics that recurrently fall into disputes like <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">Creationism</a>, etc.) and no matter of there are two teams about the same topic.</p>
<p>The direct consequence is the abolishing of AMA Deputies and AMA Interim Teams Coordination. Deputies mantainance duties will be executed directly by teams and these will be able to decide to elect a Team Deputy. But, if a team decide to have one, it will be the team's responsability and the team's bureacracy, not AMA's. (So, any MfD or concern about bureaucracy should be done against a part of the system, and not affecting the whole).</p>
<p>Advocates will <b>have to be in a team</b>, but free to join all the teams (s)he wants to. This is a point some have already presented their concerns on my user talk page. The main reason is that all agree in descentralize, but descentralizing must be a total reform, not partial. The current situation describes what happens when you have an attempt descentralized system (current AMAT program) combined with a centralized system: only one team and no interest on switching to AMAT. I highly recommend to keep only one system, not two in parallel, and think we should adopt a descentralized one.</p>
<p>AMA Coordination will be in charge of one coordinator and maybe a vice-coordinator, but no more than two: as teams begin to work, coordination's task will be reduced into:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>The "Miscellaneous" request system</b>: The request system will be categorized according to the teams, but advocees that believe no team's profile fits into their case will have to put it in that category. AMA Coordination will have to derivate those requests to a team (if possible) or assign it to an advocate, after no advocate has taken it for a reasonable time (say a week).</li>
<li><b>Teams Coordination &amp; System mantainance</b>: Administrate. This means, to keep an eye into teams that grow to big and split them down, merge teams too small and too related, moderate the meetings... I.e.: to mantain this federation. This means, to not let the system be reduced into a team's monopoly, but also to avoid AMA's atomization. Related to this, Coordination will be the official "negotiator" with MedCom and ArbCom.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Implementation Schedule</b>: Obviously, this cannot be applied as fast as I would like. We need a program to follow. Proposed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Consensus building on this reform. (Obvious)</li>
<li>Consensus decision on setting Steve's (titular Coord.), CyclePat's (Team's Coord.) and Deputies' ends of term to Dec 2007 or the accomplishment of some stages of this schedule, whatever happens first. This is to ensure we don't fall into an anarchy during the process.</li>
<li>Putting all advocates into a team. The most difficult step: Currently, we have the Arb-Team. We'll create a "Buffer" Team with all those people not belonging to any team. From there, advocates will have to begin to create groups. During the existence of "Buffer" Team, any new AMA member should have to decide: 1) to join "Buffer" 2) to join any other team created...</li>
<li>When having a reasonable amount (and diversity) of teams, all advocates reamining in "Buffer" will be expulsed from AMA for considering them to be inactive.</li>
<li>Descentralizing request system. This can be done parallelwise to the first teams creation.</li>
<li>Testing period. After a reasonable amount of time, discussion must be held to define if AMA will follow this new descentralized model or should return to the old system.</li>
<li>If advocates support, AMA will definitely make the step from "Unstable" into "Stable Release" (Open-Source users will understand me well). Resign of all AMA Coordinators and election of one/two Coordinators (or maybe, we want to reelect Steve and one of the former Deputies... that would alright too).</li>

<dd>I don't see how this does anything to stop the Association of Member Advocates from Wikilawering and making the weaker argument the stronger.

<p>It should help this way: teams will be a way to give advice and also learn from all advocates' experiences. Yes, this assumes we haven't learned any experience in the past. I agree that this "system-change" won't automatically select what advocees are trollers or not. For that, I would like to see AMA Guide to Advocacy improved... But I wanted to start with the structure problem; does anyone could help with the other <b>big</b> problem we also have? --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> | <sub><a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssociation_of_Members%27_Advocates_Teams_Arbitration_Team_4039.html" title="Wikipedia:Association of Members' Advocates/Teams/Arbitration Team">help with arbs?</a></sub> 13:26, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Less structure, less legislation. People in AMA should be reviewing requests and helping drive them through the necessary steps to resolution, not fine-tuning administrivia and voting everyone into a deputy position. Please, lets get rid of the deputies and the formalities. Improve the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_Advocacy_4ab0.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to Advocacy">guide</a>, merge the <a href="../../../a/m/a/Wikipedia%7EAMA_Handbook_1a71.html" title="Wikipedia:AMA Handbook">handbook</a> into it, and shorten it.

<p>I don't see how this reduces the role of AMA as a sock puppet enabling service. Sincerely --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a> 16:23, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>First to resposond ot Mattisse, we are not a sockpuppet enabling service and I'm slight miffed at the lable (to me it boarders on <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>, please take more care as you could offend people and additionally I drop cases that are filed by sockpuppets).</p>
<p>Second to respond to Neigel the "teams" idea <i>might</i> be a good one but requiring team member ship is overally burecratic (and agaist Wiki policy). That could very easily cuase us to be MfDed again, (and with that kind system in place any who did nom us would have a VERY valid reason to have us nuked).</p>
<p>Now to respoond to Keith, I was about to prepose that the deputies resign and the possions be done away with by the end of next week (sooner if a strong consonsenus is reached). And that the Co-ordinators job be to assist other advocates and step in when an advocate has issues with his/her "case" and to investigate any wrong doing by an advocate if there is any. Really that is all the Co-ordinator needs to do. The merging of the Handbook and Guide is a GREAT idea and should be done soon. Less formalites and more focus on helping wikipedians in resolving issues at the <b>lowest</b> possible level is the best way to go.</p>
<p>I would reocend that the request system stay in place and the AMA alert system remain (so we cna be notifed of pending "cases") but pages like meeting page and maybe the co-ordinators desk be MfDed (We have the talk page on the AMA main page to use if ewe need to generate consuses otehrwise it is really not needed and if we do drop the depuies and lessen the job of the co-ordinator then the desk is not needed either).\</p>
<p>as for "term Limits" that in its self can also be cited as burecratic. I propose that the AMA co-orinator remin until he or she resigns which is simple and to the point since with my proposal the Job would be no big deal and really all he or she woudl be is a custodian (for lack of a better word) of the AMA. And either get a new coordinator by way to Consunses or someone volenteers to fill the job. That way we are not voting and we don't have a burecratic process. <a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeon1006_ee0d.html" title="User:Aeon1006"><font color="SteelBlue">Æon</font></a> <font color="red"><sup><a href="../../../a/e/o/User_talk%7EAeon1006_32f8.html" title="User talk:Aeon1006">Insanity Now!</a></sup></font> <font color="green"><sub><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_Give_Back_Our_Membership_2940.html" title="User:The Thadman/Give Back Our Membership">Give Back Our Membership!</a></sub></font> 17:58, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hmmm... OK, I withdraw my proposal: Aeon, you're right: it maybe against Wiki-policy... and maybe to have a "non-team structure" together with "team structure" could work.

<dd>We've been in this situation ever since the second coordinator election. In fact, as I recall, that election itself took forever to hammer out. And then things on that end went idle until a new crop of people flew in and did more of the same. Now... if "tidying up" is a euphemism for "stop speaking for other members who want you to help speak for them in difficult situations", then, I guess it's gonna be a long summer.

<dd>I think he I see what Kim Bruning is saying if you look at what we are doing now as to how we did htings in the past we HAVE become more burecratic. Getting rid of the Deputies, possily doing away with the teams, distilling down the co-ordinator's job discription and MfDing a few pages that have no real value for the AMA and merging the handbooks and guide to advocay will be a fairly large step in the process and really should be done first. As for the Advocacy is bad that is rather general and in order to fix it we would need clear examples. <a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeon1006_ee0d.html" title="User:Aeon1006"><font color="SteelBlue">Æon</font></a> <font color="red"><sup><a href="../../../a/e/o/User_talk%7EAeon1006_32f8.html" title="User talk:Aeon1006">Insanity Now!</a></sup></font> <font color="green"><sub><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_Give_Back_Our_Membership_2940.html" title="User:The Thadman/Give Back Our Membership">Give Back Our Membership!</a></sub></font> 20:33, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Work out clearly what this initiative is to achieve in terms of <b>purpose</b>, <b>product</b> and <b>outcome</b>. Consider this question - is the existence of a formal association necessary for these three points? If so, what elements are essential to this? This leads on to the next step:</li>
<li>Analyse existing processes (both in service delivery and administration), and apply <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occam%27s_razor.html" title="Occam's razor">Occam's razor</a> to each of them: determine the simplest and most time-effective method that each step of the AMA system could be accomplished by. Even better, work out whether you can actually get rid of any steps entirely. A simplified framework will not only render the charges of pointless bureaucracy advanced by some people completely null and void, but also make the process of quality control far simpler - the denser the "paperwork", the more opaque its content.</li>
<li>Determine what <b>attitude</b> the AMA, as a whole "brand image" if you will, is intending to put across. Is it to secure rights for users involved in disputes, or is it to advise them? My view is there is a dichotomy here, as the securing of rights is not always reconcilable with acting a method of advise. Personally, I feel that the latter is the AMA's strength, and most of the cases where people have accused the AMA of malpractice are instances where the advocate has concentrated on the former element.</li>
<li>I might suggest that <i>unbiased representation and provision of expertise on behalf of a requesting user</i> would be far more effective as a stratagem than a commitment to due process, justice, etc., all of which are largely trappings of the legal world.</li>

<dd>I'm not sure what the conspiracy theories are for. At the time, it looked quite certain that the MfD was going to result in disbanding. (If ^demon would've been a little quicker in typing, it would have, it was <i>that</i> close). And yes, it is something I hacked together <i>very</i> quickly, so that those who still needed help wouldn't be left hanging, and yet wouldn't be seen as an attempt to circumvent the disbanding. I made no secret of that either, I said that at AN, I said that at VP, I said that in the MfD. However, given that this did <i>not</i> occur, I see nothing wrong with the two working together.

<dd>As a member of both organisations, I can say that I would not have joined <a href="../../../a/s/s/WP%7EASSIST_3f8e.html" title="WP:ASSIST">WP:ASSIST</a> if I felt there were any "political machinations" involved. Halfway through the MfD, it looked like the AMA was going under. A replacement was needed, so some editors worked very hard to get <a href="../../../a/s/s/WP%7EASSIST_3f8e.html" title="WP:ASSIST">WP:ASSIST</a> on its feet. But I believe that the eventual outcome is the best possible thing for all parties. The co-existence of the two organisations will force both to improve their working methods, and will hopefully save AMA from the threat of a second MfD. I intend to continue working with both organisations, and hope that both will survive in the long term. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89"><font color="purple"><b>Wal</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/a/l/User_talk%7EWalton_monarchist89_7ca3.html" title="User talk:Walton monarchist89"><font color="silver"><b>ton</b></font></a> <small><sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/WP%7EBRoy_e296.html" title="WP:BRoy"><font color="purple">Vivat Regina!</font></a></sup></small></font> 12:36, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not sure where to post this. I'd like to discuss the MfD at whole. As I see it, the community declared that they do not want advocates. Advocates are per definition speaking on behalf of someone else, without regards to the advocess guilt or inocense. Apparently neither the community nor the ArbCom think that this is benefitial for Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Suppose that the AMA reforms in such a way that those who are so called sockpuppeteers and vandals (as pre-determined by the community) no longer will get help by the AMA, then what kind of advocates are we, and who are we going to be advocates of? Maybe rename the AMA to the <i>Association of Selective Member Advocates</i>?</p>
<p>Seriously, I don't see what the purpose is of the AMA if they are not appreciated by the community as advocates. I would really appreciate feedback on this issue.</p>
<p>I can envision that a workable use for the AMA is to have advocates <i>appointed by the ArbCom</i> in ArbCom cases and that other functions of the AMA could be superseded by <a href="../../../a/s/s/WP%7EASSIST_3f8e.html" title="WP:ASSIST">WP:ASSIST</a> or the help desk. That would be one way to go. (IMHO the AMA must first and foremost strive to meet a need of the community, or it will soon have to cease to exist. Other issues that are being discussed here, such as b'cracy, the coordinator's role, the structure and hierarchy of the AMA, and the experience and competence of the advocates are all secondary. Personally I think that Steve has been an excellent coordinator, and that the structure of the AMA is formidable. )</p>

<dd>Hm... AMA has always been "selective". I select the advocee I want to help. The problem are we, advocates, not requesters. There always be sockpuppeteers around; they're always around <i>everywhere</i> trying to get a little advantage. I think we must bind ourselves to a reasonable self-policy/self-compromise of not accepting cases that seem suspicious. Teams could help to reduce this problem as, if a certain team members makes a wrong decision, the others could talk with this advocate and see what's happening.</dd>
<dd>ArbCom appointing for arbitration cases could be a good idea, but considering the current unfriendly relationship we have with them, I doubt they would collaborate.</dd>
<dd>AMA role in community is to give help to users in our complex "judicial" system. That's our mission. What help? Support (when <i>legitime</i>) and advice. If AMA gets deleted, then WP:ASSIST would also, as this later wants to take the half of AMA's role... --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> | <sub><a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssociation_of_Members%27_Advocates_Teams_Arbitration_Team_4039.html" title="Wikipedia:Association of Members' Advocates/Teams/Arbitration Team">help with arbs?</a></sub> 13:18, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wouldn't quite agree with your last statement here (<i>if AMA gets deleted, then WP:ASSIST would also</i>). <a href="../../../a/s/s/WP%7EASSIST_3f8e.html" title="WP:ASSIST">WP:ASSIST</a> has deliberately been constructed in such a way that it is unlikely to get accused of Wikilawyering and fighting the advisee's corner against all odds (not that I think those problems were ever prevalent in the AMA anyway, but they were raised frequently in the MfD).</dd>
<dd>In response to Fred Chess's comment above, I take the point that many of the community are uncomfortable with the fundamental idea of advocacy, but I think it's a bit strong to assert that "the community declared that they did not want advocates". Firstly, a large part of the community did <i>not</i> take that stance, hence why the MfD was closed with no consensus. Secondly, although the MfD showed that many users are critical of the ideas of the AMA, it also showed that a lot of legitimate users (not sockpuppets or POV warriors) have been genuinely helped by the AMA.</dd>
<dd>I'd also disagree with the conclusion that restructuring and "the experience and competence of the advocates" are secondary issues. We need to restructure; we need to have entry standards for advocates, and exclude any who are highly inexperienced or who have a record of being confrontational; we also need to discourage off-wiki communication between advocate and advocee, as it creates a cliquish, Wikilawyerish sort of atmosphere.</dd>
<dd>I agree with Neigel von Teighen that the idea of having advocates appointed by the ArbCom is also a bad idea. Wikipedia does indeed have a complex, bureaucratic pseudo-judicial system, and the role of AMA advocates is to provide an <i>independent</i> source of advice and support that serves individual users, rather than the system. As such, there's nothing unhealthy <i>per se</i> about AMA advocates sometimes fighting the corner of an ordinary user against an admin, or about the ArbCom disliking us. It's in accord with the principles of natural justice that those on the bottom rung should get some help against the system, and should be assisted in understanding it. Possibly <a href="../../../a/s/s/WP%7EASSIST_3f8e.html" title="WP:ASSIST">WP:ASSIST</a> will do that better than the AMA, and be less confrontational about it. But neither organisation is defunct, and I don't believe the community has rejected the idea. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89"><font color="purple"><b>Wal</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/a/l/User_talk%7EWalton_monarchist89_7ca3.html" title="User talk:Walton monarchist89"><font color="silver"><b>ton</b></font></a> <small><sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/WP%7EBRoy_e296.html" title="WP:BRoy"><font color="purple">Vivat Regina!</font></a></sup></small></font> 17:00, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ol>
<li>AMA is a sociological <a href="../../../g/r/o/Group_%28sociology%29.html" title="Group (sociology)">group</a>. There are users that only take email advocacy, some that do arb-com, some that don't really participate except for once in a blue moon and even some that are sometimes disruptive. Most AMA members are not necessarily worried for the concerns of other members. Because of this the AMA may currently be defined as a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_group_Secondary_group_df4f.html" title="Primary group/Secondary group">Secondary group</a>. We are a group of different characters established to perform certain functions and will generally establish a temporary relationship.</li>
<li>AMA fits loosely within the definition of a team. This is because it only has a couple loosely defined roles. (ex.: coordinator and AMATs). It however becomes apparent, after looking at wikipedia's definition of <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team.html" title="Team">team</a>, which states "hold themselves mutually accountable for common purpose, goals, and approach", that AMA is not necessarily a team.</li>
<li>Within the last year we have observed the creation of the AMATs (AMA teams). Unlike the AMA, AMATs, as per it's team theory, has more "sharply defined roles, either cooperative or collaborative." In fact, with the creation of the Arb-com team and it's sub-deputy assistant and assistants, I believe it safe to say that the AMAT is more of a team and still heading in this direction, if not already there. According to google's define function, it is said that "a team comprises any group of people or animals linked in a common purpose. A group in itself does not necessarily constitute a team."</li>
<li>AMA and AMAT is a [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team#Self-managed_Teams" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team#Self-managed_Teams" rel="nofollow">Self-managed teams</a>]</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/s/s/WP%7EASSIST_3f8e.html" title="WP:ASSIST">WP:ASSIST</a> is more of an action team for immediate responses. Which, I believe should be considered "emergency" situations.</li>

<ol>
<li>AMAT offers the possibility to create an action team similar to WP:ASSIST. In fact I believe WP:ASSIST should be an AMAT, which would help complete the AMA group.</li>
<li>AMAT is ideal for handling pesky tasks. As per wikipedia's article on <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teams.html" title="Teams">Teams</a>: "Teams are especially appropriate for conducting tasks that are high in complexity and have many interdependent subtasks." I propose teams should be utilized to support regular AMA members when necessary.</li>
<li>Dencentralization of users into team blocks will create a network of users who are more familiar with each other. This will create a groupe of members that are closer to <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_group_Secondary_group_df4f.html" title="Primary group/Secondary group">Primary group</a>. Furthermore, should the AMA ever face a devasting MfD, team members and their direct <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connections.html" title="Connections">connections</a> are less likely to be immediatelly desolved by the clossing down of AMA.</li>

<dd>Interesting and good summary. I really like the idea of a networked (I call it "federal") AMA with teams as its simplest cell (currently, AMA is built upon advocates). But it may increase bureucracy... yes, theoretically, this new bureaucracy would be teams' problem, but in fact, WP community will associate it with AMA and a MfD will be there again. We must descentralize, but how?</dd>
<dd>Second: we need to set priorities. What will be discussed first? I think the handbook is the first and that the new AMA structure should resemble the handbook's ideas and principles. --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> | <sub><a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssociation_of_Members%27_Advocates_Teams_Arbitration_Team_4039.html" title="Wikipedia:Association of Members' Advocates/Teams/Arbitration Team">help with arbs?</a></sub> 10:23, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It still doesn't address the issue of <i>people</i>, though. You can have the best system in the world, but when people aren't doing the job for whatever reason, the end result is the same. There's an AMA currently "under investigation" that hasn't been touched since 2/21 (to add a notice) and really wasn't looked at at all after it was filed. The request itself was highly improper (it wasn't filed by the user named), and both the user who filed it and the user named therein have since left WP one way or another. The advocate currently claims he is busy IRL, which he has been for quite a while. The failure, therefore, is with the people who choose to be advocates and either don't know how to do the job, or don't really have the time to do it. Therefore, there needs to be a fundamental change in recruitment policies, so the advocates have the time and skills to do the job. If I have an issue with a user that I want resolved through AMA, I shouldn't have to wait 2 weeks just to get things started. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 12:59, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Response to above comment: (perhaps a distraction but dully noted) As per my summary above, your afformentioned exemple demonstrates the disatavantage of the AMA being in it current status. That is, being more of a social group instead of a team.

<p>I don't mean to be rude, but I think that everyone has kind of lost sight of the bigger picture of what's currently broken at the AMA - considering the minutiae of teams, recruitment policies, etc. strikes me as "fiddling while Rome burns". The main problem is two-fold: on one hand we have the Esperanza problem, where the AMA appears to exist in part merely for its own sake rather than achieving much; and secondarily, that some advocates have behaved in a manner that is anathematic to Wikipedia philosophy by behaving inappropriately for whatever reason (e.g. the disruptive behaviour in ArbCom cases noted by Raul). Indeed, I would like to point out further to some of the comments above - such as those by Neigel - that it is <i>absolutely imperative</i> that the lumbering, bureaucratic administrative structure is dismantled and reformed <i>as soon as possible</i> into something that is actually sensible for the purposes of undertaking the AMA's objectives, in order for this project to survive. I believe there is no question that unless this is remedied, the AMA really will end up with the same fate as Esperanza, and that the issues over quality control and behaviour of advocates cannot ever be addressed satisfactorily as long as this excessively hierarchical structure exists to obscure what is actually going on. Simplicity, transparency and focus on what actually needs to be achieved is the keynote of what needs to happen. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 19:51, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Personally, I'm still trying to find the "lumbering, bureaucratic administrative structure" seeing that as the Coordinator (the only real "administrative" position other than Deputies who help out with specific tasks), all I seem to be doing as of late is fielding email questions about the AMA, checking up with Advocates as they need help, and fixing templates and other bits of code in the request system. There is no more "hierarchy" to the AMA than that: A bunch of Advocates doing their thing and a Coordinator with a bucket, mop and toolbox to clean things up and fix the leaks. If, by virtue of being Coordinator, I'm at the top of this machine, then the entire hierarchy is no larger than a speed bump.<br />
<br />
What I -do- see that the AMA needs, however, is:
<ol>
<li>A better set of member credentials to ensure that editors who are familiar enough with Wikipedia policy are helping out; and</li>
<li>A more solid way to work with ArbCom.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Putting together a group of people who made it their business to better work within ArbCom's frame of reference was a very large step in that direction, but we still have a long way to go.

<li><b>Drop the formalistic structure immediately.</b> The AMA does itself no favours by appearing "opaque" to the rest of Wikipedia, and - I believe - wastes a huge amount of time on activities that accomplish nothing towards the goal of delivering advocate services; what this means is the AMA ends up existing merely for its own sake, rather than its stated purpose on Wikipedia. The whole business of pseudo-legal ideas, elections, vast lists of minutiae as formal "meetings", formal authority, bizarre constellations of "teams" with strange acronyms, etc. needs to be killed off rapidly. As I noted on the AMA talk page, these issues were in part the reason that Esperanza met the fate it did, and need to be got rid of not only so the system is more efficient, but also so the perception of the AMA by the rest of the Wikipedia community is no longer one of a secret clique that serves no purpose other than to provide a club for its members. Transparency is essential in any dispute resolution initative.</li>
<li><b>Cease being an adversary of the ArbCom.</b> A number of arbitrators have expressed an extreme dislike of the AMA based on past dealings with advocates in arbitration cases, and indeed Raul commented on the MfD to that effect. The AMA has carried on a consistent policy of thumbing its collective noses at the arbitrators, an extremely unwise course of action that is liable to lead to the arbitrators eventually losing patience and seeing that the initiative is indeed deleted and salted for good. Often, this combative attitude towards the ArbCom has been in the name of justice and "due process" - two terms liable to raise the ire of any Wikipedian, and even more so an arbitrator - and, although I am not specifically defending the ArbCom, I have worked with many of the arbitrators for a number of years here on Wikipedia, and I consider they would not show a dislike of the AMA unless they have a good reason to do so.</li>
<li><b>Actually look at what is happening in the advocate cases.</b> Further to my remarks above about the AMA getting wrapped up in its own organisational folderol, it seems the AMA is spending more time on its own internal squabbling and setting of formalisms than actually checking to see if its advocates are doing their job properly. A concerted effort needs to be made for people to check the quality of work being done, whether the advocate is actually working on the case or has instead "dropped the ball", check that the advocate is being sensible and is not "wiki-lawyering", etc. This must not be implemented as a formalism; instead, all AMA members should, from time to time, have a good look at the cases, and watch for this - the Coordinators should be ensuring this is happening, but appear not to be doing so at the present. It takes only one bad advocate to create a bad name for the organisation as a whole. This is not, however, to be taken in support of restrictive advocate selection - it's just people have to keep their eyes open and maintain common sense about what is acceptable.</li>
<li><b>Define clearly what an advocate should actually be doing</b> and make sure, further to the above, they are sticking to it. It must be made clear to advocates that they are there to represent and advise the user, but not there to act as lawyers, nor to defend the indefensible. Although I can see logic in the idea that everyone has a right to representation, the idea that even the patently guilty should be defended is one carried over from law, and not one that belongs here on Wikipedia. In this case, the arbitrators are perfectly justified in being irritated at AMA advocates officiously trying to gum up the works of arbitration when defending users who obviously need punitive action to be brought against them for the good of the community. In short, the AMA absolutely must work with the community's interest in mind as well, not just that of its clients.</li>
<li><b>Simplify the request process.</b> Although the new-version request page is not intrinsically difficult to follow, the overall appearance of it is one of unnecessary complexity, and I found from my work at the MedCab that getting users to jump through convoluted hoops in order to request assistance will achieve nothing other than a ream of paperwork and endless administrative work. It needs to be succinct and actually glean from users what is needed to carry out the case in a concise manner.</li>
<li><b>Permit "ordinary people" to implement changes in the AMA</b> - the suffering of the submission of proposals before anything is changed, and officious attitudes held by its coordinators on the subject, is utterly pointless. I would implement the {{sofixit}} idea instead, in that people just fix whatever is broken. This reduces the task I have described above of rehabilitating the AMA down to something possible, rather than something that would inevitably fail due to the insufferable stream of proposals that would be needed. Indeed, this is an issue that annoys me personally as I am extremely tempted to jump in and fix these things - but I know if I was to do so, I would not be well-received, due to this rigid structure of authority and pseudo-democracy.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this outlines a potential strategy on what needs to be done. Should there be any way I can help with this, please do let me know.

<dd>Most of this sounds excellent, but I think ordinary WP editors involved in a dispute do and should have the right to obtain assistance, and that there should be people prepared to give it. The assistance has to be honest, and in most ArbCom cases, the best assistance and advice that can be given will be to apologize , compromise, and promise to reform. But if there is a serious contention, there should be counsel. (The model isn't lawsuits, but administrative hearings.) But AMA should not only include people willing to do this. But, as you say, this and all other points can be worked out as we go along. The last think WP needs at this point are more administrative positions. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 08:30, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
