<dd>The Khobregan [Assembly of Experts], which meets for one week every year, consists of 86 "virtuous and learned" clerics elected by the public to eight-year terms. Like presidential and parliamentary elections, the Council of Guardians determines who can run for a seat in the assembly. Members of the Assembly of Experts in turn elect the Supreme Leader from within their own ranks and periodically reconfirm him. The assembly has never been known to challenge any of the Supreme Leader's decisions. Meetings are held behind closed doors and little is known about the decisions that are made. This secrecy is a sore point for many observers. <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iran/experts.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iran/experts.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>

<dd>If anything the dominant faction had shown its opposition to any opening of the political climate by attacking gatherings, banning newspapers, arresting writers and journalists, and threatening them with the death penalty for treason. This extra 8.5 million is made up of those who cast blank votes (5% in Teheran), those who simply submitted to the ideological-political pressures to vote, and those afraid of ending up without an election stamp on their ID. In times of intense economic hardship - as now - this could deprive them of food and other vital ration coupons. What this makes clear is that the people find it easier to use elections to show their opposition by voting than by boycotting. <a href="http://www.iran-bulletin.org/political_commentary/ELECTLDR.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iran-bulletin.org/political_commentary/ELECTLDR.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></dd>

<p>Hmm. A "congressional" body which never disagrees with the chief executive? And an election used to give the body credibility (by saying nobody boycotted it), while failure to vote carries dire penalties, and yet people <b>still</b> boycotted the vote?</p>
<p>This article fails to meet any sort of encyclopedic standards. I think someone cribbed it from the Iranian Embassy site. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 20:28, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>The assembly gathers every six months and elects a new Supreme Leader, in the event of dismissal or death of the previous Supreme Leader.</i></p>
<p>Which is it: <i>The assembly gathers every six months and elects a new Supreme Leader</i></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><i>The assembly gathers every six months. In the event of dismissal or death of the previous Supreme Leader it elects a new Supreme Leader.</i></p>
<p>I'm pretty sure it is the second.</p>
<p>Second question: If the second statement is right, what does the assembly do when it meets every six months? Vote on a resolution saying the SL is doing a good job?</p>
<p>Third question: What does this mean:</p>
<p><i>... in the event of dismissal or death of the previous Supreme Leader. The experts will review and consult among themselves concerning all the Islamic jurist possessing the qualifications of leadership. In the event they find one of them better versed in Islamic regulations, the subjects of the fiqh, or in political and social issues, or possessing general popularity or special prominence for any of the qualifications of leadership, they shall elect him as the Leader.
