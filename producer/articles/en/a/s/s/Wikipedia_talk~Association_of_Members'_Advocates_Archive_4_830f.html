I tried to discuss the details of its archiving. Then there was an uncivil personal exchange. I would like to go back to the original topic. Who should do the archiving? I would suggest that requests that have been made in February 2006 should not be archived unless they have been accepted or overtaken by events. (In one case, for instance, the requester was blocked as a sockpuppet.) Who should do the archiving?</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Civility</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">BE CIVIL</a> is a basic Wikipedia policy. As advocates, we will work with editors who have been uncivil, and will try to speak on their behalf. We should set an example for them and others of civility rather than arguing about the history of this association. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_McClenon_acae.html" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a> 12:26, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">How Do Requests Get Made?</span></h2>
<p>I know of two ways that editors can request Advocate assistance. The obvious one is by posting to the Requests talk page. The other way is, of course, by contacting the advocate directly (e.g., via his talk page or email address), possibly because the advocate has been involved in the dispute. Are there any other undocumented back doors that get Advocates assigned to people? (I have a reason for asking this, but will be discreet about it.) <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_McClenon_acae.html" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a> 19:33, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are none, to my knowledge, simply because that's those ways satisfy all conditions. On the requests page gets it taken care of more broadly and quickly; asking an individual advocate makes it more private. That can be done via talk-page or e-mail. Another way, I suppose, is through a third party, though that's not a situation I've encountered. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 23:55, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Advocate Cabal</span></h2>
<p>Dear Advocates: I have recently founded a new initiative, <a href="../../../a/d/v/Wikipedia%7EAdvocate_Cabal_201f.html" title="Wikipedia:Advocate Cabal">Wikipedia:Advocate Cabal</a>, and I thought it best to inform the advocates here that I have done so; any feedback on this new initiative, or indeed assistance as advocates, would be greatly welcomed. Thank you, and best regards, --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 02:28, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I rememebr there being resistance to us doing any soirt of mediation work becuase of the mediation cabal. It doesn;t look like we're being afforded the same monopoly.</p>
<p>I ask, now that we have new coordinator, that we revisit the proposal put forth my Izehar adn myself regarding revamping the AMA.Gator (talk) 18:59, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ah, well, it wasn't that I resisted the AMA doing mediation work because the Medcab was already doing it; it was because the AMA was meant to be to provide advocates, not generalised dispute resolution, and never did I state that either the Medcab or Medcom had monopoly over mediation. Remember, after all, that the Medcab was created after the Medcom was already in existence; the Arbcab is merely intended to provide a less formal avenue for requesting an advocate, which is actually quite a different service to what the AMA is providing. Also, I'm sure there are plenty of would-be advocates who wouldn't wish to be involved in all the political folderol involved with the AMA. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 19:55, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Despite the above, I might be willing to support this proposal if there were more stringent requirements for membership. I really think we ought to refashion ourselves more like a guild than a voluntary organization that people use to make themselves look more active, as it were. Plus, if we introduce a training element to advocacy, advocates will be better prepared to deal with the ArbCom and with steps in the dispute resolution process. I remember when I took my first case, I didn't even know <i>the steps</i> in dispute resolution, and had to learn them as I went along. That should not be what younger members need to go through. Perhaps apprenticeship?</li>
<li>I agree with the spirit of the above unsigned comment, but would never agree to some aspects opf the proposed policy. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 15:23, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>After my experiences with the Mediation Cabal, I concur with Wally. Disorganization and open-door policies don't help anyone except those who don't really need help. There needs to be some sort of standard, or at least, some sort of training or review. Maybe amateur good samaritans can help mop up the fatuous calls for help, but there are real issues that need real assistance. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ancillary Proposal Regarding Membership Criteria</span></h2>
<p>Since we have people coming round due to Gator's postings, I propose that:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Membership in the Association remain voluntary but no longer be merely limited to affiliation — that is, we should define membership more stringently than simply all those who sign-up;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Those interested in membership will thenceforth be compelled to gain it by the following process:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>First</i>, a prospective member should apply for an apprenticeship to an AMA member in good standing. No application for apprenticeship will be denied, save if the prospective member is determined to be a nuisance or uncivil or has a reputation thereof, via the ratification board set up to handle their application detailed in point three. In the case of no member in good standing being available, the Coordinator will take steps to ensure the prospective member receives training;</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Second</i>, a prospective member will be apprenticed to an AMA member in good standing for a period of not less than three months and not more than six, during which they shall assist the member in their duties;</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Third</i>, a prospective member will, upon completing this training period, have their appointment as a full AMA member go before a ratification board, to consist of an odd number of AMA members chaired by the Coordinator. This ratification board will be responsible for all aspects of a particular candidates' case, including their initial application for apprenticeship, and their accession to full member status.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Fourth</i>, a prospective member will be administered an examination of some sort on their familiarity with AMA and ArbCom procedures and also good advocate behavior, as determined by forthcoming advocate guidelines. The answers to this examination will be made available to the ratification board, which will grade them as a whole and take them into account. A prospective member will further be asked to offer a short statement, in their own words, why they feel they're ready to be considered a member in good standing, which the board will also take into account.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Fifth</i>, the AMA member to which the prospective member is apprenticed will offer a confidential written statement to the ratification board with their thoughts on the prospective member and their suitability to serve as an advocate. The ratification board will take this into account.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Sixth</i>, the ratification board will vote on the prospective member. A majority vote will suffice to have the advocate declared an AMA member. The Coordinator's vote must either be supportive or abstinant; should they vote against a prospective member, they will be vetoed. Should this occur, or should the ratification board vote down the prospective member, they may with the support of two AMA members in good standing appeal to the AMA as a whole, who will vote on the member, two-thirds in favor (of those voting, not of all members) sufficing to override the board.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Present AMA members will be grandfathered into the organization, and may take advantage of this via either substantial activity within the organization or having been engaged as an advocate in at least one case (this case need not necessarily have gone before the ArbCom). Those who do not or cannot do so may reapply for admission via the method above.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>AMA members have the right and duty to serve on ratification boards. Members will serve at least once in six months. Members are obligated to serve on a ratification board should the Coordinator or an appointed deputy request it; though they may exercise one "free deferral" per year. In addition, everytime a member volunteers to serve on a ratification board and does so, they may receive an additional deferral.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>AMA members may not be compelled to take any cases; however, members the Coordinator judges to be "malingering," or declining cases simply out of sloth or the desire to be a member of the organization but not to participate in it, may be suspended at their discretion for no longer than three months. The Coordinator may never dismiss a member on their own authority, however; only a two-thirds vote of the organization may do this. Members have the right to take leave of absences at any time, for a period up to and including eight months a year.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Any member in good standing has the right to hold any position within the organization should their peers judge them worthy; no further criteria than that for membership may be asked or considered.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm going to be unorthodox and, before asking for a vote, request amendments and comments. If you have an amendment, please specify the section to which it might go.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Comments</span></h3>
<p>Any proposal to define membership criteria as being anything other than "Put your name here" and "show up when you can" is a bad idea. There is a disturbing trend--not just on Wikipedia, but in society at large--to formalize and instutionalize phenonema that were previously spontaneous and informal. Too much order reduces flexibility and makes things less <b>fun</b>.</p>
<p>An individual who only wants to represent someone every now and then should not be forbidden from participating in our organization. People have different schedules and levels of commitment, and as long as the work they do do is good, why should we care how much work they do? <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 12:56, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>We're not here to have fun; we're here to produce an encyclopedia and ensure that it's done well, while in the process entertaining every viewpoint available on a subject, mainstream or not. If one has fun doing that, so much the better — if not they ought to get involved in something else.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, the proposal above specifically makes reference to the fact that an advocate would not even need to be <i>available</i> to work for eight of the twelve months of the year, and there's no requirement that they be participating even then. However, your point is still a valid one — care to offer an amendment?&#160;:) <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 21:29, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I do care to offer an amendment, and it consists of removing the entire thing. You appear to be applying the woefully incorrect Tony Sidaway school thought to the AMA--that it's not just enough that people do good work when they do any work at all; they must be doing a certain amount of work and they must be doing it for the "right" reasons. This is absurd. Why do you care how much work people do as long as the work they do do is good? There are several legitimate reasons to "decline cases out of sloth", first and foremost of which is THIS IS NOBODY'S DAY JOB. It is a hobby. If nobody's enjoying it, no one's going to do it. It's ridiculous to have to follow a Byzantine maze of rules and codes to take some time off from participating on a fucking <i>website</i> (or one particular part of it). <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 12:58, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why, what a productive comment. Someone can write a "good" article that is hopelessly biased. Check out the circumcision articles if you don't believe me.

<dd>With Rebecca's resignation, and the pages here going silent and somewhat discombobulated, I'd say it's more than time for the AMA to pick itself up by the bootstraps. A lot of cleaning up needs to be done here, and we need to band back together and see if we can get this organization more organized&#160;:-) I'm taking it upon myself to send a message to each AMA member listed a talk page message to see if we can get a roll call as to who is still "active," so we can update the list. Once we know who's here and working, I strongly suggest that we hold an election to get a new Coordinator and designate our Deputies. People need Advocates.

<p>Hello you all. I became a member of the Mediation Cabal and therefore think that I should resign from the AMA for the time being. It has ben cool and in I may return in the future to be an advocate again but I feel that my skills would be better put to use has an informal Mediator instead. Well see you around the Wiki. <a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeon1006_ee0d.html" title="User:Aeon1006"><font color="green">Aeon</font></a> <font color="red"><sup><a href="../../../a/e/o/User_talk%7EAeon1006_32f8.html" title="User talk:Aeon1006">Insane Ward</a></sup></font> 04:02, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Logo Looks Like AA?</span></h2>
<p>Anyone notice that the "M" of the AMA, since it is taken up by the two "A's", causes the logo to read AA when glanced at? In fact, it may be advisable to provide alcohol abstension advice to wikipedians, so that an assumption that the logo is for <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholics_Anonymous_e1b5.html" title="Alcoholics Anonymous">Alcoholics_Anonymous</a> would also be correct. <a href="../../../s/c/y/User%7EScytheml_a3ed.html" title="User:Scytheml">Scytheml</a> 03:38, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
