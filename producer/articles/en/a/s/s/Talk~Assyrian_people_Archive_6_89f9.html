<p>Hi guys. It's a pity to have this page locked again. At least, i hope that it would serve to build a concensus between yourselves for once. Please be positive. -- <i><a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF">Szvest</a> 13:39, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</i> <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: orange"><sup><i>Wiki me up ®</i></sup></font></a></small></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">You can't dictate our history.</span></h2>
<p>This is the accepted Assyrian accounting of our history. Why should we compromise our account of history that we've held for centuries and replace them with pro-Western ones that have been developed in contemporary times according to so-called scholarly opinion (highly refutable)? There are many scholars that point to this being the correct interpretation and just because you label them "ultra-nationalist" their view is unnacceptable? It may be unacceptable to you or others but it is the concensus of the Assyrian people and of Assyrian scholars. According to Western views (racist "Indo-Europeans"/"Aryans") Jews, Muslims, and Middle Easterners are responsible for all the wrong in this world as were any race of non-European lineage. You cannot dictate or rewrite history just to satisfy a few enemies of our people.<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESargonious_9f62.html" title="User:Sargonious">סרגון יוחנא</a> 18:19, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The consensus of Assyrian people??? So what???!! Do you think it is the Aramaeans/(or as you wish) modern Assyrians who say the last word? We can include their views as their viewpoint, but we cannot distort, pervert and rewrite history bydicating their nationalist claims. Remember it is Wikipedia not Assyrianismpedia.&#160;::: BTW, in front of all it is the majority of Aramaeans (Syrianis) themselves who are against this distortion of their history by nationalist Assyrianists. <a href="../../../i/r/a/User%7EIranZaminBozorg_d9c5.html" title="User:IranZaminBozorg">IranZaminBozorg</a> 20:50, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anyway it is very clear that all these funny accusations indicate to one thing: your weakness. Your assyrianiasm claims have long been refuted by eminent scholars, but your only desperate tactic is to attack anybody who does not agree with these baseless claims. Calling other people of being puppet of others, being related to CIA, Mukhabarat, Mossad, etc is actually very offensive. Maybe by this tactic you think you can hijcak the disputes.

</dl>
<p>it is appalling that this article seems to be held hostage by nationalists who call themselves things like "Chaldean", feel it is not necessary to "even read" comments, and obviously feel uninhibited by Wikipedia policy. It is undeisputed that Sargon of Akkad was the grandfather of Naram-sin, or that "Babylonia, formerly Sumer &amp; Akkad, [became] a colony of Assyria." or that "The title of 'King of Babylon' was 'King of Sumer &amp; Akkad' as translit&lt;t&gt;erated from the Akkadian Šār Mat Šūmerī ū Akkadī". It is however perfecly enigmatic what these factoids are doing in the <a href="../../../l/e/a/Wikipedia%7ELead_section_3c3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Lead section">Wikipedia:Lead section</a> of this article. I did some perfectly straightforward cleanup edits to this article, removing clutter, not pushing any sort of point of view (I don't have one on this topic), and was immediately attacked with a hostility betraying the misguided puerile patriotism that is so often found on Wikipedia. I can only state that I remain completely unimpressed by such shows of chauvinism, and that I deplore that articles get protected in the face of such behaviour. I will, of course, remove the offtopic material in the lead again once the aritcle is unprotected. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 09:56, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

This article isn't part of some Wikipedia from a parallel universe, and you don't own it. It is in dire need of cleanup according to policy and MoS. You can either accept these in good faith, or write your own article on geocities. Unless you are ready to debate politely based on mutual acceptance of policy ("Sargonius" could begin by signing his posts), we cannot even begin to address issues. Sargon of Akkad is a "building block of this article"? Pray elaborate. If you can drop your hostile and unreasonable attitude, we can fix things. If you just continue with the nationalist trolling, I will suggest it will be the disruptive <i>editors</i> that should be blocked, not the <i>article</i> that should be protected. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 19:23, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You won't get your way by simply threatening us by trying to have us blocked. That is desperation speaking simply because you can't have it your way. This article in its currents stage took months to form and we had to all agree on it and finally come to a conlcusion that it was the best it has ever been and you simply want to come in overnight and change it. I don't think so. Everything is referenced that you refute and you still complain that the links are biased. Who are you? Where are your credentials on this subject? You and Benne seem to even refute Harvard studies that show the origin of the name of Syria being derived from Assyria. This will go on forever if you keep pushing this anti-Assyrian stance.

I don't really feel it is necessary because the article already proposes such a thing by mentioning Arameans, Chaldeans, and Assyrians as well as others as possible ancestors of the people but you people seem to completely ignore those facts and just focus on the Assyrian topic because of your biased and completely anti-Assyrian views. Maybe if you read the entire article and all the main article links your heads would come out of your asses and you wouldn't be so damn blind to judge this article as "Assyrianist." Many so-called Assyrian nationalists have actually bashed this article for not being Assyrian enough. Benne wants this article to be removed of any Assyrian references and changed to Aramaean as you can see in older edits he has done so. Please read the whole thing out thoroughly and read all of the previous archives before trying to rewrite this in your own view of what our people are. There are more studies on Assyrians that proclaim what this article states than what you believe. You simply refute them by claiming they're Assyrianist. That is biased and racist.<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESargonious_9f62.html" title="User:Sargonious">סרגון יוחנא</a> 18:45, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Once again, WP is not a democracy. Apparently, you can't find the arguments to support your views, otherwise you wouldn't have resorted to voting, a method which can never resolve a matter like this.</dd>
<dd>Again, you spread nonsense about me. I've stated it over and over again that I don't care what you call yourself. It just that I believe it should be made clear that claims that the modern Assyrians descend from the ancient Assyrians are heavily disputed.</dd>

<p>Assyria was a territory enncompassing the lands of the former empire now only a historical region. That historical region holds many ethnic groups. Anyone descending from those indegenous groups are considered Assyrian. It's more of a "nationality" than simply an ethnic group. It is a national/ethno-religious group. Think of Assyria as modern day USA. Many people from all over the world come to the center of Western/Contemporary civilization and a lot are assimilated into the dominant culture. The ancient world not much different. Babylon was the center of Ancient Civilization in the "Known World." Yes there were Arameans (Chaldeans included), Akkadians, Sumerians, Kassites, Amorites, etc. The genetic make of most of the middle east is composed of some sort of combination including any of the afformentioned peoples.

<p>First of all I am Chaldean Catholic. Most Chaldeans in the diaspora understand what Chaldean and Assyrian are yet have a heavily distored vision thanks to Sarhad Jammo, A Bishop from Troy, MI now in CA. I am in no way biased or an Assyrianist. I was raised into this Chaldean propoganda and only later in life did I understand the differences between different "Chaldean groups" or "Aramaean groups" and that we are all actually Assyrian because that was our nation not Chaldea nor Aramea. Those became domains of the Assyrian nation and the nation stuck with the name even in the times of the Roman Empire and beyond. And for our language we say Sureth not Arameth not Kasdu (Kasdim) or Kaldu and our people are named after Assyrian Emperors not Chaldean nor Babylonian hence Sargon, Shamiram, Nineveh, Nahrain, (na)Ramsin, Ashur, Sinkho(arib), (A)Sarhad(on) etc. and not Hamurabi, Nebuchadnasir, Lugal Zagi Zi, etc.<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESargonious_9f62.html" title="User:Sargonious">סרגון יוחנא</a> 19:00, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I really don't think you chaldos are assyrian, I am a aturiya or whatever its called, and if the chaldos helped to destroy the assyrian empire then how are they assyrian? So that says that they are NOT assyrians,but there own group of people who are diffrent from assyrians. Plus the chaldos church doesn't listen to HH Mar Dinkha IV the patriarch of our real and the first church of christians.</p>
<p>Well first of all you might want to say who you are and second of all the Church isn't what makes you Assyrian and another thing read the history of the Chaldean church for it started as part of our original church. Si qtol ganukh spisa. Well, in history it says that the chaldeanens and the medes teamed up to destroy the assyrians so if chaldos destroyed the assyrians then they really should not be considered assyrian right? and the chaldeanen church was made AFTER the original church with an agreement to the roman catholic church, that they would obey every order and that the pope is their most powerful person of their church. Yeah, I thought so.

I have no stake whatsoever in the battle that appears to be raging here. In fact I know next to nothing about the facts in dispute. However, I do know something about argumentation, &amp; it may be worthwhile saying something about the character of the argument found in this talk page.</p>
<p>The arguments put forward by the likes of סרגון יוחנא bear every hallmark of faith-based belief. His or her last post, immediately above, trumpets it aloud, as if to put at rest any remaining doubts concerning his or her visceral allegiance to at least two creeds, one religious &amp; one nationalistic. Bear in mind the Latin etymology of the word: <i>creed</i> derives from <i>credo</i>, which means 'I believe'. This could easily devolve into a 'debate' over the merits of faith as opposed to reason, but it would be rather beside the point to get into that. What must be understood as a first principle is that Wikipedia intends to be an academically legitimate encyclopedia; that is apparent everyhere from public expressions in the news to the entire body of Wikipedia guidelines. Therefore a lucid conception of what an encyclopedia consists in is entirely of the essence.</p>
<p>Ever since the first modern encyclopedia, Diderot's 'Encyclopedie ou Dictionnaire raisonne des Sciences, des Arts, et des Metieres' (plus the appropriate diacritical marks), an encyclopedia has been synonymous with a literary work that contains as exhaustive a collection of the gathered knowledge of scholarship &amp; science as it is possible to put together. If Wikipdia is to be part of that definition &amp; endeavour, &amp; there is every indication that most wish it to be, it will have to exclude the types of argument put forth by סרגון יוחנא , which are, after all, just the sort of 'reasoning' the encyclopedia--science &amp; scholarship--seek to stamp out. If there are other arguments for whatever is being proposed, ones that issue from legitimate scholarship--that is, the type of scholarship that passes muster in the traditional encyclopediae (since this is the English Wikipedia, those would be best represented by the Encyclopaedia Britannica)--then it ought to be included in the article.</p>
<p>However, applying tar-&amp;-pitch disparagements &amp; ethnic slurs in the talk page of a Wikipedia article is insufficient to support one's own understanding of its topic based on tradition &amp; faith. Both that understanding &amp; the chosen means of injecting it into the discourse are foreign to the purposes, methods, &amp; spirit of the literary encyclopedia that Wikipedia is in a constant state of striving to become. The likes of סרגון יוחנא run counter to everything Wikipedia stands for. <a href="../../../r/u/b/User%7ERubyQ_677e.html" title="User:RubyQ">RubyQ</a> 04:24, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

The genetic study was done by a population genetics luminary, Cavalli Sforza. However, do not get the misconception that Assyrians are genetically connected to there Assyrian Ancestors, NO, this study shows only that they are distinct compared to everyone else. Meaning they are not Arabs nor Kurds. The only way to connect Assyrians with there ancestors is by sequencing DNA from ancient Assyrian remains and that is not available. Romil</p>

I think that there only 3 reasons to say something like that:you dont know anythink about history or your interest come in conflict with an indipentent christian state in middle-east wich will have oil in his region or an non arabic state in that region may have conflicts with his neighbors so more problems to the western states who dont care about historical justice but about justice of their intrests</p>

<p>I think shes right to sat that the assyrian history has been very distorted by historical scholars. We are assyrians because we are born into and that people who distort our history our not, Armeanen supermacists, but are white people who our mad at us for not being absorbed in their westernization process and muslims because we have not become absorbed in their arabization process. There is no evidence that we are not assyrians but people still act like our langauge, our culture, theese things that people want us to give up our what we have that trace us back to our ancestors who lived between the rivers.
