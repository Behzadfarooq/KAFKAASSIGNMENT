<p>The following are the texts of the Assam Accord - 1985 signed between students representatives from the state of Assam and the government officials in the presence of then Prime Minister, Republic of India Mr. Rajiv Gandhi.</p>
<p>1. Government have all along been most anxious to find a satisfactory solution to the problem of foreigners in Assam. The All Assam Students Union (AASU) and the All Assam Gana Sangram Parished AAGSP) have also expressed their keenness to find such a solution.</p>
<p>2. The AASU through their Memorandum dated 2nd February 1980 presented to the late Prime Minister Smt. Indira Gandhi, conveyed their profound sense of apprehensions regarding the continuing influx of foreign nationals into Assam and the fear about adverse effects upon the political, social, culture and economic life of the State.</p>
<p>3. Being fully alive to the genuine apprehensions of the people of Assam, the then Prime Minister initiated the dialogue with the AASU/AAGSP. Subsequently, talks were held at the Prime Minister’s and Home Minister’s level during the period 1980-83. Several rounds of informal talks were held during 1984. Formal discussions were resumed in March, 1985.</p>
<p>4. Keeping all aspects of the problem including constitutional and legal provisions, international agreements, national commitments and humanitarian considerations, it has been decided to proceed as follows:</p>
<p>5. <b>Foreigners Issue</b>:</p>
<p>5.1. For purposes of detection and deletion of foreigners, 1.1.1966 shall be the base data and year.</p>
<p>5.2. All persons who come to Assam prior to 1.1.1966, including those amongst them whose names appeared on the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electoral_roll.html" title="Electoral roll">electoral rolls</a> used in 1967 elections shall be regularised.</p>

Such persons will be required to register themselves before the Registration Officers of the respective districts in accordance with the provisions of the Registration of Foreigners Act, 1939 and the Registration of Foreigners Rules, 1939.</p>
<p>5.5. For this purpose, Government of India will undertake suitable strengthening of the government machinery.</p>
<p>5.6. On the expiry of a period of ten years following the date of detection, the names of all such persons which have been deleted from the electoral rools shall be restored.</p>
<p>5.7. All persons who were expelled earlier, but have since reentered illegally into Assam shall be expelled.</p>
<p>5.8. Foreigners who came to Assam on or after March 25, 1971 shall continue to be detected, deleted and practical steps shall be taken to expel such foreigners.</p>
<p>5.9. The Government will give due consideration to certain difficulties expressed by the AASU/AAGSP regarding the implementation of the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act, 1983.</p>
<p>6. <b>Safeguards and economic development</b></p>
