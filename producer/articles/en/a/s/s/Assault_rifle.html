Assault rifles are categorized between <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light_machine_gun.html" title="Light machine gun">light machine guns</a>, intended more for sustained automatic fire in a support role, and <a href="../../../s/u/b/Submachine_gun.html" title="Submachine gun">submachine guns</a>, which fire a handgun cartridge rather than a rifle cartridge. Assault rifles are the standard <a href="../../../s/m/a/Small_arms.html" title="Small arms">small arms</a> in most modern <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army.html" title="Army">armies</a>, having largely replaced or supplemented larger, more powerful battle rifles, such as the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>-era <a href="../../../m/1/_/M1_Garand_rifle_9de2.html" title="M1 Garand rifle">M1 Garand</a> and <a href="../../../s/v/t/SVT-40_ffc1.html" title="SVT-40">Tokarev SVT</a>.

Semi-automatic rifles, including commercial versions of the <a href="../../../a/r/-/AR-15_8080.html" title="AR-15">AR-15</a>, and "automatic" rifles limited to firing single shots are not assault rifles as they are not selective fire.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Assault_rifle.html" title="Edit section: The definition">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The definition</span></h2>
<p>The term <i>assault rifle</i> is a translation of the German word <i>Sturmgewehr</i> (literally meaning "storm rifle"), "storm" used as a verb being synonymous with assault, as in "to storm the compound". Sturmgewehr was coined by <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> to describe the Maschinenpistole 44, subsequently re-baptized <a href="../../../s/t/u/Sturmgewehr_44.html" title="Sturmgewehr 44">Sturmgewehr 44</a>, the firearm generally considered the first widely-used assault rifle and served to popularize the concept. The translation “assault rifle” gradually became the common term for similar firearms sharing the same technical definition as the name giver StG 44. In a strict definition, a firearm <b>must</b> have all of the following five characteristics to qualify as an assault rifle:<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Barrel length is usually 400 mm to 500 mm (16” to 20”)</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Most common is a capacity of 30 rounds, sometimes 20 rounds.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The following features are commonly found on assault rifles, but those are not exclusive to assault rifles, as those features are shared with many <a href="../../../s/u/b/Submachine_gun.html" title="Submachine gun">submachine guns</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_rifle.html" title="Battle rifle">battle rifles</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automatic_rifle.html" title="Automatic rifle">automatic rifles</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machine_gun.html" title="Machine gun">machine guns</a>:</p>

<li>Protruding pistol grip.</li>
<li>Folding, retractable or otherwise collapsible shoulder stock.</li>
<li>Bipod</li>

</ul>
<p>There are commentators who use the expression “assault rifle” more loosely to include other types of arms, particularly arms that fall under a strict definition of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_rifle.html" title="Battle rifle">battle rifle</a>, or civilian <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semi-automatic_rifle.html" title="Semi-automatic rifle">semi-automatic</a> off-shoots of military rifles for commercial or <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assault_rifle.html#Assault_weapons_vs._Automatic_weapons" title="Assault rifle">political reasons</a>. Some militaries of nations outside of the English-speaking world also have a different definition of assault rifle. For instance, the analogous term in the <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swedish_Armed_Forces_2626.html" title="Swedish Armed Forces">Swedish Armed Forces</a> is <i>automatkarbin</i> (literally "automatic carbine") which includes both assault rifles and battle rifles.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Assault_rifle.html" title="Edit section: The changing face of infantry combat">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The changing face of infantry combat</span></h3>
<p>From ancient times, light infantry had fought in dispersed formations, while heavy infantry had fought in tightly packed formations. This continued as the sling and spear were replaced by <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musket.html" title="Musket">musket</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayonet.html" title="Bayonet">bayonet</a>. Bright colored uniforms (German: Blue, Russian: Green; British: Red, French: White) became a standard for unit cohesion in the midst of clouds of black powder smoke. Muskets were inaccurate at distances greater than 50 to 100 meters, and multiple ranks and a reserve were necessary so that some part of the unit would be ready to fire at all times. Tight formations also aided <a href="../../../o/f/f/Officer_%28armed_forces%29.html" title="Officer (armed forces)">officers</a> in controlling their men during combat.</p>
<p>The adaptation of <a href="../../../r/i/f/Rifled_musket.html" title="Rifled musket">rifled muskets</a> for military use in the mid-19th century increased range and firepower and made battle from dense formations an increasingly bloody affair as witnessed by the high level of casualties in the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>. <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skirmisher.html" title="Skirmisher">Skirmisher</a> tactics were given greater emphasis as gunpowder weapons increased in reliability, accuracy, and rate of fire. Cavalry adapted by dismounting, and using skirmisher tactics with <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breech-loading_weapon.html" title="Breech-loading weapon">breechloading rifles</a> (which could be reloaded from a prone position, reducing vulnerability to enemy fire).</p>
<p>After the American Civil War, further developments such as the adaptation of <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magazine_%28firearms%29.html" title="Magazine (firearms)">magazine-fed</a> <a href="../../../r/i/f/Rifle.html" title="Rifle">rifles</a>, rapid fire <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machine_gun.html" title="Machine gun">machine guns</a> and high explosive <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shell_%28projectile%29.html" title="Shell (projectile)">shells</a> for the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artillery.html" title="Artillery">artillery</a>, spelled the end of the dense infantry formation during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>. What this meant in practice was that infantry units no longer engaged each other at long range in open fields; the high power of relatively unwieldy <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolt-action.html" title="Bolt-action">bolt-action</a> rifles of the day (which had been tripled by the adaptation of <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smokeless_powder.html" title="Smokeless powder">smokeless powder</a>, along with a corresponding increase in <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recoil.html" title="Recoil">recoil</a> and report) was no longer suited to the close range engagement of modern warfare. Military leaders and arms manufacturers thus began grasping for a new type of weapon for this new era.</p>

<p><i>These automatic firearms tended to use used pre-existing rifle cartridges, <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinetic_energy.html" title="Kinetic energy">kinetic energy</a> ranged between 3,000–5,000 <a href="../../../j/o/u/Joule.html" title="Joule">J</a> (2,200–3,700 foot-pounds), velocities of 750–900 <a href="../../../m/2F/s/M_s_cd4b.html" title="M/s">m/s</a> (2,460–2,950 ft/s) and bullets of 9 to 13 <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gram.html" title="Gram">g</a> (139–200 grains).</i></p>
<p>If the term is applied retroactively, the first assault rifle was the <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italian</a>-made <a href="../../../c/e/i/Cei-Rigotti_563a.html" title="Cei-Rigotti">Cei-Rigotti</a>, which was developed in the 1890s and finished around 1900. While tested in <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>, it never entered military service, however. The first service assault rifle was the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russian</a> <a href="../../../f/e/d/Fedorov_Avtomat_1315.html" title="Fedorov Avtomat">Fedorov Avtomat</a> issued for the first time in 1919, chambered for the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japanese</a> <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arisaka.html" title="Arisaka">Arisaka</a> <a href="../../../6/2E/5/6.5_x_50_mm.html" title="6.5 x 50 mm">6.5 x 50 mm</a> rifle <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartridge_%28firearms%29.html" title="Cartridge (firearms)">cartridge</a>, which was only used in small numbers.</p>
<p>During World War I the French <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chauchat.html" title="Chauchat">Chauchat</a> was introduced, an <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automatic_rifle.html" title="Automatic rifle">automatic rifle</a> that was produced in large numbers (250,000). Like the later assault rifle it was capable of both single shots and automatic fire, and was loaded with a <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magazine_%28firearms%29.html" title="Magazine (firearms)">magazine</a> and also featured a <a href="../../../p/i/s/Pistol_grip.html" title="Pistol grip">pistol grip</a>. Compared to other light machine guns of the time the Chauchat was fairly light at the weight of 9 kg but it was still too cumbersome for closer quarters and had recoil that was too heavy to control when firing fully automatic due to the powerful <a href="../../../3/0/-/30-06.html" title="30-06">30-06</a> cartridge. In spite some serious flaws it was so important to infantry combat that desperate German troops who had no comparable weapon of their own started using captured Chauchats. <a href="http://www-cgsc.army.mil/carl/resources/csi/House/House.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www-cgsc.army.mil/carl/resources/csi/House/House.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> While it was chambered for <a href="../../../3/0/-/30-06.html" title="30-06">30-06</a> and therefore did not use an intermediate cartridge, it was an intermediate weapon between the submachine guns and heavier <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machine_gun.html" title="Machine gun">machine guns</a> such as the <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewis_Gun_e161.html" title="Lewis Gun">Lewis Gun</a>.</p>
<p>The American <a href="../../../m/1/9/M1918_Browning_Automatic_Rifle_e806.html" title="M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle">M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle</a> (BAR) copied the Chauchat concept in a more reliable design but was not introduced or used in any significant numbers before the war ended. Later developments added heavier <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun_barrel.html" title="Gun barrel">barrels</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/p/Bipod.html" title="Bipod">bipods</a> that made it more like today's light machine gun or <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squad_automatic_weapon.html" title="Squad automatic weapon">squad automatic weapon</a>, though it did help establish the doctrine of use for light selective fire rifles. These versions of the BAR was produced in large numbers, widely adopted, and served into the 1960s with the U.S. military and other nations.</p>
<p>Also during World War I, submachine guns also entered service such as the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villar_Perosa_%28weapon%29_806a.html" title="Villar Perosa (weapon)">Villar Perosa</a>, the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Beretta_Model_1918_bcea.html" title="Beretta Model 1918">Beretta Model 1918</a> and the <a href="../../../m/p/1/MP18_ea9c.html" title="MP18">MP18</a>. These weapons fired cartridges derived from pistol chamberings — <a href="../../../9/_/m/9_mm_Glisenti_443b.html" title="9 mm Glisenti">9 mm Glisenti</a> and 9 mm Bergmann. The 9 mm Bergman was based on the <a href="../../../9/_/m/9_mm_Parabellum_bae0.html" title="9 mm Parabellum">9 mm Parabellum</a>, with reduced charge to reduce recoil in the MP18. The developers of the <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thompson_submachine_gun.html" title="Thompson submachine gun">Thompson submachine gun</a> (also developed during the 1910s) originally intended to use rifle-powered rounds. However, a mechanical system that could handle their power was not found and the <a href="../../../2E/4/5/.45_ACP_695c.html" title=".45 ACP">.45 ACP</a> cartridge was chosen instead. These firearms are considered part of the <a href="../../../s/u/b/Submachine_gun.html" title="Submachine gun">submachine gun</a> class, but were an important step in the development of assault rifles.</p>

<p>Continuing evolution of the intermediate-caliber automatic rifle was primarily driven by ammunition.

Conversely, full-sized military rifle calibers were uncomfortable to fire repeatedly and difficult to control during <a href="../../../f/u/l/Fully_automatic.html" title="Fully automatic">fully automatic</a> or rapid fire because of significant recoil; cost of design and manufacture was also higher. One attempt to combine an intermediate cartridge with an automatic rifle by the <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italian</a> arms company <a href="../../../b/e/r/Beretta.html" title="Beretta">Beretta</a> resulted in the MAB 38 (<i>Moschetto Automatico Beretta 1938</i>). The MAB 38 used a <a href="../../../f/i/o/Fiocchi.html" title="Fiocchi">Fiocchi</a> <i>9M38</i> cartridge and a higher-powered 9 mm Parabellum cartridge, which could provide longer range fire. The effective range was about 200 m.</p>
<p>In 1942, the United States introduced the <a href="../../../m/1/_/M1_carbine.html" title="M1 carbine">M1 Carbine</a>, which was an intermediate power weapon chambered for the <a href="../../../2E/3/0/.30_Carbine_429e.html" title=".30 Carbine">.30 Carbine</a> cartridge. While select-fire capability was initially planned for the M1 Carbine, this was dropped from the first version. Later in the war, selective fire variants were made (M2 and M3 Carbines). The weapon had greater range and accuracy than <a href="../../../s/u/b/Submachine_gun.html" title="Submachine gun">submachine guns</a>, but was not as powerful as full-size automatic rifles such as the <a href="../../../m/1/9/M1918_Browning_Automatic_Rifle_e806.html" title="M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle">Browning Automatic Rifle</a>. The longer barrel (18-inch) provided the carbine with higher <a href="../../../m/u/z/Muzzle_velocity.html" title="Muzzle velocity">muzzle velocity</a> than pistols and submachine guns chambered for the same .30 round.</p>
<p>Originally the Carbine was envisioned as an inexpensive lightweight weapon for issue to rear-area and support troops (truckers, tankers, cooks, etc.) in place of the more expensive <a href="../../../m/1/9/M1911.html" title="M1911">M1911</a> pistol or <a href="../../../m/1/_/M1_Garand_Rifle_8f44.html" title="M1 Garand Rifle">M1 Garand Rifle</a>. The M1 Carbine series was soon found suitable for close quarter battle engagements, a concept that would be re-applied later. In particularly, it was furnished to US Airborne divisions, because of the expectation that Airborne units would have to fight without being resupplied. This marked the first time in which such an intermediate weapon would be mass-produced — it became the most produced American weapon of the war, with millions made. The M1 Carbine series would remain in service with the U.S. military primary forces until supplemented and finally replaced by the <a href="../../../m/1/6/M16_rifle.html" title="M16 rifle">M16 rifle</a> in the 1960s; it continued to be used limited roles—particularly the U.S. Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, and many Training Commands in various U.S. Armed forces well into the 1980s—as well as used in other nations (notably Israel, where it is still used frequently in a variety of forms).</p>

</div>
<p><i>Some of these automatic firearms used pre-existing rounds; others used new intermediate cartridges. Kinetic energy ranged between 1,400–2,100 J (1,033–1,550 foot-pounds), muzzle velocities of 600–800m/s (1,970–2,625 ft/s) and bullets of 7–9g (108–139 grains).</i></p>
<p>Germany, under the Versailles Treaty was limited to a professional army of long service soldiers numbering only 100,000 men and forbade tanks or military aircraft. This encouraged an approach that emphasized high quality, and reduced emphasis on low cost. Infantry tactics became based on teams of General Purpose Machineguns (GPMG) supporting and supported by a section of infantry. GPMG had high rates of fire to permit small numbers of men to fire at long range to defend a wide front. Enemy soldiers, briefly exposed, would be engaged with a high rate burst of fire to cause casualties before they could take cover. Close range assaults would be conducted by units with submachineguns, for greater mobility, and higher rates of fire. This tactical approach was a refinement of the "Hutier" tactics used by Germany in the last year of WWI.</p>
<p>Germany, like other countries, had observed and studied the emerging demand of infantry rifles evolving since <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, and their factories made a variety of non-standard cartridges, therefore having less incentive to retain their existing calibers. The 7.92 × 30 mm (Kurz) cartridge was an example of these experiments; in 1941, it was improved to <a href="../../../7/2E/9/7.92_x_33_mm.html" title="7.92 x 33 mm">7.92 × 33 mm</a> <i>Infanterie Kurz Patrone</i> ("Infantry Short Cartridge"). In 1942, it was again improved as <i>Maschinenkarabiner Patrone S</i>, and in 1943, <i>Pistolen Patrone 43mE</i>; then, finally, <i>Infanterie Kurz Patrone 43</i>. The similarity in size between the 7.92x33 mm German cartridge and the 7.62x33 mm developed for the M1 Carbine is a curious coincidence, but was ultimately nothing more than independent yet similar solutions to the same problem. The 7.92X33mm round used the same cartridge case head as the standard 7.92x57mm, and the bullets was made from the same diameter rod.</p>
<p>In 1942, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walther.html" title="Walther">Walther</a> presented the <i>Maschinenkarabiner</i> ("automatic carbine", abbr. MKb), named MKb42(W). In the same year, Haenel presented the MKb42(H), designed by <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugo_Schmeisser_69eb.html" title="Hugo Schmeisser">Hugo Schmeisser</a> as a result of this program. Rheinmetall-Borsig (some said Krieghoff) presented its <a href="../../../f/g/_/FG_42_fb5e.html" title="FG 42">FG 42</a> (<i>Fallschirmjäger Gewehr 42</i>, sponsored by <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermann_G%C3%B6ring_6dc0.html" title="Hermann Göring">Hermann Göring</a>) though this was in a different role, and using a heavy <a href="../../../8/_/m/8_mm_Mauser_b553.html" title="8 mm Mauser">8 × 57 mm</a> (8 mm Mauser) cartridge, which was not an intermediate round. War-time tests in <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> indicated the MKb42(H) performed better than the other two. Schmeisser developed it first as the MP43, then MP43/1, and finally as the MP44/Sturmgewehr 44 (abbreviated StG44). It immediately entered large scale production. More than 5,000 units had been produced by February 1944, and 55,000 by the following November.</p>
<p>Following the end of the war in 1947, the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> developed the <a href="../../../a/k/-/AK-47_b9b4.html" title="AK-47">AK-47</a>, which was vaguely similar in visual concept and layout to the German StG44, though quite different mechanically. It fired the <a href="../../../7/2E/6/7.62_x_39_mm.html" title="7.62 x 39 mm">7.62 × 39 mm</a> cartridge, which had been developed during WWII for use in their SKS carbines which were used at war's end. The round was similar to the StG44's in that the bullet was of a similar caliber to the larger, full-size Russian rifle ammunition.</p>
<p>The designers of the STG 45 moved to Spain and developed the <a href="../../../c/e/t/CETME_77d2.html" title="CETME">CETME</a> Assault Rifle, which was licensed for use in West Germany, and was subsequently improved to become the German G-3, produced by Heckler and Koch <a href="../../../h/k/_/HK_69e1.html" title="HK">HK</a>. proved the CETME, This is where <a href="../../../h/%26/k/H%26K_282f.html" title="H&amp;K">H&amp;K</a> started.</p>

<p><i>Many of these automatic firearms used intermediate cartridges with much lighter bullets and smaller calibers, but fired at very high velocity; kinetic energy ranged between 1300–1800J (960–1,330 foot-pounds), velocities of 900–1050m/s (2,950–3,450 ft/s), and bullets of 3–4g (46–62 grains).</i></p>

<p>After WWII and the creation of NATO, the United States insisted on introducing their own <a href="../../../7/2E/6/7.62_x_51_mm.html" title="7.62 x 51 mm">7.62 x 51 mm</a> full-power cartridge (developed from the 30-06/7.62 x 63 mm - American standard during WWII) as standard in NATO. It could kill at distances of more than 500 meters, although statistical studies of WWII battles performed by the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Army_6c52.html" title="U.S. Army">U.S. Army</a> revealed that infantry combat beyond 300 meters (325 yards) was rare. At the time, the British were developing their own 7 x 43 mm (<a href="../../../2E/2/8/.280_British_9b0e.html" title=".280 British">.280 British</a>) intermediate cartridge for their very modern and groundbreaking EM-2 bull-pup assault rifle. Due to political pressure from the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative Party</a>, which agreed with the American standardization campaign, the whole project was shelved at the eve of introduction. In Belgium, the famous arms producer FN Herstal started experimenting with the German 7.92 x 33 mm Kurzpatrone. They built a prototype of a rifle using this cartridge, but the impending NATO standardization forced them to rebuild it to use American ammo, giving birth to the <a href="../../../f/n/_/FN_FAL_fcc4.html" title="FN FAL">FN FAL</a>.</p>
<p>The Russians saw no reason to make a rifle that shot beyond a rifleman's ability to aim, and therefore considered a lighter, less-powerful cartridge to be more effective. This permitted a lighter rifle and allowed a greater amount of the lighter ammunition to be transported in the same amount of space. Moreover, the smaller cartridges lessened recoil, which allowed riflemen to sustain a higher accurate rate of fire and facilitate marksmanship training. In addition, the smaller size and handiness of an assault rifle would benefit <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tank.html" title="Tank">tank</a> crews, support troops, and units with missions other than <a href="../../../f/r/o/Front_line.html" title="Front line">front line</a> combat.</p>

<p>The smaller-caliber military cartridges such as the 5.56 x 45 mm and 5.45 x 39 mm were sometimes considered less lethal than the previous generation of assault rifle rounds, such as the 7.62 x 39mm, which were large-caliber bullets with reduced propellant or cases. However, the lighter, small-caliber bullets achieved higher velocities, more favorable ballistic properties, and reduced carrying weight.</p>
<p>One aspect of the smaller caliber ammunition that is sometimes hotly debated is its fragmentation behavior. Stopping capability is the effectiveness of the round in completely stopping the target when it hits — either killing or fully incapacitating. Within a certain range of ballistic conditions, the lighter 5.56 mm and 5.45 mm will, upon striking tissue, first tumble and then fragment. Beyond 100 yards, or when fired from shorter barrels, such bullets can often fail to fragment upon impact because of insufficient velocity. Thus, the result in a target is a rather small .22 caliber bullet hole, instead of a much larger wound channel. Effectiveness depends on what tissues of the enemy body the round destroys. Larger destroyed areas, increases the probability that sufficient damage will be done to end enemy resistance. Ultimately, any pointed (spitzer) round will tumble in soft tissue. If the jacket has a cannelure, such as the U.S. 5.56 × 45 mm M193 round, and the bullet is in the proper ballistic state and high enough velocity, the bullet will fragment, inflicting significant blood loss and internal damage, as well as a wound channel profile that is more complex to address medically. If the bullet acts as a solid, and doesn't fragment, full effectiveness occurs only if striking the brain or spinal chord, causing immediate loss of control. There is a distinct, though lesser effectiveness if the heart, large blood vessels, or liver (which last tends to tear) is hit causing fairly quick loss of blood pressure, and consequent unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Part of the dispute over small-caliber rounds arises here. Blood loss leads to indirect incapacitation, but often takes longer than direct destruction of tissue. Defense Secretary <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_McNamara_73fb.html" title="Robert McNamara">Robert McNamara</a> presented wounding ability as a reason for adoption of the M16 over the <a href="../../../m/1/4/M14_rifle.html" title="M14 rifle">M14</a>. The theory that wounding one soldier will take him out of action was wed to the findings of <a href="../../../m/1/6/M16_rifle.html#Project_SALVO" title="M16 rifle">Project SALVO</a>. SALVO concluded that the main factor in inflicting casualties in infantry combat was solely rounds fired — aiming had negligible impact. Following the US military's combat experience in <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam.html" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, questions arose over the reliability of the fragmentation behavior of the 5.56 mm bullet, the validity of the wounded-plus-helpers theory, and the effectiveness or wisdom of forgoing individual marksmanship for un-aimed volumes of fire. The United States and Australia in Vietnam used 5.56 mm ammunition (Chris Halls, <i>Guns in Australia</i> Paul Hamlyn, 1974, pp. 159-161). Other NATO nations used the much larger 7.62 x 51 mm cartridge, and Communist forces used the 7.62 x 39mm. Australia also used the 7.62 x 51 mm round in Vietnam, in its L1A1 rifles (Halls, <i>Guns in Australia</i>).</p>
<p>The general effectiveness of the 5.56 x 45 mm cartridge was questioned; experience had shown that it did not always fragment, and that the bullet was light enough to easily deflect or divert radically from its path after passing through even a soft or very thin object. The theory that enemy soldiers would drop what they were doing to aid a wounded comrade was dubious. The heavier 7.62mm bullets in use were claimed to hit harder with more mass, would not deflect or destabilize as readily, and more reliably killed what it hit. (Some of the substantiated issues were later addressed in 1982 with the changes made in the M16A2, which used a heavier 62 grain bullet with different ballistic characteristics than its M16A1 predecessor.)</p>
<p>While the debate about the effectiveness of the 5.56/5.45 mm bullet versus the 7.62 mm continued, some interesting developments did arise in the following generation of weapons.</p>

<p>The running debate over 5.56 mm vs. 7.62 mm ammunition, and the prominent argument by 7.62 mm proponents that "the Russians got it right with a .30 cal (7.62 mm)" cartridge, was stirred significantly in 1974 when the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> also developed its own smaller-caliber cartridge, the <a href="../../../5/2E/4/5.45_x_39_mm.html" title="5.45 x 39 mm">5.45 × 39 mm</a>, which was used in the <a href="../../../a/k/-/AK-74_d2ee.html" title="AK-74">AK-74</a>, the successor of the <a href="../../../a/k/-/AK-47_b9b4.html" title="AK-47">AK-47</a>/AKM.</p>
<p>In the 1980s and 1990s, the most notable changes since adoption of high velocity, smaller-caliber ammunition were designs that utilized new form factors, sights, electronics, and materials, as well as modularity. A number of <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullpup.html" title="Bullpup">bullpup</a> rifles entered service in the late 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Although bullpup rifles had existed since the 1930s, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>'s <a href="../../../e/m/-/EM-2_a7e5.html" title="EM-2">EM-2</a> was one of the few bullpup assault rifles prior to this time. Examples of the new trend include the <a href="../../../f/a/m/FAMAS_%28rifle%29_2d5a.html" title="FAMAS (rifle)">FAMAS</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steyr_AUG_4f93.html" title="Steyr AUG">Steyr AUG</a>, and <a href="../../../s/a/8/SA80_6e36.html" title="SA80">SA80</a>. All three are bullpup rifles that make heavy use of composites and plastics, the <a href="../../../f/a/m/FAMAS_%28rifle%29_2d5a.html" title="FAMAS (rifle)">FAMAS</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steyr_AUG_4f93.html" title="Steyr AUG">Steyr AUG</a> both have ambidextrous controls, and the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steyr_AUG_4f93.html" title="Steyr AUG">Steyr AUG</a>, and <a href="../../../s/a/8/SA80_6e36.html" title="SA80">SA80</a> both added a low-power <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telescopic_sight.html" title="Telescopic sight">telescopic sight</a> to the standard service version. The <a href="../../../q/b/z/QBZ-95_2916.html" title="QBZ-95">QBZ-95</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/r/SAR-21_4a0d.html" title="SAR-21">SAR-21</a>, and the <a href="../../../t/a/v/Tavor_TAR-21_835b.html" title="Tavor TAR-21">Tavor TAR-21</a> follow a similar trend as well, with a bullpup configuration and heavy use of composites.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../h/e/c/Heckler_%26_Koch_G36_48d5.html" title="Heckler &amp; Koch G36">Heckler &amp; Koch G36</a>, adopted in the late 1990s by <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, is of the traditional configuration, but also has integral telescopic and red dot sights and composite exterior. The G36C variant uses a different barrel assembly, foregrip, and a slightly shorter folding stock to make the weapon carbine length, and features a low full-length rail mount along the top of the rifle in place of the carrying handle and sight assembly, plus shorter rails on the foregrip. The <a href="../../../x/m/8/XM8_rifle_2e5a.html" title="XM8 rifle">XM8 rifle</a>, developed from the G36, had similar features, but also added more electronics such as <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laser.html" title="Laser">laser</a> sight, round counter, and integral <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infrared.html" title="Infrared">infrared</a> laser and pointers.</p>
<p>Through the 1990s, modular accessories for use on rifles, of a variety of types, started to become widespread with the rapidly increasing practice of mounting Picatinny-style rails on firearms. This was primarily driven by the growing visibility (and number) of tactical police, counter-terrorist units, special forces, and other groups that desired the capability to specifically tailor their weapons — be it to the situation at hand, their operational specialty, etc. Flashlights, visible lasers, infrared lights and lasers, ergonomic accessories such as vertical foregrips and folding or collapsible buttstocks, and a plethora of other options appeared. Many law enforcement and tactical groups, including some of the most influential, also contributed to the progression by shifting from using submachine guns to very compact assault rifles, usually with small-caliber (5.56mm) ammunition.</p>

<p>Intertwined with the growth of the modular accessories was the concept of rifles being modular themselves. The G36, for example, can be converted to a compact carbine, a standard rifle, or a squad support weapon (light machine gun) and back again simply by swapping modular parts in a matter of moments. Interchangeable or quick-detachable barrel assemblies of different lengths are emerging for some weapons, with ingenious retrofit kits to provide similar capabilities on older types. The <a href="../../../a/r/1/AR15_9b5a.html" title="AR15">AR15</a> in particular has an entire industry that has grown to make variations of every component of the rifle. An incredible variety of upper receivers of many types of operation (bolt, direct gas impingement, gas piston, blowback) utilizing different ammunition than the original 5.56x45 mm have been developed, firing both pistol and rifle cartridges ranging between target rounds such as .17 and .22 Rimfire, pistol rounds of .380 ACP to .50 AE, and more common assault rifle rounds such as 7.62x51 mm, all the way up to heavy machine gun rounds such as the .50 BMG (12.7x99mm). In a paradox many never expected, an AK variant has been developed that fires the 5.56x45 mm round, while a variant of the M4 carbine (a compact M16) has been created that can use AK-47 magazines and its 7.62x39 mm ammunition.</p>
<p>The trend in the new designs, and very likely future ones, is towards more integrated features and lighter weight with new materials and configurations. Introduction of a new ammunition would require retooling factories, phasing out conventional ammunition, and making general infrastructure changes that are considered by many military planners to be too expensive to undertake. In an effort to avoid the problems of a completely new cartridge, the 77-grain Mk262 Mod0 bullet for the 5.56x45 mm chambering, developed to address continuing issues in some cases with the effectiveness of the 5.56 mm round, has started to gain acceptance.</p>

<p>Since the adoption of the M16 over the M14, some groups of shooting pundits have supported the return to, or reintroduction of, larger caliber rounds — usually the 7.62x51 mm NATO specifically, which is made to perform like the full-sized 30-06 in an assault-rifle sized cartridge. Going back to the 7.62 mm, it is argued, would improve conventional lethality. Other individuals have suggested an increase in caliber, to the 6–7 mm range, with rifle round velocities and lower mass bullets: a kind of intermediate philosophy between the smaller caliber–faster modern rounds and the standard caliber–slower rounds of the previous generation. <a href="../../../p/r/c/PRC_e01a.html" title="PRC">China</a> in the late 1980s introduced a 5.8 × 42 mm round, with an initial velocity of 930 m/s, 4.26 g bullet and 1,842 J of energy, China claims the new round provides superior performance and lethality to NATO (5.56 × 45 mm) and modern Soviet (5.45 × 39 mm) intermediate rounds.</p>

<p>A renaissance of 7.62 mm weapons has begun to occur recently. To some degree in Iraq, but particularly in Afghanistan, soldiers are beginning to use modernized <a href="../../../m/1/4/M14_rifle.html" title="M14 rifle">M14s</a>, <a href="../../../m/2/1/M21_Sniper_Weapon_System_e091.html" title="M21 Sniper Weapon System">M21s</a>, <a href="../../../m/2/4/M24_Sniper_Weapon_System_7556.html" title="M24 Sniper Weapon System">M24 SWSs</a>, and <a href="../../../a/r/1/AR10_4504.html" title="AR10">AR10s</a> (the 7.62x51 mm predecessor of the AR15). With a longer effective range, the 7.62x51 mm is proving useful at fighting at long ranges. The 7.62x51 NATO round has also shown its usefulness against enemies who have been seen to take several hits from 5.56 mm bullets and not be incapacitated, killed, or on occasion, even deterred.<sup id="_ref-bowden_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bowden" title="">[4]</a></sup> That unpleasant surprise is attributed to long-range ballistic deficiencies of the 5.56 bullet. Similar stopping-power problems against unusually-tenacious opponents were noticed in Somalia in 1993 against militia fighters high on <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khat.html" title="Khat">khat</a>.<sup id="_ref-bowden_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bowden" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the United States there have been developments of new cartridges. Two have developed some notability as possible replacements for the venerable 5.56, the <a href="../../../6/2E/5/6.5_Grendel_9711.html" title="6.5 Grendel">6.5 Grendel</a> and the 6.8mm SPC. <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remington_Arms_4872.html" title="Remington Arms">Remington</a> has developed the <a href="../../../6/2E/8/6.8_mm_Remington_SPC_cb38.html" title="6.8 mm Remington SPC">6.8 mm Remington SPC</a> cartridge, which has the same cartridge overall length (COAL) as the 5.56 x 45 mm NATO cartridge but fires the larger .270 caliber bullets. Likewise, Alexander Arms at Radford Arsenal developed the <a href="../../../6/2E/5/6.5_Grendel_9711.html" title="6.5 Grendel">6.5 Grendel</a> cartridge, which combines long range accuracy comparable to the 7.62 mm NATO with close range stopping power similar to the 6.8 SPC. With both bullets, by matching the 5.56's COAL, conversion of existing AR-15, M4 and M16 rifles requires only replacement of uppers and magazines. Other cartridges have been developed for the AR-15 platform such as the <a href="../../../2E/5/0/.50_Beowulf_519d.html" title=".50 Beowulf">.50 Beowulf</a> and the .458 Socom - but these cartridges are much heavier and relegated to a specialty role rather than as a pure assault rifle cartridge.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Assault_rifle.html" title="Edit section: The future">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The future</span></h2>
<p>Small arms technology including the assault rifle can be described as a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Product_life_cycle_management.html" title="Product life cycle management">mature technology</a>, meaning that no major technology changes can be expected in this area. However, minor improvements can still be expected that make the assault rifle more effective and efficient to accommodate the changes on the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle.html" title="Battle">battlefield</a>. Diminishing the effect of the assault rifle are improvements to <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullet-proof_vest.html" title="Bullet-proof vest">personal body armor</a>, which allow it to stop or hinder bullet penetration from intermediate <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliber.html" title="Caliber">caliber</a> <a href="../../../s/m/a/Small_arms.html" title="Small arms">small arms</a>.</p>
<p>As weapons evolve, the delicate balance for assault rifle systems between power, weight, recoil and terminal effects will likely shift once again in an attempt to defeat body armor, to match the range of full-power cartridges, and to penetrate through windshields and thin-skinned vehicles while still producing good terminal effects. Possible future directions are <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armor_piercing.html" title="Armor piercing">armor piercing</a> or exploding tip bullets or saboted sub-caliber <a href="../../../t/u/n/Tungsten.html" title="Tungsten">tungsten</a> darts, more powerful cartridges, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_fiber.html" title="Carbon fiber">carbon fiber</a> barrels and exotic alloys such as <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titanium.html" title="Titanium">titanium</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scandium.html" title="Scandium">scandium</a>.</p>

<p>Primarily limited to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, the term <i><a href="../../../a/s/s/Assault_weapon.html" title="Assault weapon">assault weapon</a></i> is a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics.html" title="Politics">political</a> term, separate from the military definition, used to describe a variety of semi-automatic firearms that have certain, mostly cosmetic features associated with military or police firearms. The 1994 <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Assault_Weapons_Ban_994e.html" title="Federal Assault Weapons Ban">Federal Assault Weapons Ban</a>, which expired on September 13, 2004, defined the rifle type of assault weapon as a semiautomatic firearm with the ability to accept a detachable magazine, and two or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Folding or telescoping stock</li>
<li>Conspicuous <a href="../../../p/i/s/Pistol_grip.html" title="Pistol grip">pistol grip</a></li>

<li><a href="../../../g/r/e/Grenade_launcher.html" title="Grenade launcher">Grenade launcher</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A common public misconception persists that the assault weapons ban restricted weapons capable of fully automatic fire, such as assault rifles and <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machine_gun.html" title="Machine gun">machine guns</a>. Fully automatic weapons, however, were unaffected by the ban, and have been continuously and heavily regulated since the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Firearms_Act_d3c0.html" title="National Firearms Act">National Firearms Act</a> of 1934. Subsequent laws such as the <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun_Control_Act_of_1968_ad36.html" title="Gun Control Act of 1968">Gun Control Act of 1968</a> and the <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firearm_Owners_Protection_Act_5c60.html" title="Firearm Owners Protection Act">Firearm Owners Protection Act</a> of 1986 also affected the importation and civilian ownership of fully automatic firearms.</p>

<p>Currently there is new bill submitted by MCCARTHY of New York to re-ban previous firearms of the original AWB and expand to include many other firearms previously not considered to be assault weapons. The bill, as is drafted, has an "other uses" clause that may be used to expand the concept of an assault weapon to others not previously included. The new bill like the previous AWB again targets semi-automatic rifles and not true assault rifles which are capable of burst or full automatic fire.<a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h110-1022" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h110-1022" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> However this bill directly contradicts rulings made on the 1986 Gun Owners Protection Act.</p>
