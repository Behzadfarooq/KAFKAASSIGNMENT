<li><b>Strong Oppose</b>. I'm more interested in the well-oiled workings of Wikipedia than political correctness. "Assyrian people" is much more likely to be used as a link in an article than "Arameans, Assyrians, Chaldeans and Syriacs". Anyone who would find "Assyrians" offensive should really examine their priorities, since the significance of most of these ethnic groups faded out millennia ago. Besides which, most of those groups already have their own pages. See <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaldean.html" title="Chaldean">Chaldean</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramean.html" title="Aramean">Aramean</a>. In English, <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syriac.html" title="Syriac">Syriac</a> is a synonym for Aramean.

<li>Our buddy Benne here seems to be trying to hide facts here. I have proven this fellow to be a propergandish person in other pages that goes around in Germany wikipedia and changes any reference to Assyrians into "Aramaean." If you go look at the Germany Wikipedia of the page Chaldean, you will see it states "Chaldeans are Aramaeans" - This is the work of our buddy Benne. Now, for the claim he makes: <b>Calling Aramaeans "Assyrians" is considered offensive by many</b> - Benne here is not telling you what this "aramaean" movement is all about and the size of it. Fact 1. The word "Aramaean" is nowhere to be found in the Middle East. Nobody in the region calls themselfs as. Fact 2. "Aramaean" ethnicity is only being claimed by a small population of <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syriac_Orthodox_f293.html" title="Syriac Orthodox">Syriac Orthodox</a> members in Germany and Sweden. How small you ask? Out of the 1.5 million Syriac speaking people, an estimate 80,000 leave in Germany and Sweden. Of course not all of them belong ot Syriac Orthodox church - that cuts down the number dramatically, and not everyone within the Syriac Orthodox Church is going with this idea of "Aramaean" ethnicity - so in the end, your looking at 1% of the total Syraye population claiming this "Aramaean" ethnicity. So where going to be worried about offending 1% of the population Subject on Wikipedia? If thats the case, then I'm sure there are some Kurds who don't liked to be under the title of <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_people.html" title="Iranian people">Iranian people</a>. So are we going to change that as well? Just wanted to fill in everyone about the roots of this issue. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaldean_d16d.html" title="User:Chaldean">Chaldean</a> 14:29, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I did make a few edits changing "Assyrer" to "Aramäer", and I admit that in one case I made a mistake, but your statement is a downright exaggeration. (Please note that the ethnonym "Aramäer" is quite widespread in Germany.)</dd>

<dd>I continued to be appalled by the bad nature of comments about this article. The subject of moving to this very page was discussed informally a while ago. Currently, the article refers not only to Assyrians but to Arameans, Chaldeans and Syriacs as well. Although I believe, as do most others, that these different designations apply to one and the same people, no one designation is accepted by the people as a whole. The majority of West Syrians choose not to call themselves Assyrian, or identify with what they perceive is the political agenda of Assyrian Nationalists. If this article continues to be called 'Assyrian people' (even though it explicitly states throughout that other groups who reject that title are included), it will remain seriously biased. If information about those who reject Assyrian idenity is removed, they will be cut off from their shared heritage. I know Syriac and Aramaic, I've read the historical documentation and I have many friends who use another identity to Assyrian just as their parents and grandparents have done. Covering this up is an ideological whitewash. — <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 18:24, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Assyrian National Identity</span></h2>
<p><b>Gareth Hughes: What we have here is a mockery of truth. You deleted the information about the Assyrians which I posted on the front page. Seems like this is a game for you, truth does not seem matter and you are determent to fool people to believe what you want them to. What happened to presenting a neutral point of view? Neutral point of view means to present both sides of the argument and let the reader make up his own mind. Every facts I posted which you removed I can document not by quoting someone's opinion but by hard facts from the ancient and medieval sources but you are not interested in facts. What kind of bigotry is this?</b> warda</p>
<p>You have no knolwdge of the Assyrian history yet you pretend to know it all. Which part of these facts you can not believe so that I provide you ancient referrences to prove them right.</p>
<p>All nations have grown and evolved by assimilating other people. After centuries of intermarriage they become united and share a specific homeland, unique culture, history, language, and identity. There is no reason to judge the Assyrian by a different standard. After their defeat Assyrian were ruled by the conquering nations who did not spoke the Syriac language nor worshiped as the Assyrian did, therefore there was little assimilation favoring the Assyrian. It is true that the Syriac language was spoken by the Assyrians and the people west of Euphrates in Syria and beyond, but at a time when most people during their life time traveled no farther than ten miles from where they were born such cross countries assimilation was not possible.</p>
<p>Much has been made of the Arab tribes who after becoming Christian learned to speak the Syriac language but they lived mostly in tribal communities in Syria and the border region of southern Mesopotamia. There is no reason to believe they intermarried with none Arabs. It is known fact that they sided with their Moslem brethren against the Romans and the Persians revealing their unshakable loyalty to their Arab identity. Most converted to Islam voluntarily and the rest were forced to do so by Muslim Arab rulers. See; <a href="http://www.muhammadanism.org/bell/origin/p182.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.muhammadanism.org/bell/origin/p182.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.muhammadanism.org/bell/origin/p182.htm</a></p>
<p>Being Christians was not a license for wholesale intermarriage between different nationalities and culture. For example Assyrians and Armenians have lived in neighboring communities during most of the Christian centuries, but there was no wholesale intermarriage between the two. Other factors such as ancestry, language, culture and the community pride did not allow this. One can also cite none marriage between the Assyrians and the contemporary so-called 'Arab Christians' of Iraq; i.e. none Arabs who have long forgotten the speaking of the Syriac language therefore consider themselves Arab.</p>
<p>Christians in central Persia were predominantly Syriac speaking prisoners from Syria and Mesopotamia relocated during various wars. The native Persians were forbidden to convert to Christianity and when they did they were harshly persecuted and even killed. Learning the Syriac language was not mandatory for those who become Christians. In a letter to a Persian archbishop called Mina by the seventh century Patriarch Ghivargis (660-686), he writes: “we have written this in the Persian language [so that you can understand it better]. Read it through several time, until thou understandest it perfectly.” The Persian Christians according to Patriarch Eisho-yahab far more willingly converted to Islam as early as the 7th century.</p>
<p>All references to the Kurds in the Syriac language show that they lived in the mountains of Zaqrouz and often came down to plunder.</p>
<p>The Turkish tribes who converted to Christianity lived in central Asia. According to one Syriac document they had translated the two Testaments into their own language. Those who were brought by the Caliphs as mercenaries were Muslims and others who later arrived as invaders were neither christians nor spoke the Syriac language. The very fact that Turks today speak the Turkish language proves this fact.</p>
<p>The Christians among the Mongols were few and far in between. they were mostly the wives of the mongolian Chiefs such as the wife of Changiz khan and the wife of Hallaku but neither the father nor the son practiced Christianity. Within thirty years after their arrival in Mesopotamia Mongols for all practical purposes become Muslim because it far suited their temperament than the pacifist form of Christianity which the Assyrians practiced. The claim that the Mongolian spoke the syriac language is not true.</p>
<p>Overwhelming evidence indicate that Christian Assyrian identified themselves as Suryaye and Attouraye (Assyrian) and were identified by others as such therefore there it is unreasonable to ignore this realty. See www.christiansofiraq.com/facts.html</p>
<p>The tendency to question the contemporary Assyrian identity results from lack of knowledge of their history. For example Nineveh which was destroyed in 612 B.C. was resettled and according to Joan Oates, 'babylon' it was a considerable town during the Parthian and the Sassanian period. During Christianity it was the sacred city of the Christian Assyrian including the Syrian Orthodox Church. A special fast called the Rogation of the Ninevites has been observed by the Assyrians since the early Christianity as tribute to their ancient forefathers, which has survived to this day.</p>
<p>The ancient Assyrian new year was celebrated in the city of Edessa or Urhay in mid 2nd century of Christianity according to Eusibius of Ceasarea. The Principle deities worshiped there were Nebu and Bel. The city of Ashur was resettled and the Assyrian god Ashur was worshiped there way into Christianity. Temples for Ashur Bel, Sin, Nergal and other deities were discovered in the city of Hatra of the Christian era. The central Assyria was always known as Attour in the Syriac manuscripts throughout Christianity. Why would a people other than Assyrians want to preserve the memory of the ancient Assyrians and identify themselves as their descendants if they were not. The Parthians had changed the name of Central Assyrians to Hadiab, the Arabs called the land Iraq. the Kurds who currently rule northern Iraq call the land Kurdistan. To say that Assyrians called themselves Assyrians only because they lived in Assyria is absurd because no one forced them to call it by that name. By the 16th century the Assyrians had survived primarily in the plain of nineveh, the mountains north of Mosul, the Tur-abedin region in southwest Turkey and Urmia in northwest Persia in a triangular area no larger than a hundred miles on each side.</p>
<p>King Legit: By the very fact that you write Assyrians slaughtered people and then deported them you are contradicting yourself. You betray your lack of knowledge of the Assyrians and even other nations. I suggest you read the following site to inform yourself. <a href="http://www.aina.org/ata/20060331182602.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.aina.org/ata/20060331182602.htm" rel="nofollow">Cruelty of Nations and the Holier Than Thou Preaching</a> warda</p>
<hr />
<p>King Legit: All nations have assimilated others who become part of them, this is how nations are formed and grow. The conquerers do not get assimilated by the conquered people, it is always the other way around. The ancestors of the modern Assyrians are the ancient Assyrians, historical evidences attest to their survival into christianity. See: <a href="http://www.christiansofiraq.com/facts.html" class="external text" title="http://www.christiansofiraq.com/facts.html" rel="nofollow">references to Assryians during all centuries</a></p>

Why would a people other than Assyrians want to preserve the memory of the ancient Assyrians and identify themselves as their descendants if they are not . Did the Arab conquererss did that? The answer is no, they called the land Iraq . Do the Kurds who have taken over northern Iraq call it Assyria? The answer is no, they call it Kurdistan. Christian Assyrians have called themselves Assyrians side by side with Suraye and have been known as such by anyone who has come in contact with them.Those who call themselves Assyrians are the remnants of the Christian inhabitants of northern Mesopotamia the homeland of the Assyrians. Anyone who will deny their Assyrian identity might a well deny the identity of all other nations and force them to call themselves by some other name.</p>
<p>Gareth Hughes or UTC who control the information on this Wikipedia site are not interested in thousands of facts confirming our Assyrian identity or provide factual information about the Assyrians. They seem to be driven by a desire to question the identity of today's Assyrians even if it means undermining their rights in their historic homeland in Iraq. By undermining the Assyrian identity of our people they are not only helping their adversaries also contribute to our disunity and decline regardless of what we call ourselves. They have no idea what they are doing but are too arrogant to realize it. <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warda.html" title="Warda">Warda</a></p>

<p>King Legit. Assyrians have varied complexions as all other nations do. Assyrians have been driven out of their homeland and have lived in various climates for example in Urmia it snows in the winter and the temperature declines below zero but not in northern iraq which has a desert climate. How dark or light a people are depends on the temperature of where they have lived for many centuries. <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warda.html" title="Warda">Warda</a> I am from Urmia but when I look at pictures of the Assyrians of Iraq I can see how similar their features are to those whom I have known in Urmia. By the way Sargon or Sharu-kinu means just king and not legit king.</p>
<hr />
<p>Assyria deported all the mentioned groups and Assyrianized them. I've said this before. It isn't something really to be proud of because people were slaughtered yet that is the reality. There is no way to tell who the Ancestors of the modern Assyrians are. They include all of the conquered peoples of the lands taken by the Assyrians as well as the conquerors of the Assyrians. These are all possibilities and nothing can be outright proven for or against. Just look at Assyrians' physical appearances. Some are dark, some are light, some have dark hair, some have red, blonde, brown, etc. Some are tall and some are short, some have completely different facial features from others yet all are united in that they share the same fate. The fate of Babylon. If the tower of Babylon teaches us anything it's that ultimately when something falls it falls hard and the Assyrian nation fell hard and it is still trying to regroup and make another run to the top. Look at all the confusion. We are Assyrians, we also maybe descended of all the previous groups as well yet we can't prove which we're mainly descended of. Let's say the United Kingdom falls and the countries are divided. Are the "immigrants" not the recent ones but the Anglo-Saxons going to claim that they are actually <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britons.html" title="Britons">Britons</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/y/Brythons.html" title="Brythons">Brythons</a>)???

<p><b>Strong Oppose</b>Mr Hughs; with all due respect, you are neither a member of this commuinty nor a scholar of such identity issues. Furthermore, as a so-called "west-syrian" Assyrian I am appalled at your appellations issue. The facts are simple and are not to be discredited. I refer you to Simo Parpola (scholar of Assyriology) for a discussion of the modern Assyrian heritage. Furthermore, the term Syriac-speaking Christian is ridicultous in that the modern language of these people is in fact not so-called classical Syriac. Secondly....calling someone a Syriac is grammatically incorrect. Syriac comes from the Latin Syriacus...It is a western word and concept for an Eastern people. Thirdly...it is an adjective refering to a church based liturgical language. Not a noun.</p>
<p>It continues to amuse me that even in cyberspace Baathism, Kurdification, and Anti-Assyrianism can run rampant and an Englishman is the one who is in charge of editing a page on a people who are quite capable of explaining themselves in their own terms.</p>
<p>The ethnic designation is Assyrian...add all the other names as religious titles only. You would only find Assyrians as members of all the above mentioned church communities. There are no Chaldean "West Syrians"...no West Syrian Chaldeans....no Nestorian Chaldeans....and no Nestorian Arameans...its simple logic...lets use it <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Branchala (<a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBranchala_098a.html" title="User talk:Branchala">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Branchala_758c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Branchala">contribs</a>) 07:32, 16 May 2006.</small></p>

<dd>Dear Branchala, I see that you are a new user who has contributed nothing except to talk pages on this article. You are perhaps then a sockpuppet or someone enrolled from a forum outside of Wikipedia. Your first sentence presumes to know me, which is rather insulting from someone who remains anonymous. I oppose an Assyrian <i>whitewash</i> because there are a large number of West Syriacs who do not wish to be called Assyrian. To include them under the label Assyrian or to exclude them from their heritage is an insult. I know Aramaic, and a number of modern and classical dialects. I have also read historical texts on the issues of identification. I am asking th community to recognise that a substantial proportion of the people have never used the identity Assyrian to this day. — <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 18:07, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>To UTC</b></p>
<p>UTC: You are the one who is insulting the Assyrians by using your control over this site to spread false anti Assyrian information to divide our people and contribute to their decline. There is no reason for those who do not wish to be identified as Assyrians to be included on a page dedicated to the "Assyrian people". If they do not want to be known as Assyrians they have the right to do so but should leave us alone. You are disregarding and removing all the information attesting to the Assyrian identity and substituting anti Assyrian information on the page about them. this can hardly be considered scholarly.</p>
<p>IF you think you know so much about the Assyrian history list the names of the Church of the East bishops of Nineveh. Let us know what the 13th century Givargis Warda identified his people as. He was not involved in today’s arguments for you to claim 'Assyrian white wash'. What did the 4th century Mar Aprim wrote about the baoota d Ninvayee? if you can not answer these questions you do not qualify to judge our identity. If you can why would you question our Assyrian identity.</p>
<p>What you write on this site has real-life negative ramification for the Christians of Iraq. It contributes to the Kudish and Arab propaganda to question their identity and redefine them as Chrisitan Kurds or Christian Arabs. Saddam Hossain did not allow the Assryians to be counted as Assyrians in the Iraqi census. They could only be counted as Arabs or Kurds. He forced people to sign ethnic correction papers declaring themselves Arabs. Kurds in some instances are no better than Saddam. Why would you like to help such people to disposses Assyrians of their identity? This is not a game. You are helping the Kurds to take away the christian towns and villages by claiming they are not the original people of these lands and asserting that northern Iraq has always been Kurdish homeland, even though they arrived there mostly during the last two centuries.</p>
<p>The real Arameans have already been Arabized, and you seem to help the extinction of the Assyrians also. As a people without a country Assyrians have little or no resources to defend themselves against the Arabization and the Kurdification propaganda in the Middle East with help by what you write on this site. How can you sleep at night knowing you are part of this injustice?</p>
<p>The Aramean identity of the members of the syrian Orthodox church began when in 1952 Patriarch Aprim Barsoum decided to distance his followers from the members of the Church of the East. You can read about it at: <a href="http://christiansofiraq.com/joseph/reply2.html" class="external text" title="http://christiansofiraq.com/joseph/reply2.html" rel="nofollow">The syrian Orthodox Church</a> Why are you disregarding these facts. Mar Zakha the present Patriarch of the Syrian Orthodox Church recently in an Arabic article defined his people as Christian Arabs, which means those who call themselves as Arameans are on their way to be Arabized. Are you now going to include Arabs among an entry about the "Assyrian people"? What kind of encyclopedia is this which considers its primary mission to question the identity of the Assyrians? How can it be trusted if it disregards facts. warda</p>
<p><b>The follwing was deleted from the front page of this site.</b></p>
<p>There is an obvious anti Assyrianism in the Wikipedia entry about the Assyrians. Its writer’s intentions are to cast doubt about the identity of the Christian Assyrians leading the readers to believe that they are not who they claim to be. One has to wonder why he judges the Assyrians by a different standard than other nations? God did not create any nation with a specific DNA. Such inherited properties came about because of centuries of intermarriage. All nations have evolved by gradually assimilating people of other origin through conquest or migration.</p>
<p>During the last few decades alone tens of million of none Europeans such as Turks, Arabs, Indians and Pakistanis have migrated to Germany, France and England. In time they will become assimilated into the general population therefore according to this writer’s logic the English, the French and the Germans no longer should be considered pure blooded and not the same people as they were before, therefore any reference to them should include doubt about the varasity of their identity and they should be forced by Wikidepia to change the name they call their nation. When are we going to force the Arabs, the Turks, the Persians in fact all the nations of the world to renounce their ancient identity because they have assimilated people of other nationalities by millions? Why does this writer discriminate against the Assyrians? Most of what he claims is attempt to discount the identity of the Assyrians and question their racial purity a throw back to the Nazi era which ended with the death of millions because they were not Arians.</p>
<p>It is true that the syriac language was spoken in Mesopotamia and other countries west of Ehuprates it did not mean there was wholesale marriage among people in these various countries, especially at a time when most people did not travel more than ten miles beyond where they were born. from before Christianity up to the 7th century the region west of Ehphrates was dominated by the Romans while Mesopotamia was part of the Persian empire.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that the Persians or the Kurds abandoned their langauge and spoke Syriac.The perssian language was known as Pahlavie classified as Indo-European and the Kurd spoke the same langauge they do today. There is not evidence that the Persians who became Christians had to abandon their identity and their mother tongue. For example in a letter written to a Persian archbishop by the seventh century Patriarch Geivargis (660-686), writes: “we have written this in the Persian language [so that you can understand it better]. Read it through several time, until thou understandest it perfectly.” In another document Patriarch Ishu Jahab (650-660) complains that Christians of Persia are voluntarily converting to Islam even when they are not being forced to do so.</p>
<p>Kurds are new arrivals to Mesopotamia. Until a couple centuries ago they lived primarily in western region of Persia and the mountains between Iran and Turkey. There is no indication they spoke the Syriac language. After converting to Islam they became the persecuters of the Christians.</p>
<p>Being Christians was not a license for wholesale intermarriage between different nationalities. For example Assyrians and Armenians have lived in neighboring communities during most of the Christian centuries but there has not been wholesale intermarriage between them. Other factors such as ancestry, language, culture and the community pride did not allow this. Since the Christian Assyrians have only called themselves as Suryaye and Attouraye (Assyrians) it is preposterous to doubt their identity . See www.christiansofiraq.com/facts.html</p>
<p>It is true that some Christian Arab tribes spoke the Syriac language but they lived mostly in tribal communities in Syria and the border region of the southern Mesopotamia. There is no reason to believe they intermarried with none Arab Christians. It is a known fact that they sided with their Moslem brethren in wars with the Romans and the Persians which indicates their loyalty rested with their Arab identity even after becoming christian. Most converted to Islam voluntarily and the rest were forced to do so by the Arab rulers. See; <a href="http://www.muhammadanism.org/bell/origin/p182.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.muhammadanism.org/bell/origin/p182.htm" rel="nofollow">Christian Arabs</a></p>
<p>The Turks who converted to Christianity did not arrive in Mesopotamia. The Turks who were brought by the Caliphs as mercenaries were Muslims and others who later arrived as invaders were neither christians nor spoke the Syriac language. The very fact that Turks today speak the Turkish language proves this fact.</p>
<p>The Christians among the Mongols were few and far in between. they were mostly the Ugarit princess married to the mongolian Chiefs such as the wife of Changiz khan, the mother of Hallaku khan and his wife and few others. There is no evidence that tChangiz or his son practiced christianity. Within three decades after arrival in Mesopotamia the Mongols for all practical purposes become Muslims and had joined others in persecuting the Christians. The claim that the Mongolian spoke the syriac language or they intermarried with the native Christians is an exaggeration. In all cases when a person married outside the Assyrian community he/she no longer belonged to it. These and other facts indicate that the Wikidepia attempt to question the Assyrian identity of the Christians of Mesopotamia is based on lack of knowledge and bias.</p>
<p>Assimilation process often flows from the subject people toward the ruling nation, from the poor and powerless to the rich and mighty. Since Assyrians after their fall did not have invading armies to force their identity on others nor they had wealth or power to entice others to assume their identity one can argue that they are racially purer than all other nations who have during their hisoty assimilated millions of various nationalities. One has to wonder when the above writer intends to force all nations to renounce their identity since at one time or another they assimilated people of other nationalities. If he will not do that why is he discriminating against the Assyrians? warda</p>

<p>The main criteria for an ethnic group is its people's common self-identification under one name (or at least two or several 'cognate' names). There are ethnic groups who maybe maybe dialectical, differences in speech but still all are defined as one ethnic group, On the other hand there are peoples who while all speaking SAME language but do not consider themselves to belong to one ethnic group. Then if for example, Syriacs don't identify themselves as Assyrian then there is no need to labell them like that. Ankawa.com is a very famous Chaldean, Assyrian, Syriac homepage. It enlists all names together rather than choosing only one of them. <a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJalalarbil_1bfb.html" title="User:Jalalarbil">Jalalarbil</a> 19:04, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>UTC- The only reason Chaldean and syriac are used is because there is a tendency for the these other denominations to segregate their members from the others not only reliously also socially. By pretending that the name of their church is also their ethnic identity they want to disourage their people to join the other denomination. Chaldean is a religioius denomination while Assyrian is a national identity. The term Syriac was ordered by the Bishops of the Syrian Orthodox Church before the US census of 2000, in an attempt to discourage their members from identifying themselves as Assyrians, or Syrians. You seem to think that any name any bishop or Patriarch decides to call his people with is their true national identity. warda</p>

<dd>Unfortunately, <i>Mesopotamian people</i> is just too vague to be any good. Such a term might be construed as including groups who have quite different cultural backgrounds but who happen to live in the region. In reply to Chaldean: I believe the majority of Syriac Orthodox and Syrian Catholics reject the designation Assyrian, and they prefer to be known as Syriacs, Syrians or Aramaeans. A small number of Chaldeans prefer to use that designation rather than Assyrian. Unfortunately, there is no worldwide survey of which designations people prefer, so this has to be based on experience. The leadership of the Syriac Orthodox and Syrian Catholic churches use Suryani/Suryoye as their official designation, and many of the faithful use that as their cultural designation, using Assuri/Othuroye to describe members of the church of the East. This is my experience: please include your experience as evidence for my remarks being untrue. We can only speak of what we know. — <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 22:39, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Gareth, it was you that started to put info on the Assyrian people page about the Syriac Orthodox Church. Who is forcing them to be part of the Assyrian people? Look at beginning stages of this page, do you see any mentioning of Syriac Orthodox members? If you think I am trying to paint everyone as Assyrian, then by ALL means remove any reference to Syriac Orthodox members on this page. Will that satisfy you? I am in no way supportive of putting the Syriac Orthodox members grouped with us. But one thing Gareth; where should these people go? So are they arab? Aramaean? Or only Christian? (Suryoyo/Suraya) - ok, so they dont care that much about what ethnicity they are, but they call themselfs mostly "Christian" in Sureth - ok now why should the Assyrian page be hurt because of this? If they wish not to be called any ethnicity, but only Surayes/Suryoyos, then thats more the fine! Please remove any reference or claim of these people from this page. So then what is the problem?</p>

<dd>The problem is that church membership has very much contributed to how the people see themselves. There are differences in culture between different groups from different areas, but these are quite minor when seen in the overall shared culture. A substantial number of Syriac Orthodox regard themselves as ethnic Assyrians, but a larger number describe themselves as Syriac or Syrian. Read the <a href="http://www.euroamericans.net/euroamericans.net/census2000.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.euroamericans.net/euroamericans.net/census2000.htm" rel="nofollow">US census</a> to see that <i>Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac</i> is one line together (note that Arab—Syrian is quite separate). Increasing numbers of Syriac Orthodox young people are identifying as Assyrian, where their parents and grandparents did not. Many Syriacs feel very strongly about their identity being labelled as Assyrian. — <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 10:58, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Referring to the people concerned</span></h2>
<p>Since the name <i>Syriacs</i> is known to be used referring to either (1) all <i>Suryāye</i> or (2) only the people from the West Syriac tradition (i.e., Syriac Orthodox, Syriac Catholics, Syriac Protestants, according to some also Maronites), and on the other hand the name <i>Assyrians</i> is found referring to (1) members of the (Assyrian) Church of the East, or (2) all people from the East Syriac tradition (i.e., members of the Church of the East and of the Chaldean Catholic Church), or (3) to all <i>Suryāye</i>, and there is apparently no consensus on how to refer these people, neither within the various communities itself nor in academics, I think we should have a thorough debate on this question here.</p>
<p>I believe it is not Wikipedia's task to solve this problem, but I am strongly convinced that WP should describe the people concerned in a way that is in line with its <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> principles.</p>
<p>My suggestion would be to refer to the West Syriacs, a.k.a. the Suryoye, as <i>West Syriacs</i>. Referring to the West Syriacs solely as Arameans or Assyrians will not be acceptable to many. Besides, the majority of the people in Turkey call themselves <i>Süryani</i> anyway.</p>
<p>I am not very familiar with the East Syriac tradition, but I can imagine using an umbrella name like <i>Assyro-Chaldeans</i>. I urge other contributors to react, and to come up with alternatives.</p>
<p>Please do not think that I am pro or against any self-appellation, for I am not. All I want to do is contribute to presenting an image that is balanced, and complete, including all groups and subgroups. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenne_3d1e.html" title="User:Benne">Benne</a> ['bɛnə] <sub>(<a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenne_fa1a.html" title="User talk:Benne">talk</a>)</sub> 16:52, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>the Suryoye, as West Syriacs. Referring to the West Syriacs solely as Arameans or Assyrians will not be acceptable to many.</i> - I agree with this. Go ahead, BUT you have to remember some things when writing this article, 1. <b>A small minority</b> within the overall Syriac Orthodox Church members consider themselfs "Aramaean"..you keep on trying to push this idea as if Syriac Orthodox Church members consider themselves a type of ethnicity, which is not true at all. They see themselfs as Christians. 2. You can't neglet the fact the the word "Aramaean" is nowhere to be found in the Middle East today. 3. You can't neglet the fact that some Syriac Orthodox Church members see themselves as Assyrian as well. Going from Syriac Orthodox Church officals, like the late Bishop Cicek to ancient officals like 12th century Syriac Orthodox Patriarch Michael the Great.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../s/y/r/Syriacs.html" title="Syriacs">Syriacs</a> can't directly go straight to this new "Western Syriacs" page..I suggest it to be a disambiguation page. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaldean_d16d.html" title="User:Chaldean">Chaldean</a> 03:09, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>1. Neither I nor you can provide statistics on the number of Suryoye who consider themselves Arameans or Assyrians, because there no such statistics. All I can say is that I've met both, in Turkey as well as in Western Europe. My impression is that the majority just call themselves <i>Suryoye</i>.</dd>
<dd>2. Well, I beg to differ. Like I said, I have met Suryoye who think of themselves as Arameans. And concerning your remark about Patriarch Michael, I found a citation that says: 'Michael, a 12th century Syriac-Orthodox Patriarch (d. 1199 A.D.), wrote in his voluminous Chronicle about 'the kingdoms which have been established in Antiquity by our race, (that of) the Aramaeans [oromoye], namely the descendants of Aram, who were called Syrians [suryoye].' [<a href="http://www.saeyc.com/en/index.php?do=4" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.saeyc.com/en/index.php?do=4" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] I admit, this is pro-Aramean website, but lets look up what the Patriarch wrote and cite that here on Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>3. I do not deny that. I am aware of that.

The term "Aramaean" should be completly removed from this page as these people dont consider themselves Assyrian in the first place.</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/u/r/Suryoyo_people.html" title="Suryoyo people">Suryoyo people</a> or Suryoye people - where it should mostly consentrate on Syriac Orthodox people. The term Aramaean should not be all over this page, as we have established that most Syraic Orthodox do not identify with this "Aramaean" movement, but, there should be a small section in the page that talks about how <i>some</i> Syriac Orthodox members consider themselves as ethnically Aramaean. I want to make sure that this page will not be a page that promotes the idea of "Aramaeanism".</li>

<dd>I agree with the split. I think we could also use "West Syriacs" for the Suryoye, but let's see what others think about this. Syriacs could be a disambiguation page.</dd>
<dd>However, I would still like to see an article that deals with the overall history of both West and East Syriacs, and about the various theories on the origin of the word <i>Suryāyā</i>. What should that article be called? Should we use <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syriac_Christianity_8c87.html" title="Syriac Christianity">Syriac Christianity</a> for that? Or make it a separate article?</dd>
<dd>I am not so sure about the following statement: "as we have established that most Syriac Orthodox do not identify with this "Aramaean" movement". Who has established this? What are the sources? I would like to suggest the following site to you: <a href="http://www.urhoy.info/2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.urhoy.info/2.html" rel="nofollow">Urhoy</a>, that cites a lot of sources (including Greek and Syriac classics`) that state that the Syrians/Syriacs were originally called Aramaeans. ----<b><a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenne_3d1e.html" title="User:Benne">Benne</a></b> ['bɛnə] <sub>(<a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenne_fa1a.html" title="User talk:Benne">talk</a>)</sub> 15:36, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>* 1. In terms of establishment, you said it in your own words; "Besides, the majority of the people in Turkey call themselves Süryani anyway." And what do you think it means when Syriacs allinge themselves with organization in Europe with names suchs as "Assyrian Chaldean Syraini..." mean to you? It means they definatly are not for Aramaeanism. I think it should be taken as it is in that majority of Syriac Orthodox members dont call themselves Aramaean or Assyrian. By the way, you are aware Aramaean is nowhere to be found in Iraq too right? And like you said before, Syriac Orthodox members in Iraq may number as much as 80,000.<a href="http://www.assyriansofkurdistan.com/informer.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.assyriansofkurdistan.com/informer.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. See, this is the reason why I hesitated to split all the pages in the first place, because I knew you would try to make the page of Syraic Orthodox concentrating around the idea of "Aramaeanism". If I drop the idea of trying to "Assyrianing" Syriac Orthodox (which I haven't, but according to you I have) then why can't you drop your idea of trying to "Aramaeaning" them? I agree that <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syriacs.html" title="Syriacs">Syriacs</a> should be a disambiguation page.

<li>Yes, it's my impression that most of the Suryoye in Turkey call themselves <i>Süryani</i>, but that's not an established fact (there simply are no statistics, as far as I know). At the same time, quite a few Suryoye I talked to said they consider themselves Aramaeans ethnically, but call themselves Suryoye to distinguish themselves from the pagan Aramaeans, or to stress their Syriac Christian heritage. One elder pointed out to me Genesis 10:22 "The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.", saying the Aramaeans and Assyrians are each other's cousins, and Genesis 25:20: "And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian." It's not my intention to overemphasise the Aramaean heritage of the (West) Syriacs, all I want to do is mention the sources that equate Aramaeans with Syrians, <i>and</i> include information about the Aramaean movement among the Syriacs.</li>
<li>What do you mean by <i>this is all in terms of literacy, not ethnically</i>? What do you think of the following citations from Patriarch Michael: <i>"The kingdoms which have been established in antiquity by our race, (that of) the Arameans, namely the descendants of Aram, who were called Syrians."</i> and <i>"The Children of Shem are the Assyrians, the Chaldeans, the Ludians and the Arameans who are the Syrians, the Hebrews and the Persians"</i>? And what about Bar Bahlul's statement that <i>"The Arameans then, whom the Greeks call Syrians, took hold of Aram."</i>? You can even find citations from Chaldean clerics on the site I mentioned. All these sources are verifiable.</li>
<li>Previously, I suggested including the information in the <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syriac_Christianity_8c87.html" title="Syriac Christianity">Syriac Christianity</a>, but Gareth said he preferred to have the article deal with the churches, and not with the question of ethnicity. It's still my preferred location for describing the <i>Suryâye</i> in general. ----<b><a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenne_3d1e.html" title="User:Benne">Benne</a></b> ['bɛnə] <sub>(<a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenne_fa1a.html" title="User talk:Benne">talk</a>)</sub> 16:20, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>well forget about 'political correctness', the title of the page isn't flippin' capitalized! come on! and as for the rest, i tried to fix what i could, but my knowledge on this subject isnt extensive enough to be able to make all the changes i wanted to. This is a very poorly written article, and it's barely at all about their history, which i would think would be obligatory to keep up wikipedia's standard of excellence. this is a very confusing article for one who is unfamiliar with the Assyrians history and the shuffling back and forth of names and languages and foreign terms is quite frustrating. the section headings under 'identity' dont make sense, especially the multiple question marks, and there doesnt seem to be any discussion of the Assyrians when they ruled in very early times, when they were conquered by the Medes. oh, and the section on Assyrian music is entirely pointless, that tells the reader absolutely nothing about Assyrian music except how many periods there were. doesnt say when, doesnt elaborate at all, and is generally on the scale of the rest of the article, except that it's at least grammatically correct. geez 70.213.187.40 00:17, 13 June 2006 (UTC)Mica Shista</p>

<li>Whether or not modern Assyrians are descended from ancient Assyrians is still highly debated, so what's written in the history section is rather limited due to Wikipedia's factual policies.</li>
<li>The music section (like all of Wikipedia) is a work in progress.

<dd>Hi, I did go to that website that you said [khaldu.org] and what I read was "Contemporary Chaldeans and Assyrians:One Primordial Nation" - so would you like to explain yourself a little bit more or will you refuse to open your base of knowledge outside of your <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloomfield_Hills_8baa.html" title="Bloomfield Hills">Bloomfield Hills</a> community&#160;:) <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaldean_d16d.html" title="User:Chaldean">Chaldean</a> 17:18, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Final Solution 2</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Revamp this page and delete any refrence to "Aramaean" (since those who identify themselves Aramaean, refuse there Assyrian identity</li>
<li>Create a seperate page called <a href="../../../s/u/r/Suryoyo.html" title="Suryoyo">Suryoyo</a> - Talking about Syriac Orthodox, with a small paragraph talking about how some Syriac Orthodox consider themselves Assyrian, and another small paragraph talking about how some consider themselves Aramaean. (NOTE: the page Suryoyo should NOT have the ethnic template.)</li>

<p>If I dont see any rejection, I will go on with this in 3 days. If you reject, please give us another solution <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaldean_d16d.html" title="User:Chaldean">Chaldean</a> 17:26, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>West Syriacs are not only Syriac Orthodox, also Syriac Catholic, and there are also a few Protestants among them.</li>
<li>I am not so sure why the ethnicity template should be omitted. Ethnicity is not the same as race (whatever that may be).</li>
<li>As I've pointed out before, there are also references to the Aramaean heritage of the ancient Syrians in East Syriac sources. Check <a href="http://www.urhoy.info/2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.urhoy.info/2.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. So I don't think deleting any reference from the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_people.html" title="Assyrian people">Assyrian people</a> page is such a good idea.</li>
<li>I noticed that the various ethnonyms in the article had been deleted from the article without previous discussion.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Two proposals for compromise and stability</span></h2>
<p>This article has been contended hotly for at least the last two years. Whenever someone new comes along they will try to get it to fit more exactly to their own ideas of what this all means. It seems that there are a few of us who have been around long enough to see just how damaging it is when any one person attempts to impose their will on others. I have tried to be careful not to protect the page and block people, because I don't believe that that helps in the long run. I would like to make two proposals for compromise and stability. Rather than the disputed, minor changes discussed above, which, I believe, would not make the situation any better, I propose two sets of wider structural guidelines we could adopt.</p>
<p>To move forward with this article, I suggest that we agree a few points about the content of the article. We are all too focused on issues on which we do not agree that we miss the stuff we all agree upon. After all none of the regular editors of this article actually see themselves as anti-Assyrian. Consider, if you will, three baskets in which the content of this article can be placed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Basket 1 — in this we place all material and facts that everyone is happy with.</li>
<li>Basket 2 — in this we place all material and facts that are agreed by two or more people, but not accepted by everyone.</li>
<li>Basket 3 — in this we place or the material and facts that we are all agreed should not be in the article.</li>
</ol>
<p>With this system we would have a simple way of assigning consensus to different additions. For example, if there was text in the article about Assyrians being identified mostly as Christians, that would be a basket-1 statement. If there was a statement about Aramaeans, we are still to find consensus whether those who call themselves such should be included, so we say that's a basket-2 statement. If there was a statement that said that Assyrians are going to get to heaven before everyone else because they are so holy, we would say that that's a basket-3 statement ad it shouldn't be in the article. With this system it is easier for us to find agreement. If I know that everyone will agree on a statement I can add it (and perhaps give an edit summary saying <i>I hope you all think this is basket-1 stuff</i>). If I know that there are going to be others who disagree with something (i.e. that it's basket 2), I know that I should discuss it on the talk page instead of putting it in. If I know that something is basket 3, then I can make sure that it gets removed from the article. The good thing is, if I have something that I want in the article but know that there are others who don't want it, we can all agree that it's basket-2 material and use the talk page to work out how to deal with it. This approach is better than edit warring over the page as we are forced to recognise what others might think before they have to tell us.</p>
<p>Now a wider discussion has to be had about what this article is about. There was a move a while back to unite this article with the articles on related peoples. I partly agreed with this because the different definitions of who is an Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac/Aramaean are blurred (in that different people define them differently). I think we can all agree (basket-1 stuff) that these identities are related, even if we don't like certain of the names and draw the internal boundaries in different places. Thus, the idea of one article for all is based on this shared agreement. However, the disagreements on those names and boundaries makes the one-article idea difficult. Before the incomplete merger was made, there were quite a few different articles for each group, each one pushing their line. The advantage of this was that the whole aspect of what <i>Chaldean</i> means could be explored in a single article dedicated to that idea. The disadvantage was that there was no cohesion between the articles, and the articles contradicted each other. I now feel and suggest that a compromise be sought. For this compromise I suggest that there is one united article for all these groups that discusses their relation to each other and views of who is who. Then, each grouping can have its own article that expands on that designation, but should not be allowed to contradict the united article. Therefore, this article, <i><a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_people.html" title="Assyrian people">Assyrian people</a></i>, would become an article dedicated to what the Assyrians are all about, but it would have a link at the top of the page to the united article and would have to be edited in accordance with it. The united article would have a little bit about every group (with links to the articles on each), and it would be the place that we work out the balance that governs all other articles. This way, Aramaeans need not be mentioned in the Assyrian article, but both would be discussed in relation to each other in the main article.</p>
<p>I apologize for the length of this edit. I do not wish to impose these guidelines, but wish to offer them for discussion. If we are in agreement, we can begin to implement them. You may have ideas on how to do things more effectively, so please have your say. — <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 12:08, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>Shlomo Gareth,</p>
<p>Thank you for your proposals. I think they should be workable, if we can all agree on turning this set of articles into a neutral and reliable source of information about the people concerned.</p>
<p>I believe the first proposal deals not just with the Suryāye-related article group, and should therefore be discussed at a different forum, like the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_e980.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump">Village pump</a>. However, we could try and bring this policy in practice here first.</p>
<p>As I have stated before, I agree with a single article about the Suryāye, with both sections within that main article and separate articles about the various (sub)ethnicities. However, I think this can be more properly done within the framework of a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_751e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject">WikiProject</a>, because there are quite a few other articles that now have <i>Assyrian(s)</i> in their titles but in fact deal with the Suryāye as a whole. We should have a discussion about whether those articles should either be renamed or split into separate articles for the subgroups.

<li>"The united article would have a little bit about every group" - What will this page be called?</li>
<li>"this article, <b><a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_people.html" title="Assyrian people">Assyrian people</a></b>, would become an article dedicated to what the <b>Assyrians</b> are all about" - And that would include Chaldeans too right? <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaldean_d16d.html" title="User:Chaldean">Chaldean</a> 13:51, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>By the way, my name has an <i>e</i> in it. The article has had problems for over two years to be precise, and there have been different attempts to deal with it. There has been, of late, too little discussion. It's no good taking action if someone is going to revert it. I used the word <i>groups</i> as a neutral term for each of the designations, as we each draw the boundaries differently. So, I would say that those who call themsleves Assyrian are one group of this larger related group. We have discussed different names for such a page before, but without much consent. If the united article stands beside the individual articles, its name can be more flexible. Yes, the article on Assyrian people would include Chaldeans in so much as the two names overlap. Likewise, an article on Syriac people would include Assyrians in so far as these designations overlap. Each article would probably referrence another as some people identify as both Assyrian and Chaldean, or both Assyrian and Syriac. — <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 14:35, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Once that's done, and I'm going to do that straight away, we can start editing <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_people.html" title="Assyrian people">Assyrian people</a> to remove sections dealing with those who do not call themselves Assyrian. I suggest that anything controversial (basket 2) that is already in the article about Assyrians stays in until we can decide what to do with it. I also suggest that all new material is uncontroversial (basket 1) until we can get the article settled down.

<p>Excuse me sir. I just confused with the content of this article.

<p>If we would have got assimilated we would not have kept our church we have had for 2000 years, our language (which is an independent language) or our culture.</p>
<p>Semitic Christian speakers of Aramaic is what I think you're trying to say. And they are called Assyrian or Chaldo-Assyrian. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_Legit_bf8c.html" title="User:King Legit">User:King Legit</a></p>
<p><br />
They are not called Chaldo-Assyrian, well should not be called so. Chaldean is only a religious term and the right word is aramaic-speaking assyrians or syriac-assyrians since all assyrians belong to syriac churches.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>There is no such thing as Assyrians nowadays. The ancient Assyrians were assimilated into Aramaic world some 2500 years ago and later the same Aramaic people to other ethnic groups. Todays Aramaic-speaking community is a remnant of ancient Aramaic world and has NOTHING to do with ancient Assyrians. The title of this article is very confusing, untrue, forgery, and promotes political propaganda. Sure it should be corrected as soon as possible. TruthTruth 19:00, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dear TruthTruth, I do not like your argumentative tone. You probably know full well that a large number of Modern Aramaic speakers call themselves 'Assyrians'. It is not up to anyone else to decide whether that is right. However, the claim that modern Assyrians are the direct descendants of ancient Assyrians is hotly debated, and this article should remain neutral on that point whilst presenting the arguments and evidence on all sides of the debate. This page is a discussion page for improving the article. The article is to be neutral, and, whereas we acknowledge that it is not yet there, you should acknowledge that pushing another agenda here is not going to help. In this regard, please make comments about how your point of view can be incorporated into this article so that the overall point of view is as neutral as possible.

<dd>Hello, Emrrans. Please be aware that writing words in bold capitals with exclamation marks after them is often taken to mean that you are shouting: it's not a good idea to start a shouting match. It certainly is overdoing it, and just looks a little silly: I, personally, find it difficult to take seriously anyone who writes in this way. However, some of the points you make are good. Akkadian was the ancient Assyrian language, and the Assyrian Empire came to adopt the more flexible Aramaic of its western provinces as a language of administration. Modern Assyrians speak Aramaic (in fact a small number of different varieties of Aramaic). I am still very doubtful about the claim of Akkadian words in Assyrian Aramaic: most of these are just common Semitic roots. Your direction towards to the articles on Shem and the sons of Noah is towards a school of dubious biblical interpretation. I do not have a problem with you re-applying the NPOV template on this article as I think there are still problems with it and it was removed rather too hastily. — <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 11:22, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Assyrian kings always married Aramaean wives. Aramaeans were merged with Assyria and Assyrians for at least 700 years. Aramea was the first area that was captured by the second Assyrian empire in 1300BC by king Adad Naririr I. Aramea remanied part of the Assyrian empire until its fall in 612BC. So, I am pretty confident that in that 700 year span, Arameans merged with Assyrians in terms of mix population. If the community of Assyria nad Aramea were not that close, why do you think the empire changed the language offically to Aramaic? <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaldean_d16d.html" title="User:Chaldean">Chaldean</a> 14:06, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In fact Aram meant nothing more than highland which was a description of the Assyrian terrain. Yes it may have been an independent entity at some point in time however it never was of much signifigance. It was always subjecated to a more powerful empire. Aramaean scribes in the Assyrian empire were always pictured alongside Akkadian scribes. That at least points to the fact that they lived alongside each other and just as with Sumerian and Akkadian society merging to form classic Babylonian society the same happened of Aramaean/Assyrian society. In fact Assyria started as a Babylonian colony. Assyrian people today may very well call themselves Babylonian if they wished for that is the original established seat of the crown starting with the unification of Sumer and Akkad under Sargon of Akkad even though he ruled from Agade, the seat was moved to the holy city of the Gate of God. The official title of the king of Babylonia is "Sar Mat Sumeri u Akkadi" which meant king of Sumer and Akkad which was the title of Sargon. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_Legit_bf8c.html" title="User:King Legit">user: King Legit</a></dd>

The article on <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aram.html" title="Aram">Aram</a> adds some information about the history. Although 'highland' is one theory of the meaning of the name, it is not known for certain what it means: Aram wasn't very high land. Aram was never a great empire, but existed as a number of city states west of the Euphrates, of which <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damascus.html" title="Damascus">Damascus</a> was the greatest. There is evidence that, in later Aramaean history, th city states united under one king, probably as a defence against Assyrian dominance. It is true that the Assyrians and the Babylonians used Aramaic as the language of administration of their empires, and this led to its widespread use throughout the Fertile Crescent. However, the Persian Darius I is probably the most influential benefactor of ancient Aramaic. — <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 17:50, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Also, and apology I must say if I m offensive and if I m wrong about this article. — <a href="../../../e/m/r/User%7EEmrrans_c0cf.html" title="User:Emrrans">Emrrans</a> 09:18, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So what is all about the <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESargonious_9f62.html" title="User:Sargonious">Sargonious</a> making up the <i>Abdel Masseekh</i> name? Well, Gareth Hughes, I think you're absolutely right, the article I read which is in the link I added in my previous discussion that entitled <i>History of Assyrian</i> have merit but cannot be swallowed whole because it has obvious bias.

<dd>With all due respect. Maybe you've read a FEW articles on Assyrians. That doesn't render you an expert so whatever bias you feel there is, that is your amateur analasys. Once my business degree is complete I will be attending the University of Michigan to complete an Assyriology degree. I am interested in ancient Mesopotamia because I'm from there and that's what I mostly read about and study. I can say I dedicate at least an hour a day to studying ancient Assyria and modern Middle Eastern Society.<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESargonious_9f62.html" title="User:Sargonious">Abdel Masseekh</a></dd>

<dd>Oh ok, so all of you guys who reply my first message win. Because now I m wrong about the Assyrian people and its language. This is because Akkkadian language are actually an Old Aramaic dialect in which that I've just go to it and read it about an article called <i>Assyrian Neo-Aramaic</i>. So this is my last message here. Goodbye. — <a href="../../../e/m/r/User%7EEmrrans_c0cf.html" title="User:Emrrans">Emrrans</a> 12:00, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>now this would be ground-breaking linguistic research! If you discovered connections between Akkadian and Aramaic, you shouldn't waste your time with Wikipedia, you should write a book and become famous. Until then, kindly observe <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. I don't know why people here go on about the ancient Assyrians all the time. There is simply no demonstrable cultural continuity, neither do modern Assyrians engage in sun worship, nor do they speak an East Semitic language. If it wasn't for archaeology and philology, we wouldn't know anything about the ancient Assyrians at all. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 13:23, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So Modern Greeks worship <a href="../../../z/e/u/Zeus.html" title="Zeus">Zeus</a>? Your a minority in this world to reject the claim of Aramaic and Akkadian being closly linked. In my opinion; we know there are people out their that are downright anti-Greek or anti-Armenian..but we dont let them edit pages and try to post their views of the subject..I dont understand why we Assyrians are not treated the same way. Why do we have to state the "other opinion"? Why dont we dont that with every single subject? Cause, surely every single topic their are different views.

<dd>Dab, that is an insult. "There is no cultural continuity." Actually YES there is. We still name our kids, Sargon, Ashur, Ninawa, Nahrain, Shamiram, and so forth. That alone with the way we practice christianity are enough similarities to the ancient Assyrians. And we have stories of our kings and queens passed down for generations. We didn't learn these from western archeologists. There were people to this day that could read cuneiform so don't tell me that the west taught us our culture. Prove to me Jews are descended of Abraham then talk about modern Assyrians.</dd>
