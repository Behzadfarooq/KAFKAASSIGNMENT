<p>I want to keep this article as a short disambiguation page with a consise but complete list of options. My involvement in this article has been just a handful of edits throughout 2005. These edits mainly link in with a number of articles I have been writing which link from here: namely <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramaic_language.html" title="Aramaic language">Aramaic language</a>, <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syriac_language.html" title="Syriac language">Syriac language</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_Neo-Aramaic_5f76.html" title="Assyrian Neo-Aramaic">Assyrian Neo-Aramaic</a> and other modern Aramaic languages.</p>
<p>The original Assyrian language was the northern dialect of the <a href="../../../a/k/k/Akkadian_language.html" title="Akkadian language">Akkadian language</a>. There will be instances that someone searching for Assyrian language will want to be directed to the article on Akkadian. At its hight, The Assyrian Empire adopted <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramaic_language.html" title="Aramaic language">Aramaic language</a> as a lingua franca. Therefore, in certain contexts, this period of Aramaic language can be referred to as Assyrian. This is strictly <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramaic_language.html#Early_ancient_Aramaic" title="Aramaic language">Ancient Aramaic</a>, and not to be confused with any later dialects. Babylonian supremacy continued and developed the use of Aramaic throughout northern Mesopotamia. Besides Imperial Aramaic, there have always been many different dialects of colloquial eastern Aramaic spoken throughout Mesopotamia. In the Christian era, the city of <a href="../../../e/d/e/Edessa%2C_Mesopotamia_1ae0.html" title="Edessa, Mesopotamia">Edessa</a> became the leading light in Christian Aramaic culture. The dialect of Aramaic spoken at Edessa became normative for liturgy and literature for Aramaic-speaking Christians across a wide area. In all scholarly publications, this language is referred to as the <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syriac_language.html" title="Syriac language">Syriac language</a>. Western and eastern dialect regions of Syriac (although both are still eastern Aramaic) developed, but the differences are mainly over pronunciation and orthography. Classical Syriac remains the language of liturgy, and, in the western dialect region, for literature. Some people refer to this language as <i>Assyrian</i>, which is reasonable in itself: it is the liturgical language of the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_Church_of_the_East_3c63.html" title="Assyrian Church of the East">Assyrian Church of the East</a> and the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaldean_Catholic_Church_c6fc.html" title="Chaldean Catholic Church">Chaldean Catholic Church</a>, and is spoken by many <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrians.html" title="Assyrians">Assyrians</a>. However, such a labelling of this language is not only ambiguous, but against usual scholarly and historical practice. The various colloquial eastern Aramaic dialects spoken by Christian communities have been influenced by Syriac to greater or lesser degree, but also have a certain long history of being the demotic of their place. Skipping over some of the interesting peripheral languages in this category, the largest group is usually referred to as North-Eastern Neo-Aramaic (NENA) in scholarly journals. Other names have been used by various scholars, but <i>Sureth</i> (in various dialects also <i>Soreth</i>, <i>Suret</i>, <i>Soret</i>), the traditional name for the language in the language is gaining currency. Scholars generally refer to smaller dialect groupings by geography (the Neo-Aramaic of Iranian Azerbaijan). Three important dialect centres of NENA have emerged over time. First to emerge was the dialect of Alqosh, which became the prestige dialect among the soth-western group of dialects. As almost all of those who speak these dialects are members of the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaldean_Catholic_Church_c6fc.html" title="Chaldean Catholic Church">Chaldean Catholic Church</a>, the article is at <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaldean_Neo-Aramaic_6df9.html" title="Chaldean Neo-Aramaic">Chaldean Neo-Aramaic</a>. The second centre to emerge was in Urmia, at the north-eastern extreme of the region. The implementation of printing technology increased the importance of <i>General Urmian</i> over other dialects, except Alqoshi. During the turmoil in the mountains of eastern Turkey near the end of the First World War, many speakers of Neo-Aramaic fled into northern Iraq. There the admixture of village dialects and General Urmian produced <i>Iraqi Koine</i>. As Genral Urmian, Iraqi Koine and other dialects are mainly used by memebers of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_Church_of_the_East_3c63.html" title="Assyrian Church of the East">Assyrian Church of the East</a>, it seems appropriate to refer to this dialect continuum as <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_Neo-Aramaic_5f76.html" title="Assyrian Neo-Aramaic">Assyrian Neo-Aramaic</a>. <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_Neo-Aramaic_5f76.html" title="Assyrian Neo-Aramaic">Assyrian Neo-Aramaic</a> is the literary, as well as the colloquial language, of many who identify themselves as <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrians.html" title="Assyrians">Assyrians</a>, and thus could also be called the <i>Assyrian language</i>. The terms <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaldean_Neo-Aramaic_6df9.html" title="Chaldean Neo-Aramaic">Chaldean Neo-Aramaic</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_Neo-Aramaic_5f76.html" title="Assyrian Neo-Aramaic">Assyrian Neo-Aramaic</a> are founded on the usage of <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnologue.html" title="Ethnologue">Ethnologue</a>, and are sometimes deprecated by scholars for having ethnic/sectarian labels, but I feel they are a useful middle way between those who want an identifiable label for the language and those who wish th label to distinguish properly between modern dialects. The revival of interest in a modern Assyrian identity has led to the term <i>Assyrian language</i> sometimes being used to include classical Syriac and literary and colloquial Sureth, and to emphasize comparative vocabulary between Akkadian and Sureth. The first connexion denies the historical development of Aramaic in the region, and actually hides the non-Syriac roots that exist for Neo-Aramaic. The second is mostly powered by wishful thinking, and utilises comparative vocabulary that would hold for a number of <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semitic_languages.html" title="Semitic languages">Semitic languages</a>.</p>
<p>I apologize for writing an essay, but I hope that this clears up the position. There are a number of distinct languages that are called <i>Assyrian</i>. Each of these has a reasonable alternative name, which is usually more common than straight <i>Assyrian</i>, making disambiguation easy. I am equally against those who wish to remove references to <i>Assyrian</i> in modern contexts due to its ambiguity, and those who with to assert for political goals and so increase ambiguity beyond the bounds of reason. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 12:06, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
