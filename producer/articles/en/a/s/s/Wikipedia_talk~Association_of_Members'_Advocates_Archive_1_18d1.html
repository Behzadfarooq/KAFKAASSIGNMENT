<h2><span class="mw-headline">COMMENT: Ineffective and unresponsive?</span></h2>
<p>Requests are piling up on the /Requests for assistance page. No one is responding to them. There are valid issues for which people are requesting help, and we are not acting on them. This is untenable. We proffer to offer help, yet we are apparently in no position to offer it to those who need it. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<dd>I just went through and dispensed with a few of the issues. The problem is not so much too many cases, but more one of housekeeping: most of these issues either don't belong here or can be peremptorily dispensed with through some sound advice and a point in the right direction. Half or more of the cases we get are fits of pique anyway. Perhaps we need a sort of cleaning crew rotation to clear through these on a regular basis, seperating the wood from the trees, as it were. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 03:40, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is one reason we discussed putting together the page on those advocates that are available for consultations at our last meeting which Keith did not attend. Does this mean we are ineffective and unresponsive? I don't think so, certainly no one has contacted me directly to complain. I should also point out that people can contact advocates directly without leaving any trace on Wikipedia, so I think the comment by Keith is a bit harsh and is not a positive criticism intended to help us achieve greater efficiency; it is just pointing out that the requests for assistance page is not necessarily reflecting the work that is going on by the advocates. I certainly am aware of a lot of work being done by advocates such as Wally. Remember that the page for requesting assistance is just one way that people can request an advocate. Ultimately it is a direct relationship that they must develop with individual advocates, we do not have any system of appointing advocates to help anyone who contacts these pages. We made this decision early on to give all advocates independence so we did not seem like we were "governing" them. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">â Â©</a> <a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlex756_8b95.html" title="User talk:Alex756">Alex756</a> 18:30, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If I were harsh, understand my frustration. I know that there are members out there who are getting unfair hearings. Some of them come to us via our Requests page. Whether or not we can hope to work miracles, they still could use our help.</p>
<p>When I came across the requests page, there were unanswered requests dating back to June 2004. I attempted to reorganize that page for better effectiveness. And I started making an effort to respond to those complaints that could be responded to, to help clean up the page and at least be responsive.</p>
<p>Since then, I've gotten myself in a particularly heady arb case, and haven't had a lot of time to keep up that effort. In the meantime, requests of us have increased. And this is no doubt a good thing, because it means people know about us. Unfortunately, as those requests have increased, responses to them dropped off (until I made a stink).</p>
<p>People who need help from us aren't necessarily going to be up on their WP chatting skills. They certainly shouldn't be required to play talk page roulette on all the names listed under the Members list; a majority of whom, it is acknowledged, aren't at all active. Nor do I think they should have to go to Available Advocates and flip a coin to decide which person's talk page to ring.</p>
<p>If every active advocate took it upon themselves to peruse the Requests page periodically, requests might get responded to more often, and the channel for people needing us to communicate with us would be made much easier for them. Likewise, we would be able to easily view our activities as far as those requests are concerned. And furthermore, we would be sure not to end up with the same reputation for responsiveness as Mediation.</p>

<dd>Hopefully I've helped clear up some of this problem; several requests, especially old ones, have been dealt with. Some, unfortunately, were months late, which I agree is unacceptable. This is especially considering that most of the RfAs we get are not things we actually need to take action on, but people putting a request for comment here instead of in the right place. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 03:55, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know what the hell is up here, but this is sick. What, can someone tell me, is <b>wrong</b> with having a system where users who encounter problematic contributors bring them to the dispute resolution process <i>a la</i> citizens' arrest? Why do we suddenly need a body responsible for dragging people before the ArbCom simply because others can't be buggered to do it themselves? There's a difference between needing help (what we're for) and laziness (what this will be for). I suggest we need to form a unified front to resist this ridiculous organization. Anyone up for a meeting on this? <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 01:50, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>This also provides help. Bringing a case against someone can be a painful process, which I suspect you would know if you had indeed had any experience of this. I've seen it plenty of times, both first-hand and with other people, and it's a common source of losing good editors. The AMI seeks to change that. Yet you want to crush it? The Troll Defence League strikes again. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 02:10, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Please. It is <i>supposed</i> to be a painful process, because even problematic editors are not supposed to be removed without getting their due. And you can attack my experience, or lack thereof, all you want; but I would do well to watch my words, especially when the word "troll" is one of them. Like "lie" in Parliament, it is not one a person of any dignity should use to others of the same. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 02:48, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It is <i>not</i> supposed to be a painful process. It <i>is</i> meant to be a last resort, but not a painful process - the aim is to resolve conflicts, not to have people give up and leave Wikipedia. And I'm simply saying that you might actually want to experience the frustration of having to bring a case against a severely disruptive user before you comment on how it is laziness to ask for assistance with it. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 03:03, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'll do you one better â I've had to <i>defend</i> an extremely disruptive user, one whom I personally believed guilty but felt deserving of a fair shake nonetheless; I would suggest that pushing Sisyphus' rock <i>up</i> the hill is more painful than pushing it <i>down</i>. And if people are giving up and leaving Wikipedia, that's their problem â I have no sympathy for quitters. I've edited on difficult pages; I've reverted trolls and argued with anons <i>and</i> Adam Carr and 172 to boot. So please spare me the accusations of inexperience while trying to defend this... organization. I find it confusing that you are behaving in such a hostile manner towards me. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 03:19, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That you're willing to defend users is great. However, the logic that it's vital that any user must have assistance in defending a case, but should not have any in bringing one, would seem rather twisted to me. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 03:24, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I would agree. Hence why I note, as Sam did, that the AMA represents users in need whether it is towards the end of prosecution or defense, and simply the fact that defense is more commonly an area in which users need assistance, as those bringing cases generally have experience themselves with Wikipedia's arbitration system. I also note that, absent this current system which heavily-stresses community involvement in this process, the proposed body encourages what is essentially "tattling" on users whose only crime may have been irritating the reporting user or making a slip of the tongue, and, unlike a system where a user bringing a case must be intimately involved with it, removes accountability from the equation. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 03:32, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Join the club, what else is new?&#160;;) I was accused of being a sockpuppet of a banned user weeks after starting editing (mainly because I caught on fast and was interested in policy), was flamed off of IRC and the mailing list, and have been threatened with blocking and arbitration fairly consistantly ever since.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Eliminating legalese</span></h2>
<p>I'd like to propose that the legalese is removed from the AMA. This is partly to stress that our resolving disputes process is not a legal process, partly because most (all?) members of the AMA are not qualified practising lawyers, and partly because legalese is not easy for non-laywers to follow.</p>
<p>Part of this would be renaming the AMA - probably both to get rid of the formal sounding "Association" bit as well as the "Advocates" name. My initial suggestion is "Wikipedians' Representatives" - though other suggestions would be welcome.</p>
<p>The other bit would be to redefine what the AMA do. This would just be a rewording into normal English, rather than any actual refinement of the AMA's scope. Changing the word would also give a welcome opportunity to stress that the AMA can assist all sides in a dispute with the aim be to come to a swift and, if possible, amicable solution, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 19:33, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is not an idea without merit, in my opinion, as we want to as far as possible keep the process accessible to Joe Wikipedian (which I myself have, admittedly, not been careful to do in the past). However I object to any change of the term "advocate", as it is quite plain English â if we were going for legalese, wouldn't we call ourselves lawyers or attorneys or counselors? An advocate is just someone representing a particular side in a dispute. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 20:12, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Representatives potentially suggests, at least to my mind, representation of constituent groups rather than individual clients (as in elected representatives), a connotation I wouldn't want to create in this setting.

<dd>Our definition of advocate notes that it is especially used in a legal context, and also that "In Scotland, U.K., "advocate" refers to those legal professionals with the automatic right to argue cases in the supreme courts of Scotland (i.e. the House of Lords, Court of Session and High Court of Justiciary)." Also, all dictionaries that I have seen give "a lawyer" as one of the meanings of "advocate". Maybe, advocate does not mean lawyer to you, but it certainly does mean that in this part of the world. By the way, I'm not attached to the term "Wikipedian's Representatives", it was more of an initial suggestion of how we could get rid of the legalese. I'm open to anything that does not suggest, as the current wording does, that its members are, or are pretending to be, qualified lawyers, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 05:48, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Kim, personally speaking, I like to work as an AMA in the official system and not in informal mediations outside the MedCom. If there's a good formal system that guarantees that the process will be serious, then, why does the Mediation cabal exist? Also, I think you should care if the ArbCom recognizes the mediations you do as real mediations: you know that for making a RfAr, you need to have passed through official mediation first and show you did that step! Anyway, if you need any help, I'll be pleased! --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> 22:30, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The ArbCom most emphatically does '<b>not</b> require that cases presented before it be "passed through official mediation first". We'd prefer that people make an effort to resolve their differences through mediation (either formal or informal) but it's definitely not a requirement. If you go into mediation with the idea that "I'm doing this so I can arbitrate your ass" then the mediation will almost certainly fail and you might as well just not bothering wasting anybody's time on mediation. (You might also want to skip arbitration since we don't look kindly on people who try to use the ArbCom as a cudgel.) In any case, the MedCab provides a valuable resources as an alternative to the MedCom (which, from what I can tell, is quite busy as of late). I tend to refer people who come to me seeking resolution to MedCom (and, at the same time, pinging RedWolf24 to let him know that the case is on the way). If he tells me that they can't take the case right now it gets pushed to MedCab, and I ping NicholasT to let him know it's coming.</dd>

<li>Applications should receive an explicit acceptance or rejection, because now there are users, who made requests which are not going to be answered, are still waiting for a response. That's just cruel.
<ul>
<li>This acceptance/rejection would have to be determined by a member vote.</li>
<li>This causes problems, as most AMA members are not dedicated enough. A possible solution would be to set a deadline (eg if no one has responded to a request within 48 hours, it will be automatically rejected).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, all this are just thoughts, but now the requests are mainly asking for things we cannot do. Most of them are complaining about a specific user making personal attacks or something like that. I can't help anyone with that, can you? Our services need to be defined and we need to make clear what we can and cannot to. Izehar (talk) 22:33, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agreed to be the coordinator for the first year, after that no one seemed to be able to get an election together for a new coordinator; that does concern me as there does seem to be some apathy amongst members. I am happy to help in any way, but currently I have been working more behind the scenes doing some volunteer legal work for Wikimedia Foundation. If anyone can organize an election that would be great; also any counsel or assistance that I can give to members is always possible either via my talk page or, preferably through my email link there. Regarding the structure of the AMA, it was always felt that it was just a way for individual AMA members to make their skills known to editors who were looking for someone to advocate for them or, just give them some information about the complex dispute resolution process as Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">User:Alex756</a> 04:34, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>after that no one seemed to be able to get an election together</i></dd>
<dd>Sorry, that doesn't sound right. Elections had been predetermined to happen after six months, the time came and passed without elections, the issue was raised to have elections, and instead, a poll was put up as to whether we should have them (which passed with a yes), and then a number of group meetings were held in lieu of holding elections. Please don't make me go through the tedium of digging through the page histories. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<p>As far as an election, I wouldn't even know where to begin, but if you (Alex) think there should be a new one, I would think it would best for you to declare it and set it up. I think that given the demand for different services than origianlly envisioned, the AMA should reevaluate there purpose. Maybe, in addition tot he AMA's original charge, we should be open to informal mediations and non-binding arbitrations. If that is the cae, I agree with Izehar, that we need to reorganize the AMA site in order to properly educate people on our servies, direct them to the correct place, and properly accept or reject requests. Further, given the current apathy among AMA memmbers, I don't think a vote on each issue would help as most would not participate and AMA members could easily be overwhelemd with having ot vote on so many requests. maybe what we should do is ask AMA members to respond to a request if they are interested and, if they do, indicate that on the AMA page. Otherwise, we <b>should</b> have a time limit on requests (longer than 48 hours, maybe 1 week) that should be removed as having not been accepted by an AMA member after that point. Any other thoughts? Should we move this discusson to the AMA talk page now?Gator (talk) 13:37, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I really like all these new ideas, Gator! They're great! What I'd really like is to become something more organized as, for example, <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza">Wikipedia:Esperanza</a>. They're doing a great job there and I'm sure we can make AMA grow. But be careful, now it's more important to get the members working than be thinking of elections and so on.</dd>
<dd>Remember that I did one year ago an election call, the election wasn't done and the AMA is still working! So, the elections aren't so important as you believe. But in the other hand, we are proud that AMA was the first democratic organization in the whole Wikipedia, but we have forgotten to keep our democracy moving! Can we be proud of that?</dd>
<dd>I propose to discuss first how to get all members joined so we can then discuss the future of AMA. It's logical. Opinions? --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> 17:00, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We need that more people get involved in this discussion. See: we're only Keith Tyler, Izehar, Alex, you and me. I know it's impossible to gather all AMA members and it would be very useless to have nearly 60 users discussing and proposing things! No, we need <i>qualified</i> advocates with experience. Some names we should consider: Andrevan, Metasquares, Sam Spade (though he is running for the ArbCom, he would be a great help), Snowspinner and Zestauferov (who organized the first AMA election). --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> 20:41, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Tasks undertaken by the AMA</span></h3>
<ol>
<li>Informal Mediation (helping disputing parties reach their own solution to their dispute)</li>
<li>Conciliation (initially like Informal Mediation but if that fails, then the added feature of proposing solutions to disputes)</li>
<li>Neutral Evaluation (giving inputs on how a particular policy or guideline affects a certain action - when most users in a dispute do this, they have a tendency of always interpreting it in a way favourable to them, especially in content disputes - essentialy, this is "advice")</li>

<li>If an application has net been accepted within 72 hours, it will be rejected. The parties can reapply no earlier that one week from date of rejection.</li>
<li>Acceptance by an advocate will be done by notification on all parties talk pages.</li>
<li>Once an advocate accepts a case, he/she can subsequently reject it prior to completion. In such circumstances, the application will be re-entered on the requests page and will remain there for a maximum of 72 hours.</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Coordination</span></h3>

<li>The AMA as a democratic organisation shall have no single officer as coordinator, but shall be run by a committee consisting of all advocates <b>who have successfully completed at least one case</b> and choose to participate in running the organisation.
<ul>
<li>This approach has practical benefits to it as well, as this association is a voluntary one and given that Wikipedia is merely a hobby, then this ensures the likelihood of someone "in charge" always being around. Look at now, where the Coordinator is away.</li>

<p>Of course this is merely a skeleton, but we'll fill in the blanks. Izehar (talk) 21:37, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The committee idea sounds fine. I'm not sure if there should be any requirements like that though. How about a straight vote of the committee and if voters feel like that is an important criteria, then it will play a role in the decision making anyway.Gator (talk) 21:43, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My purpose was mainly to exclude users who add their name to our lists merely for the prestige of being a member, but have not contributed to the organisation's success (hopefully it will be successful once we've revived it). I'm sure that that definition applies to most of our members. Do you know how many have actually responded to requests? A substantial number have added their names and then forgotten they'd done so. I think that users should be able to join, and work their way up to the committee. The criteria aren't that high anyway. What are your views on the other proposed changes? Izehar (talk) 21:52, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well then maybe we need to further define or loosen the requirement of "succesfully completeing one case" what does that mean? How about "active members who have responded to a request in the past three months?"</p>
<p>Other than that, I have no problems, I'm pretty open to expanding our services.Gator (talk) 21:55, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yours sounds much better - what do we do now? Contact Alex? Izehar (talk) 21:58, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>edit conflict) well, I beleive he is watching. I think we need more input from AMA members at this point, but his input is very important for obvious reasons. Also, User:Imaglang has done some <b>great</b>work on this thing and I think he/she needs to get in on this.Gator (talk) 22:05, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I strongly disagree w gator, those who have failed to successfully complete a single case should have no say in any of our doings whatsoever. I reccomend something far more meritocratic than Izehar suggests, and oppose commitees as a general rule (has anyone ever heard of anything good coming out of a committee?) but at least Izehar's idea's are a step in the right direction. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 22:00, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>(edit conflict) Well whether it s committee or one person, I have no prefernece. The problem I have twith "successfully" "completing" once case is the definition. I think active members are fine and this needs to be open as possible whether it's using a committee system or a one person system.Gator (talk) 22:05, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree on the grounds that as Wikipedia is a hobby and AMA a voluntary aspect of that hobby, one coordinator will not always be around. Such as now, our coordinator is away - if there were a committee, someone (one person, two, three...) would always be around to represent AMA. Izehar (talk) 22:02, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>How about replacing "successfully completing" with "completing"? Mediations can fail because of the parties, not the mediator's skill. I propose that a task should be completed when the advocate it is assigned to says it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tasks 1, 2 and 4 should be judged to be completed when the advocate says that he has made a reasonable attempt and has succeeded or failed.</li>
<li>Task 3 should be judged to be completed once the input has been given.</li>
<li>Task 5 should be judged to be completed once the outcome of the appeal is known.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also prefer the committee idea, and a "bums on seats committee". Each vote to last about 72 hours. For example if all but four members of the committee have not voted, then the four members will constitue a full <i>ad hoc</i> committee for that vote and proceed without the rest. Izehar (talk) 22:16, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok I'm on board with that, I've been convinced.&#160;:) I would still love to hear what the current coordinator and Imag have to say about this.Gator (talk) 22:41, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

It seems like we are worried about forming a committee which we admit will do very little.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">3 issues</span></h3>
<p>There are 3 issues on hand, as I see them:</p>
<ol>
<li>if there should be a committee</li>
<li>who should be able to vote regarding this, and</li>
<li>how long the meeting or vote should be held for</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I am dubious of a committee</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I feel strongly that only those who have had <b>successful</b> cases should be allowed to vote (anyone can be present and speak). We have many people on the members list, but very little advocating / mediating, etc... being done. There needs to be a line drawn between who is really doing something and who isn't, at least among our leadership.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I support a 72 hour meeting and vote, due to scheduling issues on an international project.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, I say we go ahead w or w/o Alex, he may be gone for some time to come.</p>

<p>So what would this committee's role be exactly and what issues would people be voting on? Also, you say that "only those who have had <b>successful</b> cases should be allowed to vote" what is your definition of successful and how do you reconcile that comment with "There needs to be a line drawn between who is really doing something and who isn't." Do you want successful candidates or active candidates. TO me, the fact that someone may not have won a case doesn't mena that they shouldn't be allowed ot be on the comm or vote or whatever. Active members should the criteria.Gator (talk) 02:28, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It does not appear that the committee would actually do anything; it should be replaced with nothing. In the rare event that a vote for something will be required, it should be done as follows:</p>
<p><a name="Amendment_proposals" id="Amendment_proposals"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Amendment proposals</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>There are two categories of AMA membership:
<ul>
<li>Full membership</li>
<li>Associate membership</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Full members get to vote on any issues (should any arise).</li>
<li>Associate members only get to propose.</li>
<li>Full membership is granted to whoever has successfully completed at least one case.
<ul>
<li>Successful completion means that the member has provided one of the following services:
<ul>
<li>Tasks 1 and 2 are judged to be successfully completed when the dispute is over.</li>
<li>Tasks 3 and 4 are judged to be successfully completed once the required service has been performed (regardless of the outcome).</li>
<li>Task 5 is judged to be successfully completed once the outcome of the appeal is known.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Associate membership is the same as full membership, save that the member cannot vote on any decisions that will need to be made.</li>
<li>Votes to run on a "if you didn't vote, you missed it basis".</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, this is just brainstorming. Not many of our "members" seem to be participating in this discussion. Izehar (talk) 12:28, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I really think we should focus more on expanding our services and changing/reforming the AMA request page (adding differnet pages for different requests per: Izehar) then on governance and committees and such. I think we need to focus on reinjuvenating the AMA first. Without that, the committee will not only have very little support it will have very few members. Let's refocus our efforts to services and AMA page reform.Gator (talk) 20:02, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've been a bit sceptical about the different pages for different requests, but I know that it if it were all on one page, then it would be really long and hard to edit (in certain countries it can take even five minutes for a really long page to load <a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyRomanEmperor_2aac.html" title="User:HolyRomanEmperor">User:HolyRomanEmperor</a> is in Serbia and told me so). Izehar (talk) 20:08, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Allright so let's get concrete here. I propose that we all give our input on a new lsit of services we think the AMA should offer. Izehar, I think you came up with a good list jsut alittle while ago. It pretty much was what lawyers do in the U.S (I should know). Would you mind posting that again under a new section and we'll go from there. Let's table the committee discussion for jsut right now. That sound good?Gator (talk) 20:12, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I found what I was referring to:</p>
<p>One step at a time&#160;:-) lets deal with services first. Izehar (talk) 20:46, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Services" id="Services"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Services</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Informal mediation</b> is informally helping all parties reach a mutual acceptable solution to a dispute through compromise without violating the basic principles of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> (Wikipedia's three core policies). Consent from all parties to negotiate in this manner will be required.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Conciliation</b> is the same as informal mediation, except the conciliator can also propose solutions to the dispute - this additional capability may appear desirable to some parties and not to others. Consent from all parties to negotiate in this manner will be required.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Neutral Evaluation</b> is essentially "legal advice" on how a particular policy or guideline affects an individual or a group. As nearly everyone interprets policy in a way favourable to them, this service may be useful in RfCs or even in common disputes (eg is this edit original research?).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Advocacy</b> involves writing on behalf of a user in RfArs and RfCs. This is certainly going to be the most tedious chore. We will have to insist on <b>concise, well-written, accurate, complete</b> summaries of the scenario <b>WITH DIFFS</b>. I am sure that advocates will not want to have to go through months of talk pages to find evidence.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Appeals</b> are contesting to a decision on the basis that is it misguided. ArbCom decisions to be appealed to Jimbo and out input will have to bear the name of AMA and be signed by all its members (it will carry more weight this way). It goes without saying that requests to appeal will only be accepted if there is a possibility that it will be successful. If it will be an obvious failure, then we won't even bother. Appeals to administrator decisions to be made on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> and if appropriate, our input to be signed by all members (like a petition). Of course, all this personal vouching should be done ONLY if an obvious mistake has been made. If not, the application to be rejected (advocates vote with their feet - if they don't want to, they don't have to support a particular action).</li>

<p>Comments please... Izehar (talk) 20:46, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Question abnout conciliation. Is that kind of like a non-binding voluntary arbitration? If so, let's just call it that to avoid confusion. Other than that I think these expanded services are great. Let'some more discussion here and then we can move on to the web page.Gator (talk) 20:56, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, it's more like a non-binding voluntary med-arb as you call it in the states. Izehar (talk) 21:00, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>med-arb? I THINK I know what you mean, but please explain. Every state is different so don't assume too much lol.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I live in the UK - I don't know which state... It's a means of dispute resolution which starts out exactly like mediation, the mediator becomes familiar with the problem and the parties, if normal mediation fails, the mediator can start making reccomendations of his/her own. Some disputing parties may want this more interventionist style of mediation. Other disputing parties may not. Izehar (talk) 21:08, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok so it's like a mediation non-binding arbitration hybrid. That's fairly rare in the U.S. Let's do this.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Some comments</span></h2>
<p>I'm back and I gladly see you were working hard! Here are some replies to the most important issues discussed:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Informal Mediation</b>: I'm strongly <i>against</i> this idea. First, if there should be informal mediations in Wikipedia, there is already an organization called <a href="../../../m/e/d/WP%7EMEDCAB_20f1.html" title="WP:MEDCAB">The Mediation Cabal</a> that works on that. ABut my point is that there shouldn't be any informal mediations and that the MedCom should be the <i>unique</i> organization allowed to do mediations. Please keep in mind that the ArbCom doesn't like to arbitrate cases that hadn't passed through official mediation. No, we are <i>advocates</i>, not mediators: mediators are supposed and selected (remember that only supported users can enter into the MedCom!) to be neutral and we advocates are supposed <b>not</b> to be neutral!</li>
<li><b>New requesting system</b>: Excellent idea! This will order this thing. I like very much that 72 hours limit Izehar proposes.</li>
<li><b>Coordination</b>: As I say in <a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_AMA_proposals_8e55.html" title="User:Imaglang/AMA proposals">here</a>, I would rather discuss this later and try to keep the AMA Coordination as it is, but with a more representative function.</li>
<li><b>Meritocracy</b>: I don't like it, it can be a boomerang: that people having many lost cases but still try to win one and like to be part of the AMA will be excluded... I don't know, I must think a bit more about this.</li>
<li><b>Committee</b>: Never!!! <a href="../../../j/u/a/Juan_Domingo_Per%C3%B3n_2d3c.html" title="Juan Domingo PerÃ³n">Juan Domingo PerÃ³n</a> said that "If you want something <b>not</b> to succeed, for a committee". And this argentinean dictator always formed committees when he tried to break opposite projects.</li>

<ol>
<li>We must try to gather all the members. We're the <b>Association</b> of Members' Advocates. We must encourage members to participate even more on this project.</li>
<li>AMA must try to have more communication with the official committees. After all, we are also official and I think we have the right and the duty to participate in all the changes that are being done in the Dispute Resolution System.</li>
<li>Create advocates that work with the committees advicing and advocating mediation/arbitration requests when the Arb/MedCom needs to accelerate a case (something similar as statal advocates). Then, <b>their</b> (MedCom's/ArbCom's) request list will get smaller and also <b>ours</b>.</li>
<li>Purge the AMA members list. There are people that never advocated a case and there is a user (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiUser_82f9.html" title="User:WikiUser">User:WikiUser</a>) that added his list for protecting himself of a year ban (obviously, this was in vain).</li>
<li>Elections are needed to bring fresh air and new ideas.</li>
<li>The AMA Coordinator should represent us advocates when we interact with the ArbCom or the MedCom or even the recently created <a href="../../../m/e/n/Wikipedia%7EMentorship_Committee_9b60.html" title="Wikipedia:Mentorship Committee">Mentorship Committee</a> (MentCom). As you see, this idea with the other about breaking our isolation are related.</li>

<p>I agree with pretty much everythign you saidm, except I beelvie we need to exapnd outr services to include informal mediation, informal arbitration, hybrid...etc.Gator (talk) 19:30, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The main problem is not us doing mediation, but that <b>there should not be informal mediations/arbitrations anywhere</b>. In Wikipedia, there are the MedCom and the ArbCom. We must respect this official channels to do mediations and arbitrations as they are supported by and supporters of Wikipedia's policy. Official mediators and arbitrators must pass a selective process before they can be part of their respective committees. This tries to guarantee that not anyone can be arbitrator nor mediator and there some criteria that were considered so the people that get in are actually neutral in their decisions. Obviously, the official channels can make unneutral decisions, but those decisions can be stated as unneutral because there is something (the applying crieria) behind these bodies that allow us to say that they are wrong. Curiously, it is their officiality which allows us to appeal against their decisions. Informal mediations/arbitration aren't guarranteed to be neutral and haven't anything that guarrantees themselves. If an informal mediation or arbitration turns out to be totally unfair, who will respond for it? And that's why I don't want the AMA involved in something that can be a "boomerang" for us.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Obviously, I do agree that we must expand our services if and only if they are realted to advocacy: advicing and neutral evaluation, for example. --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> 19:51, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>IMO the difference between an informal mediation and a full mediation is that informal mediation can be for piddly little disputes that MedCom wouldn't bother themselves with. How would those parties negotiate, only through RfC; what if that didn't work? Izehar (talk) 19:56, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Right. The fact that mediations/arbitrations would beinformal, is the difference here. Nothing bad can happen, because they can't force anyone to do anything and it makes no fficial difference, but they can help people if the mediator or arbitrator helps resolve a dispute. I know that it is not agasinst policy to do this and I don't think by doing informal work like this that we would be disrespecting anyone. We shouldn't worry so mch about stepping toes here. The fact is that people are flooding the AMA page with petty disputes about issues that are ot going to be resolved through formla channles because they're not important enough. The AMA should expand services so that it can really do more than jsut advocate for people in thsoe very few cases. Anyone else have thoughts on this?Gator (talk) 20:09, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>

<dd>When I talk of informal mediation, is to do a full mediation outside the MedCom (like the MedCab does). But that cases where a "cooling down" of the discussion is needed aren't mediations, they are part of the so-called "negotiation" process (in the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">DR</a> system, it is two steps before the Mediation). There is already a group, the <a href="../../../h/e/c/WP%7EHEC_937d.html" title="WP:HEC">Harmonious editing club</a> (of which I'm part), that tries to do this. --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> 20:11, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Mediations are nothing more than that. Getting parties to come together and talk things out and try to reach a compromise. Whether you call that negotiation or whatever, I think there is PLENTY of room for the AMA to offer that aservice and there is certianly a need. I continue to push for having this service in our bag of tricks.</p>

<dd>Look, we're just starting the reorganisation - let's just agree on neural evaluation, advocacy and appeals for now. Let's see if we can handle these - if we have too many tasks, the workload will be immense. Let's start with three tasks for now and see how it goes. Once we've agreed on tasks, then we can move on the application procedures. Izehar (talk) 22:34, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm eager to move on too, but the vast amjority of the request coming in need a mediator and if we don't expand our services to include that I'm worried we're not really going to be solving the problem here. I think consensus is sufficient here just like everywhere else. Unanimity is not required to move forward. If there's a consensus that mediation/arbitration whould be included, that's good enough for me, I guess I just don;'t see why we ALL have to agree, that seems like an unreasonably high hurdle. Where am I going wrong (Sorry Izehar. Like I said I'm eager to move on too, but really want to do this right..:(..)Gator (talk) 22:44, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Right, well I would support those two additional features (where else would the petty disputes go?) Izehar (talk) 23:06, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Me too, but another user does not and Sam proposed that we need everyone to agree and I think that's an admirable but ultimately fruitless idea. I think we have consensus on the services here (not unanimity) and am prepared to move forward.Gator (talk) 23:45, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All right, this discussion seems to have come to a standstill, so let me "revive" it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Application Process</span></h2>
<p>One question: should we give AMA members tha ability to abandon their clients after they engage in servies but before they finish or should AMA members just agree to complete their job? Shouldn't we have certain standards for our members (kind of like a bar in the U.S?) How do you feel about changing that to read that AMA members promise to work with all due diligence to complete their job once they have engaged in services? Or maybe just take that out? What do you think?Gator (talk) 13:49, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, IMO we should be able to abandon our clients. I think that it would be foolish for a voluntary association to have such obligations. Our services are merely personal favours. However, I think that safeguards for quality should exist, ie unsatisfactory performance by an advocate on repeated occasions should be eligible to have his membership revoked by a member vote. Izehar (talk) 14:07, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ok, if members can do this (which I think they just agree not to do), then let's not advertise it as I think it would undermine our clients' confidence in the association. Let's just leave it unsaid.Gator (talk) 14:22, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think so, we mustn't misrepresent what we do. Our clients must know that we can withdraw (I like that word - it sounds acceptable for what otherwise would be a sleazy move) if we so choose. It should all be in our "constitution" which I am currently writing. Once it's finished, I'll place it here (or in my userspace) for scrutiny and after that, we should call a member vote. I'm thinking it should last about five to seven days (or until everyone's voted). Izehar (talk) 14:36, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>PS I don't think that prospective clients will even read the "fine print" about our withdrawing capabilities. We still haven't agreed on services yet. I think that we should just include everything and if a certain advocate wishes to avoid a certain chore, he/she can. Izehar (talk) 14:38, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well then I think that the absolute right withdraw at any time no matter the circumstances or harm to the client is inappropriate and I would push for <b>some</b> basic duties to run from the AMA member to their clients in this regard, even if it's just a bsic duty not to screw a client over. I understand that it's voluntary, but if the AMA member doesn't want the basic duty not to abandon and hurt their clients, then they don't ahve to assume it, (being an AMA member is not a right it's a privilege) but if this association is going to have any realy credence here, then our client's need to be assured ins ome small way that their advocate will not decide to leave them high and dry without any consequences.Gator (talk) 14:43, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I understand that, but it's not as if we can impose any real sanctions. All we can do is suspend or revoke membership. All members before joining will have to agree to the "practice guidelines" and if a member keep on violating them for no good reason, then his membership may be suspended/revoked. Withdrawing from a case should be discouraged, but the option should always be available. Especially in informal mediations. Izehar (talk) 14:47, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Suspension and reovcation of membership are sufficient sanctions. Practice guidelines should include a duty to to avoid harming our client's interests if at all possible. Therefore, if an AMA member wishes to withdraw they need to give proper notice to al parties, work to get an AMA memeber to replace the and withdraw in such a way as to avoid detrimental effects to their client(s). If they don't do this then sanctions can be considered, especially in repeat cases. How about that?Gator (talk) 14:51, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know - I still think that withdrawal should be readily accessible. Imagine accepting an informal mediation and it dragging on for months. I don't like the fact that an advocate is bound by an obligation to do complete a job that's impossible to complete (certain disputing parties are so pigheaded). How about making withdrawals available only in cases of informal mediation and conciliation. In appeals and advocacy it is not an option and in cases of neutral evaluation it's not really necessary. Izehar (talk) 14:57, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not saying it shouldn't always be an option and I think it always should eb available, it jsut needs to be proeprly done. If a mediation is drawing on and on, I don;t see how it would hurt the clients to withdraw with proper notice and at least a weak attempt to get a replacement. I don';t see the problem there. There jsut eneds to be a safeguard for our cleints, that their AMA member has certain obligatosn and will not just choose abandon them suddenly for not good reason and without communication.Gator (talk) 15:03, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>All right, ending an informal mediation would not be that disasterous to our clients interests. How about a mandatory week's notice. I don't like the obligation of having to find a replacement, as everyone would want to avoid a hopeless mediation. If I wanted to withdraw from an informal mediation that had been nothing but edit wars for the past two weeks and everything I tried failed, would you carry the burden for me? Heavy burdens must be able to be discharged, but members who abuse those safety hatches, should be subject to diciplinary proceedings (revocation of membership). How about a clause which says that no one will be allowed to discharge an informal mediation without having served seven days. Izehar (talk) 15:13, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Let me be clear, the member need only <b>try</b> to find a replacement, they don't have to actually produce one if no one comes forward. I think a weeks notice is fine, but the member is not burdened by posting a note on the AMA page asking for a replacement. No one needs to take him/her up on it, they should just try. I think the policy should be a unifomr polcy for <b>all</b> outr services in order to avoid confusion as to which withdrawal policy applies to which service. Let's jsut keep it simple but make it clear that they need to provide notice (1 week is fine) (2) try to find a replacement and (3) generally speaking, withdraw in such away as to not cause undue harm to a client or clients. Sound good?Gator (talk) 15:21, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's what my original proposal was - if a member withdraws from a case, he has to place it back on the requests page for the maximum of 72 hours. Izehar (talk) 15:23, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>OK, that along with one week's notice (1) and the general duty (3) I outlined above would be fine with me.Gator (talk) 15:26, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Also, I think we should have a policy to remove members who have been inactive for one month if they haven't given prior notice of their inactivity accompanied with a good reason. Izehar (talk) 11:15, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Alright on withdrawal, I think one weeks notice for all services are fine, but need to be accompanied by that duty I specified above. I am also against a full member vote to withdraw. No need to air out ugly disputes in front of everyone. I said above I was against a withdrawal policy that differed depending on the services and I thought we were in agreement when you said OK. I apologize for all the confusion. Here is the withdrawal policy I propose(d) for <b>all</b> services. 1) one week's notice to all parties 2) post on the AMA page asking for a replacement (or repost the case for 72 hours whichever) and 3)an AMA should not withdraw in such away as to not cause undue harm to a client or clients. It's important that our clients know that an AMA member has certain obligations to them when they commit and they just can't say "I'm going to screw you in one week...get ready." The AMA nmeeds to be held to a higher standard for its services than just any editor helping another editor(s) out.</p>
<p>Annex: If they do violate the withdrawal policy, they may be subject to sanctions including formal reprimands, suspension or even removal from the association by a vote of the majority of the AMA.</p>
<p>This is what I propose(d). Thanks.Gator (talk) 14:05, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sounds fine, except I can't pin down that "harm to client". How shall we define "undue harm"? Izehar (talk) 14:09, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That needs to be determined on a case by case basis and we need a general duty like that in those rare cases when someone can give one weeks notice and post for a repalcement and <b>still</b> really hurt their client because of unique circumstances that we, in our limited wisdom, could not forsee. The majority of the AMA members can decide this questions if when it comes up.Gator (talk) 14:14, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you want a more "precise" defintion I would define it as harm to a client that it beyond that which is necessary in all withdrawals (we assume that a withdrawal always harms people). That a little better? I don';t think we should define it though adn leave that up to the members when they come across it.Gator (talk) 14:16, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Remember though, my proposal above allows withdrawal only in cases of informal mediation and conciliation. How could withdrawal from those cause significant harm to the client? I can't even think of one example. However, we could put something like "excessive detriment due to reliance" or something like that in the rules just for show and in the unlikely event when it could apply, it should apply. Izehar (talk) 14:22, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Remember I said that my withdrawal policy applies to '<i>all</i> services. We should not have a different withdrawal policy depending on the services, it will get too confusing. We need to be able to withdraw from any cases under the right circumstances. We cannot be forcing our members to stick through it no matter what, that's unreasonable. I can't think of any examples myelf, but I am sure that they exist , which is why we need this policy, so that when an example does show itself, our client's are protected and there are fair procedures in place. I like your wording, I just fear it's too narrow. It's OK to have broader language when you want to have it serve as a catchall for those examples that you and I can't think of right now.Gator (talk) 14:26, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've been thinking that if we do undertake informal mediations, then we will be at competition with the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_9d17.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal">Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal</a>. Wouldn't it be much easier if the advocates focused on advocacy and if they wanted to mediate as well, they could join the cabal? Izehar (talk) 14:34, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've thought about that too, but 1) there's not really competiton, it's not this is a business or somethign and 2) ther's obviosuly a greater need out there then they can handle or else we wouldn't be flooded with these requests. I think we definately need to add it as a service. There's no rule that the cabal has a monopoly over this service and they can't handle all of the requests. Reponse to my last statement? Is my version of the withdrawal policy ok with you? If so, please add it to the above wording.Gator (talk) 14:38, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><a name="Coordination_2" id="Coordination_2"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Coordination</span></h2>
<p>You mean the committee idea? Yeah, I'm not too hot on that idea either to be honest. Maybe just a small 3 person committee so that, hopefully, one of those people will be around to help out. I cans ee how having just one coordinator can cause problems...And with a committee that small, I don't think we need any official criteria for being a nominee. Kind of like RFA, there's unofficial criteria that everyoneuses. I'm confident that the best people will be elected if we allow all AMA members to vote, give them plenty of notice and allow them to choose who would be the best at it using their own ctriteria of who deserves it. Just my OP on that. Better to keep things as simple as possible. Thoughts?Gator (talk) 15:04, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps we should have a Coordinator, a Vice-Coordinator and a Deputy-Coordinator. In practice they are the same office, but a single coordinator gives the AMA a visible head. They could be elected by direct vote of all listed members by a set date and office is conferred on the three individuals who achieve the three top places. Izehar (talk) 15:09, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Having a visible head is fine, but if we are going to have three different offices, then they really do need to be different. I wouldnt want to have a sham ofice that is really all three. I'm not really sure that having one visible head is such a big deal. Maybe the committee could choose their own chair? So we would elect a three person committee (keep it small) and then they would choose their chair so we could have a visible head. How's that?Gator (talk) 15:19, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure about that, indirect elections can be tricky - three people electing one of their number, nothing good can come of it. They're not really sham posts: they are different posts - when the coordinator is not around, the vice-coordinator will and if he/she isn't, then hopefully the deputy-coordinator will. The Coordinator is in effect the "chief". Izehar (talk) 15:23, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>How will they determine if the other two arent around? Wait for a response, e-mail the higher ups.......seems like a waste of time to me if a coordinator needs to act quickly...am I wrong? "Noting good can come from it"? What do you mean? Sounds like a parliamentary system to me. I think it could work out fine. How about this: elect one coordinator to be the head person and then two deputies to act when the coordinator cannot and to kind of pick up the slack and do chores. How's that?Gator (talk) 15:29, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I was aiming for variety, but whatever&#160;:-) Now in time, I'll archive this page and relist our new proposal in my usual fashion (the bureaucratic/<a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_tape.html" title="Red tape">red tape</a> style), spam all members on their talk pages (except the banned one) and get them to comment. If they all are leaning towards agreement, we can call a vote. Izehar (talk) 15:34, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>So are we going to have an election for each office, or should we use your idea of the top vote getter gete the coordinator positon adn then the bottom 2 get the deputy positions? I kind of liked your idea.Gator (talk) 15:38, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm trying to distinguish between conciliation and neutral evaluation and there seems to be a considerable overlap. Perhaps these two should be merged and be in effect an expert request for comment. Izehar (talk) 17:10, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>How about mediation, third party neutral evaluaton and informal arbitration?Gator (talk) 17:19, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I was thinking of listing our services in the proposal as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Informal mediation (helping disputing parties reach a compromise)</li>
<li>Neutral evaluation (giving opinions and advice from a neutral point of view)</li>
<li>Advocacy (same as last time)</li>
<li>Appeals (same as last time)</li>
</ul>
<p>Izehar (talk) 17:27, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it's better this way as it allows the advocate more freedom to do what is required to complete a task rather than having to stay within the narrow boundaries of the task definition. Izehar (talk) 17:28, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I like that. What about informal arbitration? If parties came ot me and said we agree to follow whatever ruling you make on this issue, becuase we don;t want to file an RFC and go through that entire process, that seems like a service we could provide? No?Gator (talk) 17:32, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>IMO neutral evaluation is the same as informal arbitration. It's even better, as it doesn't sound like an <a href="../../../o/x/y/Oxymoron.html" title="Oxymoron">oxymoron</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Some Comments</span></h2>
<p>I for one will support anyone who wants to help generate more advocacy at Wikipedia. However, it was not my intention when starting this organization to create yet another arm of the vast and complex Wikipedia bureacracy. It was an attempt to create a place where people could "associate" and not organize committees, votes, etc. Getting people to respond to inquiries is a good thing, but putting a structure in place to do so, is not in my opinion, the way to do it. I don't think that the activity on the "official" pages of the association is any indication of what individual advocates are doing. Sam Spade started his own "investigation agency" and I don't see that as contrary to the AMA. If I see any future for the AMA it would be to organize a conference on the problems Wikipedia faces, to analyze and criticize ArbCom by examining its activities. I think the idea of stripping someone of their AMA membership after a couple of months of "inactivity" is ludicrious. It is like suggesting that an experienced trial lawyer that decides to do some transactional work should never be allowed back in the courtroom. It would be a terrible mistake to allow members to take away another member's status except for the most serious kinds of transgressions regarding their advocacy work, and even then it would require a serious structure that allows the advocate a chance to present their side of the story (<a href="../../../a/u/d/Audi_alteram_partem.html" title="Audi alteram partem">audi alteram partem</a>). I do think that just having one person as an administrative structure is not a great idea, it would be better to have two or three people working together as co-cordinators, as a team to work on issues of interest to all advocates, not to act as a coordinator of advocate referrals, to supervise some kind of "application procedure" or some other kind of oversight that deals with the day-to-day work of advocates; that should be their own private affair. The model would be more along the lines of a bar association type of organization, not like a public interest law firm that takes in clients advocates for individual positions through the organization's appointment of advocates. This is one of the reasons that I felt that the original name I came up with Office of Members' Advocates was better changed to Association of Members' Advocates. Anyway, that is what we have been historically, and we will always be remembered as the group that had the very first real election on Wikipedia. If the members decide through a democratic process that it should evolve into something else, I have no problem with that and I will be around if anyone wants to consult with me. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">Alex756</a> 07:31, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes I agree that we should not automatically eliminate members. I strongly diagree that putting a structure in place to repsond to inquiries is somehow a <b>bad</b> idea, I think it's not only agreat idea, but is really the only logical way to go about this. The AMA is evolving into something mroe than what it was originally intended to be and I think that's great. It's reached the next step in that evolution. If we don't embrace that I think the AMA will become extinct.13:48, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>We need more people who can help and are willing to help others through the <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a> process, whether they be nice, tidy mediations or arbitrations, or more messier interpersonal rows and libel accusations, etc., involving people who aren't familiar with WP process.</p>

A request will jsut be deemed denied if NO ONE responds within 72 hours so that we don;t ahve the clutter we ahve now. If you think it should be longer than 72 hours then please say so. I think 72 hours is sufficient but that's jsut my opinion.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">More Thoughs On Proposal</span></h2>
<p>I'm going to echo a lot of what Alex said, he predates me with the Association but I predate most of the names that I'm seeing in conversations here. I think there's a general incorrect perception of what the AMA is and what it isn't.</p>
<p>I've been gone on a Wiki-break for a while, I just got very fed up with a lot of stuff concerning copyrights and sourcing and since those issues appear to be addressed now in the wake of certain incidents I'm going to wade back into the waters. I've had a number of cases and I was a part of probably two of the larger and longer Arb cases of the past year, Netoholic and Instantnood. Overall I think the Arbcom respects my abilites as an advocate and I've always worked hard to represent my "clients" well.</p>
<p>First is regarding the tasks of the group. The first one is informal mediation and that task is already accomplished by <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_9d17.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal">The Mediation Cabal</a>. They're flooded with requests and being one of the founders of that project I'm proud to see how popular it has become. They've had member turnover a bit but things all in all appear on the right track. I also oppose AMA doing mediation because our goal is to act as Advocates, being an Advocate means having a bias towards a particular person and that isn't compatible with being a mediator.</p>
<p>The second task is "Neutral Evalution", again, I think that's hard for a group that is supposed to advocate for someone. Also, it's more or less what Medcom does. Historically the task has been "Partisan Evaluation", in other words User A comes and says "I need help make this argument in this case" or "I'm getting torn to shreds here and need some help" and an advocate sees that and says, "sure, I'll help you". I've done it on cases I didn't agree with the person but that's what being an advocate is, it's being a partisan for someone who needs it.</p>
<p>The last two tasks you have are what we should be centered on -- RFA, RFC and Arb appeals and whatnot. That's the meat and potatoes about what being an advocate is about.</p>
<p>Okay, next, applications. The application page just needs to be tidy. No one has to take a case, if no one wants to take it I say it gets moved to an archive after two weeks, simple enough. If someone wants to take it they do. If an advocate starts working with someone and decides he can't anymore I don't think he needs to do anything else but to notify his "client" and suggest he might want to repost his application. The only exception to the rule is an advocate who is working an Arb case or appeal for someone. If he decides to withdraw he needs to let his client know, notify the Arbcom, and suggest the person apply for another advocate and ask for a delay in Arbcom proceedings while he gets help or formulates the argument himself.</p>
<p>During my case with Neto I threatened a few times to withdraw if he wasn't going to take my advice or try to work with me (i.e. going out and engaging activity similar to what he was in Arb for). I felt that was my right, he knew it, and he made changes accordingly. Now, if for some reason we have someone who drops clients all the time that would need to be looked at but I'm not aware of that ever happening.</p>
<p>I don't like the voting thing, isn't this Wikipedia where we should be trying to reach consensus? How can we advocate for people to reach consensus if we can't do it ourselves? Some things need a vote (i.e. elections) but most things do not. With the rate that people work on the project and then go on break and come back we have a lot of turnover of editors coming and going, there shouldn't be an easy vote process that can change the whole thing while someone takes a Wiki-break for a couple of months.</p>
<p>Then all the jazz about suspending or terminating members, I don't know if that's necessary, peer pressure is usually enough. However, I think we might need something very basic in this regard -- for example, I don't like it that we have an AMA member listed as away because he/she is currently serving a one year ban. Doesn't make the group look good. This should be simple though and I don't think it should be a vote of the full membership so as to avoid witch hunts. I think the Coordinator can make a decision like that and the group can have the right to protest what the coordinator has done and then you go to consensus forming on it.</p>
<p>There it is, my $0.02. Let me say I am certainly glad to see new names, I tried working on reorganizing and elections and announced a meeting a month in advance and one person showed, that was very disappointing. I'm hopeful there's interest to keep this group going in the right direction.</p>

<p>Response: What the AMA is or isnt is what the AMA memebrs thnk it should or should not be. We are not bound by some sort of tradition here. If you think the defitnion of an "advocate" is too narrow to encompass activities like mediation adn neutral evaluation and yoyu think that's abnig problem, trhen we cna change the name of the organizaton. If we, as the members, think it should expand and do more, than we should. Mediation is an appropriate activity for us 1) if we want to do it and 2) if there's demand. I've heard thia rgument ovetr and over again about the cabal, but there is plentry of room for two organizations helping people resolve disputes. Same thing goes for the medcom. Look at the requests coming, in, the vast majority of them are for things beyond our current sevices. So we cna either hide our haeds in the sand and continue telling them to go away (really working well by the way) or we can change and adapt to better serve the project.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what your point is on the voting. Al we want to do is vote for elections, which you seem to support, so where's the problem?</p>
<p>Whether you want to give the power to discipline memebrs to the coordinator or the members is fine with me.Gator (talk) 13:31, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, we aren't bound by anything but why go out and duplicate efforts already being handled by other projects? If you want to do informal mediation then, by all means, sign up to help on The Mediation Cabal, there's nothing stopping you from doing AMA and TINMC, they're both user groups. The problem presently, as I see it, is that a lot of the muck that came to AMA and was dismissed because it really wasn't in our purview is sticking around. For whatever reason AMA has always been a bit of a complaint department and I don't think we really want that duty. Personally I don't think it's that they come just here, they post their complaint wherever they can and this is one of the places they end up. If you go back and look at the archives of the requests I think you'll find a lot of that and I think you'll find a lot of people that just wanted to drag their issue to another venue. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 03:27, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've amde my thoughts on this issue very clear, so I won;t go into detail again. There's nothing wrong with expanding our services into anotehr associations domain when it's obvious they're just not able to handle all of the matters out there and I dont want to join that group because I want to handle complaitns ehre, not there.

<dd>This makes absolutely no sense to me "I want to do something another group does but I don't feel like doing it there so I'll do it in this group that doesn't do it". I really don't understand. Again, this is the Association of Members' <b>ADVOCATES</b>, we're not mediators, we're not cops, we're not <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedi.html" title="Jedi">Jedi</a>, we advocate for people.

<dd>Audi alteram partem -- "hear the other side" is what this group has always been about, giving voices to people who are having difficulty. AMA is a user group that's part of the dispute resolution process, we're not the process. There are many outlets for mediation -- <a href="../../../t/i/n/WP%7ETINMC_f912.html" title="WP:TINMC">MedCab</a> which I mentioned earlier, the <a href="../../../h/e/c/WP%7EHEC_937d.html" title="WP:HEC">Harmonious Editing Club</a>, as well as <a href="../../../m/e/d/WP%7EMedCom_d7c8.html" title="WP:MedCom">MedCom</a>. In fact, if a case goes to MedCom and they feel not enough informal mediation has been done they send it to MedCab. Now say one of those users feels like he needs someone to stick up for his point of view <b>that's</b> where AMA comes in.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, all in all -- I don't understand your logic about changing this group into something that overlaps and duplicates other groups and I don't understand where the fire is that this needs to be voted on and the "transformation" begins. To be really honest with you Gator, and I hate pulling rank and I hate saying "I've done so and so and blah blah blah" but I just archived about 6 months worth of requests, do you want to know the number of requests you responded in some fashion to? <b>2</b>, and they're both on the current page. I think I quintupled that last night alone. Maybe if you had a record of many contributions to people looking for Advocates people would be more receptive to your POV. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 02:09, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey there's no reason to get hostile. All I'm saying is that I think it';s time that the AMA expanded, that's all. If the word "advocate" bothers you, then we should change the name. I personally cna define an advocate as somethign that encompasses mediations and and thir party neutral activity, but if you can't then let's change the name. But the name of the organization is not an argument and neitehr is th efact that another organization does the same thing. There's plenty of room here for both. Anyone else?Gator (talk) 18:00, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>IMO we should leave the possibility of performing additional tasks open, and our members who do not want to perform them don't have to. Gator who does want to mediate, can; whereas Wgfinley who doesn't, won't. Izehar (talk) 18:03, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>That sounds fair. I don't see why some members should be prohibited from doing that if they want to and no one would be forced to. Thanks.Gator (talk) 18:09, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Again, this makes no sense. This group has and has had a need it looks to serve, we don't need to bog it down with services duplicated by other groups. What next, if someone wants to come and revive the Wikipedia District Attorney and wants to do investigations within AMA we should allow that? How about a group of AMA members set themselves up as a Shadow ArbCom? This group doesn't need a bunch of bureaucratic process to bog it down, a lot of rules and allowances for expelling members for malfeasance that has never taken place before, nor a bunch of new objectives and tasks to distract us from what our mission is -- to be advocates. <b>Noone</b> is prohibiting people from mediating, as I said, you can go join <a href="../../../t/i/n/WP%7ETINMC_f912.html" title="WP:TINMC">MedCab</a> and still be in this group. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 02:05, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reforms? How about working the requests page?</span></h2>
<p>Okay, I just spent a couple of hours cleaning up the requests page and, you know what, it looks like the last person to do it was......<b>me</b>...... back in April. Handling requests is where it is at for us. After I saw some thoughts about "all these requests" we've been getting I had to see for myself.</p>
<p>Once I sorted them out there were about 20 requests in the past two months, that's not a lot. I went through a ton of them and there are a grand total of 6 requests left that I haven't done anything with yet. How about, instead of all these grand plans about committees and votes and removing people we finish the cleanup and respond to some requests? It's not that hard.</p>
<p>I moved everything before November into archive 4, there was just no sense in keeping all that there so the page is much easier to sort through now and everything is in the correct section, just need some folks to respond to a few of the requests.</p>

<p>You all might want to remove <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMissionary_fe7a.html" title="User:Missionary">Missionary</a>, seeing as he was just a sockpuppet.

<dd>Of course he should be removed - along perhaps with <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiUser_82f9.html" title="User:WikiUser">WikiUser</a>. Vandals and sockpuppets give us a bad name.

<p>Removed him given his own admission he was a sockpuppet. The <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiUser_82f9.html" title="User:WikiUser">WikiUser</a> issue is a bit more touchy and I think needs input from the group as to what to do about that. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 19:30, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
