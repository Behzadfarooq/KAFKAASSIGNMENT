I acknowledge that this is not always possible: some people do not share the common goal, or approach it so destructively that they hinder the project more than they advance it, and cannot or will not be won over.

<p>At some point you start to wonder, who's the bigger problem: the "problem users", or the people who feel the "problem users" need to be investigated and prosecuted? Why'd any of us start here: was it because we wanted to build an encyclopedia, or because we wanted to play politics and get on each other's nerves? I am currently listed as an AMI victim, and I have experience with this sort of thing: a handful of users will gang up on you no matter what you do, no matter how hard you try to appease them. You can offer them everything they want plus a little extra and it's no good, because you've been identified as a target and they'll never let up. If they win one battle, they don't sign a truce; they advance a little further and try to seize some more ground. Something has really got to be done. These people, Snowspinner being the foremost example, seem to have no interest in genuine dispute resolution; they are only about finding and harassing "problem users" until they either get banned or leave the project in disgust. This authoritarianism is a dangerous mentality that drives off users and distracts us all from the fundamental purpose of writing an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 07:35, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Disruptive users drive off a heck of a lot more users. If there is a chance that a user may reform, then they should be given every chance to do so. However, if a user's disruptive behaviour continues to outweigh their productive contributions, it is only appropriate that the Arbitration Committee acts in the interests of the vast majority of non-disruptive users, and deals with them, so that the rest of Wikipedia does not have to. Some people, even after one or more arbitration cases, just don't get the idea of playing well with others. This isn't about playing politics. It's about building a quality, neutral encyclopedia, and a prosecutorial office - to make things easier where arbitration may be necessary, but where a user may be afraid or unable to take the time to take that added step - is a useful addition to this goal. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 08:35, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd><i>to make things easier where arbitration may be necessary, but where a user may be afraid or unable to take the time to take that added step</i>—A group designed to aid those who ask for help with the difficult and time-consuming arbitration process would have merit. In fact, we have a well-respected group, whose name I should not need to repeat, which does exactly that.</dd>
<dd>Now consider this gang. Look at its currently active cases. Were any of them started because someone was having unresolvable difficulties with another user and needed help preparing an arbitration case? Let's see:
<ul>
<li>WHEELER: Did anyone ask Snowspinner to bring this case? Or did he just decide, by himself, that WHEELER was a "problem user" who needed to be "dealt with"?</li>
<li>Netoholic: Same question. Same answer.</li>
<li>Everyking: You can guess.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I will leave aside the merits of these cases for now, but the pattern is instructive. Past cases involving Snowspinner, now closed, might reveal similar patterns. —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Charles</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;P.</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mirv_1dda.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mirv">&#160;<sup><small>(Mirv)</small></sup></a>, <small><a href="../../../a/u/p/WP%7EAUP_1329.html" title="WP:AUP">AUP</a>, wants to know: Do you trust this self-appointed clique to judge your merit?</small> 09:33, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Everyking, if Snowspinner or others want to harass you by bringing meritless complaints, they can do so now, with or without an AMI. I'm not taking a position on any particular complaint against you or anyone else; I'm just saying that I don't see how an AMI, properly identified as <i>un</i>official, would facilitate that kind of abuse. There seems to be an implicit assumption that the AMI's decision to take a case would function as an adjudication of the merits. I don't see why it should. No one is suggesting that the ArbCom be displaced. If you think that some members of the ArbCom are mindless Snowspinner acolytes who would be unduly influenced, and who would vote to uphold a particular complaint simply because an AMI member was identified as helping to present it, then you should be pursuing the obvious remedy, which is to get better ArbCom members. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 08:29, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The Arbcom has shown a remarkable inability to correct Snowy's misbehavior, even with something so mild as a verbal reprimand, even when its own findings demonstrated that he was clearly in the wrong. Maybe "mindless acolytes" isn't a fair description; I might speak rather of an unduly close relationship and level of influence. So how do we find better ArbCom members? —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Charles</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;P.</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mirv_1dda.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mirv">&#160;<sup><small>(Mirv)</small></sup></a>, <small><a href="../../../a/u/p/WP%7EAUP_1329.html" title="WP:AUP">AUP</a>, wants to know: Do you trust this self-appointed clique to judge your merit?</small> 09:33, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't follow ArbCom actions closely enough to know exactly what you mean about correcting Snowspinner's misbehavior. If you mean that he's brought (or helped bring) RfAr's that were ill-advised, my response is that the bringing of a <i>frivolous</i> RfAr could be considered misconduct, but that a user who has concerns about another's conduct should have a pretty wide latitude to bring a complaint without worrying about being punished in response. The mere rejection of a complaint, or a finding that the complainant was "clearly in the wrong", doesn't indicate that there was "misbehavior". As for finding better ArbCom members, the answer is obvious. You note how the current members have acted on cases of concern to you. When they're up for re-election, you participate in the campaign, publicizing what they've done and why you agree or disagree with it. The election will be a rough indication of whether the community agrees with you. In the meantime, while we await the next election, you obviously disapprove of some of the things Snowspinner has done in the absence of an AMI. Do you think that giving such efforts a name and a <a href="../../../t/l/a/TLA_0bd4.html" title="TLA">TLA</a> will worsen the ArbCom's "remarkable inability" to act correctly? (I appreciate your response, by the way, as well as the responses from the AMI's proponents about the flip side -- how creating AMI would improve matters. My tentative judgment at this point is that the advantages and disadvantages are both being overstated.) <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 14:31, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Everyking, don't worry - if this measure passes so that Snowspinner and Grunt, two Wikipedians who wouldn't know a major edit of an article if they saw one, have the effective right to veto users that they don't like, many WPians will end up leaving. There are alternatives - for instance, the BBC has a website, h2g2, where all articles get peer reviewed before posting and the emphasis is on sharing knowledge rather than letting people who have no intention of writing articles dictate to those who do, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 08:56, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Where are you pulling this from? The only group on Wikipedia that has the right to take any action against users is the Arbitration Committee - of which Snowspinner is not a member, and of which Grunt was directly elected to by the Wikipedia community. This new organisation will have no right to "veto" users that they don't like, for the Arbitration Committee will still be able to reject (and indeed take action against the perpetrator of if necessary) any cases that are deemed to be frivolous, unwarranted or in bad faith. To suggest that the AMI will have some sort of mysterious "veto" on "users that they don't like" is sheer propaganda. (Also, accusing those who disagree with you of being here to boss people around instead of writing articles is downright offensive) <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 09:09, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

This whole proposal is about encouraging unpleasantness. The threat behind giving this proposal official status is clear: If you disagree with Snowspinner and Grunt, you get banned, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 10:06, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rubbish. I support the AMA, and indeed was a member of it until I was elected to the Arbitration Committee. That doesn't mean that I concede to every petition made by an AMA member - I take it into account, just as I would any other. I also strongly support this organisation, but that does not mean that I - or any other arbitrator - will be influenced by this organisation taking charge of a case. It is simply there as an assistant to those who may not be strong-willed enough to drag themselves through making a necessary case against someone alone. It is also of note that there are several cases pursued by Snowspinner in this way (Anthony comes to mind) where Grunt has indeed attempted to stonewall any action being taken - which makes it pretty damned clear, in my mind, that he's hardly bound to support an action just because it's being brought by Snowspinner or an organisation he founded. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 10:50, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just wanted to explain the changes made to this structure so far, in the hopes of clarifying why many of the objections seem to me to be moot by now. First of all, there is no dictator. There is a director. "Dictator" was meant as a joke. It was apparently not funny. For those objecting to the past usage of the term, I suggest you also object to Raul's position as Featured Article Director, which was previously Featured Article Dictator as well. Regardless, there is no longer a dictator.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are powers specifically denied to the director. He does not have veto power. He merely has the power to elevate people to senior partner. They then have the veto power. This goes hand in hand with another change, which is to demand that the director and senior partners seek approval before starting a case.</p>
<p>Finally, I have noted that the directorship is a finite position. I will not always run this association. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 16:06, Mar 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The director doesn't have veto power, but he gets to pick those who do. Those holding the veto power will be his cronies. Thus he manages to give the appearance of devolving power while ensuring that things will go his way anyway. The director and senior partners are supposed to ask for review, but note that only the senior partners may veto cases; partners can voice their disapproval, but so what?</dd>
<dd>Changing an infinite term to an indefinite one means little, especially when no mechanism exists for picking a new director. (My guess: the new director will be chosen from among the senior partners, who were, guess what, hand-picked by the old director.) Spread the opprobrium but keep the power, eh? —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Charles</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;P.</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mirv_1dda.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mirv">&#160;<sup><small>(Mirv)</small></sup></a>, <small><a href="../../../a/u/p/WP%7EAUP_1329.html" title="WP:AUP">AUP</a>, wants to know: Do you trust this self-appointed clique to judge your merit?</small> 16:53, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This page is, however, beyond help. It is quite clear that its aim is to hound out Wikipedians that this page's supporters do not like - as the earlier drafts prove. What we really should be doing is encouraging a speedy and <i>amicable</i> resolution to disputes, not a speedy and hostile one, where certain well-established Wikipedians (I wouldn't say editors as at least one has not made a major contribution to an article as far as I can see) chuck out those other editors whom they dislike.

<dd>The AMA is about allowing Wikipedians who get involved in the dispute process but who are not particularly articulate when defending themselves, to ask someone else to assist them in their defence. It's aim is to help the dispute get resolved better. The idea of the AMI seems to be to give Snowspinner, assisted by Grunt, a mandate to identify problem users, who will then be chucked out of here much sooner than is currently the case. You'll have to ask the supporters of this proposal as to why they continue to support it, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 10:11, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The AMA, in its current form, exists to assist users who are embroiled in a dispute in resolving that dispute. In terms of arbitration, it acts as a place where someone who has a case against them can have someone to defend them, in order to make things less stressful. The AMI, on the other hand, exists to fill the other side of this equation. A user may have a legitimate issue with another user, and one that may well need to be resolved by arbitration, but may not be strong-willed enough to go through the stress of bringing a case. Bringing an arbitration case <i>is</i> stressful. I've experienced it first hand. If the AMI had been around when I was a newer user, it would have spared me a lot of grief. With this in mind, I think the more pertinent question is to the the opponents of this proposal as to why they continue to oppose it.</dd>

<dd>As to Sam's comments - an outcry from the usual suspects (Mirv, Cecropia, Netoholic, Jguk and Sam Spade) does not maketh community outrage.

<dd>This <i>is</i> a group for helping people with the arbitration process. That is its one and only goal. As you quite well know, it is an unofficial organisation, so suggesting that it is official is just propaganda. It just differs slightly in organisation structure from the AMA because of the potential for abuse (following the example of the Mediation Committee, which has similar issues), and has the potential to work quite well once a variety of people are "senior partners". Indeed, since you appear to agree in principle, it seems to me that these differences could be worked out.</dd>

<dd><i>That is its one and only goal.</i>—The only one it proclaims publicly, anyway. Stated goals and actual goals don't always coincide.

<dd>Ambi, can you give me a single case in the past six months where the complainant has not succeeded in seeing sanctions taken against the accused party? I looked recently, I could find none. Not a single one. In any case, the slant against accused and towards complainants (usually admins) is staggering. I don't accept the notion that it is somehow hard to carry through an arbitration complaint, once it is accepted by the committee.

<dd>I realise it may have been intended to work for both sides, but I don't think this is the way that it is currently working in practice. I'm also inclined to think that they're perhaps better as seperate organisations, as both tasks generally require people with different skills - the AMA needs people who are fairly diplomatic, and with mediatorish skills, whereas the AMI needs people who are good at things such as collecting evidence. Both are important tasks; I'm just not sure that having the same people doing them is necessary.</dd>

<dd>Finally, I'm not throwing my weight behind this in an official capacity, but rather as a user who's spent a lot of time dealing with arbitration matters. I do think it's a good idea, and I do think it would make things easier on the parties involved. I really don't see that a conflict of interest is likely - I used to be an AMA advocate, but that doesn't bias me in their favor now - I can't see why supporting the creation of this would be any different. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 11:45, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good answers (and response by Mirv&#160;;). As far as I am concerned, you can say what you like <i>in a non-official capacity</i>. Grunt being a member is a bit awkward, but I don't personally critisise it, rather I merely warn than someone might someday. It is worth noting that active arbiters can't be AMA advocates due to concern over a conflict of interest. If you think my position as an AMA doesn't involve collecting copious evidence or prosecuting troublesome users, I suppose I ought to refer you to <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_Clients_f3d7.html" title="User:Sam Spade/Clients">User:Sam_Spade/Clients</a>, or cases I have been involved in:</p>

I think it is safe to say the AMA has long possessed a prosecutorial as well as defensive status in its advocacy, and that the AMI appears at a glace to be redundant.

<dl>
<dd>I am going to find myself, at this point, in the very rare position of agreeing with Sam. However, given the events transpiring here I cannot but give his statements my full support.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is a fundamental misunderstanding on the Wikipedia as to the purpose of the AMA. It exists, as a body, to represent <i>any</i> user who requires help navigating the dispute resolution process of the Wikipedia. As Sam noted, this <i>specifically includes</i> users who are initiating action against those they find disruptive, as well as users defending themselves against such accusations. I myself am involved in two (possibly three) such cases right now.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The way our dispute resolution process currently functions (for the record, as I suspect and very much hope that all present fully understand our judicial mechanisms) is that a user who is engaged in difficulties with anyone else initiates action as per the dispute resolution guidelines of this site. This specifically includes users who have had unfriendly encounters with those whom they consider "trolls", and those whose editing privileges they wish to get removed. Basically, therefore, we have a "citizens' arrest" system where vandals are concerned, which is, I think, in the spirit of communitarian action and cooperation that Wikipedia embodies. What some, including Ambi (and apparently other arbitrators as well) ask now is for a bureaucracy to be set up <i>for the specific purpose of hunting down and "bringing to justice" those who are considered vandals</i>. My reply is to ask what, exactly, is wrong with the current system? It's not as if too few people are being brought to the ArbCom — you all are having a pretty big job getting through all the cases. This project is, therefore, going to do one of two things: circumvent the dispute resolution process and therefore act unjustly, or utilize it against these "problem users" and clog the ArbCom so horribly that they will be hard-pressed to get anything done. Personally, I'm rooting for the latter, as I always prefer a non-working system of justice than a working system of injustice. However, that's a personal preference.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What's more, when I contested my last case before the ArbCom I was castigated by certain arbitrators for being overly formal. While they may well be right, since when do arbitrators stand in opposition to formality in cases themselves but stand in favor when considering the bureaucracy that leads <i>up</i> to cases. Why are the arbitrators even complaining at all? I am proud to say that I voted for most of them — most of <i>you</i> — and I certainly did not do so that they might bitch about not having enough meat thrown into the grinder.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, if we were to even <i>consider</i> a body such as this, a Wikipedia "prosecutor" as it were, it is only right that the position be elected. This is absolutely a necessity. I could not, and I know many others would agree, ever abide or tolerate a bunch of self-appointed jackboots running around dragging <i>anyone</i>, problem user or not, before anyone simply because they felt it necessary. To have such a thing stands in stark contrast to our values as a group of people. Forget the fact that our present system works more or less fine or that the AMA satisfies any legitimate role this organization would (I say legitimate in that, as Sam noted, we will prosecute but not seek out opportunities for prosecution), but running around looking for users to pick on is just a prescription for disaster. What's more, it is shameful. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 02:44, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There may be a misunderstanding about the intended purposes of the AMA - if so, it might be time that the AMA did some serious PR work. At the moment, it is acting solely as a form of Wiki-Legal-Aid for those brought before the ArbCom. I have <i>never</i> seen an advocate assist someone with bringing a case, and I personally struggle to picture any of the three current advocates assisting in bringing a case against someone.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Before you seek to summarise my words, you might do well to read them. This new body would <i>not</i> have the role of hunting down and dealing with "problem users". It would have the role of assisting those who feel that bringing a case is necessary, but are unwilling or unable to do so themselves. We've stated that time and time again, and to continually misrepresent this verges on bad faith.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I, along with most of the current ArbCom, have strongly opposed an increase in legalism when dealing with ArbCom cases. I don't think it's helpful in resolving disputes. This, on the other hand, is not an added legalistic step. It's just another organisation - just like the AMA (which I support and used to be a member of) - to assist people through a difficult process.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The AMA isn't elected - nor should it be. The same goes for the AMI. There would be no "bunch of self-appointed jackboots" dragging anyone to ArbCom. Just as the AMA would not seek out cases, neither would the AMI. However, they would quite happily assist with cases brought to them, where that user felt that they needed assistance with bringing an arbitration case. I really don't think it does you or Mirv any favors to continually throw propaganda around and to continually misrepresent the arguments of the proponents of this. I may not agree with Sam Spade, but at least he has had the courtesy to rationally discuss the issues at hand and not resort to such tactics. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 03:11, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And you might do well to read mine. <b>Why is this necessary?</b> I have seen no plague of trolls suddenly infecting this site to prompt the creation of a body such as this. I further suggest that if someone has problems with a user but cannot be bothered to use good citizenship in bringing them to through dispute resolution to a just conclusion that they are being bad neighbors and a detriment to the community that this site represents. As for advocates bringing cases in a prosecutorial fashion, I refer to the above examples, and additionally suggest that far more people require assistance in defending themselves than in prosecuting others, as those engaged in prosecuting others under the "citizens' arrest" basis I outlined above generally have far better knowledge of the operation of the system.</dd>
</dl>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with you wholeheartedly that any unnecessary legalism — including that of which I myself have been guilty — is undesirable. However, concomitant to that is increase in bureaucracy, which is part and parcel of the former.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You mention that the AMI would not be "seeking-out cases", and therefore there's no reason for its functionaries to be elected. You might forgive me if, based on initial descriptions of this organization on its own page, I am somewhat wary. You might forgive me if I am also wary of any organization whose "investigators" search for behavior considered antisocial simply because of some sort of "user tipoff". I have difficulty believing this does not set off alarms to you as it does me.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Where courtesy is concerned, I will not stoop to discussion of your "propoganda" remarks but only note that on the AMA page you came very close to accusing me of being either a troll or a user purposefully aiding them. I will also note that you, as an arbitrator, ought to choose your words of censure a trifle more carefully. I also trust that you might assume good faith and not automatically censure me for what is much more likely a misunderstanding — if I have made any such error (I will cite an initial characterization of this body as more independent than that which it is intended to be), I apologize. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 03:30, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

In my opinion he should have since the admins had clearly violated Wikipedia <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">banning and blocking</a> policies. It is also clear to me why the admins did a permanent ban themselves instead of going though proper Wikipedia <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a> procedures. If they had done that, and Dnagod had decided to contest an RfAr with his own evidence, I believe it very likely that the arbitrators would have had no choice but to sanction several other users and admins besides ruling on User:Dnagod. <a href="../../../g/k/_/User%7EGK_aed0.html" title="User:GK">gK</a> <a href="../../../g/k/_/User_talk%7EGK_b00e.html" title="User talk:GK">¿?</a> 14:13, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's a pretty good question after the schoolyard <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catfight.html" title="Catfight">catfight</a> that accompanied the creation of this group. Almost everybody has behaved rather disgracefully and they should be <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shame.html" title="Shame">ashamed</a> of themselves. Before this association was created I probably would have said that I liked the idea and something like it should be created. After that unseemly display, however, I am a bit surprised that there hasn't been an overwhelming <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensus.html" title="Consensus">consensus</a> to delete this article over at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_District_Attorney%27s_Office_56bb.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/District Attorney's Office">WP:VFD</a>. Even if this association survives the VFD vote, you are probably going to have serious problems having anyone take the AMI seriously. Your best bet would be to chose someone less controversial and less stubborn than <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> as your <a href="../../../f/i/g/Figurehead.html" title="Figurehead">figurehead</a>, especially during the initial startup period where you will need the most support from the general <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedians_0c31.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedians">Wikipedian</a> <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen.html" title="Citizen">citizenry</a> for it to become an effective organization.</p>
<p>I really do believe that something like this organization is needed on the Wikipedia to handle problems that the <a href="../../../a/m/a/WP%7EAMA_ced1.html" title="WP:AMA">WP:AMA</a> really isn't set up to handle. There are a very small number of Wikipedia editors (probably less than ten) who are constantly involved in small <a href="../../../e/w/_/WP%7EEW_c046.html" title="WP:EW">edit</a> and <a href="../../../r/v/_/WP%7ERV_7050.html" title="WP:RV">revert</a> wars, who are involved in regular <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>, and who often break other Wikipedia <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">policies and guidelines</a>. They are smart enough that their behavior related to any one article or individual is usually not enough to file an <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> over, but the totality of their actions on the Wikipedia spread over dozens of articles and individuals can be much worse than someone who spends all of their time edit warring over a single article like <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision.html" title="Circumcision">circumcision</a>. If nobody digs into the Contributions for an editor that they have had problems with, they would never know that the editor had been causing problems on dozens of articles. (A suggestion: The AMI should consider <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/a/Wikipedia%7EAMA_Requests_for_Assistance_1619.html" title="Wikipedia:AMA Requests for Assistance">Wikipedia:AMA Requests for Assistance</a> as part of an early warning system and should look to see who the participants in each article dispute are.

If people think this forms some sort of crusade on my part, I can only say that I trust the arbcom's rulings, and that there is little I can do to a user without their assent. All I can do is ask them to look at things. If what I point them to is a problem, they deal with it.

I don't agree with it, but I'm sure you intend to prove me wrong. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 06:26, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd say find Snowspinner and see if there's still a reason for this to be here. If not, I'd consolidate their role into the AMA and be done with it. <a href="../../../c/q/j/User%7ECQJ_12e6.html" title="User:CQJ">CQJ</a> 22:55, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
