<p>We need to get some more sources in the article to help structure it better. We need external sources for things such as first appearances of the practice in film.</p>
<p>We also could do with expanding upon the history, but only if it were well sourced.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 12:31, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's the problem. Facts about hardcore porn, especially about the more revolting aspects, are never well-sourced; this problem was emphasized a few times during the deletion discussion. The first appearance likely was never "on film" but rather on video (the porn industry stopped using film in the 1980s, I think).</dd>
<dd>I recall seeing it first in the late 1980s in a <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Jeremy_5f73.html" title="Ron Jeremy">Ron Jeremy</a> video shown at a bachelor party, and the general reaction of the audience was either revulsion or shock ("doesn't she know where that thing has <i>been</i>?!"). Assigning an actual term to the practice likely came later. Now it's everywhere. =<a href="../../../a/x/l/User%7EAxlq_af18.html" title="User:Axlq">Axlq</a> 18:27, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Speaking of sources, I just tried and failed to find something... I could swear I saw in another Wikipedia article a sourced statement that porn stars get an enema to wash out any fecal matter before being filmed having anal sex. I can't find it in the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anal_sex.html" title="Anal sex">anal sex</a> article though. If this is true (and it seems sensible), then it deserves a mention in the health risks section of this article, perhaps in the context of "don't try this at home; leave it to the professionals." =<a href="../../../a/x/l/User%7EAxlq_af18.html" title="User:Axlq">Axlq</a> 06:05, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>First of all, thanks to <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenAveling_8f0b.html" title="User:BenAveling">BenAveling</a> (<a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_584c.html" title="User talk:BenAveling">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BenAveling_a072.html" title="Special:Contributions/BenAveling">contribs</a>) for adding that "offensive" notice at the top of the talk page.

<p>Okay, so I've been asked to take a look at this, and I can't help to add my two cents (as a 3rd party editor). Frankly, I don't see why this particular article is getting so heated. There are many other articles that cover similar <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornographic.html" title="Pornographic">pornographic</a> topics, but I don't see anyone complaining there. First, I would like to know why exactly CyberAnth and 193.219.28.146 feel this article is not encyclopedic. I know that other encyclopedias don't cover such topics, but we're Wikipedia, a free encyclopedia. By no means are we an academic encyclopedia, as you can see by the wide array of content here. This is just a compendium of all notable knowledge. I don't see how this particular article seems offensive to anyone. When you think about it, this all has to do with human sexual behavior. However odd it may be, it still is encyclopedic and at Wikipedia, such articles are welcomed. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 21:16, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>One thing the article does not address is why someone would do this. My understanding is that people who engage in anal sex generally consider it to be superior to oral sex. If such a person has successfully obtained access to his partner's anus, why would he want to withdraw his penis without achieving climax just to transition to an alternate form of sex that he considers inferior? 4.89.247.63 01:21, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not only that, but the article doesn't explain the reason the <i>receiving</i> person would want to do this, either. Som people like to do strange things. Or perhaps the practice only occurs in porn videos. As editors, however, it is not our place to pass judgement. At best, all we can do is try to find a verifiable, citable source who can explain it. =<a href="../../../a/x/l/User%7EAxlq_af18.html" title="User:Axlq">Axlq</a> 04:47, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a personal advocate of ATM, I must say that the heightened sense of "naughtiness" or defiance, is likely what gives ATM its extreme appeal to those of us in the anal-to-oral scene. Likewise, female participants often relish the tawdry nature of the act. Mike Brennan, a well-known porn actor, said that it was the only way he actually enjoyed having sex on film, despite the many other acts he has engaged in. That being said, Mr. Brennan's coprophilic nature (he is also an advocate of the dirty Sanchez), may preclude him from giving unbiased opinions on the subject.</dd>

<dd>UPDATE - Anyone heard of Kelsey Murray? I came across a bad porn movie on cable starring Ms. Murray, who performed an act of ATM on a male participant who had actually had his penis is a second woman's rectum. Rather surprising - I figured ATM'ers stuck to only fellating penises which has been in their *own* ass, but I suppose it's not always the case. Anyway, I think it was called "Chef's School" or something. Has anyone seen Kelsey in any other porn movies? Preferably also doing ATM? 69.41.206.59 21:50, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I read the story, which was interesting indeed, but I can't say anything about it because I wasn't involved in that situation so I know nothing about it. All I can say is that although <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CENSORED" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not censored</a> there are of course limits. An article that simply describes a certain sexual term or act, like this one, should <b>not</b> be censored. Photos depicting such acts might not be really suitable for Wikipedia. It's all really a gray area though and very prone to intense debates and heated discussions, so each situation will have to be judged differently.

<p>While the subject of this article doesn't appeal to me either, it would seem that 193.219.28.146 was reverted and blocked (not "censored") because (a) the comment above, comparing Wikipedia to Britannica, violates the leading two paragraphs in <a href="../../../t/a/l/WP%7ETALK_766c.html" title="WP:TALK">WP:TALK</a>; (b) repeated <a href="../../../d/i/s/WP%7EDIS_ceec.html" title="WP:DIS">disruption</a> from re-adding the comment violates <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>; and (c) repeated violations of <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>.

By that definition we should have pictures of child abuse on the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_pornography.html" title="Child pornography">child pornography</a> article. Let's try and keep it real here. I do agree that your initial comments were in good faith and seem to have been reverted a bit hastily but can we keep this debate on track. <span style="border:2px solid #FFEEAA;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedro1999a_d138.html" title="User:Pedro1999a"><b>Pedro</b></a><small>1999a</small> | <a href="../../../p/e/d/User_talk%7EPedro1999a_e883.html" title="User talk:Pedro1999a"><font style="color:#accC10;background:#FF0011;">&#160;Talk&#160;</font></a></span> 22:35, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I gave link to this article on wikitruth, because it shows quite nice what is the (extreme but logical) consequence of current Wikipedia policies. "Zero censorship" policy is slippery slope in practice. "Zero censorship" + "we need pictures in every article" = pornopedia, not encyclopedia, and even Jimbo realizes this. <a href="../../../1/9/3/User%7E193.219.28.146.html" title="User:193.219.28.146">193.219.28.146</a> 23:00, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-sequitur.html" title="Non-sequitur">Non-sequitur</a>. Nobody has suggested adding pictures here. And you haven't explained how this discussion is constructive to improving this article. Please do so. I confess I am curious why you feel your comment at the beginning of this section is important enough to violate policy and get yourself blocked. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmatulic_b5b8.html" title="User:Amatulic">Amatulic</a> 01:47, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
