<p><b>Asset forfeiture</b> is a term used to describe the confiscation of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assets.html" title="Assets">assets</a>, by the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State.html" title="State">State</a>, which are either (a) the proceeds of <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime.html" title="Crime">crime</a> or (b) the instrumentalities of crime. Instrumentalities of crime are property which was used to facilitate <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime.html" title="Crime">crime</a>, for example cars used to transport illegal narcotics. The terminology used in different jurisdictions varies. Some jurisdictions use the term "confiscation" instead of forfeiture.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Asset_forfeiture.html" title="Edit section: The civil law/criminal law distinction">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The civil law/criminal law distinction</span></h3>
<p>Most legal systems distinguish between the criminal and the civil, generally using separate courts, different procedures and different evidential rules. The traditional view is that crimes are public wrongs and that the criminal law addresses those who harm society through morally culpable acts in order that punishment may be imposed and potential offenders may thereby be deterred from committing similar offences. Criminal proceedings are therefore “officially designated ceremonies of guilt designation” and the label “criminal” carries with it a social stigma which is not imposed on the losing party in a civil action. Because of this stigma and the potential punishment which may be imposed by a criminal court, legal systems provide procedural protections above those available to a respondent in a civil case. For example, criminal proceedings require a higher standard of proof than that normally applied in civil proceedings.Generally it is the state which brings criminal proceedings. However, this is not an absolute rule since many jurisdictions also allow private individuals to initiate criminal prosecutions.</p>
<p>The bringing of civil proceedings is, by comparison, primarily the forum for a wronged private individual. Nevertheless this too is not an absolute position, as the state also may sue in the civil courts as a wronged individual, for example, in respect of a contractual dispute with a multinational company. Civil law does not aim to punish, but rather is designed to provide two types of remedy. Firstly, it provides a remedy requiring a return to the way things were, the status quo ante, so as to restore the position of an injured party. Secondly, it provides a remedy to compensate an injured party for harm done to him.</p>
<p>While the traditional view of civil and criminal proceedings might be described as neighbouring countries divided by a common border, this dichotomy is not as distinct as that metaphor might suggest. In recent years there has been a growing homogeneity between criminal and civil procedures. Criminal cases now often involve civil, or quasi-civil, procedures and some civil litigation has become quasi-criminal. Indeed it has been said that almost every attribute associated with the criminal law also appears in civil law and visa versa. This “significant disintegration of the wall between criminal and civil proceedings” has occurred on a number of fronts and is due, at least in part, to the fact that multiple strategies are now used to deal with crime. An early example was the use of injunctions to protect victims of domestic violence, even though, to obtain such an injunction, the plaintiff may be alleging the commission of a criminal assault. Rather than the traditional dichotomist perspective therefore, legal proceedings might be better seen as a continuum, with distinctly civil proceedings at one end and clearly criminal proceedings at the other. Between the two ends of the continuum are a range of possibilities, each of which may be more or less criminal or civil.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Asset_forfeiture.html" title="Edit section: The trend towards civil forefeiture">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The trend towards civil forefeiture</span></h3>
<p>The traditional approach to serious criminality has been arrest, followed by the institution of criminal proceedings with a view to conviction and imprisonment. In recent years, such has been the wealth generated from economic crime and, in particular, from drug-related crime, that a confiscation or forfeiture element has been added to the criminal process in many jurisdictions. The need for a broader response than a solely criminal one was recognised by the US President’s Commission on Organised Crime as long ago as 1986&#160;:</p>
<p>”To be successful, an attack on organised crime in our mainstream economy cannot rely solely on the enforcement of federal criminal laws…The Commission believes that a strategy aimed at the legitimate economic base of organized crime must build upon the recent successes of law enforcement, and must be based upon intervention measures as broad based as the nature of the threat posed by organized crime. A strategy in this area should also rely upon civil and regulatory measures tailored to the specific problems confronted…”</p>
<p>Although pioneered in the USA, there now appears to be a global trend to use stand-alone civil proceedings as a means of recovering the proceeds of crime in the hope that they will be more effective than proceedings which are ancillary to, and dependent on, a criminal prosecution. Recent examples of jurisdictions which have introduced civil forfeiture legislation include Italy, South Africa, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Fiji, the Canadian Provinces of Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and British Columbia, Australia and its individual States, and Antigua and Barbuda. In addition, the Commonwealth has produced model provisions to serve as a template for jurisdictions who wish to introduce such legislation.</p>
<p>This trend towards civil forfeiture has been prompted by the nature of organised crime. Organised crime heads use their resources to keep themselves distant from the crime which they are controlling and to mask the criminal origin of their assets. For this reason it has become extremely difficult to carry out successful criminal investigations leading to the prosecution and conviction of such individuals, with the result that finances derived from crime are often effectively out of the reach of the law and are available to be used to finance more crime. Such peaceful enjoyment of the proceeds of crime damages public confidence in the rule of law and provides harmful role models. This has led to a recognition that criminal confiscation regimes may be inadequate and ineffective in certain cases.</p>

<p>There are two types of forfeiture cases, criminal and civil. Almost all forfeiture cases practiced today are civil. In <b>civil forfeiture</b> cases, the US Government sues the item of property, not the person; the owner is effectively a third party <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plaintiff.html" title="Plaintiff">claimant</a>. Once the government establishes <a href="../../../p/r/o/Probable_cause.html" title="Probable cause">probable cause</a> that the property is subject to forfeiture, the owner must prove on a "preponderance of the <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evidence_%28law%29.html" title="Evidence (law)">evidence</a>" that it is not. The owner need not be judged guilty of any crime. In contrast, <b>criminal forfeiture</b> is usually carried out in a sentence following a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conviction_%28law%29.html" title="Conviction (law)">conviction</a> and is a punitive act against the offender. Since the government can choose which type of case, a civil case is almost always chosen. The costs of such cases is high for the owner, usually totaling around $10,000 and can take up to three years.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Marshals_Service_ef55.html" title="United States Marshals Service">United States Marshals Service</a> is responsible for managing and disposing seized and forfeited properties. It currently manages around $1 billion worth of property. The goal of the program is to maximize the net return from seized property by selling at <a href="../../../a/u/c/Auction.html" title="Auction">auctions</a> and to the private sector and then using the property and proceeds for law enforcement purposes.</p>

These fall into various types. Firstly there are confiscation proceedings which may follow a criminal conviction.
