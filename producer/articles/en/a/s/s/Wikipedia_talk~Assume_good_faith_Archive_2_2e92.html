<h2><span class="mw-headline">Does AGF extend to suspicious IP edits?</span></h2>
<p>Now that there are some nice tools for scanning IP edits, does AGF extend to those edits? There's a type of vandalism associated with them: just inserting a word or two of nonsense in one or two places that can linger for months. Sometimes it's not easy to guage if such an edit is vandalism or just seemingly out of context jargon.

<dd>I agree, the logo doesn't belong. It doesn't add anything and there's no consensus at all for it's inclusion.

<dd>I'm not trying to be disruptive, I just want to see this image used. The creator put hard work into it, and I tried to make a good faith contribution to the encyclopedia when I first added it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Acceptable to everyone</span></h2>
<p>I'm going through the guidelines and policies for the first time. Near the end about what happens when assuming bad faith: "The ideal is to make articles acceptable to everyone." Is this actually the case? To me, this reads as, make it into a variation of newspeak where it says absolutely nothing at all or is so ambiguous that anybody can read whatever they like into it. Or, as has been the case with the article I'm actively trying to contribute to at the moment, <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nineteen_Eighty-Four_808a.html" title="Nineteen Eighty-Four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a>, just let everybody keep adding whatever they want to it until it is so huge that nobody wants to spend the time to go through it. I'm assuming you want a useful encyclopedia, not an accumulation of the world's toxic waste.</p>
<p>I realize you're stating that's the ideal and that other policies need to be balanced against it. I just wish that would either be explicitly stated there or the ideal left to the NPOV policy page where all the necessary context is provided. Adding/redefining/summarizing a well-defined policy on a guideline page is not making anything clearer.</p>
<p>My ideal of NPOV as I would state it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make articles reflect what the majority of the experts agree upon without adding additional opinion or conclusions to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>To me, that goes the extra step of not only assuming good faith, but requiring that those participating show enough good faith that they provide experts that support their contribution, causing them to also, at least at a basic level, comply with the verifiability rule too. I really don't think these rules need to conflict (and mislead) if they are expressed more precisely.<a href="../../../i/n/1/User%7EIn1984_a6f9.html" title="User:In1984">In1984</a> 23:04, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You misunderstand NPOV. We don't try to write 'what is correct' rather what we try to write is what is undisputable fact. Bob says the moon is made of cheese, sue says the moon is made of rock. They do not agree on the composition of the moon but both can agree that bob and sue have made their respective claims. Obviously it's not always simple to apply, and some sense has to be applied, but thats the spirit. What you propose would involve intentionally biasing articles because someone would have to pick the experts (or the method for picking experts). --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 21:16, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I understand that the objective is "undisputable fact", not truth. That's the first line of verifiability. No dispute there.&#160;:) I see NPOV and verifiability as recursive, so I don't see a conflict in selecting experts. Even if there is one, it's a conflict that's important because it is part of the foundation for the encyclopedia. Leaving it up to votes or changing the language to offend no one turns this into a collection campaign speeches, not knowledge. Even then, I'm offended when I come across meaningless writing. So the goal of being acceptable to everyone is still impossible to satisfy.</dd>

<dd>If there's an expert problem, it's more likely to be in articles that cover things like music and film. Even there, certain parts lend themselves to expert review as opposed to claims of fingers up and down. For example, if a society of animators that includes nearly all animators and cuts across company and international boundaries declares a certain film's animation as the best ever, it would be fair to cite that as support for a statement in an article on the film that its animation, if nothing else, is the best. As for the fingers up and down areas that remain, you can link to sites dedicated to fan reviews like IMDB and simply exclude it from the article as something that is impossible to present without potential bias. As I understand verifiability and NPOV, if neither can be satisfied, leave it out, or, as an alternative, insert a statement to that effect so people reading it are not tempted to keep adding their view. <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E200.50.160.167.html" title="User:200.50.160.167">200.50.160.167</a> 06:30, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I changed "This policy does not require that editors continue to assume good faith in the presence of evidence to the contrary. Things which can cause the loss of good faith include vandalism, personal attacks, and edit warring." to "This policy does not require that editors continue to assume good faith in the presence of evidence to the contrary.

<p>this being because I've seen several sockpuppets cynically remind other editors to "assume good faith!" - new accounts, mind you, with a sophisticated knowledge of WP rules and procedure, immediately involving themselves in edit wars - and I think it appropriate to note that in such cases, good faith ought not be the mandated default assumption.Timothy Usher 07:33, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm not sure what you're proposing. No assumption of good faith for new users? That's certainly not a good idea. Plenty of people read articles here for a long time (thus becoming familiar with how everything works) and only register once something piques their interest. The presumption of good faith can be rebutted by evidence of bad faith. Sometimes, this is pretty simple, and a quick glance is enough to see bad faith. If there is strong evidence that a user is a "sockpuppet," then you don't have to assume they aren't. But you shouldn't assume that anybody is, or force them to somehow prove that they aren't (I don't even know how they would do this) right off the bat. --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheapestcostavoider_7826.html" title="User:Cheapestcostavoider">Cheapestcostavoider</a> 20:18, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I've been on the same pages as Timothy recently, and I know where he's coming from. An editor met with opposition, and then a string of new editors showed up and began to support him. They reverted aggressively to his version, followed him to different pages which they'd have been unlikely to stumble on by chance, and voted for what he voted for, and supported him in discussion. One was found through a user check to be operating from his IP. Then, while he was blocked, a new user showed up, said on the talk page that he was new but agreed with the arguments of the (temporarily blocked) user, and then reverted back to his version, and also started an edit war. The blocked user was asked on his talk page if he had any connection any of the new users who supported him, and he said no. Unfortunately, he forgot that he was logged on as one of them at the time, and his signature betrayed him!&#160;!&#160;!&#160;!</p>
<p>Since then, five new users have turned up to support him, all using a particular (and very idiosyncratic) spelling mistake, and using similar language and displaying similar behaviour. A checkuser hasn't shown any link between this user and the more recent newcomers, but they could be meatpuppets who joined Wikipedia at his request in order to help him to get more than three reverts a day. They show little interest in editing other articles. One of them has 42 article edits, of which 37 are reverts to the version of the established sockpuppeter. The established editors who object are constantly told to "assume good faith".</p>
<p>In my experience, genuine newcomers don't normally know how to revert (unless it's a revert of just a sentence, which they insert or delete manually), and don't know how to track contributions, and don't edit war with such confidence against established users. Voting, reverting, and following another user's contributions are signs of sockpuppetry from brand new users. I support Timothy's addition, though of course I would not want a new user to be labelled as a sockpuppet on the basis of having the same POV as another user. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 21:29, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Assume Good Faith: a stupid policy?</span></h2>
<p>What would happen if you did away with the <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>? Isn't the better thing to do all other things being equal, to "assume bad faith and/or stupidity", and (more importantly, I think) "assume other people will assume bad faith and/or stupidity about you"?</p>
<p>This is just a starting assumption; an onus which can be displaced. But that onus is on <i>you</i>, the editor, to displace it: to establish bny the content of what you're writing that you're acting in good faith and intelligently. You're best placed to discharge the presumption; much better than another editor who is required to give you the benefit of the doubt and liberally construe your words. They're <i>your</i> words - it's in your gift to make them unambiguous, clear, courteous and intelligent.</p>
<p>This has the advantage of, more or less, replicating the circumstnances in which we find ourselves when we get out of bed every day - this is how we do engage in the real world. Of course, we might modify this for someone we have already come across before ("he was pretty sensible last time; no reason to think he won't be sensible now") and for people we know we will have to come across again (this is the analogue of the first round of an iterated prisoner's dilemma) - but the discretion whether to actually assume good faith rests with the construer, rather than being an enforceable entitlement of the construed.</p>

<dd>Fair point, I suppose - but the latter aspect is the more important one. We can't legislate to force people to assume good faith, and there's not much point trying. What's the consequence of not assuming good faith? Indeed, how can you ever establish someone isn't? It seems to even having this "rule" out there serves as an invitation to classic passive aggressive (and illegitimate) tactics. Let's face facts: say, "folks: have thick skins.

Someone could almost always be acting in good faith, for example a penis image vandal might think he's helping to convince us to turn off open editing which he believes is a bad policy.

<dd>I think it's generally fairly clear when someone is deliberately vandalising pages. When it's not, and particularly when the person making the changes is a new user, then assuming they're acting in good faith seems like a good policy: removing their changes without even indicating a good reason why is only going to drive away people who want to improve articles. For example, I noticed one page on my watch-list yesterday had been marked as 'reverting vandalism' after someone changed the first flight date of an old military aircraft. Yet five minutes on Google found a number of pages claiming that the each of the two flight dates was correct, so it appears there's a genuine disagreement. That's the kind of thing which should have been discussed on the talk page before the original editor changed it, but someone else had decided to claim it was vandalism instead, rather than reverting it and suggesting a discussion on the talk page. As a relatively new editor who's read Wikipedia for quite a while before I registered, I have to say I've seen more problems caused by anti-vandals with 'revert fever' than from actual vandals. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 17:36, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
