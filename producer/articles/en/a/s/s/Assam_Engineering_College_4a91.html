It started with Civil Engineering discipline, and within a few years other departments came into existence. Currently, it provides Bachelor's Degree in eight different engineering traits and also provides Master's Degree in Computer Application, Civil Engineering and Industrial and Production Engineering. There is a scheme for Doctorate Degrees in <a href="../../../s/o/i/Soil_Mechanics_834d.html" title="Soil Mechanics">Soil Mechanics</a> &amp; <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydraulics.html" title="Hydraulics">Hydraulics</a> as well. It's annual festival called the "Pyrokinesis" attracts students from the entire region.

<p>Pyrokinesis, the annual national level technical cum cultural festival of Assam Engineering College has curved a niche among all academic institutions of the north east in the last couple of years due to its unique composition and fostering of friendship among the participating institutions.</p>
<p><br />
'<i><b>Pyrokinesis kindles the creative essence of the versatile young mind</b></i> <b>providing a perfect platform to unite its ‘technical’ genius with the</b> <b>vibrant ‘cultural' quotient.'</b></p>
<p>Pyrokinesis is a word not found in the dictionary. Neither has it meant something substantial. If the word is broken into two, it may mean something like "moving fire" or "setting things ablaze".Just shows that AECians wants to put ablaze their creativity and talents.</p>
<p><br />
The three day long event showcase the various technical and cultural extravaganza.</p>
<p>The events include:</p>
<p>1. Tecnokinesis (the technical section of the event)</p>
<p>Big-Gyan, the seminar,</p>
<p>Technocracy, the technical exhibition,</p>
<p>Wrangler, the debating contest,</p>
<p>Grey Cells, the quizzing contest,</p>
<p>Brainstorm, the school quiz,</p>
<p>Codewar, the software contest,</p>
<p>Skoar, the gaming contest,</p>
<p>Different Strokes, the painting contest,</p>
<p>Visual Impact, the photography contest.</p>
<p>2. The cultural section of the event includes</p>
<p>Mars and Venus, the ultimate personality contest</p>
<p>Pyrotechnix, the rock contest</p>
<p>Blue Suede Shoes, the DJ night</p>
<p>Sanskriti, a performance by school-children,</p>
<p>Iron Man, body-building contest,</p>
<p>Cynosure, the main event,</p>
<p>Dance Mania, DJ night.</p>
<p><br />
Technokinesis the technical section of this fest, provides a common arena to all budding technocrats to prove their mettle in a combat of wits that ignites the intellect and mobilizes the inquisitive mind. It also gives the wannabe ‘techies’ an insight into the latest cutting–edge technology and contemporary path breaking research through various lecture-sessions, workshop and discussion forums conducted by the stalwarts in this field.</p>
