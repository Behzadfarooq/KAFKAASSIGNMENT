Nestorian archbishop with Assyrian fighters in Persia.</div>

<p>Before <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, about half of the Assyrian population lived in what is today <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, specifically the <a href="../../../h/a/k/Hakkari.html" title="Hakkari">Hakkari</a> region. In 1914, <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Turks_61fd.html" title="Young Turks">Young Turks</a> began to systemically target Christians of <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia_Minor_99e3.html" title="Asia Minor">Asia Minor</a> with events such as the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_Genocide_c598.html" title="Assyrian Genocide">Assyrian Genocide</a>. In the beginning, key Assyrian nationalist leaders and religious figures were wiped out of communities, where as at one point the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriarch.html" title="Patriarch">patriarch</a> of the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_Church_of_the_East_3c63.html" title="Assyrian Church of the East">Assyrian Church of the East</a> was only twelve years old (<a href="../../../m/a/r/Mar_Eshai_Shimun_XXIII_68dd.html" title="Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII">Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII</a>).<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> declared war against the Allies and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> in October of 1914. For geographic reasons, it was important for the British to gain the support of the Assyrians.</p>
<p>Because of large oil fields, Britain wanted to insure that the <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosul.html" title="Mosul">Mosul</a> region would be part of the newly-colonized Iraq instead of the future state of <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>. The Assyrians promised loyalty to the British in return for an independent state in the future. After the invasion of Mosul by the Young Turks, the Assyrian army, led by General <a href="../../../a/g/h/Agha_Petros_c1b6.html" title="Agha Petros">Agha Petros</a>, fought intensively against the Turkish soldiers and pushed them out of the region, leading to Britain's control of the region. The battles are described in detail by <a href="http://www.assyrianlevies.com/gpage1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.assyrianlevies.com/gpage1.html" rel="nofollow">surviving letters</a> of Petros and British officials.</p>
<p>By the end of 1922, no sufficient Assyrian population was left in Turkey and a small population left in Iran. Many fled southward to join native Assyrians in the Nineveh plains.</p>
<p>The Assyro-Chaldean National Council stated in a December 4, 1922 memorandum that the total death toll is unknown, but it estimates that about 275,000 "Assyro-Chaldeans" died between 1914â1918.<sup id="_ref-Yacoub_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Yacoub" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>In the letter the bishop wrote that 90,000 Assyrians had been massacred by the Turks. He also said that the Assyrian people were against the proposed autonomy of the Kurds. The letter convinced France to allow Assyrian representation during the upcoming peace conference.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Assyrian group from Iran arrived in France first. The British, having no authority in Iran and fearing the presence of a group which it could not control, forced the Iranian Assyrian delegation to leave Paris and not participate.</p>
<p>Then the Assyrian delegates from the United States arrived.

The United States stood with Great Britain in these deliberations, the latter promising 20% of the oil industry business be awarded to American companies.

<p>The Constantinople Conference was between Great Britain and Turkey, May 21, 1924 The Assyrians were told that Britain was "fighting" their case for them and that there was no need for them to attend. A letter on behalf of the Assyrians and their settlement was written under the direction of Sir Henry Conway Dobbs, the British High Commissioner in Iraq, under "Statement of Proposals for the Settlement of the Assyrian People in Iraq", in that regard.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>The government of Turkey claimed Mosul as part of Turkey, and Fetâhi Beg declared that the Assyrians, who he referred to as Nestorians, are welcome to live in their previous lands in Turkey where they would find freedom. Sir Percy Cox stated that Mosul belongs to Iraq and that the Christian Assyrians need protection from Turkey.</p>
<p>This was part of his statement:</p>

<p>Ultimately, no agreement was reached. Turkey then massed its troops on the border to occupy the Mosul Province by force. The Assyrian Levy Force of 2000 was sent north to protect Iraq since the Iraqi army at this time was unfit to undertake such a task. The Assyrian force was largely responsible for the annexation of Mosul to Iraq rather than to Turkey, as an official of the League of Nations stated.</p>

<p>June 16, 1925 The Commission presented its findings. It recommended that the Assyrian people receive full protection if they were to return to Turkey, that they be given their freedom, and that they receive reimbursements for all their loses during World War I.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[13]</a></sup> The Commission further recommended the Patriarch, Mar Eshai Shimunbe, be given full authority over his people.</p>
<p>These recommendations were not approved.

<p>In 1925 the Permanent Court of International Justice took over the disputed border line issue and, in December 1925, adopted a resolution which refused the idea of the Assyrian's return to HakkÃ¢ri and gave that region to Turkey, while giving Mosul to Iraq and settling on a border line almost matching the same status quo line which was called the Brussels Line. Further, it recommended the continuation of the British mandate on Iraq for another 25 years to safeguard the Assyrian interests.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

<p>On November 11, 1927, the Assyrians continued to protest their mistreatment and continued to send letters to the League of Nations, requesting a report from both the governments of Britain and Iraq concerning the situation. The Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague did not accept the reports of Britain and Iraq and requested that both countries fulfill their obligations towards the Assyrians. At the same time, some Assyrians are not considered full citizens of the country. In 1992-93 all Assyrian teachers and professors who had previous Ottoman nationality were forced to retire.

<p>Britain dropped the earlier established recommendations by the Mandate Commission on the grounds that those recommendations should be directed to the Turkish Government and not the Iraqi Government, Assyrians from the HakkÃ¢ri and Tur Abdin originally, escaped and have no intentions of returning to Turkey. Hence, they should occupy the land the Iraqi government has provided for them.</p>
<p>Several treaties were signed and ratified between Britain and Iraq in the next two years in what seemed to be Britain's preparations to clear the way for Iraq to enter the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Three petitions were received by the Mandate Commission stressing the fears of the Assyrians regarding the termination of the Mandate; they were dated in September <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a>, October 20, 1931 and October 23, 1931. One was rejected by Sir Francis Humphrys on the grounds that it was submitted by a person not qualified to represent the Assyrians. Humphrys still pledged the moral responsibility of Great Britain to the future attitude of the Iraqi government.</p>
<p>The October 23, 1931 petition was submitted by His Holiness Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII, in Mosul, asking for permission to allow the Assyrians to leave Iraq before the end of the Mandate, stating that it would be impossible for the Assyrians to live in Iraq. This decision was reached at with the agreement of all the Assyrian leaders and when responses to this petition were delayed, the Assyrians decided to take action and planned for a general 'cessation of service' by all the Levies.</p>
<p>The Mandate Commission reviewed the Assyrian petition and was still not satisfied with Britain's and Iraq's assurances of protection of minorities. Worth mentioning here that Sir Humphrys was accused by his own fellow British officials to fabricate lies in regards to the Iraqi government's sentiments about the Assyrians.</p>
<p>The Mandate Commission gave its recommendations, stating that they are concerned about the Christians, and accordingly, average people were given the right to submit any petitions to the League of Nations, directly, in the future.</p>
<p>In partial compliance with requests of the petition, the Iraqi government set up a further land-finding committee. It discovered but little land both cultivable and available. In fact, they found malaria-ridden, swampy lands, and recommended expenditure on an irrigation scheme to produce more. Hundreds upon hundreds of Assyrians died with malaria in those lands.</p>
<p>The Council of the League of Nations accepted the recommendations and Iraq issued a declaration guaranteeing the protection of minorities on May 30, 1932.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Iraq was accepted into the League of Nations on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_3.html" title="October 3">October 3</a>, 1932.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Assyrian national question was taken to <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva.html" title="Geneva">Geneva</a> by the Assyrian Patriarch <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mar_Eshai_Shimun_XXIII_68dd.html" title="Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII">Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII</a> again when he addressed the Permanent Mandate Commission meeting and urged the council to fulfill its obligations toward the Assyrian Nation. The League yet again granted the Assyrians their rights of homogenous community in Iraq with a local autonomy.</p>
<p>Mar Eshai Shimum was quoted in the meeting:</p>

<p>After the establishment of the Kingdom of Iraq in 1932, an Assyrian uprising followed through the following year, refusing to sign a declaration of loyalty to <a href="../../../f/a/i/Faisal_I_of_Iraq_4179.html" title="Faisal I of Iraq">King Faisal</a> and agree not to thwart the scheme of the League of Nations for the settlement of the Assyrians, was deported by the order of the government on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_18.html" title="August 18">August 18</a>, 1933 and deprived of Iraqi nationality.</p>
<p>The failed uprising led to the massacre of 3,000 Assyrians throughout northern Iraq.</p>
<p>The largest massacre was in the village of <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumail.html" title="Sumail">Simele</a>. Eyewitnesses wrote numerous books about the events.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Levies, alarmed by this and the imminent withdrawal of British troops, decide upon a concentration of all Assyrians in the <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amadia.html" title="Amadia">Amadia</a> area for security. All Assyrian officers jointly presented a manifesto on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_16.html" title="July 16">July 16</a> to the commanding officer requesting discharge within 30 days. The other ranks also followed the lead of their officers. The British feared if this were allowed to happen they would loose all authority in Iraq. To buy time, they decided to allow discharge over a four month period. A British battalion was flown in from Egypt when discharges commenced. After negotiations with Assyrian leaders, the Levies withdrew their request and the British battalion was withdrawn. In all, 296 were discharged. No Iraqi was held responsible for the massacre. A large number of Assyrians began to flee Iraq and find safety in Syria, under French control at the time. The transport and machine gun Assyrian companies ceased to exist as separate units, both being divided between the two Assyrian battalions. Kirkuk was occupied by a platoon from the 2nd battalion to guard the wireless and other RAF stores.</p>
<p>Due to the events of 1933, Assyrians mark <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_7.html" title="August 7">August 7</a> as their martyrs day.</p>

<p>After the Simele massacre, the Council of the League of Nations was absolutely sure that the Assyrian issue was still an unsolved problem. The Assyrian Patriarch requested the League to form an Assyrian and Kurdish enclave in the north of the province of Mosul under a special administration. The Patriarch reminded the Council about the plan originally suggested by Lord Curzon, the British Foreign Minister, on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_17.html" title="December 17">December 17</a>, 1919.</p>
<p>In Iraq, <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashid_Ali_al-Kaylani_7445.html" title="Rashid Ali al-Kaylani">Rashid Ali al-Kaylani</a>, the Iraqi Prime Minister, announced that the Assyrians should find a new home outside Iraq and promised that the Iraqi government was willing to make very generous contributions to cover any expenses of such settlement. On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_13.html" title="October 13">October 13</a> 1933, the League of Nations appointed a committee of six of its members to look into this possibility.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_24.html" title="October 24">October 24</a>, the Assyrians submitted another petition by Yousuf Malik, an Assyrian Nationalist from Iraq who was exiled to <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanon.html" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a> and who moved between <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus.html" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beirut.html" title="Beirut">Beirut</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damascus.html" title="Damascus">Damascus</a> exposing what was going on inside Iraq and the British games. This petition gives the details of many cases of oppression against the Assyrians in Iraq, details on hardships from government officials, and the facts about the Simele massacre.</p>
<p>From October 1933 to June 1935, the committee of six looked into many options. They covered <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Guiana_1cac.html" title="British Guiana">British Guiana</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/g/Niger.html" title="Niger">Niger</a>, however, all failed. A further suggestion that the British <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Cross_7021.html" title="Red Cross">Red Cross</a> might send a relief party to Mosul was also objected to, apparently on the grounds that this would discourage the activities of the Iraqi Crescent, which has not carried out any relief work among the Assyrians. In September 1935, the plan of settling of some of the Assyrians in the Khabour and Ghab areas in Syria was approved. History shows that the plan was never followed up so it too has failed.</p>
<p>Things did not change for the Assyrians in Iraq until the outbreak of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, when the Iraqis revolted under Rashid Ali al-Kaylani who sided himself with <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Germany</a> and wanted to force the British out of Iraq completely. The faith of the British existence in Iraq hanged in the hands of the 1500 Assyrian Levies' ability to hold the British Air Force Base in <a href="../../../h/a/b/Habbaniya%2C_Iraq_ddd0.html" title="Habbaniya, Iraq">Habbaniya</a> against the rebels of over 60,000 Arab tribesmen and regular troops who surrounded the base.</p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser_2db4.html" title="Gamal Abdel Nasser">Gamal Abdel Nasser</a>, officers from the Nineteenth Brigade known as "Free Officers", under the leadership of Brigadier <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdul-Karim_Qassem_ccae.html" title="Abdul-Karim Qassem">Abdul-Karim Qassem</a> and Colonel <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdul_Salam_Arif_4a04.html" title="Abdul Salam Arif">Abdul Salam Arif</a>, overthrew the Hashimite monarchy on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_14.html" title="July 14">July 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a>.</p>
<p>The overthrow of Iraq's monarchy instilled new hope for the Assyrian cause. However, this hope was short-lived. Qassem was assassinated in February <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>, throwing Iraq into a period of political uncertainty. Out of the chaos emerged the <a href="../../../b/a/a/Baath_Party_abf8.html" title="Baath Party">Ba'ath Party</a> who promptly took control of Iraq's government.</p>
<p>The Ba'ath brought promise to Iraq and the Assyrian cause when the new government recognized the cultural rights of Syriac-speaking citizens (Assyrians, Chaldeans and members of the East Syrian Church) in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>. Syriac was to be the language used at all primary schools where the majority of pupils spoke that language in addition to Arabic. Syriac was also to be taught at intermediate and secondary schools where the majority of students spoke that language in addition to Arabic. Special programs in Syriac were to be broadcast on public radio and television and three Syriac-language magazines were to be published. An association of Syriac-speaking authors and writers was also established.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>Still, no autonomy was granted to the Assyrians. However, movements towards autonomy and independence remained active. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>, a new <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_flag.html" title="Assyrian flag">Assyrian flag</a> was introduced and adopted by the Assyrian Congress in <a href="../../../t/e/h/Tehran.html" title="Tehran">Tehran</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>, the Assyrian Provisional Government, headquartered from the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_diaspora.html" title="Assyrian diaspora">Assyrian diaspora</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, chartered a constitution for an autonomous Assyrian state. The Assyrians now had their goal set and would maintain it.</p>
<p>However, when <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam_Hussein_75a3.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> rose to power, things began to change for the Assyrians in Iraq. Assyrians were deprived of their cultural and national rights while at the same time the Ba'athist regime tried to co-opt their history. The 1972 proclamation was reversed and Hussein began a strict campaign of <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabization.html" title="Arabization">Arabization</a> on any non-Arabs in Iraq, including Assyrians as well as other groups such as Kurds, Iraqi Turkmen, and Armenians. During the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran-Iraq_War_b457.html" title="Iran-Iraq War">Iran-Iraq War</a>, many Assyrians were recruited to the armies of both sides. This resulted in Assyrians in Iraq killing Assyrians in Iran. It was estimated that 60,000 Assyrians were killed during the conflict.</p>
<p>When Hussein first assumed power, the Assyrian population in Iraq numbered 2 million to 2.5 million. Due to both persecution by his regime and subsequent emigration to <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordan.html" title="Jordan">Jordan</a>, <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a>, and <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanon.html" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>, that number began to decline drastically.</p>

<p>With the fall of Saddam Hussein and the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_invasion_of_Iraq_768c.html" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>, no reliable census figures exist on the Assyrians in Iraq (as they do not for Kurds or <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraqi_Turkmen_0331.html" title="Iraqi Turkmen">Iraqi Turkmen</a>), though the number of Assyrians is estimated to be approximately 800,000.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_Democratic_Movement_fadc.html" title="Assyrian Democratic Movement">Assyrian Democratic Movement</a> (or ADM) was one of the smaller political parties that emerged in the social chaos of the occupation. Its officials say that while members of the ADM also took part in the liberation of the key oil cities of Kirkuk and Mosul in the north, the Assyrians were not invited to join the steering committee that was charged with defining Iraq's future. The ethnic make-up of the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_Interim_Governing_Council_bc61.html" title="Iraq Interim Governing Council">Iraq Interim Governing Council</a> briefly (September 2003 - June 2004) guided Iraq after the invasion included a single Assyrian Christian, <a href="../../../y/o/u/Younadem_Kana_176e.html" title="Younadem Kana">Younadem Kana</a>, a leader of the Assyrian Democratic Movement and an opponent of Saddam Hussein since <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>.</p>
<p>Today, the Western media has a strong tendency to acknowledge only three major groups in Iraq: Sunni Arabs, Shi'a Arabs and Kurds. The <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraqi_Kurdistan_b48b.html" title="Iraqi Kurdistan">Kurdish Autonomous Region</a> has claimed that it has been instrumental in the renovation and support of Assyrian churches and schools.</p>

<p>The panel discussion entitled "Focus on Iraq" on August 30 featured Assyrian politicians and activist from Iraq and the U.S., which was held in Chicago.</p>
<p>Mr. Willis Fautre's (from <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_Rights_Without_Frontiers_c507.html" title="Human Rights Without Frontiers">Human Rights Without Frontiers</a>) model, two overlapping forms of federalism are envisioned. First, the nation would have separate administrative "regions", each with its own parliament; a form of territorial federalism. Each community (Assyrians, Turkman, Arabs, and Kurds) would also have their own parliament representing their communities throughout the country; a form of community federalism. The community parliament would have full autonomy in religion, culture, schools, agriculture, energy, and protection of monuments. The unity of the federal government would be guaranteed by a bicameral system with a House of Representatives elected directly by the people and a Senate appointed by the various communities. For legislation affecting linguistic, cultural, or religious rights, both houses of parliament would have to pass the bill. In addition, though, in the community-based Senate, a super-majority (e.g. 2/3) vote would be needed in addition to a simple majority of every represented community. In such a way, each community would enjoy virtual veto power in matters of language, culture, and religion.</p>
<p>The proposal for an Assyrian self-administered zone established in the environs of Mosul, extending to Dohuk in the north and Fesh Khabur to the northwest has gained increasing appeal among Assyrian activists, intellectuals, and political leaders. The current political challenges facing Assyrians in the newly developing Iraq include rising Islamic pressure, gross under representation of Assyrians, and a sometimes callous misrepresentation of Assyrians simply as a Christian minority without reference to the Assyrian political, cultural, and nationalist platform. As Mr. Jatou reflected, the increasing Islamic fervor as well as other challenges in Iraq necessitate the establishment of an administrative area for Assyrians and Yezidis.</p>

<p>The first of the many church bombings that were to come occurred on the morning of August 4, 2003, that left 19 worshippers dead.</p>
<p>As the attacks on Assyrians continue to escalate, with the 20th church bombed and the death toll of the Assyrians climbing in 2004, demands by Assyrian politicians for an autonomous safe haven reached at an all-time high. A meeting took place in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">British House of Commons</a> to discuss the subject.</p>
<p>A meeting was organized by the Labour MP <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Pound_8d8d.html" title="Stephen Pound">Stephen Pound</a>, in conjunction with the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_Democratic_Movement_fadc.html" title="Assyrian Democratic Movement">Assyrian Democratic Movement</a> and the Jubilee Campaign, a Christian human-rights group. Mr. Pound demands were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Support an autonomous administrative region as a safe haven</li>
<li>Support the infrastructure of the region</li>
<li>Oppose "the active and passive ethnic cleansing" of "the only indigenous people of Iraq"</li>
</ol>
<p>Mr Pound argued "the fate of the Chaldo-Assyrians in Iraq will define the socio-political structure of the Middle East."</p>
<p>The then <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_Iraq_2b26.html" title="Prime Minister of Iraq">Prime Minister of Iraq</a>, <a href="../../../i/y/a/Iyad_Allawi_7b43.html" title="Iyad Allawi">Iyad Allawi</a>, said he was considering the plan, but nothing resulted as he lost his position in the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraqi_legislative_election%2C_January_2005_77b5.html" title="Iraqi legislative election, January 2005">January 2005 elections</a>.</p>
<p>On November 30, 2005, Iraq's Foreign Minister, <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hoshiyar_Zebari_a36e.html" title="Hoshiyar Zebari">Hoshiyar Zebari</a>, supported the idea of an Assyrian administrative region by saying "They (Assyrians) are free to organize a province or regional government. It should not be just because we have Kurdistan, but should be organized around an area. If they can do it in three provinces or even one it should and can be done."<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the same weekend, a further five Assyrian churches were bombed in Iraq. By the end of 2004, an estimated 40,000 Assyrians and other Christians have fled Iraq since the beginning of the war.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>'s Labor Party member <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Bowen_bf56.html" title="Chris Bowen">Chris Bowen</a> spoke about the possibility of autonomy for the Assyrians numerous times in the Parliament during 2005.</p>
<p>On February 24, 2006, Minister of Human Rights in <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdistan.html" title="Kurdistan">Kurdistan</a>, Dr. Mohammad Ihsan, stated "We don't mind Iraqi Christians concentrating anywhere they wish, and establishing a new province for themselves in the Nineveh plain, and bringing together Iraqi Christians from all over the world and their return to their houses and towns."</p>
