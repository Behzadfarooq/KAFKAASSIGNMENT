<p>Yes... You are right it doesn't need to be written by a nationalist, I apologize. However, it should be written with much more care and accuracy. Do more research... The study on the genetics is misunderstood and misrepresented, and why cant we unify and call all our people Assyrian and our Language Assyrian... Not only will it strengthen us but it will also allow other people to have an easier understanding of who we are... That is why this page is a disgrace to me as an Assyrian. I want to be able to tell people to read about ASSYRIANS on wikipedia but I cant. We could be stubborn and change things back and forth but I dont have patience for that, I just hope you guys understand that this page needs alot more work. When written, it should be written for an audience who knows nothing about assyrians. Read it from that perspective and you will understand what I mean. God bless you brothers. Romil Benyamino</p>

<p>In what way are they "descendants of the ancient Akkadians"? Or maybe rather of the "Chaldeans", who "were originally an Aramaic-speaking nomadic tribe from the Arabian peninsula that ultimately conquered Babylon"? This article seems to be very strong on urban myths of ancient Mesopotamia, while it should focus on the <i>contemporary</i> people. The origin of the name of Ashur should be discussed at <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashur.html" title="Ashur">Ashur</a>. Alleged origins of the Chaldean dynasty should be discussed at <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaldean_dynasty.html" title="Chaldean dynasty">Chaldean dynasty</a>. And sweeping claims about the ancient history or origins of the modern Assyrian people should be better referenced than the odd link to some online article. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 11:54, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Chaldean, if you want to restore the offtopic material or unsourced claims I removed, you would do well to use the talkpage first. As for fanciful inclusion of Ashurbanipal and ancient Assyrian or Akkadian figures like Sargon, this would be just as silly as including <a href="../../../v/o/r/Vortigern.html" title="Vortigern">Vortigern</a> in <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_%28people%29.html" title="English (people)">English (people)</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/g/Image%7EEnglish-people.JPG_79a3.html" title="Image:English-people.JPG">Image:English-people.JPG</a> (shrug), sheer <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_mysticism.html" title="National mysticism">national mysticism</a>. Per the very first sentence, this article is about contemporary Syriac Christians. Ashurbanipal is not contemporary, not a Christian, and not a speaker of Syriac (Aramaic), and thus falls outside the scope here by not one but three (of three) counts. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 11:09, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>If YOU want to change the topic of this article COMPLETLY by disconnecting our roots, then I suggest you VOTE on it first before you dictate the page. This page is not about CHRISTIANS only, so Ashurbanipal does not have to be a Christian in order for him to be Assyrian. And YES Ashurbanipal did speak Aramaic, as during his rule the offical language of the empire was Aramaic. You need to check yourself before you make such dramatic changes. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaldean_d16d.html" title="User:Chaldean">Chaldean</a> 13:53, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>hm, <i>what</i>? There is a link to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_Empire_a07a.html" title="Assyrian Empire">Assyrian Empire</a> in the very first sentence, so I have no idea what you mean. This isn't the article about the Assyrian Empire. We can leave in Ashurbanipal if you absolutely insist. According to <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramaic.html#Ancient_Aramaic" title="Aramaic">Aramaic#Ancient_Aramaic</a>, Aramaic became widespread in Assyria from 700 BC. So while I don't see why this is relevant at all here, I'll agree that the last century of the Neo-Assyrian Empire may be included under Aramaic history. Just because Aramaic became widespread in the Empire, I don't think this proves that the <i>king</i>, personally, spoke the langauge. A lingua franca isn't an "official language", and as a matter of course, official documents at the time were still written in Assyrian, <i>not</i> in Aramaic. I won't object to Ashurbanipal if he is so dear to you, but I would be interested in a source stating that he spoke Aramaic. I <i>agree</i> that the Assyrians are the "bona fide" descendants of the people of the 7th century, pre-Achaemenid, Assyrian empire. Thus, the name "Assyrians" is certainly justified. It just so happens that they did <i>not</i> inherit the Assyrian language, which makes them the <i>linguistic</i> bona fide descendants of the Aramaeans. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 14:23, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Listen</b>, you can look at the archives and past discussion about this topic, we have fought over and over and have worked VERY hard to finally all of us to agree on the article. You can't just come in and start having it your way. If you so dearly are so passionate about this subject, then you should have joined us in the past year. For your information Assyrians started to speak Aramaic as early as 13th century BC, you have lost totaly credabilit, if you really want to get involved in this page then talk to the 2 mods (<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">User: Garzo</a>, <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">User:Khoikhoi</a>) that have been working with us on this page for so long for ANY kind of edits to this page. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaldean_d16d.html" title="User:Chaldean">Chaldean</a> 19:49, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>you are the passionate one here, dear. I merely removed a few bogus claims, that's all. The factual substance remains the same. But, fine, I'll justify my edits one at a time. Which ones do you object to in particular? I already admitted that Ashurbanipal can stay around for your edification, even if it's patently quaint to keep him. I am not sure why I am supposed to have lost your credibility. This is merely another article needing cleanup to me, while you seem to derive your very identity from some mystical Chaldean essence.

<p>Dab, the only thing bogus is your editing of this article. We've come to a comprimise on this article. KhoiKhoi, Chaldean, Garzo, and several others agreed on this before we finally settled on the way it is now. Look up the Assyrian Kings list yourself and you'll see that Assyrian tablets referred to him as Sargon the Assyrian and Aramean scribes as stated in the article were depicted alongside their Akkadian brethern. Akkadian was merely the language of Government as Elamite was for the Achaemenid Dynasty even though the Eastern part of the empire was predominantly Persian and the Western portion was Aramaic.<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESargonious_9f62.html" title="User:Sargonious">סרגון יוחנא</a></p>

I'm just looking at Christoph Baumer's new book <i>The Church of the East</i>, and comparing it to the older standard work by Baum. I don't want to get into arguments about this, but it is true that the general academic community does not accept a lot of the claims of the Assyrians.

<dd>I think you read more into that than was there — I for one have no such prejudices about Iraqis. I'm just saying that this stuff is out there, and it's the work of academics. You are right to note that the issues of ethnicity in the Middle East are frought with tricky judgment calls. Therefore, it is in the interest of neutrality that an editor who wishes to express that many resonable people have serious problems with the concept of a contemporary, defined Assyrian ethnicity. The article is not to judge either way, but present the facts. One fact is that the majority of academics who have stated an opinion reckon that modern Assyrians are not the continuation of ancient Assyrians. Whether you like it or not, that's what's out there — I've mentioned a few books and web-based reviews that demonstrate this. — <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 23:01, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Prove that Anglo-Saxons or Germanic peoples are not descended from the snake in the Garden of Eden. First of all disprove the story existed then try to prove that through some genetic mutation or evil miracle the snake didn't spawn evil humans. Sound rediculous I know but I could compose a whole book of nonsense and come up with all sorts of "credible" refrences and pass that off as scholarly work.<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESargonious_9f62.html" title="User:Sargonious">סרגון יוחנא</a> 16:08, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not only do I believe in the credibility of this article but I also claim: Ashur is the true God in a pantheistic sense ("the sum of all the gods [gods being a metaphor for the inexplicable]"), and the basis of Monotheistic religion that Judaism, Christianity, and Islam were based on, I believe that The Bible, Kuran, and Zoroastrian thought to be derived from the Assyrian Religion. The symbol of Zoroastrianism is almost identical to that of the God Ashur. I also believe that Jesus, Buddha, Vishnu, Shiva, Brahman and any other so-called "divine" entity to be "divine incarnations" [very wise people] of the one God [existance]. I believe he may have revealed himself differently to other peoples. I don't hold the concept of God to be that of a living one such as an old man living on a cloud ready to strike sinners with lightning. I believe religion was put on Earth by "God" [natual human thought] purposely. Reasons being: to test people's understanding, test their loyalty to God [humanity], and to keep things dynamic [conflict]. So far everyone's failed to an extent and succeeded to an extent. People killing each other in the name of God is the greatest failure and the greatest success is that we're still here and haven't anniahalated each other [survival]. I am a direct continuation of the royal line of Sargon of Akkad [structured civilization]. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESargonious_9f62.html" title="User:Sargonious">סרגון יוחנא</a> 16:17, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not just through yet. What about Arabized Muslims? Most of them are not ethnically Arab yet may claim to be Arabs especially the Egyptians. Same goes for the Turks. Most of them may not even have a shread of Arab or Turk blood yet may claim descent from the groups? Why not dispute their claim to ethnicity or continuation of bloodline? The same goes for any assimilated ethnic group. Just because a race was conquered doesn't mean it was completely eliminated off the face of the Earth. What about Native Americans? They still exist after their Genocide. What about the Brittons that the Anglo-Saxons slaughtered? What about countless other groups in history? When it comes to history no matter how well-documented it was it isn't absolute fact so basically what you "non-believers" are doing is racist and ethnocentric in trying to dictate our history through your means. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESargonious_9f62.html" title="User:Sargonious">סרגון יוחנא</a> 18:25, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If Coptic Christians are arabs then why aren't Assyrian Christians considered arab too? This page should redicect to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Arabs_f787.html" title="Christian Arabs">Christian Arabs</a> 141.217.128.177 23:16, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Very funny, Copts don't consider themselves Arab. Ask Father Zachariah. He'll laugh at you. There's a fatwa on his head because he teaches the dark side of the Quran... the real side.</dd>

Hello friends; This article sounds terrible, filled with ultra nationalist claims with no academic or scientific base. I'm happy that before me Dab and Gareth Hughes have criticized its factual accuracy. By a quick searching on internet I found these; I hope it helps.</p>

<dd>Your claim is false. This article has many credible sources unlike the two above you listed. Those are completely biased especially aramnahraim.org... That's a group in the diaspora trying to distance itself from Assyrian nationalism.<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESargonious_9f62.html" title="User:Sargonious">סרגון יוחנא</a> 13:51, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually the Aramnahrin's article (with the expection of its intro) is the uncensoredversion of the first source, the Friesian.com, before they were insulted by Assyrianist ultra nationalist. Anyway I did not see any academic evidence for the current version of the article (Assyrian people). For your information websites like Aina.org, Christians of Iraq, Zindamagazine etc.. are all totally biased with an extreme assyrianist ultra nationalist point of view. These follow a self-referenced pseudo-scientific policy, and label all the Aramaic speaking groups of middle east as Assyrian; a claim which heavily distorts history. I don't think that anything which does not agree with Assyrianism or Assyrian ultra nationalism is necessarily wrong. We can have both the view of mainstream academia and of Assyrian nationalists themselves, in the article, in two separate sections.</dd>
<dd>Thank you.</dd>

<dd>Because they're interested in Assyrian matters they're nationalists? Or are you refuting them solely on the grounds that they have Assyrian names? Iran Zamin Bozorg (great)... Are you a meat puppet of Dab? You seem to have sprung up overnight refuting the Assyrian article of all articles in responce and almost in defense of Dab's claims. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESargonious_9f62.html" title="User:Sargonious">סרגון יוחנא</a> 20:50, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
