<li>Neutral Evaluation (stating an opinion)</li>
<li>Advocacy in RfArs and RfCs (speaking on behalf of a user)</li>

<li>Tasks 1 and 2 above will require consent from all parties.</li>
<li>Applications will be made on the page where they are made now, and should be made using a standard template.</li>
</ul>
<pre>
==Example Application==
===Requested service===
===Involved parties====
===Brief description of circumstances (with word limit)===
===Evidence of all parties' consent (if applicable)===
</pre>
<ul>
<li>If an application has not been accepted within 72 hours, it will be rejected. The parties can reapply no earlier than one week from date of rejection.</li>
<li>Acceptance by an advocate will be done by notification on all parties talk pages.</li>
<li>An advocate may not withdraw from a case that he/she has accepted except in the following circumstances:
<ul>
<li>The advocate has given seven day's notice of his intention to withdraw to all parties and on the discussion page of the requests page.</li>
<li>Three days before the advocate actually withdraws, the original request must be re-entered on to the requests page and will remain there for the full 72 hours or until another advocate accepts the case.</li>
<li>The applicants have not relied on the advocate's services to such an extent that it would be unfair for him/her to withdraw his/her services.
<ul>
<li>"Services" includes future services which the advocate has agreed to supply by accepting the case.</li>
<li>It is presumed that the applicants have not relied on the advocate's services to the said extent. This presumption is reversed once evidence to the contrary is produced.</li>

<li><b>Support</b> this will revitalize the AMA and would no longer prohibit members from providing commonly requested services (mediation, opinion work). I'm totally on board and don't see why, fis ome members want to perfrom certain services (without hacing to join anotehr group that is not getting the same requests as we are here), why they should be prohibited from doing so. So what if AMA stands for advocates <b>it's just a name!</b> and "advocate" can be interpreted to encompass mediation/opinion work. Now's not the time to be opposed tochange.

<li><b>Support</b> Regrettably, up to this point I haven't been active in the group.

<li><b>Support</b> - I joined the AMA rather excitedly but have done little for lack of understanding exactly what, when and how I should be doing things.

<li>What I don't like very much is make the AMA a place for mediation too, but to oppose to the whole proposal only because of that is not fair. --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> 13:45, 10 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I (and Gator) added mediations to the proposal because that is what most of the requests are asking for (eg "this user's being rude, have a word with him"). It is very rare to find a request for advocacy. Izehar 15:19, 10 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is a proper place to go for that. We are called the <b>Association of Members' Advocates</b>. <i>Advocates</i> carries a connotation that is pretty hard to miss. If people ask for something that is not in our business to provide, so much the better — we can turn the case over to MedCom or MedCabal and let them handle it.

<dd>Oops. I meant to give a reason! I feel it would make the organization overly bureaucratic, especially the parts where it lets people be kicked out of AMA. I also especially don't like the idea of automatically rejecting cases after 72 hours, though I'd like to not see them sit longer than that, to be honest. I do like the tasks part, but I don't think we should provide mediation; Wikipedia already has two mediation groups, one informal, and anyone can provide informal mediation. --<a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhroziac_d326.html" title="User:Phroziac">Phroziac</a> <sub>.</sub> <small>o</small> º <sup>O (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhroziac_3a1f.html" title="User talk:Phroziac">♥♥♥♥ chocolate!</a>)</sup> 22:50, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you don't want to mediate, then don't; withdrawal of membership is a safeguard to quality and I think that the chances of that happening without a good reason are extremely unlikely, and the 72 hours limit is intended to prevent a backlog. Anyway, the applicants are allowed to resubmit their application a week later. Izehar 22:56, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have been absent for some time, despite my earlier participation in reform processes, and would not vote save that my opinion was sought via a message on my talk page: thus I cast a ballot. I find the proposals not only too ambitious and broad-based but I also feel that they step on the toes of other organizations. To my mind we have a mediation crew here to mediate — albeit one even less effective than we are — and we have arbitrators to give opinions on application of Wikipedian policies. They idea that we might fulfill either of these roles, mediative or advisory, is offensive to those organizations.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, when we have such trouble coordinating ourselves now, how are we to assign ourselves more responsibility? And <i>who</i> are we to do so? The comments below, by an Arbitrator no less, should capture the need for increased emphasis on training and standards rather than on reckless self-aggrandizement. I fear this is an effort, though well-meaning, fuelled more by dreams than capability.</dd>
<dd>I would also like further input from our Coordinator on his thoughts about this.</dd>

<dd>Far, far too formalized and rigid. Rejection of request after 3 days is a joke considering how badly the current requests page tends to be neglected. Doesn't mention at all the simple task of helping others through the DR process. This isn't limited to representation. Being well-versed in the DR process and being able to show others the way through it is what I mean. A lot of requests need only this. Removes ability of members to work in a Wikian, self-directed way and instead injects decisions of the entire AMA into their activity or continued membership. Increases the duties of AMA, mainly including the need to vote on so many procedural issues. Don't forget, some of us like to edit articles too from time to time. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<dd>Finally, let me say that I take exception to this vote being put to the group with a closing time and an implication that action will be taken then. There was no provision for this when the group was formed. Any changes to the group should be done by consensus and I believe there were many long time members who stated their issues with this proposal so to put it to a vote, in my mind, is trying to bypass consensus building.</dd>
<dd>Now, members are being told if they don't want to mediate they don't have to or they should leave? This group has <b>never</b> had a proviso regarding mediation and I frankly don't understand why some are insisting to push this through, it's like me barging my way into your living room and telling you I don't like your TV and you should go buy a new one. Since many other members have introduced their concerns I haven't seen a single change to this proposal and to me, that doesn't show that you worked very hard on it. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 01:15, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Oppose</b> I absolutely oppose allowing people who have never advocated having any say. I also oppose removing members who do things. Non-active members could be removed, I guess, but who cares? I do like the fact that you guys want to do <i>something</i> (how about advocating?), and I agree some organisation needs to occur. Rather than a commitee, we need to delegate tasks. For example, I'd be willing to contact members on their talk pages in regards to work that needs done. Someone should have the job of being the ambassador to the other committees (prob our co-ordinator). Someone else should be given the job of maintaining our AMA pages, someone else the job of mentoring new advocates, and so forth. We also need to give recognition to members who have successfully completed cases. Branching into mediation or other things is fine, but lets do that AFTER our requests for assistance page is empty, and we've run out of things to do, eh? <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 08:12, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Arbitrators shouldn't be allowed in AMA except as "on hiatus" members not only because of potential bias, but because until there's some reform of the system, they'll be too damn busy to be effective. Don't even pose the option, it'll be a nuisance.</li>
<li>Change "should" to "cannot", unless they want to do it independently. It'll give the AMA far more credibility.</li>
<li>Ditch <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_past_the_post.html" title="First past the post">first past the post</a> thinking, it doesn't jibe with Wikipedia. Instead, make a clear level for consensus, i'll create a simple formula after my break if you'd like.</li>
<li>Make an addendum regarding if there are no advocates available after 72 hours.

<dd>This is to avoid conflict of interest. If an arbitrator supports one side of a dispute and then that case is brought to arbitration then than arbitrator would have to rescue. Rescuing, means that the ArbCom has less expertese and diversity of opinion - we want to avoid that. Izehar 22:50, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Comment</span></h3>
<p>As an Arbitrator, I obviously have an interest in the possibility that the AMA might someday be of some use. Unfortunately, the AMA has a very poor reputation -- I have heard my fellow Arbitrators comment many times that "No AMA advocate has ever been in any way helpful on any case ever", and in the cases I've been personally involved in which had an AMA advocate, the advocate has been at best worthless and at worst obstructionary and irritating. (There have been helpful advocates, but none of them were AMA members.)</p>
<p>So, with that background out of the way, I look forward to a revitalization of the AMA, converting it into a useful entity that will prove helpful in the dispute resolution process. Unfortunately, I think the "instruction creep" that is laid out in the above proposals will do nothing to further that. Rather, I think you people need to think about what makes an effective advocate in the Wikipedia community, and try to select members who have those characteristics. Unfortunately, I don't see any evidence that you've figured out what those characteristics are (don't worry, neither have I). But I think writing a bunch of procedural folderol for elections and dismissals and such not is not the right first step toward that. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 23:21, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not aware of anyone ever complaining about AMA advocates being "obstructionary and irritating". If this is so, then perhaps this organization should be disbanded. It was never meant to be a policing organization or yet another arm of the Wikipedia bureaucracy. It was meant to be a place were people who were anti-bureacracy could help other individuals, not become self styled "Wikipedia lawyers-in-waiting". As the first elected coordinator I tried to get people interesting in having conferences and discussion the work of an advocate, but this does not seem to interest people who are interested in having their names listed as being members of a group but who don't really want to work at improving the group. I also agree with you Kelly, the way to improve it is not to have yet another reorganization. Reminds me of what they say about Canadians when they die and go to heaven (and I can say this because I am a Canadian), they organize a conference. Never really want to do anything, just want to discuss it. I think this organization should be disbanded, if people want to start yet another group, fine, but don't add it to the mantle of a disfunctional group, just start your own. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">Alex756</a> 00:15, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was also a bit taken aback by Kelly's comment and am wondering which ArbCom members she talked to! I received several private messages from ArbCom members during my cases that I was doing a very good job. I think there is an important component of assisting on Arb cases for those who are not experienced in them, I think this task of "lawyers-in-waiting" was taken on as a response to the District Attorney's Office which went on to become <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssociation_of_Member_Investigations_15dc.html" title="Wikipedia:Association of Member Investigations">The Association of Member Investigations</a>. I think Alex is right though and we need to get back to our roots and what this group is supposed to be about, not take on additional tasks when we already have issues. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 01:33, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wgfinley, your service as an advocate before the ArbCom was before my tenure on the Committee, and it may not have been noticed that you were an AMA member by the Committee at the time. It has also occured to me that one or more of the effective advocates may have actually been members of the AMA, but they <i>never presented themselves as such</i>. On the other hand, whenever we (the ArbCom) see someone pop up in an RfAr as "so-and-so's Advocate from the AMA" we all groan, knowing that what will come next is a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, or a redundant cross-filing, or some other procedural annoyance that will ultimately come to nothing but which will force us to deal with extra noise that adds nothing to the Arbitration process.</dd>

<dd>A useful advocate, from the ArbCom's perspective (or at least my perspective, as a member of the ArbCom), will refrain from "wikilawyering", and will instead present a consistent and coherent explication of the evidence that demonstrates that his client should not be censured, or that his client's nemesis should be censured, or both. Advocates should also assist in the Arbitration process by proposing <b>reasonable</b> principles, findings of fact, remedies, and enforcement measures on the workshop page of the arbitration case. Special attention should be given to writing principles which reflect our core values and which can stand universally as precedent; findings of fact should be specific to the case, be supported by evidence (generally, edit diffs), and should only be offered to the extent that they are required to justify a remedy or enforcement. Advocates should avoid arguing directly with the other parties of the case (at least on the Arbitration page) as that just tends to make the arbitration pages longer and more fractious. Advocates are strongly encouraged to control their clients and to encourage them to refrain from posting in the arbitration itself. (In the most recent case I dealt with that involved an advocate, the party made far more posts to the arbitration pages than the advocate did. I was sorely tempted at the end of that case to recommend a remedy forbidding that advocate from representing any person before the Arbitration Committee for a period of one year.)</dd>

<dd>I can't speak for what sort of representation would be helpful to the Mediation Committee or the Mediation Cabal. It would behoove this organization to find out what these other bodies in the dispute resolution process would find most helpful from an advocate representing someone involved in their processes, and seek to develop methods to help deliver those services to the betterment of the community, and thereby the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 04:38, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The purpose of this proposal is to stop the group being dysfunctional by laying down:</p>
<ul>
<li>What we do;</li>
<li>How we do it;</li>
<li>How our services may be obtained;</li>
<li>How we work; and</li>
<li>To establish a few membership rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>IMO a bit of <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_tape.html" title="Red tape">red tape</a> is necessary here. If one were to check the <a href="../../../a/m/a/Wikipedia%7EAMA_Requests_for_Assistance_1619.html" title="Wikipedia:AMA Requests for Assistance">requests page</a> it would become abundantly clear that the people who need our services have no idea what this association is and the fact that no advocates respond indicates that most advocates, on joining, had no idea what would be expected of them. Now, assuming this passes, everyone will know what we do, how we do it etc. Most requests are complaints of abusive behaviour with newbie expectations of immediate bans - advocates cannot help with that kind of thing. All we can do is help resolve disputes. This proposal emerged after lengthy discussions and detailed examination of each clause, in an attempt to revive this association. We had become stuck in a rut and very few, if any, members actually accepted any requests. If anyone can think of a better way than the above proposal, let's hear it. This is the best I (and a few other members) can think of. Izehar 00:44, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I served for some months with the Mediation Cabal before becoming an Arbitrator. MedCab provides several of the same services that you're proposing to provide, without the organizational structure. The problem, as I see it, with having a lot of organizational structure is that you get status-seekers joining for the sake of being a member, without any committment to the function of the organization. The MedCab avoids this largely by having no membership requirements, and thus there is no status to gain by joining.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you want my opinion, you should scrap all membership rules, allow open membership, and concentrate on providing resources for members and the community. The way you avoid the problem with people asking for things they can't have is to have clear resources that explain to people what they can have. The reason you have members who don't respond to requests is that many of them joined for status, rather than to help, or because they don't know how to help; you eliminate the first by taking away the status and the second by teaching them how to help (note: teach, not tell; there's a difference). But that's just my opinion.</dd>

<dd>I'd really like it if an effective organization of advocates -- one that the ArbCom can rely on -- were available, for those cases where one party or the other really does need an advocate (an unfortunately common occurrence).

<dd>No, Sam, I wasn't even thinking of you. I won't name names, but I will state that I had already formed a solid impression of the AMA's "uselessness" (as a fellow Arbitrator described it once) even before the Silverback case was filed. But nice job of shooting the messenger, there. And exactly the sort of thing that a good advocate should avoid doing, as it is never wise to antagonize the decisionmaker by attacking them, as you did me in the Silverback case then and as you are doing right now. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 01:37, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Be that as it may, Sam, the advice is more than valid. I have found in my experience that rare is the occasion that an arbitrator will recuse themselves, and then it is almost always at the very beginning of the process notwithstanding a request. I have also found that so-called "wiki-lawyering" is indeed viewed very dimly by the ArbCom — perhaps my skill is less than yours, but <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Denning%2C_Baron_Denning_3516.html" title="Alfred Denning, Baron Denning">Lord Dennings</a> these people are not. It may indeed be my opinion that a little more concern for process and jurisdiction would serve the ArbCom well; but that is not theirs. We serve our clients best by working under the structure the Committee sets up for us, not by trying to stick it to them — that's usually what turns minor issues into ridiculous dog-and-pony shows in the first place. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 20:32, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

OK. I'll freely admit I am helping <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Gatti_fee8.html" title="User:Benjamin Gatti">Ben Gatti</a> out on this case and I admit that as it is my first case that I'm not doing brilliant. However, since I am working in ADDITION to Ben no harm has came to his case. However, I would strongly disagree with the assertion of anything I've done as being "baseless" or "litigitious". I feel that this notion was started when I merely asked for more time to look into the case.</p>
<p>And for the record I didn't advise the "US Supreme Court move" and the request for was before I took on the case.</p>
<p>As far as my handling of the case goes, well it is simple. Ben is reasonably new to Wikipedia with strong views on certain topics. He read the "be bold" argument and was so. However, he merely needs to tone down his views and remember to maintain a NPOV. However, the blame for this matter coming to the ArbCom doesn't lie solely with Benjamin Gatti, it lies substantially with the complainants who seem keen to ignore the underlying issue. Additionally, any problems ben has caused could easily be solved with admonishment and mentorship. The absurd 1 year ban being proposed by the complainants in the case is barbaric and unjust. --- <i>Responses to <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChazz88_a26a.html" title="User talk:Chazz88">Chazz's talk page</a>.</i> Signed by <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChazz88_5a50.html" title="User:Chazz88">Chazz</a> @ 23:20, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I didn't mean to make this a discussion of that case, and though many of things you say are wrong on their face, there's no sense in responding here. My point is that perhaps it would make sense to have some kind of selection process. Wikilawyering in itself shows an inherent wrong priority; you should never have to appeal to technicality of policy rather than the encyclopedia itself (which is wikilawyering), because even as a mediator or an advocate I expect the encyclopedia to always be your top priority. If that is the case, then obstruction per wikilawyering is counterproductive. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 01:04, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For my part, I know from hard experience never to count an advocate's behavior to themselves in the context of a case, but to look first at the client.

<p>I object to Kelly Martin's comments. We all have our opinions about whether or not the justice process at WP should be a kangaroo court, as it is today, or should be something which at minimum respects basic principles such as a <a href="../../../r/u/l/Rule_of_law.html" title="Rule of law">rule of law</a> or <a href="../../../n/u/l/Nulla_poena_sine_lege.html" title="Nulla poena sine lege">no crime, no punishment</a>. If bringing up basic principles of simple justice is seen as "obstructionist" by the ArbCom, then that speaks volumes about the problems of arbitration at WP. And as far as I know, AMA stands for Association of Member's Advocates, not Association of ArbCom Assistants. (And if that is what the current proposal is aimed at bringing about, it is deplorable.) - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<dd>You can object to them all you like, but your objections will not change the nature of the Arbitration Committee. The ArbCom is not a court of law, and its purpose is not to dispense justice. The ArbCom's purpose is to clear the deck of troublemakers so that the rest of us can get on with writing an encyclopedia. If your client is before ArbCom, it's because s/he has been involved in a disruption which is interfering with writing the encyclopedia. Your task should be to explain how your client is not at fault for the disruption (or that there was no disruption, but that's pretty unlikely to be the case or the case would have been rejected in the first place), or else to admit blame for the disruption and state how your client will alter his or her behavior to avoid future disruption. If your argument is instead based on externally-derived "principles of simple justice" without any thought as to how those principles relate to writing an encyclopedia, then you're wikilawyering, an act which is in itself disruption, and by so doing actually make whatever situation your client is in even worse. If you see your role as an advocate to "get the best possible result for your client", then it behooves you to not do things that will annoy the people who decide what result your client gets -- whether you agree with them or not -- and it certainly behooves you not to create further disruptions for the sake of standing on a irrelevant point of principle. (In fact, we have a policy prohibiting exactly that.) <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 19:37, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps it would also behoove Mrs. Martin to step lightly lest she put herself on the wrong side of justice, eh? I said before that it is best to do what is possible not to ruffle the committee's feathers and endanger clients — that is so. However that certainly <i>does not</i> mean bending over backwards to appease the ArbCom or any single arbitrator. The idea that <i>any</i> point of principle is "irrelevant", or that a "principle of simple justice" can be construed as "disruptive", is not only farcical but morally reprehensible. The reason people <i>take</i> cases to the ArbCom is to seek justice, and to gain a remedy for wrongs — not, I should hope, in order to cull people they don't like from the encyclopedia. If that is the attitude amongst the majority of the Committee then perhaps there is indeed a cancer of which some speak.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A note re. proposed branching into mediation</span></h2>
<p>Dear AMA Members: I've been maintaining the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_9d17.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal">Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal</a> for some months now, after having taken it over from <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">User:Kim Bruning</a>, and indeed, recently the Mediation Cabal has become fully functional and effective in performing informal mediation. Our primary purpose is to provide mediation assistance where it is requested, not "accepting" or "rejecting" requests but rather providing help where requested. We don't actually have any formal process, nor do we have any kind of fixed mandate, which means our mediators have quite a free rein to do what they think is best for those asking for help from us.</p>
<p>Really, our primary role here has been to try to staunch issues before they get to a point where they require official intervention, and provide a friendly hand to assist in cases where required. I invite members of the AMA to take a look at this initiative; you will notice that we are indeed alive and well, as Kelly points out, and handling cases. Personally I think we should avoid duplicating each other's efforts; the Mediation Cabal can't really provide the services of an advocate, and likewise the role of an advocate is not the same as an informal mediator. We are so informal that we don't even have a selection or joining process for prospective mediators - people just help out.</p>
<p>Thus, I respectfully recommend that the AMA not branch into informal mediation, simply because the Mediation Cabal and the AMA will otherwise end up duplicating each other's work rather than focusing on our individual areas of expertise. Indeed, the provision of advocates is I believe absolutely essential to the course of dispute resolution, and I feel that the AMA would do far better to allocate their resources towards building a proper system for the request of user advocates and implementing that system to make advocates available to all members. I believe that many disputes, even some being actively mediated, would greatly benefit from advocates being readily available to provide advice and support to users involved in active disputes. It is always best, I feel, for Wikipedia initiatives to concentrate specifically on a single focus - especially with dispute resolution - and that is what I have done my best to maintain on the Mediation Cabal. I thus highly recommend that the AMA do likewise.</p>
<p>If there is any way I can assist the AMA further, please do not hesistate to ask.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">An Alternative Proposal</span></h2>
<p>Due to the contentious nature of the proposal underway now, and the serious questions that have been raised about this organization's future operation, I propose the following:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>An election should be held within the next two weeks to elect a Coordinator, a Deputy Coordinator for Operations (i.e. clearing out the cases on our backlog) and a Deputy Coordinator for Policy, per the original proposal. The election for each should proceed using the simplest procedure possible. The term should be minimal, as these positions would be interim until we sort ourselves out. Suffrage, for members, is universal.</li>
<li>All proposals as to the nature of the AMA's duties and the way they are conducted are placed on hold pending this election.</li>
<li>Following the election, a policy review should be conducted by the DCP, engaging the participation of <i>all advocates who have been involved in at least one case.</i> This should be taken inclusively — if you helped someone solve a dispute pre-mediation, or in mediation, or in arbitration, or solved your <i>own</i> dispute, then you are qualified.</li>
<li>Following the election, an operational review should be conducted by the DCO, to discuss how AMA advocates act, styles of advocacy, what works, what doesn't, what helps those needing advocacy and what doesn't, etc. Same guidelines as above. Both reviews are under the Coordinator's direction and</li>
<li>Meetings or discussions of some sort should be held either monthly or semi-monthly from here out, in which all members can attend, discuss business, raise issues, etc.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thoughts? I am particularly interested in what Gator and Izehar might have to say, as they seem to be the main force behind the main proposal to which this, hopefully, might be an acceptable halfway point. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 19:27, 11 January 2006 (UTC) || fixed numbering — <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanManka_997b.html" title="User:IanManka">Ian Manka</a> <sup><a href="../../../i/a/n/User_talk%7EIanManka_481c.html" title="User talk:IanManka">Questions?

<p>My thought is that we need to deal with one thing at a time. Let's get through the first propsal first and <b>then</b> we can deal with this idea if its not moot. The fact is that a majority of voters are in favor of our plan. If our plan was being overwhelmingly defeated that'd be oe thign, but the voters, so far, are at least split over the issue (more in favor of ours position), so let's that process proceed to its finish first. That's my thought on this.</p>
<p>I'm glad to see other propsal being offered though and there is interest in actually doing something to revitalize the project by people otehr than myself and Izehar. Ideas being shot down with no coutner offers was getting old, so thanks.Gator (talk) 21:57, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Considering that an AMA coordinator election has long since been overdue, I propose that the requirement of participating in such an election be membership prior to the date the election should have been held. This is a bit of a "do-over", I suppose, but it will repair AMA's lapses in a way that best matches the way they should have happened. After that point, one elections are back on track, future elections would hold such a bar in relation to the dates they are scheduled to be held. I think that a lot of people who have recently joined and haven't really gotten involved with what currently are the AMA's functions need to consider whether they really understand what the AMA is or was when they joined.</dd>
<dd>I would avoid overly formal positions in addition to coordinator. IMO positions such as your DCP and DCO could be volunteer positions done with approval of the coordinator or the AMA body. And their role should be as facilitators to specific internal functions, namely the reviews.
<dl>
<dd>AMA holds the distinction of having been the first WP organization to hold elections.

<dd>While I find "your" proposal admirable, Gator, the fact that there is so much disagreement, and the fact that there is such a divide between the "old guard", as it were, and some of our newer members, makes it rather untenable. Plus your proposal makes demands of the organization that our outside the boundaries of its mission. That being said, I feel that you're right to take steps to help revitalize the AMA, and this proposal is not an effort to belittle that — indeed, I mean to salute it by making efforts at reform a permanent and integral part of the organization.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This proposal, unlike yours, is intended merely as a stopgap while we all sit down and review what it is exactly we want the organization to do. It is a middle of the road idea that I feel would be acceptable to the greatest number of us and would continue with our former processes while taking steps to bring them around to something more workable. That is what I have in mind. It's not about "getting through" anything; the point of this proposal is to substitute the first one, not succeed it. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 00:09, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I appreciate the sentiment Wally but I don't think we need a layer of bureaucracy in this group, I don't see it helping anything. The fact of the matter is anyone could step up and help deal with issues on the requests page, etc, and yet I've been the only one to go through and reorganize, move, archive things for more than a year. These are simple tasks that anyone could help with.</p>
<p>Finally, I don't want to come off has hostile or nitpicking but the truth of the matter is the majority of those who have voted to this point do not support the proposal as it currently stands, 6 oppose it and 5 are neutral stating their reservations. This is why I don't think we needed a vote on this and why I think it's a bad idea, there are issues with the proposal that were raised, nothing was changed in it and it was put forward anyway. Changes to this group should be by consensus as I stated in my vote. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 02:36, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Counting neutal votes as oppose votes in unfair. If they were opposed tot he measure they would ahve voted that way and igf they were for it thy would have voted that way. They voted neutral for a reason and for their vote to be counted in any other way is unfair. It's 9-9 right now. Not being defeated overwhelmingly and should nto be stopped before the deadline unless hat changes (and it might). I notice that those whoa re in favor of suspending the vote and looking tot he alternative propsal also happen to have voted oppose. Finish one thing first and then I will gladly support the alternative proposal. I'd love to hear what Izehar has to say, but at this point, I am not willing to withdraw the motion that is on the table as it were. Let's stay organized andf fair and just finish voting.Gator (talk) 13:23, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We shouldn't be voting on anything right now except for a new coordinator, which is way overdue. You're taking advantage of a power vacuum. It stinks.

<dd>This proposal is much better than the first one: it's simplier and it is easy to get it working. I like the idea of first <b>clearly</b> organize the AMA with a new election and then, discuss the AMA policy. Please, in no country the laws are made whilr there isn't a legislative branche (called it Congress, Legislature, <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bundestag.html" title="Bundestag">Bundestag</a>, Parliament or King!). Let's set a "schedule":
<ol>
<li>Order ourselves by electing a new Coordination and both Deputies.</li>
<li>Let the DCP and the Coordinator work into a policy proposal.</li>
<li>Discuss and vote on the DCP and Coordinator's proposed policy. If this proposal is not approved, the current policy stays as it is.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>The main idea is that we focus on advocating rather than in discussing legislation... It's better that only these two DCP and Coord create a proposal by their own and discuss it between them before it's "launched" to public discussion. --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> 17:28, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I will not render my personal opinion on the new proposal. I just think that the proposal that was <b>first</b> put forth needs to be addressed '<b>first</b> before moving on to alternatives when a good number of people are in favor of. I don't want ot be accussed of throwing votes away when the figures are so evenly split. Let's just finish this process first and then move on. I agree 9-9 or 9-7 is not conensus so unless something amazing happesn, you will get to have your alternative put forth, so just be patient, there's no hurry. And if the consensus says yes to ur propsal, then that's the consensus. That's my opinion.Gator (talk) 18:17, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">As it stands</span></h3>
<p>Neigel has proposed to go through with just part 1 of the above, amended to elect just the Coordinator. I agree with that, and suggest that suffrage be extended to anyone eligible to vote in the first poll. I suggest it be an acting position with a limited term, ex. 1 month, during which time the Coordinator can work <b>with</b> the member body to develop a simple mission statement and structure (possibly, but not necessarily, using or including parts of proposals heretofore put) so we can get ourselves moving again. The Coordinator could also come up with a standard of membership (or perhaps certification?) to use in the future, and we could agree to election procedures — with the advice and consent of all of us in discussion being a basic element.</p>
<p>Anyone object to going forward on that, and that alone? <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 17:47, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Let's move forth!</span></h2>
<p>I'm tired from all this discussions that lead into nowhere. Let's move forth! There is something that anyone here agrees: we need a new Coordinator. Then, let's vote a new one <b>now</b>. So, any suspicions of taking advantages of this power vacuum will end. We need someone that directs this discussio into some place.</p>
<p>I'm avaliable to arbitrate the election, since I won't candidate and I'm not interested in being AMA Coordinator. Obviously, if you want me to monitor the election process, I won't be able to vote, but I don't care.</p>
<p><b>Election procedure</b>: Anyone can nominate someone (except me) or himself and users vote supporting (not opposing, so this is simplier and faster) the candidate (called <a href="../../../a/p/p/Approval_vote.html" title="Approval vote">approval vote</a>). The new coordinator will be the user having a the absolute majority (50% + 1) of the votes. If this doesn't happen, then the two most voted candidates should go into a <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballotage.html" title="Ballotage">ballotage</a> where the user with most votes wins. The vote should be done in a <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERfA_0b0c.html" title="WP:RfA">RfA</a>-style page with subpages for each candidate.</p>
<p>This vote should be <b>only</b> for coordinator. The voting of both proposed DCP and DCO can wait (although I agree with it) after we have a Coordinator. --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> 18:39, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

They had pletny of opportnities to say, hey, let's vote ona corrdinator FIRST and then see where we stand, but that didn't happen. <b>Instead</b> they wait untila majority of people support the proposal they oppose (9-7 at the time) and <b>then</b> they put forth this idea and literlaly <b>demand</b> that the vote be stopped in favor of their proposal.

Simple number of cases tried doesn't work, and success in ArbCom cases — especially the ones we get — are often very difficult to verify, as it can range from getting the client off to getting them a better deal than they'd otherwise have to just convincing them to back off.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">2006 Coordinator Election</span></h2>
<p>As it turns out, a review of past materials on AMA elections (<a href="../../../a/m/a/Wikipedia%7EAMA_2004_Coordinator_Election_ca31.html" title="Wikipedia:AMA 2004 Coordinator Election">1</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EAMA_2004_Coordinator_Election_d473.html" title="Wikipedia talk:AMA 2004 Coordinator Election">2</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/a/Wikipedia%7EAMA_Coordinator_Election_ae92.html" title="Wikipedia:AMA Coordinator Election">3</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/a/Wikipedia%7EAMA_Coordinator_Election_Procedure_a1b5.html" title="Wikipedia:AMA Coordinator Election Procedure">4</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EAMA_Coordinator_Election_Procedure_60c4.html" title="Wikipedia talk:AMA Coordinator Election Procedure">5</a>) indicate a few details, but also a few loose ends.</p>
<p>Details:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the first (and only) election, there was a 5-day nomination period.</li>
<li>Two mediators were enlisted to manage the electoral process.</li>
<li>Voting was done by secret ballot, using a set-up email address as voting box, and confirmation of vote receipt via email. (Note that the email address used then appears to be disabled now.) Abstention was mandatory, though in practice only one person did this.</li>
<li>The only seemingly agreed-upon definition of the Coordinator is to connect those needing advocacy with those giving advocacy, including monitoring Requests for advocacy.</li>
<li>The first vote seems to have run for two weeks, "from April 16 to 30, 2004"</li>
<li>Suffrage was granted to anyone signed up to the AMA prior to the opening of voting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Loose ends:</p>
<ul>
<li>The term of the coordinator was never set. One proposal said 6 months. In January 2005, 8 months after the first election, the AMA membership at the time agreed by 10-1 to hold another election. However, this did not occur, and the election was postponed indefinitely in favor of a series of meetings to assess AMA direction and efficacy.</li>
<li>A number of other things considered defining about the coordinator and the election were actually in a proposal that was never voted on.</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess the questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we agree to continue the practices laid out in the details above?</li>
<li>How can/should we settle the loose ends, specifically the term of office?</li>
</ul>
<p>IMO:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain the 5-day nomination period.</li>
<li>The election period should be shortened to a week.</li>
<li>Suffrage should be limited to something before opening of vote. I accept Wally's compromise proposal of those who were eligible to vote on Gator's proposal. Since AMA membership is voluntary, I also think former members should be eligible.</li>
<li>We should maintain secret ballot, with some confirmation process. I don't know about mandatory abstention. Seems to me a good vote-confirmation method would make that unnecessary.</li>
<li>Term of coordinator should be extended to one year, though we shouldn't probably decide that now. Perhaps the candidates should indicate what terms they are open to accepting if elected.</li>
</ul>

<dd>I don't agree with former members being eligible. If we're going to have a standard that all those who are members at time X are eligible, it's hardly appropriate to go and rope in those who do not meet that standard in any way, be it recruiting new members or drafting withdrawn ones. Plus, having withdrawn membership shows rather a lack of commitment to the organization and its goals.</dd>
<dd>I also feel that the Coordinator's term should be negligable <b>at this point</b>, and that it should be merely an acting position, at least until we conclude a universal procedural standard and organization. I would support anything up to and including three months, but nothing longer.</dd>
<dd>Secret ballot is a must. This ArbCom election, for example, was farcical; not only was it more difficult to vote using the open method, promoting ballot fatigue, but it also forced everyone to show their hand, so to speak. It's bad for the voters and bad for the candidates. Something tells me it was set up that way...</dd>
<dd>Don't worry about abstention. The standard should simply be the number of votes in favor divided by the number of votes cast. We are to proceed by <a href="../../../a/p/p/Approval_voting.html" title="Approval voting">approval method</a>, yes? So we merely have everyone either vote for or not vote for each candidate they find acceptable. The candidate with broadest acceptability wins. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 19:24, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, as a side note, if this election proposal meets consensus might we engage a member of the MedCab to run it (I already wondered aloud if Nicholas Turnbull might be prevailed upon)? I think that would be the best way to proceed; of course any outside honest broker would do. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 19:26, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I was trying to consider individuals who may have left due to the inactivity and power vacuum that has occured, as well as those who didn't intend to leave for good but just for a hiatus, not knowing that by doing so they would be excluded from this sort of thing. And I wasn't suggesting we track old members down. I guess I was saying that, if a former member came across the page after the cutoff point for suffrage, and was encouraged to rejoin AMA as a result of seeing this, that they should be invited into the process as part of our quest for revitalization.</dd>
<dd>I didn't entirely mean to make an election proposal, but I guess I did. I was hoping more that we could come to consensus without too much explicit voting.</dd>
<dd>Given movement on WP and AMA and the items ahead of us after the election, I would say 3 months is too short and will lead us into another election before we are ready. I.e., chaos. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<dd>But I do not believe we are ready for a full Coordinator yet. We want to rebuild the organization <i>first</i>, set up its systems of leadership and standard operating procedures <i>second</i>, and execute the above <i>third</i>. A full Coordinator election seems like too much, too fast. However this is not to say our new Acting Coordinator would be restricted to a three month term: I merely mean to set a definite timeframe within which work on the restructuring of this organization be completed, after which the leader submit themselves for reelection. While I am generally opposed to incumbents being allowed to reseek seats, this would be a clear instance where that would be desirable.</dd>

<dd>An Acting Coordinator could also appoint deputies rather than submit them for election during this interim to engage in some of the review that I mentioned above. This would again be proper because an election would necessarily occur at the end of the interim period. Obviously they would still need to get member support for any actions; it would nevertheless just emphasize the stopgap nature of the post. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 22:44, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A suggestion</span></h2>
<p>Might I perhaps be permitted to make a suggestion? Rather than electing a coordinator at this point, someone should simply jump in and make themselves Interim Coordinator, without an election, to serve whilst the plans are being drawn up. This would remove the need of an outside party to adjudicate the election, would involve only one as opposed to two ballots, and would permit policy making and discussion to take place with a central command of authority. Ballots should be conducted <i>after</i> one has the road-map, in my experience, never before. Just my opinion, of course.

<dd>I could not disagree more. Someone cannot just "jump in" and make themselves Coordinator; we all have an equal right to lay claim to the post if there is no mechanism for deciding who would have it, and it would still involve discussion to make sure only one person took the job. I believe that it would be best if we could all unite around a single candidate; however no one can be denied the opportunity to try, and a coronation without universal consent would do just that. A vote is simple, quick — and legitimate. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 20:53, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thats obviously not true wally, look at how much time has been wasted over simply choosing a successor to Alex. <b>Nobody</b> has declared a desire for his position, and a vote in such a circumstance is not only against wiki-norms, its against common sense. Democracy for its own sake is no answer to a power vacuum, and gives no special legitimacy.</p>
<p>How about we make a list of the jobs that need doing, and volunteer for doing them. if 2 people want the same job they can both do it. Lets stop wasting time squabbling over petty symbolic status, there's work to be done. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 23:28, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let me make clear what I feel should be the intention behind the reform of this organization. We <b>all</b> will, indeed, <i>must</i>, have an integral part in it. The post of an (acting?) Coordinator is, at this point, merely going to arbit the discussion we are just now beginning about the future of the AMA and, when it has reached a natural endpoint or concurrence, coalesce it into firm policy about <b>what we do and how we do it</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Had I my druthers I would suggest that most of the policy writing be delegated to other users — for instance I know you have an interest in that area, Sam. I don't know how the person elected would like to do it, however, and since that person will certainly not be me I am hardly the one to say. My point is, though, that a volunteer will lack authority and legitimacy. The time spent on a simple process is not time wasted, and the amount required will be negligable. Right now we have <b>one</b> job that needs doing, and it's a job too important to leave to the random chance and lackluster effort of a volunteer. Let's do this, quickly and right. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 00:01, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The only reason why I suggested the "jump-in coordination" method is because, well, it seemed to work on the Mediation Cabal (which, when I came to it, was in a similar state that the AMA is in now, although perhaps it had less active members) and I just jumped in and took control. Admittedly we don't operate elections and we aren't a democratic organisation (as our name suggests, obviously) but nonetheless I do think that in times where organisations are faltering it is usually far better for a single person to simply take control, not necessarily after being asked. We do, after all, have a "be bold" culture here on Wikipedia, and I think that extends to the way we operate our organisations to further our aims.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And after all, if that person does not perform adequately as self-appointed dictator, the mob can simply strip him of his dictatorship by the force of the masses. I consider such a process to be generally more fruitful than ballots. However, I recognise the AMA does things differently, and hope that you have a smooth election below.

<dd>I can see the logic in that. However, like you said, we have more active members, and a strong history of participation. That would make having a sort of benevolent dictator all the more difficult, and all the less effective, in my opinion. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 03:26, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To Sam: No one has expressed interest because we are not at a nomination state yet. But... Expressing interest and even nominating is not even truly necessary; in an <a href="../../../a/p/p/Approval_voting.html" title="Approval voting">approval voting</a> scheme, just put down the name of all members you think would be acceptable. If the winner declines, then it falls to the person with the next broadest support. The only difference that would arise from someone not being a candidate would be that no one would put them on their list, which in this model would have the same outcome. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

</dl>
<p>In the interests of moving things along, I propose the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>An election for Coordinator immediately be held. A nomination period of four days, following by an election of one week, should begin should this proposal reach consensus (I would consider consensus to be fifteen votes, considering the turnout in the last proposal; otherwise about 75% should more or less vote).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Nominations can be submitted by any member for themselves or any other member. Members have a right to decline.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Voting will be by approval and secret ballot. Once an impartial mediator is appointed, all members eligible to vote in the first proposal will be able to cast a vote in favor of as many candidates as they like. The candidate who gains the broadest approval (decided by votes cast for them divided by total members voting) will be declared elected. In the event of only one candidate, that candidate shall be declared elected.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Coordinator should direct discussion on various issues of importance to the AMA, in which all members must be allowed to voice opinions. The Coordinator will be empowered to write up a mission statement and such guidelines (such as ethical, or suggested procedures for advocates, etc.) given appropiate discussion. The Coordinator can delegate this duty to any member they choose. The mission statement must be presented for amendment and approved by a consensus vote, as must any body of guidelines. The Coordinator can appoint deputies to assist them if they choose.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Coordinator will be acting, and will serve not less than four and not more than eight months.</li>

<li><b>Support</b>; Wally has taken us in the right direction by actually proposing this thing and getting it off of the ground. It'd be a shame to waste this proposal, as it strictly outlines what said coordinator will do, gets rid of first past the post crap, and sets a timeline for elected coordinator to do said duties assigned to them. If they haven't gotten this organization running in 8 months, they'll be out. One question though... if the Coordinator doesn't give any noticeable effort after, say a month or so, could there be an election or proposal to upheave the Coordinator, and get a new one? Besides that, I'm fine with the proposal... — <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanManka_997b.html" title="User:IanManka">Ian Manka</a> <sup><a href="../../../i/a/n/User_talk%7EIanManka_481c.html" title="User talk:IanManka">Questions?

<li><i>(Abstain, since I do not have suffrage)</i> - If this was a vote for coordinator I would consider it a worthwhile effort; however, holding a vote on a vote strikes me (with no intention to impugn the work of its architects, I might add) as bureaucracy in its essence. Unless the AMA does something proactive, it shall be stuck in an endless loop of voting <i>ad infinitum</i> - and since the provision of advocates is so vital to Wikipedia, I think that the AMA should concentrate on advocation first and foremost, and organisational administration second (if at all).

<dd>To answer Nicholas, the problem is that we have not provided ourselves with a means by which to hold an election. So, the idea of having an election must be bootstrapped by defining the election process. I personally abhor ad hoc organization and election. Even WP has a few hard policies. But you're right if you feel like we've been doing a lot of proposing and voting lately, but such is the process of reaching consensus sometimes. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Just a note from the outgoing AMA Coordinator</span></h2>
<p>Just want to let you know that I have just resigned as Coordinator of the AMA opening the way for an election. If you want to see my statement check the Coodinator's page: <a href="../../../a/m/a/Wikipedia%7EAMA_Coordinator_28a8.html" title="Wikipedia:AMA Coordinator">Wikipedia:AMA Coordinator</a>. I hope the members understand the meaning of my resignation and see it as a proactive step in allowing the democratic process to work. While some of you may not think I have been particuarly active recently I think there was good reason for this inactivity and I do not see it as an indication that the AMA is not fulfilling the role that it had under the mandate given to me as the first elected Coordinator. Be that as it may we definitely should have an election and since the term of office of the coordinator was never clearly set resignation is clearly the way to call an election under our present system. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">Alex756</a> 18:58, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Interim Coordinator</span></h2>
<p>I don't wish to steal Alex's day from him but in the best tradition of "the King is dead, long live the King!" I thought I should make my announcement. I've been considering this for a while, I wanted to make sure I was going to have the time to do it. Despite being recently appointed to my local school board (a return engagement for me) I have decided this is something I would really like to do and would like your consideration for interim coordinator.</p>
<p>I think this position should be filled ASAP so that we can move on with getting things rearranged. I realize I may have not been as welcoming with open arms of the "new blood" we have but I think I've been constructive in my criticism and tried to see the good points of the proposals presented. I've been an editor here (with an account) for a year and a half, I was recently elevated to <a href="../../../a/d/m/WP%7EAdmin_66ad.html" title="WP:Admin">Admin</a> and I have formally advocated on two Arbcom cases as well as in many other instances that didn't involve Arbcom. Despite being on my local school board (twice now) as its vice-president I was also state chairman of the Libertarian Party of Illinois. Now, if any of you know anything about Libertarians let me just tell you that trying to lead Libertarians is a lot like trying to herd kittens!! So, I'm used to broad ranges of very independent and vocal individuals.</p>
<p>It's my belief that dispute resolution is one of the biggest issues facing our community right now. We have <a href="../../../w/h/e/Wheel_war.html" title="Wheel war">wheel warring</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/n/WP%7ETINC_0d39.html" title="WP:TINC">cabal accusations</a>, an Arbcom docket a mile long, a contentious Arbcom election underway and a number of other issues that all pertain to dispute resolution. The community needs a healthy AMA now more than ever and I would like to help see us get there.</p>
<p>As part of this, I propose the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The interim term will be six months from appointment, if I still want the job at that point I have to run again.</li>
<li>I will resign from <a href="../../../t/i/n/WP%7ETINMC_f912.html" title="WP:TINMC">The Mediation Cabal</a> so as not to create any undue burden on my time or create a conflict of interest.</li>
<li>During the six months more formal rules or bylaws for this group will be drawn up, I will attempt to lead us to that point.</li>
<li>I will listen to all points of view on the creation of these bylaws and will see that all voices are heard in their creation, the goal is consensus.</li>
<li>Coordinator job duties, additional coordinators, term of office, and elections will be part of the bylaws.</li>
<li>I would like to see more online live meetings using <a href="../../../i/r/c/IRC_b274.html" title="IRC">IRC</a> if we choose that or maybe something a bit more available and user friendly like <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skype.html" title="Skype">Skype</a>, I believe this will cut down on the number of problems we seem to have right now with voting, etc.</li>
<li>The three main areas of focus will be maintaining the requests page, training and mentorship for new advocates, and better establishing ourselves within the dispute resolution process.</li>
</ul>
<p>There you have it, I hope I have covered it all. I would welcome your comments, questions, or your support if you are so disposed already.</p>

<dd>Several members have indicated they think this is getting bogged down in procedure. I agree to n extent, it appears we're having votes to have votes and everything is grinding to a halt. Meanwhile we have a lot of things we could be doing that aren't getting done. The position is interim and is meant to get us moving to the point where we can come up with what an election for the permanent position(s) would be. So while I support the idea Wally I think we need to get a move on. So, my announcing my intention is to try to get the ball rolling a bit quicker in deference to those who have said we should get going. If the group decides we want to wait and go through this then just consider this my announcement that I intend to run, whichever way it pans out. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 06:46, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We <i>are</i> getting going, and it can be done far more quickly in the long run if we do it right. Had we agreed to parameters in the first Coordinator election, it wouldn't have been so long until we were able to effect a second. There is a difference, I think between advisable and inadvisable speed. And there is a difference between a coronation and an election. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 17:20, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I really, really fail to see how piling on yet another proposal while one is already being considered is supposed to solve the problem you state. Your proposal doesn't do any better in terms of moving things along as the current one does. It really bothers me that the AMA seems to be averse to propriety and basic procedure in its own operation. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<dd>First off for Keith, this group is <b>mired in its own procedure</b>. What other organization do you know of that the president/chair resigns and there is no immediate successor on at least an interim basis? To conclude we can go another few weeks to vote on how we're going to vote and just leave it vacant indicates we're not very important.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And to Wally when he points to the last non-election as a reason why "we should wait", I just draw the opposite conclusion on. First, they never specified what Alex's term of office would be but elected him to the position, the same thing exists here (with a vague "not less than and not more than" which causes me to ponder what will happen when some think it should be sooner than later and vice versa). That left a sizable period of time where because of RL Alex was unable to participate much yet there was nothing in place to replace him so he more or less begged for someone to step up and replace him. At the time I hesitated because I had a heavy "case load" and was still pretty new then.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Second, they wrangled so long on election procedure and whatnot the second time around <b>no vote took place</b>. People simply got tired of it and walked away which is the point I believe many of us are reaching and what people who used to look for help from AMA are reaching. Finally, there's no close date, no indication of when we will close this vote so when are we assuming a consensus is reached on it? After 15 vote for it? What if it never gets to 15? After two weeks of being up there then? After more testimony from ArbCom members that our organization is completely ineffective? After another month's worth of people don't have their cases responded to because we're fiddling while Rome burns?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is an interim position, it should be no big deal, I'm willing to step up and work on it and we can settle all the specifics of normal elections when we work on our bylaws in their entirety. There's nothing undemocratic about appointing an interim coordinator by acclimation while we work out new procedures for the organization as a whole. I think that if I went on some tyrannical raid of some sort (which I don't think there's any evidence to support) that members would step up and say I should no longer be interim as someone else has already said. Let's get on with helping those who who need it who wait while we wrangle about procedure in a committee. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 14:19, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While I like Wgfinley personally, the AMA badly needs an election to make sure this is done properly. In more than two years, the AMA has never had an effect on the outcome of a case, as stated by several arbitrators. It's a good idea, but it's never been done properly, and has completely failed to achieve its stated objectives. It needs to be providing effective assistance to those who need it, rather than wasting the advocates time, the arbitration committee's time, and the time of the people they are supposed to be helping because the advocates don't know what they should be doing to actually have an effect.</p>
<p>It's because of that that I would like the chance to put myself up as an alternative co-ordinator. I've served as an arbitrator, so I know what arbitrators look for, but I've also had a pretty good record as an unofficial advocate, having achieved results in quite a few cases. If I was given a few months as AMA co-ordinator, I think we may well be able to set up an effective group of advocates that provide timely and meaningful assistance, and actually succeed in getting results for the people they intend to help. I've got no interest in sticking around beyond six months, but I would really like the opportunity to get this up and running successfully. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 13:29, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was aware of Sam's "detective agency"; I was referring to advocacy done under the AMA banner, as that page fairly clearly sets itself out as Sam's personal effort. In any case, Sam's efforts are purely prosecutorial. A user who finds themselves up before the ArbCom still has nowhere to go for effective help - if they can get themselves an advocate (which, depending on the time of year, they may or not be able to do), there's virtually no chance that they'll get an advocate who will actually make any difference on their case. Above all, it is that that I'd like to end. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 13:50, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There has never been any advocacy done under the "AMA banner." That is not how the group works. It is just a clearinghouse, not a pro bono law firm. How can anyone even make a statement that advocates have never helped anyone? They are information resources, not television trial lawyers. They are to help the individual editor faced with the dispute resolution process and they are not just for people accused of something wrong as Sam points out. I do not think that one could know if an advocate made a difference because the work of an advocate is mostly undocumented, hopefully, as it should be and remain. Advocates are not going to necessarily change the outcome of ArbCom cases, just make the process more accessible to people who do not understand it, but any such comment is wholely unscientific and, in my opinion, and bordering on libel as it is offered without any reasonable hope of proof in an effort to disparage our group of volunteers on this public page who, I sincerely beleive, really do help the dispute resolution process. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">Alex756</a> 16:20, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is a clearinghouse that is simply not doing its job. It hooks people up with advocates who more often than not simply waste the time of all parties involved because they don't know how to be an effective advocate, and on quite a few occasions (Everyking being a prime example), the process fails to hook a user up with an advocate at all. The arbitration committee continually sees cases where a user gets an AMA advocate in the hope of helping them put across their side of the case, only to see that advocate stuff around with technicalities instead of actually helping them present said case. While I'm sure there are some cases when advocates on this page have been asked and been able to explain the process to people, but it is the times when they need to actively step in and participate that AMA advocates so regularly utterly fail. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 21:25, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Following that, there may be eligibility; I am uncertain if there is any specific policy on that score. My proposal merely restricts the franchise for the vote, not the eligibility for nomination; while perhaps an oversight, an honest broker for the interim period might not be a terrible idea. I tend towards a "let the votes speak as they may" attitude. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 04:02, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">POV</span></h4>
<p>Even in the administration of Wikipedia, reckless POV rears its ugly head.</p>
<p>It's reaffirming to me to hear an arbitrator state that advocates have little effect on arbitration cases. It saves me the trouble of going through and trying to prove it myself.</p>
<p>Ambi, as I would expect from an arbitrator, blames that lack of effect on AMA and the advocates. I, in turn, blame the arbitrators.</p>
<p>An advocate cannot reverse the preconceptions, loyalties, and as Sam said, occasional hero worship that taints the arbitration process. The process, its social tendencies, and its management lead to a situation that is stacked against an accused. Argument of principle, whether legal or non-legal, is useless (any argument of principle is labeled as "wikilawyering"). Acceptable edit history weighs much less than challenged edit history. Being an admin, and/or being the person to bring a case, works in ones favor. These are the perceptions of the ArbCom from those who have dealt with the process personally from the defense standpoint. It does not interest itself in any solid principle of evenhandedness, it can change policy affecting its operation at will, it elevates restrictive policy over empowering policy, and it even goes so far as to restrict a user from doing something that it has agreed is not against policy if the body is already predisposed against the user.</p>

<dd>You could first start by assuming good faith. The main issue here, which I believe many of the AMA advocates have never understood, is that the arbitration committee is <i>not</i> a court of law. If there is evidence that suggests that their continuing editing is of more harm than good to the project, then their advocate needs to explain why it's in the interests of the project to keep them around. Adding clear evidence, reasoning with people, and helping some users communicate in what can be a particularly stressful situation can and will have quite an effect on cases. Snowspinner and Sam Spade both understand the above, which is why they've been so successful in a prosecutorial role. While it was a fair while ago, I've also been able to be fairly successful in a defensive role for that reason.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Being an admin or the person to bring a case has nothing to do with how arbitration works out. Admins regularly do end up being sanctioned if they've crossed the line, and the person to bring a case often winds up in just as much trouble if they've been equally in the wrong. "Arguments of principle" are indeed not helpful - the arbitrators want to know how said user helps the project, and in a system that is not a court, trying to get the user off on some technicality instead of taking the time to explain that just wastes the time of everyone involved.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Being a reasonably effective advocate was what got me elected to the arbitration committee in the first place. I could and did see changes made in quite a number of cases, including quite a few where users were up for some form of sanction or another. I did that by convincing the arbitrators that said sanction was not a good idea and was not beneficial to the project - not by trying to tie them up in technicalities. I'd really like to see the rest of the AMA learn this point, and suspect we would see advocates playing a far greater and more successful role in the arbitration process if this actually occurred. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 21:10, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Before I vote supporting or opposing you, I 'd like to say this: I understand that an Interim Cordinator could be needed now that the scenario has changed with Alex's resignation and that would be the main reason for me to change myopinion of helding an election now. But, on the other hand, we were working in another plan and I think we should try with it first. I like Wgfinley as a new AMA coordinator and I'm sure that he'll do it very well, but it's quite unserious and useless to be changing proposals each day. But I also understand that we need someone that lead this mess so we can vote... In summary, I'm a bit confused, so I prefer to wait before voting until this gets a bit clearer to me --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> 13:00, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The AMA is working, it has been working and it does work. It is the members that make it work. The job of the members is to provide help to people. IF you want the AMA to work, I suggest you try to be more proactive. The role of the coordinator was never to "fix" the organization is was just to have someone available who can deal with problems. If you think an election is going to "fix" anything, you will be disappointed, in my opinion. This group is not about titles, adding things to Wikipedia pages or about getting publicity; it is about the members directly helping people who are faced with the complex dispute resolution process; not some new additional bureacratic structure within Wikipedia. If you sincerely think the organization is "broken" perhaps all the pages should be listed for deletion, i.e., the group be disbanded and advocates can just help people directly as they have been doing and I hope they will continue to do even if these pages do not exist. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">Alex756</a> 16:09, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The AMA has never worked. I see the role of a coordinator as someone who can speedily make sure people who need an advocate get one and that the advocates basically know what they're doing, not as some hereditary title. I'm not saying the group should be about publicity, bureaucratic structure or titles, and I don't think it's broken to the point of needing deletion. I do, however, think it could and should be much more effective. <small>unsigned comment</small></dd>

<p>I for my part was helping others long before the AMA came about, and will be helping others (on and off the wiki) regardless of if I continue being a member of AMA or not.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Regarding prosecution</span></h2>
<p>However offensively, Ambi brought up a rather insightful point regarding my successes. They were nearly all (w the exception of <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">User:WHEELER</a>, a mixed result) prosecutorial in nature. Why is that?</p>
<p>I do what works. The ARBCOM is terrifically disinterested in the positive article improvements of editors. They tend to ignore evidence in general, even admitting to such w some regularity. What can one do?</p>
<p>Keep it short, simple, and concentrate on the attack. Dig up dirt. Make the opposition out to be right scoundrels, a menace to our encyclopedia. Is that the right thing to do? Does it result in a better encyclopedia. No, indeed it does not. But it works, nearly all of the time.</p>
<p>The only exception I know of was the recent case involving <a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">User:Cberlet</a>, whom the arbiters admitted a great deal of "hero worship" towards, and even personal dealings with. In that matter no amount of evidence did us any good, and the only workable solution I am aware of would have been Cberlet's approach: come across well to the arbiters outside of the wiki. As it was 5 editors were lined up and <s>shot</s> disciplined based on a conspiracy theory advanced by <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chip_Berlet_64c2.html" title="Chip Berlet">Chip Berlet</a>, in accordance w his (and others) political biases. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 16:51, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The committee is most certainly <i>not</i> disinterested in the positive article improvements of editors - indeed, I wish this was something advocates brought up more regularly. It's a crucial part of getting across the side of the person up before the committee, and it's one of the things advocates (not to mention users themselves) forget to do all too often.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The committee doesn't ignore evidence, but parties often provide screens and screens and screens of material, which makes it very hard to try and get a grasp of the situation. Helping to get this down to a manageable size, so that it doesn't take weeks to work out who's really at fault, is a great way for advocates to help, but again, is another thing that gets overlooked.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the end, the goal is to make a better encyclopedia, so show <i>how</i> the user is helping to make a better encyclopedia. Again, this is something that advocates all too often forget to do, to the detriment of the people they're supposed to be helping. "Concentrating on the attack" may be a way of driving your opponents off the wiki, but I'm more interested in making sure every person has access to the assistance of advocates who will actually help their case. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 22:04, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Election Board</span></h2>
<p>As it seems the election proposal is closing on attaining consensus (which was set at fifteen votes in the proposal with twenty people voting; at this moment we have eleven valid votes cast, nine in favor), I wanted to put forward a suggestion about how it'll be moderated. I suggest it be run by someone outside the organization, without suffrage, and when the vote is conducted the count should be confirmed by two voting AMA members who were not themselves candidates. As an extension of the election I think we can kind of "voice vote" this part; else we can just have the one returning officer from outside AMA. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 19:35, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This seems awfully complicated. Why do we need someone to run it? Why do we need someone to confirm the count? Why do we need a returning officer?

<dd>Well, as it seems to be going the proposal under consideration now will pass. Which means we will vote on this, by secret ballot, despite any objections. And bureaucracy is neither an inherent evil nor is it something that should be used as a straw man attack. Fairness takes effort and it takes a check or too, and I was merely floating this as an idea for it. This whole process would move faster if everyone involved would simply reconcile the fact that we will not have a grandee simply assume the powers of office in this organization, but will rather act with the thoughtfulness and consideration that has always characterized the AMA.

<dd>Dear Wally: I would, with all due respect, point out that there is a difference between organisational leadership that is <i>required</i>, as you put it, and that which is <i>desired</i> by some of the organisation's participants. In my opinion, there may be a desire for such leadership, but I cannot see any persuasive reason why it is actually required for the efficient running of an advocates' service for Wikipedians. Indeed, I am of the view that probably the AMA would work perfectly well without any of this organisational folderol; however, whether it would work optimally, or in the best interests of service users and members, would be another matter. I would, however, aver that such bureaucracy and being bent on the task of being an organisation as evidenced on this talk page recently, versus advocating on behalf of people, is far from required, and should be brought to a just ending as promptly as possible.

<p>Can anyone justify the continued operation of this project? I have seen nothing positive from an AMA advocate operating in their role due to an AMA request - not once has an AMA advocate worked to inform users who come seeking assistance how better to operate within the system - rather, the standard practice appears to be agressively taking their designed advocatees side and using every single wikilawyering, debate-society tactic in the book to "win."</p>
<p>This does not include advocates who run various things on the side - see Sam Spade, for example, whose prosecutorial whatever appears to be wholy unconnected from this project. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 19:31, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One example of an AMA advocate operating within the <b>spirit</b> (not the rules) of Wikipedia to assist a new user in improving the <b>encyclopedia</b> would be more than enough to convince me of the merits of this project. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 18:19, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think we both know that no matter what the example, it won't satisfy you, so please go ahead and file the MFD. We are in the midst of attempting to elect a new interim coordinator in order to reform the association, so it's really a bad time to be doing this. I seriously doubt anyone here will go out of their way to justify the AMA to you or anyone right now and they know an MFD will certainly fail, so it's really best if you jsut file it now instead of waiting three weeks and getting little no responses. People will, at least, be forced to argue for the AMA in an MFD, so let's just cut to the chase. Just my opinion.Gator (talk) 18:23, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Please provide one example of an AMA advocate operating within the <b>spirit</b> (not the rules) of Wikipedia to assist a new user in improving the <b>encyclopedia</b>.

<p>I've helped users, I just don't drag it through the courts. This group is valuable in that it allows users to contact people willing to help when they need it. We don't need a lot of discussion about it. Different users need different kinds of help. You don't need to be a lawyer to help someone, and there's no need to prove this group is of value. If <i>you</i> don't need an advocate, that's fine, if you do, we're here. <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">Pedant</a> 05:31, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Poll Closed</span></h2>
<p>With a vote of 9-1-1, and having reached the expiration date latterly set at 20 January, the poll meets consensus and an election will occur at the earliest possible moment.</p>
<p>The proposal called for four days of nomination, followed by a secret ballot vote on the approval system. If no one minds, since there's already a nomination section, that could be retroactively counted towards the four day period in order to move this along quicker.</p>
<p>Nominees thus far are:</p>
<p><b>KeithTyler</b> (nominated, accepted) and <b>Wgfinley</b> (nominated, accepted). Possible nominees pending acceptance or community consensus are <b>Ambi</b>, <b>Kim Bruning</b> and <b>Neigel von Teighen</b>. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 19:47, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

My personal opinion is that resumption of membership should be automatic following the expiry of a term as Arbitrator, making the fact that she is not presently on the member list irrelevant.

<dd>I nominate myself. My platform is a massive reform of the mission and methods of advocates, with a specific eye to cutting the amount of wikilawyering down to zero, and a critical eye to steering the often problematic users who come here to change their behavior to conform to standards rather than to futily try to push their damaging opinions through avenues of power. I will agressivly monitor each and every advocates advocacy to determine that they are acting both in the interest of their "client" and in the interest of the encyclopedia, which is what this project is designed to protect. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 18:42, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Eligibility for suffrage was membership as of 21:46 on 6 January, same as with the first proposal vote. There was no discussion on eligibility for candidates, hence Ambi was able to run by consensus. However, I have objections to Hipocrite running; Ambi was a member beforehand and was automatically removed (but NOT automatically reinstated) per AMA guidelines. Hipocrite only signed up today, however. Hipocrite does have a point that nothing was listed, however, so if any member in good standing is willing to support his right to run I'll not stand in the way. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 20:30, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well if you're looking for a member in good standing to support Hipocrite's nomination, count me out. He just joined today right (after threatening to move to delete the AMA) and he can't vote in the election due to his recent membership, so it should be implied that, without consensus, only those with sufferage should be able to run. Or else we're being kind of cotnradictory. No right to vote but can run, but not vote for yourself... Just my thought on the matter. If the consensus is to allow him to run, I'm fine with that. To be clear though, he should be able to run and vote for a permanent coordinator however. Gator (talk) 21:11, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Based on today's edits, you're intentions are...vague at best.Gator (talk) 21:55, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My intentions are quite clear. I posted a request that someone justify the existance of this project on January 19th, after having watched three AMA advocates "help" clients disrupt the encyclopedia via wikilawyering, and viewing a talk page that was filled with garbage about election policies and procedures - leading me to believe this was nothing more than a Nomic support group. On the 20th of January, one of the AMA advocates replied that he did good work. On the 20th of January, I asked for examples. I waited 5 days, but none were forthcoming. On the 25th of January, I asked that someone justify the continued existance of this project, with the statement that if no one could do so, I would MFD it. You then responded that you were certain that any evidence of good actions by AMA would be ignored by me - you did not, however, provide any such evidence. In fact, when I insisted that you give me evidence of this project helping the encyclopedia, you wrote that "I'm not going to waste my time and no on here owes you a justification." I decided that instead of killing what might be a usefull project because a user with a substantial grudge against me was going to be troublesome, I was going to fix the project. To do so, I nominated myself for coordinator and wrote a strongly reformist platform. You decided that this was unacceptable, and, instead of allowing people to decide what they prefered, you attempted to invalidate my platform. My intention is to make this encyclopedia better. If that means deleting this project, then that's the answer. If that means me running this project, that's the answer. If that means me making sure the next coordinator is actually doing something to fix the project, that's the answer. I can promise you, however, that you trying to wikilawyer someone out of an election because you don't like them or what they stand for is NOT the answer. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 22:03, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh please, I have no power to "allow" or disallow anyone from voting for you, I'm merely arguing that you shouldn be allowed to run and that is acceptable adn I wasn;t the only one. Call that "wikilawyering" (assuming you have a definiton for that, other than arguments that you prefer not to respond to, but you seem to throw it around qyuite a bit, so I bet you have a incredibnyl vague subjective definition) if you want to, but I don't care. As of now, no one else seems to care if you run or not, so feel free. And rest assured, that I hold no grude against you fro anything you've done or said to me in the past.....you offer plenty of reasons to oppose you by the new thigns you say every day.

<dd>It was (is) just like you said, a proposal. That's not "denying" anybody, anything, I have no such power. Get off it. Not anyone should be allowed to run in my opinion, including you. That's my opinion and I'm entitled to it. Thanks for the vague subjective definition...like I expected. What one person thinks is "an improper technical interpretation of policy" anotehr person thinsk are sound arguments. I've said this before, the people who usually lable things as "technicalities" are just covering for the fct that the arguments are over their head, but isntead of educating themself and responding to the argument in a logial manner, they label it a "technicality" or, in your case, "wikilawyering" and libeate themself from the obligation to respond. Look, run if you want and no one else is opposed, that's fine. I'm tired of all of this. Again, good luck.Gator (talk) 22:18, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

There have been other conflicts as well, relating to a dispute that I am having with DreamGuy. Hipocrite appeared rather suddenly (and negatively) in the discussion, and has also been making what (IMHO) are "less than good faith" edits to my official bio article<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elonka_Dunin&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elonka_Dunin&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. The combination of the attack, as well as applying for this position, somewhat bewilders me, though the discussion here at the AMA does help shed a bit more light on the matter. I'd agree that there's <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entryism.html" title="Entryism">entryism</a>, but is this also perhaps an example of <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trolling.html" title="Trolling">trolling</a>? <a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 10:45, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am withdrawing from the coordinator election as I am resigning from AMA. There's a major event behind this but things here at AMA have been bugging me for a few weeks now so it made the other decision rather easy. This group used to be very loose and committed to helping people, now it seems more in love with its own process and procedure than anything else. By running for coordinator I was hopeful that I could nudge things in the right direction o get AMA back on track. I'm not sure if that's possible anymore and I'm not sure if rehabilitating AMA is possible right now.</p>
<p>I was one of the founders of <a href="../../../t/i/n/WP%7ETINMC_f912.html" title="WP:TINMC">MedCab</a> and when I came back from wikivacation it was in very good hands so I intended to focus my efforts here on AMA. Now MedCab is without a coordinator and I don't want to see things fall apart there so I have elected to take over as MedCab coordinator. I think what that group does is very important and it has always had a flair for being informal, something I very much like.</p>
<p>So, I am resigning from AMA at this time. I leave with but one bit of advice and that is to LOOSEN UP. This group is falling over itself with policy and procedure and policy and procedure for policy and procedure. This isn't helping people which was the goal of AMA when it was founded -- to help people that needed it. I don't see a lot of that going on and it's sorely needed. So, I wish you all the best, I really hope you can get things turned around. If you are serious about mediation I invite you to come join, you don't have to quit here to do so. <i><a href="../../../a/u/d/Audi_alteram_partem.html" title="Audi alteram partem">Audi alteram partem</a></i>. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 03:32, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wgfinley has make me take a decision I was thinking of since all this mess began. I tried to do my best by starting a nomination process that had now led into the dissaster we have now. Damned be that post (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AAssociation_of_Members%27_Advocates%2FArchive1&amp;diff=26520157&amp;oldid=17830931" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AAssociation_of_Members%27_Advocates%2FArchive1&amp;diff=26520157&amp;oldid=17830931" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>) which began all this "revival" process that ended with AMA's agony. Sorry for beginning the nomination process without consensus and try to install "de facto" an election. Bye!</p>

<dd>I ask that you reconsider. We are moving a bit slowly, but steadily, towards our goal of a full and fair election.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Doing it right.</span></h2>
<p>I know how we can fix all this and eliminate all this silly propriety and legitimacy that is driving people away due to AMA's movement being so slow in comparison to all the other projects on WP. (I dunno where people estimate this from... I've been trying to get a <a href="../../../n/o/r/Talk%7ENorth_American_Numbering_Plan_b947.html" title="Talk:North American Numbering Plan">mass move</a> going on for months which is still stalled in interference, and an AFD I posed days ago has no comments. But I digress; there must be some other metric for measuring what is "Wikipedia time".)</p>
<p>Anyway. The solution is clearly this: Wally assume Benevolent Dictator, load up the List of AMA members, close his eyes, and poke the screen with his finger. Whomever his finger lies upon will be the new AMA coordinator. Since holding a consensus poll on this idea would only aggravate people, he should just go ahead and do that right now.</p>
<p>That would eliminate all of the grief and exasperation lodged against the other AMA members who appreciate AMA's electoral legacy in WP and think they owe it to the rest of WP to do it right and proper, and not simply ad hoc and devolving into anarchy, with competing Coordinators vying for the role.</p>
<p>You know, the Coordinator as it stands today doesn't have much actual power except in terms of a title and a badge of electoral merit. Having or not having a Coordinator doesn't really affect anyone's ability to advocate. It doesn't prevent anyone from visiting the Requests page or trolling new ArbCom cases or whatever it is you do. The fact that things in AMA got so stagnant after the lack of a Coordinator is really quite unexplainable, considering few people seemed to mind at the time. (I for one was very vocal about the endless IRC meetings for months in lieu of a coordinator election, which among other coincidences led to my decrease in involvement.) What AMA does is explained on the main page, and there are currently no barriers to joining. But clearly, in order for its members to operate, AMA needs a Coordinator, for some reason. And that person will undoubtedly be expected to breathe some sort of life into this motley group, somehow; even though, really, it doesn't require any coordinating; it just requires a willingness to find, and then assist, in disputes.</p>
<p>The AMA, in its role, has the potential to be a number of things beyond just a group of advocates. I'm not saying the AMA needs to have additional roles in its definition. But what I am saying is that, in theory, we have a very good understanding of what the DR process is like for most people, as opposed to those people mired in roles in the mechanics of the process (Arbs/Meds/etc.). But to potentially start such initiatives, we need to make sure we are organized.</p>
<p>Now, someone find please find a third party to handle the receipt and tally of coordinator votes, so we can do this thing, and appease the patience of those unsatisfied with the average speed of communication in WP.</p>

<dd>Sam, I don't want to hear your anti-everything rants right now. This is the method that has been agreed upon and it will be followed. You can be productive and try to help it along, or you can say nothing. And I assure you a period of silence from you now would be <i>most</i> welcome. I am doing my best, and I would like to do it with you instead of despite you.

That conversation does not entail someone saying "leave it alone, you are new." Provide some sort of reason why the old list - which was filled with people that cannot, have not, and will not advocate at any point is better than the new list, which puts people who are willing, ready and able to help at the top and people who are none of the above at the bottom. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 21:15, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
