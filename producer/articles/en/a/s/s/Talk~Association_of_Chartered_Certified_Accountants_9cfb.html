<p>Fellow members of ACCA are still known as <i>Chartered Certified Accountant</i>, there is no such title as <i>Fellow Chartered Certified Accountant</i>. Psnae 13:24, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have asked ACCA regarding the details of membership title, they told me that the title of "ACCA" belongs to the <b>Associate Chartered Certified Accountant</b> or just called <b>Chartered Certified Accountant</b>. And the title of FCCA means <b>Fellow Chartered Certified Accountant</b>. This is general practise which is according to ICAEW and other major accountancy organization worldirde.</p>
<p>Lewislams 1:53, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's true in a sense that FCCA stands for Fellow of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, like ACCA stands for Associate of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants. But the generic designation of <i>Chartered Certified Accountant</i> is the same for both Fellows and Associates. Psnae 03:57, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>According to the membership titles of ICAEW and other major accountancy organization worldirde, the <b>ACA</b> means <i>Associate Chartered Accountant</i>, <b>FCA</b> belongs to <i>Fellow Chartered Accountant</i>, and <b>CA</b> means <i>Chartered Accountant</i>, so there is also the general practise that can apply on ACCA's membership title. Moreover, according to the reply by ACCA, ACCA membership titles are truely meaining that: The title of <b>ACCA</b> belongs to the <b>Associate Chartered Certified Accountant</b> or just called <b>Chartered Certified Accountant</b>. And the title of <b>FCCA</b> means <b>Fellow Chartered Certified Accountant</b>. Lewislams 15:28, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry, but this is not correct. From the <a href="http://rulebook.accaglobal.com" class="external text" title="http://rulebook.accaglobal.com" rel="nofollow">ACCA Rulebook</a>, in section 2(c) of the Bye-laws (Second Schedule to the Royal Charter) it makes it clear that the designation is the same for Fellows and Associates: <i>"Every member may denote his membership of the Association by the use of the professional designations Chartered Certified Accountant or Certified Accountant and/or the designatory letters FCCA in the case of Fellows and ACCA in the case of Members."</i></p>
<p>and an extract from the Members Regulations: <i>"A member who was admitted to membership on or after 1 January 2005 and has been a Member of the Association for a continuous period of five years shall automatically advance to fellowship, and be a Fellow, of the Association and may denote his fellowship of the Association by the use of the professional designation Chartered Certified Accountant or Certified Accountant and/or the designatory letters FCCA"</i> Psnae 03:22, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>NZICA unilaterally terminated mutual recognition with ACCA. What replaced this is not "mutual recogition" but at best a limited form of advanced standing. Effectively, ACCA is no longer recognised in New Zealand. Psnae 20:03, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>But ACCA qualification is still recognised in New Zealand legislation for registration to perform statutory audit work. ACCA is gazetted under the relevant act (Under Section 199 of the Companies Act 1993: Qualifications of Auditors) in New Zealand. An ACCA member can practice as long as they hold an ACCA public practice certificate (with audit qualification) in their country of origin. In effective, ACCA is still recognised in New Zealand.</p>
<p>FrankL906 2:41, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>But not recognised by NZICA, which is most important. Even with practising rights, an ACCA member trying to practice in NZ without NZICA membership is at a serious professional disadvantage. Same goes for those seeking employment, most NZ employers (other than the largest ones) won't know much about non-NZ or Australian designations. However I accept that the term is too strong, so will change to no longer <b>fully</b> recognised in New Zealand. Psnae 03:52, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, ACCA members can legally open the accountancy firm to provide the practising services and legally sign the audit reports in New Zealand, so you <b>can't say</b> ACCA is no longer fully recognised. We should say ACCA is <b>statutory recognised</b> in New Zealand but ACCA is not <b>fully</b> recognised by NZICA. FrankL906 14:41, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A separate article entitled Chartered Certified Accountant has been recently created. As Chartered Certified Accountant is the title of a member of the ACCA (and only of the ACCA) there is very little, if any, material that could be applicable to one article and not the other. <a href="../../../t/h/j/User%7ETHJames_7f86.html" title="User:THJames">THJames</a> 20:53, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>OBJECTION for proposed merger&#160;: Chartered Certified Accountant</p>
<p>According to the <b>general practises</b> of Wikipedia, there are <b>many seperated articles</b> between the professional organizations and their own qualifications, such as <a href="../../../c/f/a/CFA_Institute_6136.html" title="CFA Institute">CFA Institute</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chartered_Financial_Analyst_6049.html" title="Chartered Financial Analyst">Chartered Financial Analyst</a> (CFA) qualification, or <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_of_Management_Accountants_c941.html" title="Institute of Management Accountants">Institute of Management Accountants</a> (IMA) and <a href="../../../c/e/r/Certified_Management_Accountant_23f7.html" title="Certified Management Accountant">Certified Management Accountant</a> (CMA) qualification.</p>
<p>Moreover, Chartered Certified Accountant is one of specific and popular accountant title in this world and also belongs to one of common name of accountancy firm (Chartered Certified Accountant Firm or CCA Firm) in United Kingdom and some commonwealth countries, such as CPA firm in United States. So it is <b>benefit to reserve</b> the article regarding Chartered Certified Accountant.</p>
<p>Lewislams 1:53, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The difference is that <i>Chartered Certified Accountant</i> is awarded <b>only</b> by ACCA, so it's pointless to have two articles describing what is essentially the same thing. The article <i>Chartered Certified Accountant</i> should redirect to ACCA. <a href="../../../c/e/r/Certified_Management_Accountant_23f7.html" title="Certified Management Accountant">Certified Management Accountant</a> is a generic title given by different accounting bodies, so merits a (brief) article of its own explaining this. The same applies to the two CFA articles, they should also merge. Psnae 03:55, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>So how about <a href="../../../c/f/a/CFA_Institute_6136.html" title="CFA Institute">CFA Institute</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chartered_Financial_Analyst_6049.html" title="Chartered Financial Analyst">Chartered Financial Analyst</a>? Actually, I think there is no matter to seperate these two articles in Wikipedia. FrankL906 14:50, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yup. The article <i>Chartered Certified Accountant</i> belongs to one of specific statutory accountancy qualification in United Kingdom and some commonwealth countries, but the article "ACCA" belongs to the whole association of ACCA. Therefore, it is <b>benefit to reserve</b> the article regarding <i>Chartered Certified Accountant</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Lewislams 15:11, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Moreover, the articles <a href="../../../c/e/r/Certified_General_Accountant_4a44.html" title="Certified General Accountant">Certified General Accountant</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/r/Certified_General_Accountants_Association_of_Canada_b8ce.html" title="Certified General Accountants Association of Canada">Certified General Accountants Association of Canada</a> (CGA-Canada) also are seperated, accompany with the case of <a href="../../../c/f/a/CFA_Institute_6136.html" title="CFA Institute">CFA Institute</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chartered_Financial_Analyst_6049.html" title="Chartered Financial Analyst">Chartered Financial Analyst</a>, so they point out that seperated articles between the professional organizations and their own qualifications that is the <b>general practises</b> of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Lewislams 15:19, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually, it is <b>NOT</b> a good proposal to merge the association and the specific qualification to be one. As you know, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chartered_Certified_Accountant_c647.html" title="Chartered Certified Accountant">Chartered Certified Accountant</a> is just one of qualification offered by <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_of_Chartered_Certified_Accountants_2417.html" title="Association of Chartered Certified Accountants">ACCA</a>, anothers are Certified Accounting Technician, Diploma in Financial Management (DipFM), Diploma in International Financial Reporting...etc. However, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chartered_Certified_Accountant_c647.html" title="Chartered Certified Accountant">Chartered Certified Accountant</a> is the statutory accountancy qualification in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, all <a href="../../../e/u/_/EU_f2e6.html" title="EU">EU</a> countries, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>(For auditing government institutions), <a href="../../../z/i/m/Zimbabwe.html" title="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>, and some commonwealth countries, it is the specific object(qualification) that is different to the whole association of ACCA. Therefore, reserving the specific article for <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chartered_Certified_Accountant_c647.html" title="Chartered Certified Accountant">Chartered Certified Accountant</a> is benefit to all readers in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>As same with chartered accountant, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chartered_Certified_Accountant_c647.html" title="Chartered Certified Accountant">Chartered Certified Accountant</a> is the term protected by statutory laws in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and some commonwealth countries. Therefore, it is the specific meaningness to reserve the article of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chartered_Certified_Accountant_c647.html" title="Chartered Certified Accountant">Chartered Certified Accountant</a> for this purpose.</p>
<p><small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 219.76.157.19 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_219.76.157.19_2103.html" title="Special:Contributions/219.76.157.19">contribs</a>) .</small>,</p>
<p>If the article <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chartered_Certified_Accountant_c647.html" title="Chartered Certified Accountant">Chartered Certified Accountant</a> is to be retained, it needs to be purged of a lot of duplicate information. Otherwise it looks too much like "ACCA promotion" which is not the role of Wikipedia. Psnae 20:39, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>OBJECTION too</p>
<p>I also think it is <b>benefit to reserve</b> the specific page of Chartered Certified Accountant in Wikipedia, coz Chartered Certified Accountant is one of specific accountancy qualification which is seperate to the whole association of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_of_Chartered_Certified_Accountants_2417.html" title="Association of Chartered Certified Accountants">ACCA</a>, and also seperating the articles between professional organizations and their own specific qualifications that is normal practice in Wikipedia, so I object the proposed merger too.</p>
<p>FrankL906 2:30, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If we are to maintain the separate articles I should like to understand what material could possibly be in one article and not the other. Currently the article "Chartered Certified Accountant" contains only duplicate but slightly reworded material from the other article. I agree that the creation of two articles appears only to be an attempt to gain duplicate space to put forward promotional material. Please could the objector(s) clarify what material would appear in one article only?</p>

<p>The major duplicated parts between two articles have been deleted, so the problem has been solved.</p>

<p><br />
The CCA article in fact only contains material that is duplicated in full in the ACCA article - royal charter, mutual recognition, POV that this is equivalent level qualification etc, albeit with slight changes to the wording.</p>
<p>Merger tags should not be removed until consensus has been reached. I have a suspicion (from the distinctive style of the contributors) that the opposition and deemed resolution to the merger proposal are in fact from the person who created the article , not other Wikipedians.</p>

<p>Many of the wordings and the sentences in CCA are based on different articles including <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_qualified_accountants.html" title="British qualified accountants">British qualified accountants</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_of_Chartered_Certified_Accountants_2417.html" title="Association of Chartered Certified Accountants">ACCA</a> and <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accountancy.html" title="Accountancy">Accountancy</a>. It just has grouped some meanings regarding CCA qualification from those articles only, so it can help a lot to many readers whose have interests and would like to get the full views on this Chartered Certified Accountant qualification only.</p>
<p><small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 203.198.1.7 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.198.1.7_dcb9.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.198.1.7">contribs</a>) .</small>,</p>
<p>The article of Chartered Certified Accountant is quite concise to recount what's the meaning of the Chartered Certified Accountant qualification, so many people can easily and quickly get the meaning of CCA qualification when they just want to know more on this qualification only. As you know, there are 110000 ACCA holders with 260000 ACCA students, so the influential impact of this Chartered Certified Accountant qualification is quite strong and popular in this current accountancy world. Therefore, many people from anywhere of this world especially US guys that would like to know what is ACCA and her accountancy qualification - Chartered Certified Accountant too.</p>
<p><br />
Well, I think the seperated articles of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_of_Chartered_Certified_Accountants_2417.html" title="Association of Chartered Certified Accountants">ACCA</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chartered_Certified_Accountant_c647.html" title="Chartered Certified Accountant">Chartered Certified Accountant</a> would be better because they are the descriptions of different objects. Also, Chartered Certified Accountant is one of statutory title of accountancy in my country, I think it is better to reserve the page of Chartered Certified Accountant in my point of view.</p>

<p><b>Against.</b> The Association and the credential are different and the Association oversees other programs beyond the CCA program. The Association of CCA also engages in advocacy, continuing professional education and research, so there are separate articles for a reason.</p>
<p><b>Against.</b> The Association and the Professional are different things. I'm starting to work on the topic on French wikipedia and will need to create two different links. --<a href="../../../d/i/l/User%7EDiligent_e67e.html" title="User:Diligent">Diligent</a> 09:27, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>British Overseas Territories do not necessarily operate on UK regulations, so it is not true to suggest ACCA is recognised there without supporting evidence. And recognition of any kind in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bermuda.html" title="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> is highly questionable as the <a href="http://www.icab.bm" class="external text" title="http://www.icab.bm" rel="nofollow">Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bermuda</a> is part of the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Institute_of_Chartered_Accountants_8655.html" title="Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants">Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants</a>.

<p>Well, I just can confirm to all that ACCA is statutory recognized in Cayman Island and British Virgin Island subject to the law of both places. About Bermuda, Psnae is right, the accountancy professional is under the regulations of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Institute_of_Chartered_Accountants_8655.html" title="Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants">Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants</a>. However, according to the free trade regulations between UK and her overseas territories, all members of UK RQB bodies (ACCA, ICAEW, ICAS, ICAI &amp; AIA) would have the practising rights in those places including Bermuda.</p>

<p>I note that there is no registered user with the above account, nor is the above time correct; the history page shows this to be an unsigned comment by 218.103.194.50 at 18.44 UTC 1 September. I would assume again (from the distinctive style and contribution of the user) that this identity is yet another <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">sock puppet</a> of Lewislams, who wrote the original section on which the comments have been made.</p>

<p>There are no "free trade regulations between UK and her overseas territories". Please cite your facts if you want to be taken seriously. Psnae 03:13, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
