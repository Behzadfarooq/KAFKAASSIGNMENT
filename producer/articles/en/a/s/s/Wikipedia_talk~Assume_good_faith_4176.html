<p>This is my proposed expansion of the policy:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Equally important as assuming good faith is to <b>assume high intelligence</b>. Although we may not know many of the other people who edit Wikipedia articles alongside us, it is likely that they have a curiosity about life that derives from high cognitive ability.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When examining other people's edits, it is important not only to check facts diligently to ensure we do not introduce factual inaccuracies into debates and articles, but also to remember that our fellow contributors sometimes make mistakes in spite of "knowing it, really", and that it is possible that they are aware of the mistakes they've made, but were not able to correct them before somebody else did. This can be due to any number of reasons, including slow connections, network failure, computer failure, inefficient peripheral devices, and sudden demands of our real life environments.</dd>

<p>It is my opinion that this should never have been a policy, only a guideline. Let me explain why. The first point would be that what does and doesn't constitute good faith is hugely open to interpretation. Nowadays, most criticism of anything seems to firstly be countered with a reference to this policy, which invariably stalls constructive discussions. "You're not letting me get away with whatever changes I want to make, therefore you are assuming bad faith and I win because you violated policy."</p>
<p>Secondly, this policy is completely unenforceable. All it does is it makes people express whatever bad faith they have in more nefarious and less detectable ways. My objection to this policy is currently the deepest resentment I have to any part of Wikipedia, and I hope that this can be addressed, because apparently the disclaimer, <i>This policy does not require that editors continue to assume good faith in the presence of evidence to the contrary</i>, is being ignored by the vast majority of people.</p>
<p>I come from an academic background where discussion is encouraged, and anything that concerns the matter at hand can be said in whatever mode most suits the speaker and will be answered in whatever mode most suits the respondent (with usually some consideration given to the need to speak in terms that the questioner can understand). In fact, it is understood as a challenge to always bring forward the heaviest criticism one can come up with. It has always been my understanding that Wikipedia aspires to this academic mode of discussion to resolve disputes, and that at the heart of Wikipedia, there is a belief that questions can be answered with a combination of intellect (aka common sense) and use of outside sources. However, a lot of people on Wikipedia are already having trouble distinguishing even between harsh criticism ("that's a stupid thing to do") and personal attacks ("you are an asshole"), so in combination with <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> (why are there two of these, by the way?), this policy is an absolute recipe for disaster. I would hope that we can come to some fruitful discourse on what can be done to resolve the current situation. My proposal is to relegate WP:AGF to a guideline, which in my opinion is really what it is, and ever can be. It's not enforceable as a policy because it's not yet possible (and God help us!) to screw with somebody's neurons to change some basic belief they hold about another person. Note that this is in contrast with other policies, which can be enforced by editing and deleting pages, and executing protections and blocks. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a>&#160;<small>•</small>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 16:07, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think it makes too much practical difference whether this is a guideline or a policy. Call it a principle, if you will. I do prefer "guideline" myself (and argued in favor of that designation somewhere in the murky history of the page...) because it will provide less expectation that there is some bright-line rule about when one is violating it, which there isn't and can't be. Doesn't matter. Yes, it is completely unenforceable; you cannot know someone's intentions. Which is why it exists. Assume good faith because you can't know otherwise -- and act against unacceptable behavior. (If someone's bad faith is not producing bad effects, we don't care. If it is, we do, however small they may be.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do not think the principle, as it is, is a recipe for disaster. I think it is necessary. It does <i>not</i> mean we must assume everyone's actual actions are good, just that in our approach to correcting them we err on the side of charitable interpretations. Some of the worst POV-pushers on the wiki are doing so in completely sincere, good-faith conviction that they are spreading The Truth. They still have to be banned.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>—yes, NPA is a subset, but sometimes the more frequent violations need a page of their own to beat it into people's heads that yes, this really is part of it, stop it right now, that means you. A bit of redundancy to combat obnoxious ruleslawyering isn't too bad.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do agree that genuine criticism is often but should not be mistaken for incivility—but I don't think this page itself is at all inconsistent with that. Oh, and anyone who waves this policy/guideline/principle/whatever around insincerely to try to get out of being called out on bad behavior should be severely beaten with a large, knotty cluestick. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Kat Walsh</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill your mind?)</a> 17:41, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You know, Samsara, you have a couple of other 'projects' up that I'm skeptical about, but this is the most sensible thing I've seen all day (maybe that means I haven't had a very sensible day). I usually think the spirit of this page would be better titled something like <i>Don't make unwarranted assumptions about other users' motivations</i>, but that just doesn't have the same ring to it. At any rate, even though it has no practical significance what tag sits at the top of the page, labeling a page dedicated to thoughts and motivations as 'policy' has unfortunate effects, particularly when combined with the fact that a small fraction of those who quote it have actually read it. Quoting this as 'policy' and pointing fingers at those 'violate' it just tends to derail discussion of content into discussion of what one person might or might not have been thinking about another person's thoughts. This is of course totally nonproductive, and undecidable in any case. Knocking some of these people on the head with the cluestick tends to produce more whining - well, now you're assuming that their accusation of assuming bad faith was made in bad faith, which isn't assuming good faith, is it? <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 02:26, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would also support changing this from policy to guideline. <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANDAL_b36a.html" title="WP:VANDAL">WP:VANDAL</a> suffice enough to be policy, but however how often can <b>obviously</b> suspicious edits be considered as good faith and you be considered as having bad faith for seeing them as inappropriate (even the bolded sentence in one of the paragraphs mention that this should not stop one of doing so). So based on these circumstances calling this a guideline would be more accurate.<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_d57f.html" title="User:Persian Poet Gal"><font face="comic sans ms"><font color="purple"><i><b>¤~Persian Poet Gal</b></i></font></font></a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_f352.html" title="User talk:Persian Poet Gal"><font color="purple"><sup>(talk)</sup></font></a> 04:26, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Centrx has gone ahead and make the change back to guideline with the reasoning that you can't force people to assume good faith. I agree and support the change.

<dd>I think the downgrading of this needs more discussion than this. Abandoning an implicit assumption of good faith as policy implies that the community can now do what it wants, as long as they are civil in their actions. This no longer protects new users, as they rely on people assuming good faith. Although there is a small difference between policy and guideline, there must be a reason for someone to say this is not important enough to be promoted by all users, as opposed to "something some users think is a good idea". Unless there is a solid reason why new users should <i>not</i> have an implicit not-guilty tag attached to them I see no reason why the not-guilty assumption should be changed to guilty through this change. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 22:40, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's not abandoning it, it just changes the class of this page. You cannot impose opinions on editors ('You must assume good faith'), and Assume good faith is a subset of civility, which covers more cases and is more in line with the role of a "policy". —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 23:11, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Per well-reasoned arguments above, I would also support a change from policy to guideline. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 22:47, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Persian Poet Gal: You do not have to actually say that all edits are done in good faith. You just have to assume, and not be overly reactionary without other evidence. Part of the definition from <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a> "Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism." assumes that this policy is a hard and fast piece of advice <i>for</i> all editors <i>supported</i> by all editors. By downgrading this to guideline we can no longer use the current definition of vandalism, as policy should not rely on a guideline for its basic definition, as that would seem to show that not all users think the current definition of vandalism is okay.</dd>

<dd>Not calling people stupid is fine (and belongs at <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> if not already obvious there), but that is different from actually supposing that someone has high intelligence. One of the reasons for assuming good faith is exactly because the other person may very well be mistaken, or not understand Wikipedia, or simply be stupid but good-hearted. That is not the same as assuming something that is plainly false in many cases, or making wild assumptions about the "high cognitive ability" of an editor who is on Wikipedia because they have a "curiosity about life".

<dd>The point is that there are welcome contributors who do not have high intelligence. With good-faith at least, either someone is acting in good-faith at least generally, or they should not be allowed to continue that way on Wikipedia. After we do not "continue to assume good faith in the presence of evidence to the contrary", the user gets a warning to stop. After we do not continue to assume high intelligence in the presence of evidence to the contrary, nothing whatsoever changes; we would still be giving the exact same answers to a question as before, we would still be making the exact same edits to that person's revisions as before.

<dd>Which is why I suggested getting rid of the "high" portion of "assume high intelligence" and making it "assume intelligence". Assuming high intelligence may give Wikipedia the appearance of snobbishness or elitism and discourage people from editing here. It may also decrease the amount of tolerance someone has for honest mistakes. However, by assuming that they have modicum of intelligence it extends AGF beyond the person's intentions and extends that good faith to the content of their edits, while leaving room for mistakes. I've noticed on certain pages that even if editors are assuming good faith about the actions of the other editors, they are discrediting the edits because of a lack of respect for the content they are adding. Too often content is removed because it is "nonsense", "useless", etc. but there is a lack of explanation beyond those statements in the edit summaries or if there is an explanation, it is done in a manner that disrespects the content and that disrespect tends to starts the discussion of the content off on the wrong foot. By assuming the other editors have some intelligence the content discussion is done in a more intellectual manner, which tends to make the discussion less personal and more about finding out why the content should be in the article or not. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblehead_bff2.html" title="User:Bobblehead">Bobblehead</a> 08:40, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I already explained myself in the section above. Now I suggest let's move on, please, back to the real issue, which is that without a clear new consensus, the policy guideline has been changed to include an assumption of competence on the part of WP users. That was never intended to be part of the principle until now. As to the matter of using three revs today, on a matter this important I'm entitled to my 3, and if you argue differently, sue me or file an RFC. My preference would be to move right onto the substantive discussion, and consensus the issue among the many editors who may have missed out on this little discussion here.

<dd>Seems to me Kenosis was intelligently using his allotted three reverts in good faith. As for common sense, seems to me common sense would indicate that since the average American has an IQ between 95 and 110 (just like the rest of the world), assuming "high intelligence" (IQ 130 or higher?) would be to live in a fantasy world. Given that Wikipedia has no entrance exam and is open to anyone with access to a computer and the ability to string letters together to form words and sentences assuming that only the top 3% of the populace contribute to Wiki would be an ableptic excercise.</dd>
<dd>Now, if we remove the word "high", what does that buy us?

<dd>RE "We have already agreed to drop the word higher." WHO IS "WE"? This is a lobbying effort by Samsara to <i>change</i> the parameters of WP:AGF. It has met with substantially more disapproval than approval, when the opposite would be required to justly implement it. And at least one user has pointed out that a different procedure would be needed (announcing the intentions to the larger community and getting broader feedback on the proposal) in order to properly implement such a change . AGF has nothing to do with presumed intelligence or any other kind of competence--period. It has only to do with assuming good intentions. ... <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 04:53, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I certainly would not assume, merely on the basis of edits or commentary, that someone is lacking in in intelligence, but I think to assume <i>high intelligence</i> as in <i>exceptional human intelligence</i> overstates the case, and may be unduely optimistic. And to a certain degree it might be argued that intelligence should be less of an issue than the ability to read and write and to think critically and dispassionately and the quality of being informed as to the facts pertaining to the subject of an article. Possibly, this phrase might be better rendered <i>assume a reasonable degree of intelligence</i> or other moderate words to this effect. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptonymius_12d0.html" title="User:Cryptonymius">Cryptonymius</a> 15:53, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Here is a brief summary of the problems I see with this newly added addendum to WP:AGF, recently advocated by User:Samsara, which currently reads as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Equally important as assuming good faith is to <b>assume high intelligence</b>. Although we may not know many of the other people who edit Wikipedia articles alongside us, it is likely that they have a curiosity about life that derives from high cognitive ability. Therefore, when you approach people, a typical phrase you may wish to use is, <i>"you may already be aware of this, but [...]"</i>."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>(1)</b>This newly inserted attempt to include a supplementary policy guideline for WP users to "assume high intelligence" has absolutely <i>nothing</i> legitimately to do with assuming "good faith". Good faith has to do with assumptions of others’ intentions, not about their competence. WP:AGF places upon us an expectation to assume good faith intent to help the Wikipedia project, and to continue to assume good faith unless and until there is substantial evidence of motives not consistent with good faith that can be clearly demonstrated to other participating editors. The issue in assuming good faith is <i>not</i> whether someone else is assumed to be smart or not-so-smart, but rather has only to do with assuming that others’ intentions are good and not malicious. To the extent that we follow the policy guideline, assuming good faith guides us to avoid making hasty negative assumptions about others' intent, particularly when we get into disagreements about article content or manner of personal interaction. And WP:AGF is no way whatsoever anticipates that we need make any standardized judgments about others' cognitive abilities or skills in order to support our assumptions of good faith. To the contrary, making assumptions about others' level of intelligence would appear to increase the likelihood of arriving at a hasty judgment in the context of disagreement, to the effect that someone else, assumed to be very intelligent, obviously must be being obtuse or fraudulent.</li>
<li><b>(2)</b>Worse, this debate in the talk section(s) just above has gotten lost around the periphery of the issue and has wandered into whether one should assume "high intelligence", or merely "intelligence" or some other level of innate ability, when in fact assuming good faith has absolutely nothing to do with assumptions about others' innate ability or any other speculative assessment of other users' competence.</li>
<li><b>(3)</b>Irrespective of whether such a concept may be legitimately attached to assumptions of good faith, <i>any</i> official policy guideline insisting that users assume that other users have a pre-specified competence level of any kind is completely opposed to the foundational concepts of Wikipedia, which make no demands for a given level of competence in order to participate in WP. If the agenda here is to get Wikipedia users to assume competence of some particular kind, there should be a completely <i>separate</i> proposal arguing for a <i>new</i> project-page guideline specifying what those assumptions should be (e.g. WP:Assume high intelligence).</li>
<li><b>(4)</b>The proposed addition of "assume high intelligence" to the <a href="../../../a/s/s/WP%7EAssume_good_faith_cd17.html" title="WP:Assume good faith">WP:Assume good faith</a> policy guideline also makes several additional flawed assumptions.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A) The assertion that "to assume good intelligence" is <i>"equally important as assuming good faith"</i> is an unconsensused judgment formulated by User:Samsara, and not a reflection of consensused Wiki-wide priorities. Even assuming that an expectation for WP users to hold assumptions about others' intelligence is legitimate at all, on <i>any</i> project page, the issue of its relative importance has not been adequately discussed among WP users.</dd>
<dd>B) the assertion concerning other WP users that <i>"...it is likely that they have a curiosity about life that derives from high cognitive ability"</i> is completely unfounded and speculative. It's a nice compliment, but completely unverified and probably unverifiable. Moreover, it quite arguably is contrary to many editors' personal experiences with other editors across the wiki.</dd>
<dd>C)The statement <i>"[t]herefore, when you approach people, a typical phrase you may wish to use is, "you may already be aware of this, but [...]"</i> is a nice advisory that appears quite relevant to <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a>, but is a <i>non sequitur</i> and does not properly follow either from AGF or from any other assumptions such as about intelligence.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In sum, any principle, expectation, demand, or guideline to assume high intelligence is not properly a part of WP:AGF, and quite arguably should not be a part of <i>any</i> WP project page. ... <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 05:01, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes it is, because as Centrx has amply demonstrated, if somebody does something that looks stupid to you, most people would either assume that the person is being evil or stupid. AGF advises against believing people to be leaving, so very obviously, there is a glaring omission of advising against believing people to be stupid, which, as I have said before, and some have agreed with (Pschemp and Persian Poet Gal), can be just as offensive. AGF is about creating a good atmosphere, not about giving people a guideline that suggests by omission that people who do perceived wrong are stupid. Read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Assume_high_intelligence&amp;oldid=89084728" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Assume_high_intelligence&amp;oldid=89084728" rel="nofollow">this version</a>, which makes everything perfectly clear. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a>&#160;<small>•</small>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 11:32, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>RE "[I]f somebody does something that looks stupid to you ... would either assume that the person is being evil or stupid"&#160;??? If somebody does something stupid where? On the Wikipedia talk pages or in the articles? Stupid to whom? No one's required to make such judgments as are suggested by Samsara's choice between "evil or stupid", unless a situation has gotten to the point where it's headed towards, or already in, a request for mediation, RFC or RFA. And, "evil" is not anywhere near specific enough, and arguably should <i>never</i> be a permissible judgment about another participant in Wikipedia. And in general, people do not <i>do</i> things in Wikipedia, but instead <i>say</i> things, <i>question</i> things, <i>assert</i> things, wonder about things, etc. And, an <i>action</i>, where someone <i>does</i> something such as deletes a whole section or article, inserts random characters or other such guff, etc. may call for a reasoned judgment whether it's likely accidental. If someone <i>does</i> something that doesn't appear likely to be random or accidental, such as inserting in an article the words "Professor X sucks", we're called to make a judgment whether it's a mistake (possibly unfamiliar, inexperienced, perhaps clumsy, or even, as Samsara says, stupid) or whether it's vandalism (malicious), and never whether it's "evil". Other situations, such as suspected spamming, may call for judgments whether it's merely enthusiasm about a preferred website or POV, or whether it has commercial motivations or other self-serving motives. Yet other situations may call for other judgments such as whether a mass copyedit of an article is <i>doing</i> something too broad or too agressive at one time. When people <i>do</i> things such as those I just mentioned, the issue is not, ever, a simple choice between whether the other editor is being "evil or stupid", as Samsara says above. And it's not necessarily a required choice between "stupid" and "not in good faith" either.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The vast majority of circumstances, however, have to do not with what others' <i>do</i> but with what users' say, assert, question, include in an article, state on the talk page, etc. The vast majority of instances can, and should, be dealt with on the basis of the particular conceptual or substantive or procedural issues at hand, be they related to an article's content or to points being discussed on a talk page. In no way does this process require anyone to make a judgment about others' innate abilities in order to make a personal decision whether another user deserves to be assumed to be participating in good faith. The policy guideline WP:AGF directs us to AGF-- period-- unless there is substantial evidence to the contrary which can be articulated and demonstrated to other editors. And <i>even if</i>, in the context of arguing to fellow WP users your grounds upon which you may have ceased to assume good faith on the part of someone else, the possible question comes up as to whether things said or done by that editor are best interpreted as either incompetent or malicious, such a question would be only one of an extremely large number of possibilities and questions that could potentially be involved in the analysis.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Making speculative judgments about others' innate abilities, such as to "assume high intelligence", is completely irrelevant to assuming good faith. This proposal plainly did not have consunsus to begin with, and plainly has substantial opposition on a number or grounds by at least six or seven users thus far, with only marginal support by about three users if I'm counting the views correctly. The paragraph about "assume high intelligence" should be removed promptly upon unlocking of the project page, and not be replaced unless and until there is a clear consensus for its inclusion in the project page. ... <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 16:52, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Concur with Kenosis here - pardon me, but it is idiotic to assume high intelligence, as intelligence varies enormously, and most importantly, assuming intelligence is actually contrary to AGF: someone might be a little slow, which can look malicious, but actually be a good-faith effort on their part.

<p>Regardless of where it belongs, it is a terrible break with WP procedure to introduce a change like this without talking to a larger community, and without having come up with a coherent and defensible explanation of what it means and what the implications and likely side effects are. This is WP policy, whether we call it a guideline or a policy, and it's not the place to be throwing neat ideas in randomly. Please, proponents, once the page is unlocked, yank this in toto and prepare an essay explaining what you mean and why it should be part of WP policy, and where you think it should go, and then float the essay at the Village Pump and wikien-l for feedback. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 06:08, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Proposed extension: <small>Equally important as assuming good faith is to <b>assume <s>high</s> intelligence</b>. <s>Although we may not know many of the other people who edit Wikipedia articles alongside us, it is likely that they have a curiosity about life that derives from high cognitive ability.</s> <u>Therefore, when you approach people, a typical phrase you may wish to use is, <i>"you may already be aware of this, but [...]"</i>.</u><br />
When examining other people's edits, it is important not only to check facts diligently to ensure we do not introduce factual inaccuracies into debates and articles, but also to remember that our fellow contributors sometimes make mistakes in spite of "knowing it, really", and that it is possible that they are aware of the mistakes they've made, but were not able to correct them before somebody else did. This can be due to any number of reasons, including slow connections, network failure, computer failure, inefficient peripheral devices, and sudden demands of our real life environments.</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>Existing rejoinder: <small>Assuming good faith is about intentions, not actions. Well-meaning people make mistakes, and you should correct them when they do. You should not act like their mistake was deliberate. Correct, but don't scold. There will be people on Wikipedia with whom you disagree. Even if they're wrong, that doesn't mean they're trying to wreck the project. There will be some people with whom you find it hard to work. That doesn't mean they're trying to wreck the project either. It is never necessary that we attribute an editor's actions to bad faith, even if bad faith seems obvious, as all our countermeasures (i.e. reverting, blocking) can be performed on the basis of behavior rather than intent.</small></dd>

<p>The bits that are clearly rejected by the current talk page participants are stricken out above, the bits that have been tentativly rejected are underlined. We're pretty much left with an extention of the existing third paragraph, copied below the proposed extension. I think that the action is over here, that the page can be unprotected and that we can agree that "Equally important as assuming good faith is to assume intelligence" has no consensus at this time.

<dd>Intelligence implies that you are going to discuss with someone in a rational manner. If you assume that you are better than someone you are not as likely to discuss things as rationally. it is equally important as it is more than just assuming someone made an edit without wanting to harm either the encyclopedia or their fellow editors. It adds IMO an element of respect above a simple initial good faith condition.</dd>
<dd>Ignoring the semantic difference between guideline and policy for the moment, it is important as a way of improving the applicability of the whole idea. Although there are those who think that this idea is outdated and somewhat less than what they expect of a policy (whatever that is), the encyclopedia was not created with the goal to gain a fellowship of editors to lord their status over others. Heck, you could say the goal was to humbly respect the efforts of others and get a true representation of human knowledge. A simple civil society does not contain any elements of humility. You can rip an editor to shreds without violating either "civility" or "no personal attacks". The applicability of this addition, although it may not have been in the original, is significant in this respect I think. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 08:55, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is also a completely different concept than AGF's original intent, and deserves to stand (or fall) on its own as a separate policy proposal. It's just not right to go around tacking other possible but not consensus good ideas onto major WP policy documents. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 10:32, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>
<p><i>All</i> of the proposed material is irrelevant to WP:AGF-- completely irrelevant. Even "assume reasonable intelligence" or some such approach would be irrelevant. Even a statement such as "assume rationality" quickly finds numerous exceptions where an edit or a discussion is neither intelligent nor rational, but we're still called to assume good faith unless there's clearly demonstrable evidence to the contrary. However, since the project page already has a paragraph which serves as a brief 'advice column', I would support the inclusion of an additional statement or two about how one might wish to communicate the assumption of good faith. The example of saying "you may already be aware of this, but [...]" is one of many that could be used as examples of how to communicate one's assumption of good faith (even though this is more in the realm of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a>). Possibly even a note of advice about attempting to demonstrate some degree of <i>patience</i> with other users might conceivably help editors' demonstrate their assumption of good faith.</p>

<p>But any dictum for assuming intelligence, aptitude, competence, or any other type of ability, experience or skill, is not among the necessary conditions for assuming good faith, and should be rejected with respect to this project page. ... <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 16:58, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is reasonable; I've removed that section, as it clearly does not have consensus. While I suspect the aim was to provide a nice way of adding an asterisk to the basic policy that says "and don't assume everyone is a blithering idiot, either", the wording left something to be desired.</dd>

<p>I've noticed a lot of interactions here in which one editor throws an <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">AGF</a> link at another as part of a response to some point in a dispute. The effect of this is often an escalation of ill will, and a further wandering from the constructive point at hand, because they end up arguing over whether one person was assuming good faith, and whether the other was assuming the assumption of good faith...</p>
<p>I would suggest, and maybe someone can figure out a way to include this in the guideline, that the correct response to a "failure to AGF" is not to accuse them of failing to AGF, but to <i>explain your intentions</i>, and show that you're working for the best of Wikipedia be refocusing the discussion on that, and not on who may have violated which civility-related policy.</p>

<dd>I think this suggestion by GTBacchus is simply brilliant. I also believe that AGF should be a Policy, not a guideline.

<dd>That a page is tagged as a guideline is not because of "shortcomings", it indicates how the page fits into the policy framework.

Instead Tom should put "please refer to (policy)...where it says 'blah, blah, blah'" so that everyone (Mary included) can understand what Tom believes is the relevant portion of the quoted page. Often there are conflicting phrases/clauses on the same page or based on a particular interpretation a conflicting policy, but nothing productive can occur with just the link. Mary will read the link, find the part that supports her and ask Tom for more detail...which generally is ignored.

However, without such an exception, even the use of the word "<a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7Evandal_0d77.html" title="WP:vandal">vandal</a>" (the very definition of which includes malice) would have to be prohibited - people may vandalise (perform bad <i>actions</i>), but that doesn't allow us to call them vandals (thus assuming bad <i>faith</i>). I'm sorry, but I think this is absurd hair-splitting. An impracticable rule is worse than no rule at all. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous44_ccf4.html" title="User:Anonymous44">Anonymous44</a> 15:44, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../a/a/g/WP%7EAAGF_5ca1.html" title="WP:AAGF">WP:AAGF</a> used to be an essay (officially, it still is), and for good reasons, IMO. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith&amp;diff=50554113&amp;oldid=50290495" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith&amp;diff=50554113&amp;oldid=50290495" rel="nofollow">This</a> edit, which apparently passed without substantial discussion, suddenly turned it into part of the policy/guideline itself. I think this is wrong, not because I am in favour of citing AGF groundlessly (personally, I never envoke it in discussions), but simply because it does not make sense logically - and this does not inspire any respect for WP policies/guidelines. The reason is simple: failing to assume good faith in someone else is not the same as acting in bad faith oneself - thus, accusing someone of violating AGF is not the same as accusing him of bad faith - thus, accusing someone of violating AGF does not violate AGF. Accusing wrongfully of AGF violation may be a very wrong thing to do, but AGF is not the policy to deal with it. The fallacy of the AAGF essay is, IMO, simply that someone equated "not assuming good faith" with "making <i>any</i> sort of accusations", and figured that envoking AGF is an accusation, too. Of course, the underlying identification of any accusation with an AGF violation here is wrong. Once again, my major concern is not the actual application of the rule; it is the fact that people reading WP policies and guidelines expect to read something that has been well thought over, and will have less respect for them if they find something illogical or impracticable there. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous44_ccf4.html" title="User:Anonymous44">Anonymous44</a> 15:34, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Accusing the other side in a conflict of not assuming good faith, without showing reasonable supporting evidence, is another form of failing to assume good faith."</dd>
<dd>If someone insists on re-including it, it ought to be re-worded to something like "Accusing the other side in a conflict of not assuming good faith, without showing reasonable supporting evidence, is strongly discouraged."

<dd>I think you've got two concepts mixed up here. This guideline concerns itself with assuming another party's intentions are evil.

<p>OK, I'll try to clarify it.</p>
<p>The disputed sentence says the following: if you say (without sufficient reasons): "User X violates AGF", then you are violating AGF.</p>
<p>However, this is another way of saying that if you assume that user X assumes bad faith, then you are assuming bad faith.</p>
<p>And this is another way of saying that assuming bad faith (as user X supposedly does) is a form of acting in bad faith.</p>
<p>But that's not true, is it? User X may have perfectly good intentions, and yet make the mistake of being too suspicious towards others. I notice someone pointed out more or less the same before, without realising that he is already contradicting the new text of the policy. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Assume_good_faith&amp;diff=59254339&amp;oldid=59254197" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Assume_good_faith&amp;diff=59254339&amp;oldid=59254197" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>Here is a table of sorts, starting from the statement in the present text and reaching the implication that I'm sure no one of us would agree with:</p>
<p>1. assuming <b>non-assumption of good faith</b> = violating "assume good faith"</p>
<p>2. assuming <b>non-assumption of good faith</b> = assuming <b>bad faith</b></p>
<p>3. <b>non-assumption of good faith</b> = <b>bad faith</b></p>

<dd>Okay, I can see the paradox. I think that since this isn't a policy any more, it may be okay to drop that sentence. You've got to appreciate, though, that the phrase was added at a time when every vandal and edit warrer would come to ANI and complain that bad faith had been assumed against them. So that phrase was presumably added at that time - in good faith - in order to curb such a waste of everybody's resources. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 18:53, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm very glad it's all cleared up, I really hate conflicts. :) Sure I understand why people felt that something like that was necessary; and indeed I think the sentence can be preserved in a form that achieves the same effect without being paradoxical, something like "<b>Editors should avoid</b> accusing the other side in a conflict of assuming bad faith without showing reasonable supporting evidence." I guess that's the edit I should have made in the first place, but I couldn't think of a good wording. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous44_ccf4.html" title="User:Anonymous44">Anonymous44</a> 19:10, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A procedure of "verifying credentials" is not part of normal wikipedian practice, and I think it has better stay that way. Credentials are really peripheral to the whole project; it works on the basis of wiki policies and (in particular) on citing sources, not on expertise. The fact that one is or claims to be an expert should have no consequences for the way one's edits and arguments are treated. So I don't like this addition, mainly because it seems to suggest that credentials <i>do</i> have a "legal" significance, if they are true. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous44_ccf4.html" title="User:Anonymous44">Anonymous44</a> 20:47, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
