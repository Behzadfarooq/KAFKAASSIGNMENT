<hr />
<p>The state of Assam as of today is a divided place, as a res000ult of influx of non Mongoloid people in to the region from across the border both from India and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The shift towards domination by Indians and Muslims started after the British take over in 1826 and climxed in the 1940's with the Congress party bringing in crores of Bangladeshis in to the region to secure their win in future Parliamentary and State elections.</p>
<p>Assam which was originally a Mongoloid land now is being taken over by Bangladeshis and High Cast Hindu Indians and traders from Rajeshthan.</p>
<p>All this has resulted in alieanation of the indegenous tribal population from the developmental process, giving rise to seperatist movement and inter tribal clashes.</p>

<p>I have put a NPOV tag on this article because the <i>Different Interpretation</i> section seems very pov to me. Example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>This was because the local Assamese people did not have the aptitude for hard work. They lived in a paradise where no work was required to grow their food since the land was so fertile. Therefore they grew lazy and fat and were averse to hard work.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I am not knowledgeable about this topic, so I'll refrain from editing it myself, but maybe someone who is familiar with this can have a look at it and separate facts from opinion. The section also needs some spelling/style revisions, I think. <a href="../../../s/i/e/User%7ESietse_Snel_e2d7.html" title="User:Sietse Snel">Sietse</a> 11:56, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a request to user connecting from 65.38.226.42, 65.38.226.56 and other IP addresses.</p>
<p>The paragraph on <i>assama</i> needs a reference. The paragraph is:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The word “assama” was used during the time while Bhaskarvarman ruled <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamarupa.html" title="Kamarupa">Kamarupa</a>. Then the present upper Assam used to emit poisonous gasses and uninhabitable. To this land, some of the Kamrupi criminals escaped during those days in order to avoid punishment. The Chinese traveler Xuensang wrote about it in his travel note. Those people were also referred “assama” or "asama";, and Xuensang not traveling back to China through this route was because he was worried about getting attacked by “assama” people.“assama” or “asama” in Kamrupi can also mean one who is not compared with.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Please provide the reference in which <i>assama</i> is used in the context of an escaped convict during Bhaskarvarman's time. Is it a <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> or <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assamese.html" title="Assamese">Assamese</a> word? The reference that the Chinese traveller did not travel to China via Assam for fear of these <i>assama</i>s is also needed. There are references of a robust trade between Kamrupa and China at that time, and Bhaskarvarman is said to have mentioned a Chinese song which was popular in Kamrupa at that time (Suniti Kumar Chatterjee). Why would <a href="../../../x/u/a/Xuanzang.html" title="Xuanzang">Xuanzang</a> not take this well travelled trade route if he wanted to get back to China?</p>
<p>The Assamese word for a convict is <i>assami</i> with roots in the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_language.html" title="Persian language">Persian language</a>, according to Assamese dictionaries (Chandra Kanta Abhidhan). The text that mentioned this was deleted. To build up a good page and make it into a <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_Article_2aef.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured Article">featured article</a>, please follow the guidelines given in <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_tutorial_6edc.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV tutorial">Wikipedia:NPOV_tutorial</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_Examples_bee0.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view/Examples">Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view/Examples</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaipau_d3d7.html" title="User:Chaipau">Chaipau</a> 23:08, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Deleting <b>assami</b> was good job because <b>assami</b> and <b>assama</b> are two different words. In <b>assama</b>, /s/ and /s/ forms a conjunct though you may pronounce it as <b>asama</b>.</p>

<dd>Please refrain from deleting or adding stuff to this article. I do not want an edit war on this article. I made this request earlier. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaipau_d3d7.html" title="User:Chaipau">Chaipau</a> 02:10, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You have not replied to the earlier dispute. Instead you have edited added another problematic paragraph.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Anthera Assama was discovered long before the <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yandabu_Accord_33c8.html" title="Yandabu Accord">Yandabu Accord</a>, and <i>assama</i> here implies <i>unequal</i> or <i>not comparable with</i> – <i>assama</i> was chosen as part of the <i>scientific name</i> because the <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silkworm.html" title="Silkworm">silkworm</a> can only live in the climate of foothills of Eastern <a href="../../../h/i/m/Himalayas.html" title="Himalayas">Himalayas</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>First, the sentence is factually not correct. The earliest nomenclature of the Muga silkworm is from <a href="../../../1/8/3/1837.html" title="1837">1837</a> <a href="http://www.funet.fi/pub/sci/bio/life/insecta/lepidoptera/ditrysia/bombycoidea/saturniidae/saturniinae/antheraea/index.html#assamensis" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.funet.fi/pub/sci/bio/life/insecta/lepidoptera/ditrysia/bombycoidea/saturniidae/saturniinae/antheraea/index.html#assamensis" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, more than 10 years after the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Yandaboo_c349.html" title="Treaty of Yandaboo">Treaty of Yandaboo</a>. Second, the date of Yandaboo Treaty is not important because it isn't likely that the British did not have a name for Assam before the treaty was signed. Third, <i>assama</i> is indeed "unequal", but that does not mean the name of Assam comes from <i>assama</i>. Please give reference to your claim that the Muga silkworm is named after the Sanskrit word for unequal because it can survive only in the foothills of the Himalayas (which is also untrue because the Muga silkworm provides a thriving sericulture business today as well as it did in the past in the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmaputra.html" title="Brahmaputra">Brahmaputra</a> valley, which is almost at sea-level).</p>
<p>Kindly refrain from adding anything to the article before this dispute is settled.</p>

<p><b>Reference 1</b> Kamrupi Bhagavad Puran</p>

<p><i>asama</i> or <i>assama</i> – <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamrupi.html" title="Kamrupi">Kamrupi</a> meaning would be <i>weird</i> or <i>not compared with</i>. This word had never been used in <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamrupi.html" title="Kamrupi">Kamrupi</a> scriptures to represent a land, but had been used to represent a <i>specific class of people</i> <b>not caste</b> (see <i>reference 1</i>). These people were not <a href="../../../a/h/o/Ahom.html" title="Ahom">Ahom</a> either but <i>weird/sinner</i> according to the scripture, and anybody claiming them <a href="../../../a/h/o/Ahom.html" title="Ahom">Ahom</a> would do a big mistake demonstrating lake of knowledge.</p>
<dl>

<p>Both Chinese and Japanese write foreign name using their own art. <i>Ja Mo Lo Pho</i> is the mane one will find in original scripture or travel note that is preserved in a shrine in China. The Chinese do not see the same as travel note but see as <i>Holy Scripture</i>.</p>
<p>Even Kamrupi villagers use the word <i>asama/assama</i> for the <i>weird</i> context, also the other <i>not comparable with</i>, as in the <i>reference 1</i> “Kamrupi Bhagavad Puran”. As I stated, no Kamrupi scriptures used this word to represent the land.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The present use of a similar sounding word is irrelevant, since the word "Assam" used to donote the land, kingdom or people is many hundred years old. If you claim this is not the origin of the word Assam, then I do not see how this is relevant at all. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaipau_d3d7.html" title="User:Chaipau">Chaipau</a> 19:58, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Assamese words</i> are misspelled and mispronounced <i>Kamrupi words.</i> Kamrupi is a dieing language while Kamrup is a Lost Kingdom. The modern Assamese language is the dialect of <i>Ahom Kindom.</i> A good and practical name for this dialect should be <i>Ahomese</i>. No Kamrupi scriptures were written in this dialect.</p>

<p>Foothills of Eastern Himalayas – is a big area it goes all the way to present Bangladesh. In fact places like Rangpur/Noihati presently in Bangladesh were in Kamrup.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmaputra.html" title="Brahmaputra">Brahmaputra</a> valley is not almost at sea-level. The valley is very inclined land but <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmaputra.html" title="Brahmaputra">Brahmaputra</a> ends almost at sea-level.</p>
<p><i>Anthera Assama</i> does not live in a climate other than Foothills of Eastern Himalayas, according to a biologist, if not genetically engineered. This fact should be documented somewhere. That is the reasion why it got Sanskrit name in part, i.e., <i>assama</i>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>If it is documented somewhere that the word <i>assama</i> in <i>Antheraea assama</i> is from the Sanskrit word, please provide it here. According to my research, the first use of the Latin name for the Muga silkworm is from <a href="../../../1/8/3/1837.html" title="1837">1837</a> (as <i>Antheraea assamensis</i> Helfer, 1837; J. Asiat. Soc. Bengal, 6: 43). <i>assamensis</i> is latin for "of Assam". Therefore, it is nearly certain that the name is based on the name of the land, not the other way round.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Further, the land of the Ahoms have been called "Assam" long before the Muga silkworm was named. Some of the first accounts of the land came from travellers who travelled with Mir Jhumla during his invasion of Assam in <a href="../../../1/6/6/1663.html" title="1663">1663</a>. Thomas Bowrey writes about Mir Jhumla: "They lost the best of Nabobs, the Kingdome of Acham, and, by consequence, many large priviledges" (Bowrey, Thomas, A Geographical Account of Countries around Bay of Bengal, ed Temple, R. C., Haklyut Society's Publications). Further, an account of Mir Jhumla's expedition can be found in Tavernier's "Travels in India", published in <a href="../../../1/6/7/1676.html" title="1676">1676</a>. He uses the spelling "Assen" for Assam in the French original. The official chronicler of Mir Jhumla too calls the place "Asam" (The Indian Antiquary, July 1887, pp222-226)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Formal contact of between the East India Company and the Ahom kingdom was established in the context of the Moamoria Revolt, and has been documented in "Ango-Assamese Relations 1771-1826" (S. K. Bhuyan). In this account, the British have consistently referred to "Assam" and "Assamese".</dd>

<dd>It is not necessary to find the name in the Buranjis. It is already known that the epithet Asam, from which the modern term Ahom was formed, was given to the Ahom by the indigenous people. Your objection is infructuous. The dominant view among scholars is that the word Assam <i>is</i> associated with the Ahoms. Here is an entry from Satyendra Nath Sarma's <i>Assamese Literature</i>, Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden, 1976.
<blockquote>
<p>While the Shan invaders called themselves Tai, they came to be referred to as <i>Āsām</i>, <i>Āsam</i> and sometimes as <i>Acam</i> by the indigenous people of the country. The modern Assamese word <i>Āhom</i> by which the Tai people are known is derived from <i>Āsām</i> or <i>Āsam</i>. The epithet applied to the Shan conquerors was subsequently transferred to the country over which they ruled and thus the name Kāmarūpa was replaced by Āsām, which ultimately took the Sanskritized form <i>Asama</i>, meaning "unequalled, peerless or uneven" [Banikanta Kakati: <i>Assamese: Its Formation and Development</i>, p2]</p>

<dd>The quote is from the second paragraph of Chapter 1.

<p>Dr Banikanta Kakati was a <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamrupi.html" title="Kamrupi">Kamrupi</a> man by the way. He must have done so in order to hide a resentment as because some <a href="../../../a/h/o/Ahom.html" title="Ahom">Ahom</a> wanted to claim the name of the state as because of there presence in Eastern Assam. But you might read a book by Bisweshwar Hazarika printed sometimes during 1850's (from my memory hole) -- a <a href="../../../a/h/o/Ahom.html" title="Ahom">Ahom</a> man and questioned in that book on <a href="../../../a/s/a/Asama.html" title="Asama">Asama</a> and Asamiya. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurmaa_5c01.html" title="User:Kurmaa">Kurmaa</a> 19:13, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurmaa_5c01.html" title="User:Kurmaa">Kurmaa</a>, welcome to our discussion. I feel it does not serve any purpose to second guess the intentions of scholars. It is best to discuss their contributions on their merits. Kakati may be a Kamrupi; but for us, that is not important. What is important is that he produced work of a very high caliber, which people and scholars have accepted. It is also important to give opposing views/work a space; again, on their merit. I hope we can carry on with this discussion in this spirit and produce an entry on Assam that is highly regarded in the Wikipedia community and useful to serious readers. Setting our pet theories against each other will unfortunately not help us. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaipau_d3d7.html" title="User:Chaipau">Chaipau</a> 15:14, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If Dr Banikanta Kakati has written in his work that "Assam was derived from Ahom" out of fear, than this is is a serious matter! Is it true? A number of scholars had based their works on Dr Kakati's work. If this is true, then all these works are standing on thin air!</li>
<li>Kurma is Kamrupi, I am Jorhatia, he is Nalbaria, she is Barpetia, amuk is Ahom, tamuk is Kachari.... Banikanta Kakati is "Kamrupi", Debakanta Barua is "Kalangparia".... may I ask <i>who is Assamese?</i>.</li>

<b>Hello <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaipau_d3d7.html" title="User:Chaipau">Chaipau</a></b></p>
<p>You would need to realize that the outsiders created lot of names, e.g., India, Hindu, Assam, etc.</p>
<p><b>What am I trying to tell?</b></p>
<p>I am trying to tell that the <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamrupi.html" title="Kamrupi">Kamrupi</a> scriptures have sloka that uses the word <i>asama</i> or <i>assama</i> or <i>asom</i> -- for your information, all three Roman spellings, i.e., <i>asama</i> or <i>assama</i> or <i>asom</i>, have one native spelling in <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamrupi.html" title="Kamrupi">Kamrupi</a> scripts; the word is used for two meanings one <i><b>weird/sinner</b></i> and the other <i><b>not comparable with</b></i>. The <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamrupi.html" title="Kamrupi">Kamrupi</a> speakers still use/speak this word for both meanings, and pronounced Sanskrit in <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamrupi.html" title="Kamrupi">Kamrupi</a>. But present name <i>Asom</i> is not pronounced Sanskrit by <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamrupi.html" title="Kamrupi">Kamrupi</a> speakers.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It might be so, but that is irrelevant in the context of this Wikipedia. Please do not bring in the fruits of your original research here. This is not the place for it (<a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No_original_research</a>). Anyway, this is a theory most likely brought out by people who have racial prejudices against the Ahoms. Because it is impossible that a set of kings who ruled Assam for 600 years would accept a derogatory term to call themselves. The Ahoms did accept this appelation. Moreover I have not come across this in any academic work. Therefore, to keep Wikipedia racially un-prejudiced, this reference should be removed.</dd>

Your references were all in English written by (probably) Bengali-assisted. We should try to find the original writing in order to compare the translation. I am confident to come up with something similar <i><b>sindhu to hindu</b></i> and <i><b>indu to India</b></i>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Your assertion is not correct. I mentioned the Mir Jhumla's chronicler who called the kingdom Asam, which predates the English/French references I have given. Clearly, the English and French picked it up from the Mughals, not the other way around. But there are references in the Assamese Bhagavad, translated by Sankardeva, where he calls the country "Asam Muluk", which is probably the first reference to Assam by that name. This reference is widely quoted in all academic works that I have come across. This is also another instance of how the word Asam could not have been used in the "weird/sinner" context you mention.</dd>

No <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamrupi.html" title="Kamrupi">Kamrupi</a> scriptures called the land <i>Asom/Asama/Assama/Assam/</i> because it was part of <i>Kamrup</i>.

<li>In undivided Kamrup upto Coos Behar one can find those words still spoken but heavily used in yester year scriptures.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The very phenomenal Sanskrit pronunciation usage in order to compose <i>present perfect sentences</i> is still spoken in undivided Kamrup. And this grammar is used to compose at least 90% percent of the sloka in yester year <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamrupi.html" title="Kamrupi">Kamrupi</a> scriptures. This is the grammar one can find both in <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamrupi.html" title="Kamrupi">Kamrupi</a> lokageet as well as Bargeet.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There are sloka in <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamrupi.html" title="Kamrupi">Kamrupi</a> scriptures where scholars wrote explaining why they wrote in Kamrupi although they were good at <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>. So one can find the word <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamrupi.html" title="Kamrupi">Kamrupi</a>, but the word <i>Brajavali nowhere</i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Now, please have a look at the <i>Ramayana</i> hymns composed by Madhavakandali, and then compare the language/grammar with that of <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sankaradeva.html" title="Sankaradeva">Sankaradeva</a> wrote; do the same with <i>Prahlada Charita</i> composed by Hemasarasvati - a scholar can make a impartial decision based on this.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mahendrakandali trained Sankaradeva somewhere in present Routa area of undivided Kamrup. Upon reading Samkaradeva's first writing, Mahendrakandali complemented him with a sloka toila <i>nun</i> naai ..., <i>nun</i> here is not Brajabali it is Kamrupi word. To learn why kamrupi words were mutelated in <a href="../../../a/h/o/Ahom.html" title="Ahom">Ahom</a> Kingdom, please refer Grim's law <a href="../../../j/a/k/Jakob_Grimm_c85f.html" title="Jakob Grimm">Jakob Grimm</a> as well on phoneme mutelation. No Ahomese scholars wrote a paper in this regard. <b>I do not blame you for creating the word Brajavali, but try to look at why so(?)</b></li>

<p>Hello Kurmaa,</p>
<p>You probably are not aware of some of the Wikipedia policies. One of the most important is the policy of <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>. I have mentioned that the portion of the poem has been cited by Bani Kanta Kakati, the foremost linguist on Assamese. This assertion has been approved by most other writers and it has wide acceptance, that that word "asama" is the first use of the name "Assam". Since I have cited reliable sources you cannot delete the portion on your personal whim.</p>
<p>The other important policy is the one on <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>, which in a nutshell is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Articles may not contain any unpublished theories, data, statements, concepts, arguments, or ideas; or any new analysis or synthesis of published data, statements, concepts, arguments, or ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So when you object to the ideas of Bani Kanta Kakati and others, you will have to cite your sources. You cannot insert your own ideas. Even if you cite sources, you can at best put it up as a contesting idea. You cannot just go ahead and delete that portion. This goes against the policies as well as spirit of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I am inserting the text. You are invited to put up a contesting portion after citing published work.</p>

<p>Guys, Stop fighting. I am a hindu bengali and my forefathers are residing in Assam since 1912. However, the mass infiltrations of bangladeshis from across the border has really made Assam a mess.

<p>'13.02.2007 Supriti Phukan and Sarat Kumar Phukan, Last gate, Dispur, Guwahati-6, Assam, India.'</p>
<p>In recent times since the February, 2006 there is a debate over the change of name from ‘Assam’ to Asom and the debate was initiated by Ex-President Asom Sahitya Sabha Late Chandra Prasad Saikia. Subsequently, the Assam Government particularly the Assam cabinet took a decision in favour of the change. This was made to light by Assam Government spokes person Sri Himanta Biswa Sarma, Minister of State, Finance Department and following which there were reactions and counter reactions from various corner the prominents were: Sri Kanaksen Deka, the present President of Asom Sahitya Sabha, who supported the change along with Prof. Priyam Goswami, Gauhati University, whereas The Assam Tribune, a leading English Daily of North East India, published an Editorial repulsing the view point of change of the name from Assam to Asom. In additon to these, a few local media both print and visual before the necessary Constitutional Amendment introdued the word Asom in place of ‘Assam.’ A few of the organizations like -Tai-Ahom Students’ Organization, Tai Sahitya Sabha, All Assam Yutia sahitya Manch, Six Ethnic Tribal Status Demand Committee etc opposed the induction of name Asom instead they are in favour of the present nomenclature ‘Assam.’ In the process, all the bodies be it in support or in oppose placed their different logics and view points. After going through the entire issue, I desire to place my view point for the consideration of the Assam State Government, The Asom Sahitya Sabha, and all other organizations, individuals finally, the people of Assam and North east India. Place-names are continually changing, especially during periods of various political upheavals but there should be always a reasonable reasoning in every such change. · The term Assam, Asom etc., was originally drawn from the name of Ta:i-A:hom or Sha:n Community. The original home of this community is somewhere in Muang-Mao now in South China (now under Dehong Dai Prefixure). This Ta:i community is known by various names in different regions such as –Shya:m, Sia:m, Sha:m, Sha:n, Da:i, Nue, Newa:, Pa:long, Lu, La:o, La:sha:m, etc. · The Ta:i people entered Assam in various historical epochs since A.D. 12th century onwards. The major or prominent flow was in A.D. 1228 under the Command of Chao Lung Siukapha. At that time the land of upper Assam was under the rule of various smaller ethnic groups viz. Kachari, Moran, Muttack, Borahi, Chutiya etc. The Kachari was dominant group among all of them. · They named this newly entered Tai community as –Ha:Sha:m, Ha:Cha:m (meaning land of Sha:m or Cha:m) later A:sha:m, A:sa:m. · The frontier tribes Singpho, Da:i, La:o, Newa:, Burmese etc. call this community as ‘La:Sha:m’, A:sha:m, A:sha:n, A:tha:n, A:than etc. · Prominent Western scholar Baden Powell finds its root –Ha:Com. · And now let us examine some of the view points in the context: One of the first unambiguous earlier historical references comes from Thomas Bowrey in A.D. 1663 about Mir Jumla's death: "They lost the best of Nababs, the Kingdome of A:cha:m, and, by consequence, many large privileges". Jean-Baptiste Tavernier d'aprés des Documents Nouveaux, 8 vol., Paris, 1886, where the literature of the subject is fully given. See also an English translation of Tavernier's account of his travels so far as relating to India, by V Ball, 2 vols. (1889). For the 400th anniversary of Tavernier’s birth in 2005, the Swiss filmmaker Philippe Nicolet made a full-length film about him called Les voyages en Orient du Baron d’Aubonne. Another Swiss, the sculptor Jacques Basler, has made a life-sized bronze effigy of the great 17th-century traveller which looks out over Lake Geneva at Chexbres) Travels in India, published in A.D. 1676 uses the spelling “A:ssen” for Assam in the French original. · The official chronicler of Mir Jumla too calls the place “A:sa:m”, “A:cha:m” · Most scholars accept that the first known mention of the word Assam today is in a stanza from the Bhagavat of Sankardeva composed/translated in this region about the middle of the A.D. 16th century which described the ethno-cultural groups of the region transcribed in Trans</p>

<p>In various documents of British East India Company, in their relationships with the last few Ahom kings, the name of country was mentioned as Assam. After the fall of the Ahom kingdom and the conquest by the British in A.D. 1826, in the Treaty of Yandabo, "Assam" was used to denote the area under the earstwhile Ahoms, and its protectorates (Darrang Koch, Jaintias, Kacharis and many hill tribes in the present Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland). Later it was applied to the entire British province including, Garo Hills and Lushai Hills (Mizoram). The boundaries of Assam have been redrawn many times after that, but the name Assam remained. Today, the political boundary of Assam contains roughly the historical Ahom Kingdom and its protectorates, the Kachari kingdom, Koch Hajo and a part of the Jaintia Kingdom. Inscription (viz. Viswanath Temple Inscriptions one side written in Sanskrit and other side Tai-Ahom languages –Opar pristhe A:sha:ma, A:homa a:ksaren likhitong….), Koch Rajvamsavalli, Koch king’s court and Bhutiya kings’ correspondance record, Coins and Cannon records confirm the use of the word for the state –A:sha:ma.</p>
<p>Most of the Bengal (particularly Mushlims Nababs) and neighbouring states' records prior to the arrival of British rulers used the word ‘A:sha:m’. In the context, the reference made by Chinese scholar Xie Yuan Zhang, in New Letter of Thai-Yunan Project, 1994, is very much relevant over resolving the present debate: Dr. Zhang refering to a ancient Chinese Chronicle he mentions the name of this region as “A:-S-A:-M” (no variation in Tonne). He also mentions that the Kachins of Yunan and Myanmer call the people of this region “L-A:-S-A:-M”. The Chinese also call people of this area as “Cha:n” or “Cha:n-Chi” or “Ta:i” or “Da:i” or Tha:i-Chien (no variation in Tonne) etc. The Chinese also named approximately the Arunachal Pradesh region in their language as “Zangnan or South Tibet”. Also the comment of a historian and literary personality of Assam, Satyendra Nath Sarma has some relevance to the point: While the Shan invaders called themselves Tai, they came to be referred to as Āsām, Āsam and sometimes as Acam by the indigenous people of the country. The modern Assamese word Āhom by which the Tai people are known is derived from Āsām or Āsam. The epithet applied to the Shan conquerors was subsequently transferred to the country over which they ruled and thus the name Kāmarūpa was replaced by Āsām, which ultimately took the Sanskritized form Asama, meaning "unequalled, peerless or uneven"</p>
<p>In our view, the word Assam is of recent origin since the days of the British Government i.e., A.D. 1826 onwards but the root of the word A:sha:ma lies with the ruling Ta:i community (now better known as Tai-A:hom community, A:hom a distorted form of Ha:Sha:m&gt;A:Sha:m&gt;A:hom &gt; A:sha:m &gt;Assam).</p>
<p>Finally, to denote the Ta:i-Ahom (they call themselves) community the words used by various neighbours –Ha:Sha:m, Ha:Cha:m, La:Sha:m, La:Sha:n, A:sha:m, A:sha:n, A:tha:n, A:than, A:Cha:m, A:ssen, as well as A.D. 16th century Bhagawat of Srimanta Sankardeva, Darrang Rajvamsavalli, various Inscriptions, Cannons, Coins, Partughese, Dutch, Parsi records etc., all support that there was clear use of affix -A: in all the cases instead of affix -A. So the word Ha:sha:m or A:sha:m is historically and linguistically established beyond reasonable doubt, hence the name of the State should be Ha:Sha:m or A:sha:m (Assam).</p>
<p>In our view, if the name to be at all changed, the standardized form Ha:Sha:m or La:Sha:m, at least A:sha:m should be accepted at per International Standardization of United Nations Group of Experts on Geographic names (UNGEGN), which has a definite meaning and bearings.</p>
<p>The name of the country A:Sha:m (Assam) was given after the name of this ruling community's land or country 'Ha:Sha:m' or 'La:Sha:m' once they extended their Kingdom up to the river Karatoya. They had also a name in their own language i.e., Tai, Mung-dun-chun-kham, meaning a country of full of garden of gold.</p>
<p>The other reasonings such as Constitutional difficulties, International and National importance and commitment, Brand name difficulties, Drawing common public opinion etc have no legal standing before the logical and scientific reasonings.</p>
