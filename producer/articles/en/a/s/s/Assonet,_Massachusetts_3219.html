<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Assonet%2C_Massachusetts_3219.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Assonet was first settled in 1659, shortly after the completion of Ye Freemen's Purchase. The word comes from the local <a href="../../../n/i/p/Nipmuc.html" title="Nipmuc">Nipmuc</a> Indians, who had a settlement in the area, and has two meanings: "place of rocks" and "song of praise." Those meanings are traditional, but the former can be segmented as:</p>
<dl>
<dd>(h)assun-et</dd>
</dl>
<p>where hassun or assin, which is a word used by southern New England <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algonquian.html" title="Algonquian">Algonquian</a>, means "stone". The -et is a locative suffix: "at the place of the stone". As the region is mainly a tidal marsh, the stone referenced is most likely <a href="../../../d/i/g/Dighton_Rock_951c.html" title="Dighton Rock">Dighton Rock</a> in the <a href="../../../t/a/u/Taunton_River_2d95.html" title="Taunton River">Taunton River</a> next to Assonet Neck. The entire region was sold to the English in 1659 by the <a href="../../../w/a/m/Wampanoag.html" title="Wampanoag">Wampanoags</a>, but, due to the <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algonquian.html" title="Algonquian">Algonquian</a> mobile way of life and the splitting and recombining of social units, the Nipmucs may have been subject to or at the time part of the Wampanoags.</p>
<p>The English settlement remained for many years a small fishing and farming village, growing to be <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freetown%2C_Massachusetts_16d3.html" title="Freetown, Massachusetts">Freetown</a>'s more industrious side by the end of the 18th century. By the end of the 19th century, Assonet had begun to slowly return to its origins, having less and less industry in town. At the beginning of the 21st century, the village has once again begun to expand rapidly.</p>

<p>Assonet was settled on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_2.html" title="April 2">April 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/6/5/1659.html" title="1659">1659</a>, but a string of wars between <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">English</a> settlers and the local <a href="../../../w/a/m/Wampanoag.html" title="Wampanoag">Wampanoag Indians</a>, including <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Philip%27s_War_22e4.html" title="King Philip's War">King Philip's War</a>, prevented much permanent settlement until later. History shows the area existed as a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proprietary.html" title="Proprietary">proprietary</a> settlement as early as 1680, and in 1683 Assonet and <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fall_River%2C_Massachusetts_6440.html" title="Fall River, Massachusetts">Fall River</a> were incorporated as the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freetown%2C_Massachusetts_16d3.html" title="Freetown, Massachusetts">Town of Freetown</a>, named as such because its settlers were <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freemen.html" title="Freemen">Freemen</a>. The earliest records of the town, from approximately 1680-1685, have been lost. Since then, records have been kept and maintained to trace back the town's legacy. Little development occurred after the incorporation of the town, other than the construction of houses and smaller businesses.</p>

<p>Assonet became a prominent commercial fishing port in Southeastern <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts.html" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> in the 1700s, best known for its <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trout.html" title="Trout">trout</a>.

As the century progressed, the villagers began to fall under the same strains as the rest of the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thirteen_colonies.html" title="Thirteen colonies">colonists</a>. Assonet was far enough east that it avoided many of the problems faced during the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_and_Indian_War_3b82.html" title="French and Indian War">French and Indian War</a>, but did feature in the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Revolutionary_War_48ec.html" title="American Revolutionary War">Revolutionary War</a>. Skirmishes were fought in Assonet, and the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Freetown_7abd.html" title="Battle of Freetown">Battle of Freetown</a> was fought on the outskirts of the village in present-day Fall River. The main settled area of the village was known to support the British, even harboring a general before he fled to <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newport%2C_Rhode_Island_c6b0.html" title="Newport, Rhode Island">Newport, Rhode Island</a>.

As the 1700s closed, <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church.html" title="Church">churches</a> and other more prominent buildings began to pop up around the village, including the 1794 construction of Village School, then the office of a <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raynham%2C_Massachusetts_00cf.html" title="Raynham, Massachusetts">Raynham</a> <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawyer.html" title="Lawyer">lawyer</a>.</p>

<p>The 19th century was perhaps the most industrious period in the history of Assonet. The village developed rapidly, with its combination of <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railroads.html" title="Railroads">railroads</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/i/Ship.html" title="Ship">ships</a>, its position on the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stagecoach.html" title="Stagecoach">stagecoach</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Postal_Service_3c00.html" title="United States Postal Service">mail</a> routes, and its <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factory.html" title="Factory">factories</a>. The current <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts_Route_79_4bfd.html" title="Massachusetts Route 79">Route 79</a> roughly follows the mail and stagecoach route from <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhode_Island_988e.html" title="Rhode Island">Rhode Island</a> to <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston</a>, and the Green Dragon <a href="../../../t/a/v/Tavern.html" title="Tavern">Tavern</a> on South <a href="../../../m/a/i/Main_Street_ce07.html" title="Main Street">Main Street</a> was a popular stopover along the route. The <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downtown.html" title="Downtown">downtown</a> area boasted <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shipbuilding.html" title="Shipbuilding">shipbuilding</a> and was an <a href="../../../i/m/p/Import.html" title="Import">import</a>/<a href="../../../e/x/p/Export.html" title="Export">export</a> <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port.html" title="Port">port</a>, as well as a successful <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fishing.html" title="Fishing">fishing</a> industry.</p>
<p>The N. R. Davis Gun Manufactory, located near and on a portion of where Hathaway Park now sits, opened and provided many weapons to Union soldiers during the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a>. Also built was the Crystal Springs Bleachery and Dying Company, which brought millhousing to a small area of the village, and employed many from town and neighboring <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fall_River%2C_Massachusetts_6440.html" title="Fall River, Massachusetts">Fall River</a>, also known for industry.</p>
<p>North Church (1809), <a href="../../../t/o/w/Town_Hall_3658.html" title="Town Hall">Town Hall</a> (1888), and the Guilford H. Hathaway <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library.html" title="Library">Library</a> (1895) were all constructed in the same small area on <a href="../../../t/a/u/Taunton%2C_Massachusetts_e0bd.html" title="Taunton, Massachusetts">Taunton</a> Hill, and complimented the Village School nicely. The Town Hall has served as the municipal office building (1888-present), meeting hall (1888-1976), library (1888-1895), police station (1888-1978), and a variety of other functions. The second floor, literally a hall, was subdivided into office space in the mid-1970s. The Guilford Hathaway Library (b. 1895) served as the town's only library from its construction until the James White Library opened in <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Freetown%2C_Massachusetts_5ef8.html" title="East Freetown, Massachusetts">East Freetown</a> in 1947. The first <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post_Office_4bd6.html" title="Post Office">Post Office</a> in town opened in Assonet in 1811, and has operated continuously since then, first in a razed building on the corner of Elm and North Main Streets, later in a second razed building, and now at its current 1962 facility on South Main Street near the former Assonet Star Market. The <a href="../../../z/i/p/ZIP_Code_3179.html" title="ZIP Code">ZIP Code</a> for Assonet is <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ZIP_Codes_in_Massachusetts_3504.html" title="List of ZIP Codes in Massachusetts">02702</a>.</p>

<p>In the mid-20th century, Assonet began to remove itself from the commercial/industrial scene. Most of its mills closed during this period, following the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>. The N. R. Davis Gun Factory burned to the ground in 1925; and the Crystal Springs Bleachery, now New England Textile, burned in 1955. (Remnants of the latter can be found by Mill Pond.) The former Monument Manufacturing Company on Mill &amp; Locust Sts. was the largest domestic producer of sleeping bags during World War II. In the postwar period, the majority of villagers sought work outside of town, and farming also came back into common practice. This reverse trend would not last long. By the 1990s, the village began to develop again as the region was seen as a "great escape" for upperclass Boston workers.</p>
<p>Next to the Hathaway Library is a local <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verizon.html" title="Verizon">Verizon</a> station, which is the home of one of the first regional dialing systems. Not far away is Freetown Fire Department Company 1, constructed in 1948.</p>

<p>In 1795, 1835, 1809, and 1937, three <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> churches were built in Assonet.

<p>The original <b>Baptist Church</b> (1795) was built on the site of South Church. The building suffered a string of misfortune, culminating with it burning following a <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lightning.html" title="Lightning">lightning</a> strike <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circa.html" title="Circa">c.</a> 1835.

<p><b>South Church</b> (1795/1835) served as the First Christian Church of Assonet steadily until 1916, then again from 1917-1922. At this time, it began alternating weekly services with the Congregational Church, from 1922-1944. In 1968, the church combined with the Congregational Church to form the United Church of Assonet, and South Church was sold. A parsonage was built to its left in 1899, and there are cemeteries both across the street from the church, and on the property. Baptisms were originally performed in the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assonet_River_ccbc.html" title="Assonet River">Assonet River</a>.</p>

<p><b>North Church</b> (1809) served as the Congregational Church until 1916, when it formed the Federated Church of Assonet. Its on-and-off independence mirrored that of the First Christian Church, except from 1916-1917 North Church was the facility utilized. The joining of the two congregations in 1968 fell under the roof of the North Church, which is still used today. The steeple of the church contains a bell cast by <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Revere_ebd6.html" title="Paul Revere">Paul Revere</a>. A non-adjacent parsonage still exists further up <a href="../../../t/a/u/Taunton%2C_Massachusetts_e0bd.html" title="Taunton, Massachusetts">Taunton Hill</a> as a business.</p>

As the congregation grew too large for the small church, St. Bernard's Church was sold and its parishioners moved into South Church, heavily renovated and renamed St. Bernard's Church.

<p><b>South School</b>, 1869-1950, currently exists at the corner of Copicut Road and South Main Street. It was a three-room schoolhouse used initially for grades 1-8, and later for grades 3-6 and "special class."

<p><b>Village School</b>, closed in 1950, currently exists on Taunton Hill between the Town Hall and North Church, being the elder of those two buildings by 94 and 15 years, respectively. It began as a lawyer's office in 1794, then became a string of schools. Originally, the minister of North Church served as the schoolmaster. In the 1850s it was a private school, the Assonet Academy. It was purchased by the town circa 1903 and used as a grammar school until 1950 for grades 1-8, and later grades 1 and 2. In the 1980s and 1990s, the structure was used for public meetings of municipal committees. Throughout its history, it served as a meeting place for local <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_Scouts_of_America_a2b0.html" title="Boy Scouts of America">Boy</a> and <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girl_Scouts_of_the_USA_835b.html" title="Girl Scouts of the USA">Girl Scout</a> <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scouting_in_Massachusetts_ae85.html" title="Scouting in Massachusetts">troops</a>.

<p>It is a two story building, with two rooms on the upper (primary) floor. The lower floor is a two-room cellar, and partially underground. The foundation is brick, and the building itself is wood. The exterior is white clapboards, and the front staircase has a portico and both wooden and iron railings. A cupola adorns the center of the roof, and the windows are six-over-one. The interior of the building is divided in the center, with the wall travelling parallel to School Street between the two front doors. Each room has chalkboards running along the walls, and hanging fixtures from the ceiling provide artificial light when necessary. The building has no plumbing and a woodstove provides heat, with a central brick chimney.</p>
<p>Facing the building from Taunton Hill, the righthand room is painted in bright colors, and was formerly used for meetings of the Girl Scouts and the town's Cultural Council. The lefthand room is panelled in faux stained wood, and was used by the Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>A revitalization effort, begun a few years ago, seeks funds to help restore the ailing structure, which suffers from the effects of weather, rot, deterioration, and a lack of maintenance funds.</p>

From 1857-1862, the Forge School existed in an outbuilding known as the "corn crib" on the property of Daniel Macomber on Forge Road, which was once the site of the oldest dwelling in town, dating back to the 17th century.</p>
