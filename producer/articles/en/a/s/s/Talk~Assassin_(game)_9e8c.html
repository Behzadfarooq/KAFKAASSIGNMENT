<p>If you have specific rules about assassins, please do not include them in the article unless you can generalize them sufficiently! It has been suggested that:</p>
<p>It sounds like several people here have a lot of specialized information to share, in more detail than an encyclopedia article can support. Have you considered starting up a project at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikicities.html" title="Wikicities">Wikicities</a> or other <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_wiki_farms.html" title="List of wiki farms">Wiki provider</a>? That way, you could really get into the nuts and bolts that are specifically useful to Assassin players. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreplySpang_52d7.html" title="User:FreplySpang">FreplySpang</a> <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreplySpang_a627.html" title="User talk:FreplySpang">(talk)</a> 03:58, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Assassin is a long-standing tradition at Carleton, dating back to at least <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>. Using "Caucus", an internal server at the school, the Assassin's Guild leaders establish the rules of the game. Most weekends, each assassin is given a "target" person to kill, though on some weekends "frag everyone" or team games occur.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The weapons used in assassin include guns, knives, poison, and bombs. Bombs are alarm clocks with "Bomb" written on them, poison is tabasco sauce, and knives can be any harmless object (usually a ruler) made silver (by paint or duct tape) and at least 8 inches long. Guns are commonly pellet and rubber band guns.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Many rules exist in assassin. For example, kills may not occur during classes, nor may they occur in the presence of more than a certain number of witnesses. To enforce these rules are players known as "enforcers" given special powers.</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>OK, I did some web research and made a major expansion. I'm sure there are variants not covered, but I think I got the gist of the common rules. I considered a list of colleges where assassin is known to be played, but it'd probably get quite long. I mentioned the two groups that seem to be the most well-established (MIT and Cambridge.) Anyone with other perspectives should certainly include them. This is the sort of subject where Wikipedia could easilly become one of the best sources of information available. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 04:55, 5 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Mike, the weapons rules you wrote doesn't apply to all games of Assassin. Check out the links I posted. I was trying to stick to features common to most or all variants. Of the three rules sets I found, one group explicitly forbids poison. Another uses dart guns only, and issues the guns to players so that no other weapons are legal. Most of the details (like using alarm clocks as bombs, or rulers as knives) seem to be Carleton-specific, as none of the rules sheets I found agree with them exactly. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 17:59, 5 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I added "tracer guns" to the list of common weapons based on my own experience of this game from the mid 1980's, but I see that it still appears in the MIT "Assassin Game Template" rules: <a href="http://web.mit.edu/jemorris/Rules/standard-rules.pdf" class="external free" title="http://web.mit.edu/jemorris/Rules/standard-rules.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://web.mit.edu/jemorris/Rules/standard-rules.pdf</a></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Talk%7EAssassin_%28game%29_9e8c.html" title="Edit section: Davidson Assassins">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Davidson Assassins</span></h2>
<p>I'm a moderator of Assassins at Davidson and my reasoning for adding the info on the school's winners is very similar to Mike Church's. I wanted to know what other games at other schools were like, and I was intending on others to add information on their school's games and winners.</p>
<p>In addition, we know for the most part what the game of Assassins is, but there is little emphasis on the elite group of men and women who have won Assassins. These folks are awesome and deserve more recognition&#160;:-)</p>
<p>Furthermore, I'm planning the school's next game in the spring (it's a spring tradition for us), and unlike other years where it was played within or between dorms, the game will be open to the entire freshman class. This year's game could potentially have up to 470 players (has there been a game this large before anywhere else? If so, I would love to know how it turned out!) Lastly, I wrote the article so that it could be a resource to the new crop of players. These players need a sense of history of who came before them and how that lineage progresses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Interesting, but I still think this info should be moved to the article on Davidson College. As for game size, I personally remember an assassin game being played that was open to my entire high school (potentially over 1,000 participants, but if memory serves only about half actually participated) circa 1984, but since it can't be "verified" I don't intend to mention it in the article. There is a high school in Springfield, Illinois that apparently has had an assassin game every year, open to its entire class (a few hundred, I believe). In 1993, U.C. Berkley had a 300-person game. Grand Canyon University had a school-wide assassin game in 1999 or so (potentially over 1,000 students). So while I agree that the planned game at Davidson is large, I'm not yet persuaded that it is unique enough to warrant this much space about the Davidson winners in this article. Instead I would just discuss the game as played at Davidson, mention that it is a major social activity there, and then discuss the actual winners in the college article. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 04:54, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<dd>My high school in Massachusetts always had a game for the graduating senior class (probably around 250-300 players), since at least the year 2000. But I was always under the impression that we were by no means original, and that virtually every school did some sort of thing like this. So, I would say that no individual game (except for whichever college happened to originate it) should get a specific mention.<a href="../../../e/l/c/User%7EElcocinero_1f83.html" title="User:Elcocinero">Elcocinero</a> 17:20, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>No problem. I'll create a separate page for the winners and just link it to this article and the Davidson article. By the way, I also heard about the Grand Canyon University game, but school officials cancelled it since they feared students were going to be insensitive to local shootings at that time. I'm curious, how did you hear about the other games?</li>

<p>The Davidson Assassins game has 382 people (over 80% of the freshman class) signed up to play and has gotten approval by the Athletics Department to give the top quartile of players P.E. credit. Is this distinction worthy enough to include the Davidson Assassins game in the main article? --Emjose 03:23, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd say that's worthy of a brief mention. Not too often that you'd get an Athletic department to officially recognize something so non-traditional. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 07:04, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have played a version of Assassin before, not on college campus. You simply had to get alone with the person you were trying to kill and then say, "Bang, you're dead." This was at a camp, so there was a board where the people who were killed wrote their names at mealtime. The last non-assassin living would win (there were two assassins). It was a fairly simple version of the game, and could be played in places other than at college. 66.16.106.84 22:05, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems that there is a lot of content for various Assassins guilds throughout the world. Maybe it would be a good idea to split the article about the game into the game article and an article detailing the history/ current status of assassins guilds all over the world.</p>
