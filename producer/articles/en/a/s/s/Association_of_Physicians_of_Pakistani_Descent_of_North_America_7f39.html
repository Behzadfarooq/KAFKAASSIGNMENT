<p>Whereas a formal form of electronic communication such as a web based communication portal through the APPNA website does exist,it is barely used by the officials or the members .The portal is seldom used even for official communications by the organization . A Yahoo Group (R) called ApnaList or listserv <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ApnaList/" class="external free" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ApnaList/" rel="nofollow">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ApnaList/</a> is run privately by a group of the organization's members. The current membership of this group is more than 440. The forum provides an avenue for dialogue among the APPNA members and free exchange of views. In contrast to the APPNA organization and its establishment,which has traditionally sided with all the undemocratic forces and regimes in Pakistan and worked as their proxy,this group also includes members who oppose the totalitarian rule in Pakistan and regularly protest the violations of the human rights,women's rights and rights of the minorities in Pakistan. All members,including even the ones opposed to having such a free dialogue, have equal opportunity to write on this forum.</p>

<p>APPNA SEHAT (Scientific Educational Health Administrative Training) is a subsidiary of APPNA that was established in 1989 and registered as Social welfare organization. In <a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu.html" title="Urdu">Urdu</a> sehat means health. The main purpose of APPNA SEHAT was to develop a low cost model which could address health and related problems effectively and efficiently and to implement practically low cost primary health care projects based on the model for poor and marginalized segments of rural communities. APPNA appointed a team of health experts to investigate the health situation in Pakistan. SEHAT developed Health Education based low cost practical model for rural communities. The approach is aiming at behavioral changes through education, guidance and capacity building through trainings. The proposed model of self-help is a process of transformation of marginalized, un-served, and looking for ‘dole-outs’ communities into effective, independent, self-sustaining communities, meeting most of their needs especially the primary health care needs. The model was pilot tested from 1989 to 1992 in four topographically and culturally diverse areas of Pakistan from mountains of NWFP through hills and planes of Punjab to deserts of Sindh. It launched its first ever Primary Health Care project in 1989 as pilot project with 16,357 people living in 2,200 households of 15 villages at four places Mardan, Murree, Sahiwal and Badin. Through the policy of graduation out, which is the premise of the program, all those units which were on APPNA SEHAT financial support for more than three years or more, have been graduated out. The finances so spared will be used to include new communities waiting for technical and social guidance to improve their life style. So far 37 units at all locations have been graduated out of program and added 16 new communities. <a href="http://appnasehat.org.pk/Introduction.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://appnasehat.org.pk/Introduction.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_of_Physicians_of_Pakistani_Descent_of_North_America_7f39.html" title="Edit section: PAKPAC">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">PAKPAC</span></h2>
<p>In 1990, Pakistani American Public Affairs Committee (PAKPAC) was formed as the political arm of APPNA and it was registered as a separate entity. Though originally it was primarily composed of physicians, it has since become open for all Pakistani Americans.</p>
<p>The Pakistani American Public Affairs Committee (PAKPAC) is a nationwide, membership based, not for-profit lobbying organization registered with the US Federal Election Commission. PAKPAC membership is largely dominated by nearly 10,000 Physicians of Pakistani descent that are established across United States and contribute more than $100 billion to the GDP. It’s membership is open to the entire Pakistani American community which is rapidly approaching the 1 million mark PAKPAC's mission is to advance and strengthen U.S.-Pakistan relations, while working tirelessly to preserve, protect and promote ideals of civil liberties commonly cherished by all Americans. PAKPAC is organized to give voice to issues and concerns common to the Pakistani American community. It play's an important role in fostering greater political and civic engagement within the Pakistani Americans. PAKPAC is also focused in collaborating with other regional and national Pakistani American organizations, as it continues to serve as a watch dog for inaccurate and negatively biased media coverage about Pakistan and Pakistani Americans. PAKPAC is also involved in educating media outlets, political parties, academic institutions, think tanks, and Administration (US as well as Pakistani) about issues of concern and significance to the Pakistani American community, especially concerns of becoming a victim of hate crime on account of ongoing terrorist threats. (For more information on PAKPAC, browse our website (www.pakpac.net).</p>
<p>PAKPAC is also engaged in enhancing US image in Pakistan by creating awareness regarding the greatness of America that has provided majority of Pakistani Americans to realize the “American dream” by living in peace and prosperity without fear of persecution.</p>
<p>PAKPAC is currently focused on promoting the following legislative agenda:</p>
<p>1. Civil Liberties:</p>
<p>The pursuit of civil liberties remains an unfinished business. PAKPAC continues to strive to ensure that Pakistani American community continues to enjoy the principles of free society through our role in remaining engaged with executive and the legislative branch of the government.</p>
<p>2. Economic Development:</p>
<p>The Pakistani American community is endowed with entrepreneurial spirit and if given the optimum chance can contribute immensely in creating employment opportunities for all Americans. We envision that at least $100 million every five years be earmarked for Pakistani Americans to seek through various SBA programs available with commercial banks, or grants and interest free loans available through Federal and State agencies; this would undoubtedly catalyze creation of skilled as well as unskilled jobs, especially in the healthcare and general services sector.</p>
<p>3. Education Credits:</p>
<p>Pakistani American community is very committed to encouraging its children to receive formal education. Most of the Pakistani American children finish graduate school. We believe that amongst the immigrant communities in the US, Pakistani American parents largely participate in defraying college education for their children. We hope that the US congress will consider offering $5000 in tax credit per child per year for Americans of Pakistani descent who is at least defraying 50% cost of their child's college education.</p>
<p>4. AID to Pakistan:</p>
<p>United States should begin to equate similar importance to Pakistan in Southeast Asia, as we offer to State of Israel in the middle east to ensure global peace. PAKPAC envisions an additional $100 million per year to be allocated over next ten (10) years in aiding Pakistan to overhaul her primary education infrastructure, catalyze cultural evolution and welcome tourism.</p>
<p>5. TRADE with Pakistan:</p>
<p>Stimulating US-Pakistan trade is essential to create a sustainable economic growth in Pakistan. PAKPAC envisions US congress to pass legislation offering Federal corporate tax holiday for five years to small and mid size US companies that do business with Pakistan.</p>
<p>The 2006-07 Board of Directors of PAKPAC consist of:</p>
<p>1. Raza Bokhari, MD, MBA (Pennsylvania) President 2. Saud Anwar, MD, MPH (Connecticut)President-elect 3. Parvez Shah, MD, (Maryland)Treasurer 4. Saquib Khan, MD (New York) 5. Hassan Bukhari, MD (Texas) 6. Mohammed Suleman, MD (Louisiana) 7. Rafiq Rehman, MD (Kentucky)</p>

<p>In 1990 the group organized CAPPNA (Children of Association of Pakistani Physicians of North America) to plan and promote programs for the members' children. Numerous activities have been planned to promote education and fun for the youth of APPNA. In 1993, SAYA was organized as the Society of APPNA's Young Adults. It became an autonomous organization for college and graduate students. CAPPNA is now for APPNA children in middle and high school. Shuja Shafqat was recently president and Basil Latif his treasurer. The current president is Najia Hamid.</p>

<p>After a highly controversial election for the office President-Elect which contained a number of irregularites during both the campaign and the counting of the ballots, APPNA has been sued by Dr. Zeelaf Munir in Federal Court asking that a revote be held for the office of President-Elect. After the first court hearing the judge inquired why a revote was not held, and ordered APPNA to turn over all requisite documents to Dr. Zeelaf Munir's attorneys concerning the election within fourteen days.</p>
