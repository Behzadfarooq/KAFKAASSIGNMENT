How do you describe a targeted killing between foes during war time? An assassination? "The U.N. Charter states that “in peacetime, the citizens of a nation, whether they are political officials or private individuals,” are supposed to be immune “from intentional acts of violence by citizens, agents or military forces of another nation.” But in wartime, international law allows the targeted killing of a member of the enemy’s chain of command..."

<p>Do you mean how does "one" describe a targeted killing between foes during war time assassination attempts.</p>
<p>Assasination covers both peace time and war time "targeted killings" for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Foxley_e319.html" title="Operation Foxley">Operation Foxley</a>, a British SOE plan to assassinate Hitler</li>
<li>The German resistance tried to assassinate Hitler with a bomb.</li>
<li><a href="../../../r/e/i/Reinhard_Heydrich_f2f0.html" title="Reinhard Heydrich">Reinhard Heydrich</a> was assassinated.</li>
<li><a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Mountbatten%2C_1st_Earl_Mountbatten_of_Burma_0c4b.html" title="Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma">Louis Mountbatten</a> was assassinated by the IRA.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once someone is dead are you suggesting that he was "targeted killed" is a sutible replacement for assasinated? To me it sounds very clumsy--<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a></p>

<dd>I believe the English term "targeted killing" originated with the official Hebrew euphemism of "targeted foiling" (since "assasination" would obviously be a non-starter for officials, and "execution" is illegal in Israel without a trial [and nearly impossible even then]). However, there isn't an Israeli or Palestinian alive who doesn't understand the real meaning. English-language media just de-euphemised it a bit, to make the meaning clear to foreigners. I think that "execution" might be a good unbiased description, since it conveys the meaning of a controling power killing an individual for past crimes. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAltmany_69eb.html" title="User:Altmany">altmany</a> 12:46, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The problem is that the term is an euphemism and it also has different means as well, (which is presumably why some governments which use it like it). If a sniper shoots a soldier in a war that is a "targeted killing" as is shelling a crossroads to interdict troops moving up to a front, but neither are assassinations. During the troubles in Northern Ireland if a protestant paramilitary group when out and killed a catholic, that was also a "targeted killing" (they were targeting a catholic, any catholic). When protestant paramilitary groups targeted specific alleged prominent members of the IRA or prominent supporters of the IRA, those were assassination attempts. When the IRA killed Mountbatten that was an assassination but the killings of soldiers at <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warrenpoint.html" title="Warrenpoint">Warrenpoint</a> on the same day was a targeted killing (with the use of a second bomb at the likely Army RV point) was not an assassination.</p>
<p>Do a Google search on [assassination site:gov.uk] to see what I mean. Even more interesting is a search on ["Targeted killing site:gov.uk] only two papers one is on the trade in endangered species and contains the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>The Tibetan antelope...The dramatic population decline is attributed solely to the targeted killing of their wool..."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The other is about "The Use of New Technologies for Policing Purposes" which has these two phrases in it which shows that assassination is more widely understood in plain English term even among the likely audience of such a document than "targeted killing"</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Even if one leaves the most extreme consequences of arrest, detention or even assassination aside"</dd>
<dd>"the recent attack by US forces on a car in Yemen, in which five persons, believed (by the US) to be terrorists, were assassinated ("the subject of targeted killing").</dd>

<p>I think you are misunderstanding what the word assasination means in plain English. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 14:24, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just out of curiosity, what is a non-"targeted killing"? Is it when you kill without a target? It seems to me that any killing that is not wholesale slaughter is "targeted killing". Can anyone point out what is the preferred term by the media, governments and the accademy? The article says that both the Clinton and Bush administrations have backed targeted killings, is that the term used by them?--<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoron_5be3.html" title="User:Doron">Doron</a> 08:49, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>If that is true then why then why do the authorites who use the euphemism "targeted killing" never say "XYZ was assasinated after being trageded for killing" instead the use the words as a from of doublespeak where the term could be replaced with the word assasination or assasination with the term "targeted killing". --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 14:47, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It was <u>your</u> idea that these terms are interchangeable, and now you are asking why one is not used instead of another? See their respective definitions: they have different meanings. Also, the word <i>assassination</i> has negative emotional/ideological/political overtones. Intentionally or not, your proposed merge would lead to losing that difference and imposing POV. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">←ну?</a> 01:20, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If the terms had different meanings then someone could be assasinated by targeted killing, have you ever seen such an expression? If not I put it to you that "targeted killing" is an euphemism for assassination.</li>
<li>In which way does "<a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Foxley_e319.html" title="Operation Foxley">Operation Foxley</a> was a British SOE plan to assassinate Hitler" carry "negative emotional/ideological/political overtones"? --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 11:06, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Did I ask you no to spill the same exact talk across pages? Here is the main difference: TK is a stated policy, while assassination is a POV term. I have to admit that I am not the best judge to qualify "plan to assassinate Hitler", but that doesn't prove anything. I wouldn't apply "assassination" to that misiile strike on al-Qaeda operatives in Yemen. Would you? ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">←ну?</a> 09:49, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dispute</span></h2>
<p>It is not clear from the article what is the difference between "targeted killing" and assassination. Is one of them a euphamism? I've never seen Khaled Mashal's failed assassination being referred to as an attempted "targeted killing". As far as I know, Israel uses the term to indicate an assassination of terroris activists using <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precision-guided_munition.html" title="Precision-guided munition">Precision-guided munition</a>, though I may be wrong.--<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoron_5be3.html" title="User:Doron">Doron</a> 12:53, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're right. I modified the text to reflect the fact that Mashal &amp; Ayyash were not "targeted killed", but "regular" assassination attempts by the Israeli security forces. The unofficial distinction is that the term "target killing" is normally reserved (at least for Israel) for actions that conform to all 3 of the following criteria:
<ul>
<li>Airborne attacks (carried out by the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_Air_Force_4b7e.html" title="Israeli Air Force">Israeli Air Force</a> and not by <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mossad.html" title="Mossad">Mossad</a> or other Israeli security arms)</li>
<li>Within the context of the <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Intifada_8589.html" title="Al-Aqsa Intifada">Al-Aqsa Intifada</a></li>
<li>Within the boundaries of the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_territories.html" title="Palestinian territories">Palestinian territories</a></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I suggest using this distinction to differentiate "targeted killing" from other forms of assassination, thereby answering <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">User:Philip Baird Shearer</a>. So, "targeted killing" would still deserve its own entry, as a specific form of assassination.

<dd>There is no source for these criteria - they are more informal distinctions between TK and regular assassinations. These should not be confused with the necessary legal criteria before TKs are attempted. Note that the term was later apparently picked up by other governments (USA, Russia) to describe similar actions, so the criteria and distinctions should not be presented as Israeli-specific.</dd>
