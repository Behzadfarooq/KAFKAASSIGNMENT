<p>Got here following Cats, (163x) and did some fix ups as substandard writing was in need.</p>
<ul>
<li>Accidently removed sentence giving two alternative fan names of the Assiti Multiverse speculation (I over wrote the cut buffer), when I was looking for a better place to land them way down. Sorry, but you had saalfeld in the wrong direction and I got distracted by the factual error.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>non-encycopedic to use 'atlternate' when proper english is alternative. This is not sports, where the newspapers have trashed the meaning of alternate from something varying periodically (Alternating current) to something that means substitute. Fine in Tasah the gymnist article, as is sports.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This series is more promise than fact at the moment, though the first novel is out or due out soon. (See XPost1 Below on titles of these) <b><a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabartus_bae5.html" title="User:Fabartus">Fra</a></b><a href="../../../f/a/b/User_talk%7EFabartus_c63e.html" title="User talk:Fabartus"><font color="green">nkB</font></a></li>

<ul>
<li>I'm placing a clean template herein and copyedit in the article to bring this up to a higher writing standard ASAP. Don't see a reason for clean in reasonably good looking articles.

<p>Alternate history and time-travel are conventionally classed as SF ( unless there's, you know, magic involved). Agreed. It is no fantasy. --Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus 10:25, 26 Jun 2004 (UTC) In reality, the Grantville Disaster was the result of what humans of the day would have called criminal negligence. Caused by a shard of cosmic garbage, a discarded fragment of what, for lack of a better term, could be called a work of art. A shaving, you might say, from a sculpture. The Assiti fancied their solipsist amusements with the fabric of spacetime. They were quite oblivious to the impact of their "art" on the rest of the universe. The Assiti would be exterminated, eighty-five million years later, by the Fta Tei. Ironically, the Fta Tei were a collateral branch of one of the human race's multitude of descendant species. Their motive, however, was not revenge. The Fta Tei knew nothing of their origins on a distant planet once called Earth, much less a minor disaster which had occurred there. The Fta Tei exterminated the Assiti simply because, after many stern warnings, they persisted in practicing their dangerous and irresponsible art. <a href="http://www.baen.com/library/0671319728/0671319728.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.baen.com/library/0671319728/0671319728.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.baen.com/library/0671319728/0671319728.htm</a> And 1781 is an "Assiti Shard" story, as his website says, but it's not part of the 163x universe -- the 1781 from which George Washington disappeared can't happen in that world and his appearance in classical Roman times didn't. Yep. The 1632 (or 163x) universe is aare a diffrent parts (series) of Assiti Shard universe, not the other way around. --Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus 10:25, 26 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Another volume in the Assiti Shards universe is entitled <b>1781 (novel)</b>. That novel has the same "starting point" as the 1632verse -- an "Assiti shard" striking the Earth and causing a time transposition -- but the actual story is completely different. In 1781 (novel), a "shower" of Assiti shards strikes the Earth during the <b>18th century</b> and sends (in separate incidents) both <b>Frederick the Great</b> (and his army) and <b>George Washington</b> (along with all the forces gathered at the battle of Yorktown) <b>back in time</b> to the Roman Empire <b>during the "third century crisis" when the Empire was falling apart. In essence, the story is about two alternate approaches to rebuilding Roman society.</b> <a href="http://www.ericflint.net/wip.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.ericflint.net/wip.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ericflint.net/wip.htm</a> --wwoods 06:06, 21 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, and I didn't recognize the title, but By Any Other Name is also not a 163x book. Quoting <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Flint_1515.html" title="Eric Flint">Eric Flint</a>:</p>

<dd><i>Finally, there’s been a new development regarding the novel I’ve been under contract with for time -- yet another separate</i> Assiti Shards novel <i>-- which had the working title of "Shaxpur." That title has now been changed to <b>By Any Other Name</b>. Both titles are something of an in-joke between Jim Baen and myself, which derives from the fact that the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Oxford_c2cd.html" title="Earl of Oxford">Earl of Oxford</a> — whom both Jim and I think was the real author of <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakespeare.html" title="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>'s plays — will figure as a major character in the novel</i>.</dd>
<dd><i>By Any Other Name will be a rather different novel from the others, in that in this novel</i> humans and Assiti actually come into direct contact <i>(and conflict) with each other. Although part of the novel will take place in Elizabethan England, it's really more of a straight science fiction novel than alternate history as such.</i></dd>

I don't know that stating "the fact that the Assiti Shards event results in a unique fictional parallel universes is a new wrinkle in literature" would actually be correct. S. M. Stirling seems to be doing this same thing in his Nantucket series. <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaid_1fbd.html" title="User:Kaid">Kaid</a> 10:56, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Parallel universes are a dime a dozen in SF. What is unique here is the literary mechanism. Nantucket doesn't appear to explain how the society went back. Flint does, and moreover held up two plotted works, one cut off in mid-creative stream due to the 1632 demands. That's not to say EF didn't borrow something from Steve, but filing off serial numbers has a long and honorable tradition in speculative fiction- RAH said so! Both co-write with Drake and all three are friends, though Eric is undergunned on the Military side lacking a military background to lean on. <b><a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabartus_bae5.html" title="User:Fabartus">Fra</a></b><a href="../../../f/a/b/User_talk%7EFabartus_c63e.html" title="User talk:Fabartus"><font color="green">nkB</font></a> 05:46, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I've marked this article for <a href="../../../c/l/e/WP%7Ecleanup_c50d.html" title="WP:cleanup">cleanup</a> as it needs some serious attention.

<dd>There is little reason to worry about NOR here. We are speaking of a quite recent literary production (of which there is nothing but the text) and there's little in the way of authoritative opinion to quote. With that said, the 1632-verse has been something of a publishing phonomenon and there's surely some fanzine commentary which could be cited. It's not here, and if it exists, some of it should be. An opportunity to improve the article, I think.</dd>
<dd>More importantly, the writing is floppy and circuitous. The Average Reader will have difficulty following the structure (or lack thereof) now. This does not meet any acceptable standard of writing for WP, and presents an opportunity for some considerable restructuring and copyediing. This article belongs on the cleanup list until it reaches a rather higher standard of writing, regardless of NOR. <a href="../../../w/w/_/User%7EWw_6383.html" title="User:Ww">ww</a> 02:55, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm a heavy SF reader and have a degree in English Literature, and I can say that I'm baffled by the amount of jargon and embedded acronyms and links in these paragraphs. It's not any easy read for anyone, in my opinion. I'd volunteer to help with cleanup myself, but I don't have any prior knowledge of this series. I came to this page because I was curious about the books, but it doesn't help much. <a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7ETHINMAN_805e.html" title="User:THINMAN">THINMAN</a> 05:39, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
