	    <p><b>Asser</b> (d. 908/909) was a <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Welsh</a> <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monk.html" title="Monk">monk</a> from <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._David%27s_a48c.html" title="St. David's">St. David's</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Dyfed_a4b1.html" title="Kingdom of Dyfed">Dyfed</a>, who became <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Sherborne_9f5b.html" title="Bishop of Sherborne">Bishop of Sherborne</a> in the 890s. In about 885 he was recruited by <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_the_Great_636c.html" title="Alfred the Great">Alfred the Great</a> to join the circle of learned men at Alfred's court. In 893 Asser wrote a biography of Alfred, <i>Life of King Alfred</i>, which is the main source of information about Alfred's life, though no early copies survive. Asser also assisted Alfred in his translation of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_the_Great_c26a.html" title="Gregory the Great">Gregory the Great</a>'s <i>Pastoral Care</i>. Doubts have periodically been raised about whether Asser's work was a forgery by a slightly later writer, but it is now almost universally accepted as genuine.</p>

<p><b>Asser</b> (also known as John Asser or Asserius Menevensis<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>) was a <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Welsh</a> <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monk.html" title="Monk">monk</a> who lived in the late ninth century. Almost nothing is known of Asser's early life. The name Asser is likely to have been taken from Aser, or <a href="../../../a/s/h/Asher.html" title="Asher">Asher</a>, the eight son of <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacob.html" title="Jacob">Jacob</a> in <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis.html" title="Genesis">Genesis</a>. Old Testament names were common in Wales at the time, but it has been suggested that this name may have been adopted at the time Asser entered the church. "Asser" is <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> for "blessed", so it is possible that Asser's birth name was "Gwyn" (or "Guinn"), which is <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welsh_language.html" title="Welsh language">Welsh</a> for "blessed" (or "blessedness"). According to Asser's own account in his <i>Life of King Alfred</i>, Asser was a monk at <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._David%27s_Cathedral_9eba.html" title="St. David's Cathedral">St. David's</a> in what was then the kingdom of <a href="../../../d/y/f/Dyfed.html" title="Dyfed">Dyfed</a>, in southwest Wales. He also makes it clear that he was brought up in the area, and was tonsured, trained and ordained there, and mentions Nobis, a bishop of St. David's who died about 873 or 874, as a kinsman of his.<sup id="_ref-KL_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KL" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Asser.html" title="Edit section: Recruitment by Alfred and time at court">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Recruitment by Alfred and time at court</span></h2>
<p>Much of what is known about Asser comes from his biography of <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_the_Great_636c.html" title="Alfred the Great">Alfred the Great</a>; in particular a short section in which Asser recounts how Alfred recruited him as a scholar for his court. Asser provides only one datable event: on St. Martin's Day, 11 November, 887, Alfred decided to learn to read Latin. Working backwards from this, it appears most likely that Asser was recruited by Alfred in early 885. Asser recounts meeting Alfred first at the royal estate at Dean, <a href="../../../s/u/s/Sussex.html" title="Sussex">Sussex</a>. Alfred held a high opinion of the value of learning, and recruited men from around Britain and from continental Europe to establish a centre of learning at his court. It is not known how Alfred heard of Asser. One possibility relates to Alfred's overlordship of south Wales. Several kings, including Hywel ap Rhys of Glywysing and Hyfaidd of Dyfed (where Asser's monastery was) had submitted to Alfred's overlordship in 885; Asser gives a fairly detailed account of the events. There is a charter of Hywel's which has been dated to c. 885; amongst the witnesses is one "Asser", which may be the same person. Hence it is possible that Alfred's relationship with the southern Welsh kings led him to hear of Asser.<sup id="_ref-KL_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KL" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Asser responded by asking for time to consider Alfred's offer, as he felt it would be unfair to abandon his current position in favour of worldly recognition. Alfred agreed but also suggested that he should spend half his time at St. David's and half with Alfred; Asser again asked for time to consider, but ultimately agreed to return to Alfred with an answer in six months. However, on his return to Wales Asser fell ill with a fever and was confined to the monastery of <a href="../../../c/a/e/Caerwent.html" title="Caerwent">Caerwent</a> for twelve months and a week. Alfred wrote to find out the cause of the delay, and Asser wrote back that he would keep his promise when he recovered. When he did recover, in 886, he agreed to divide his time between Wales and Alfred's court, as Alfred had suggested. Others at St. David's supported this, since they hoped Asser's influence with Alfred would avoid "damaging afflictions and injuries at the hands of King Hyfaidd (who often assaulted that monastery and the jurisdiction of St. David)".<sup id="_ref-KL_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KL" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Asser joined several other noted scholars at Alfred's court, including <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grimbald.html" title="Grimbald">Grimbald</a>, and John the Old Saxon; all three probably reached Alfred's court within a year of each other.<sup id="_ref-KL2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KL2" title="">[3]</a></sup> His first extended stay with Alfred was at the royal estate at Leonaford, probably from about April through December of 886. It is not known where Leonaford was; a case has been made for Landford, in <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wiltshire.html" title="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a>. Asser records that he read aloud to the king from the books at hand. On Christmas Eve, 886, after Asser had for some time failed to obtain permission to return to Wales, Alfred gave Asser the monasteries of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congresbury.html" title="Congresbury">Congresbury</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banwell.html" title="Banwell">Banwell</a>, along with a silk cloak and a quantity of incense "weighing as much as a stout man", and then allowed Asser to visit his new possessions and thence to return to St. David's.<sup id="_ref-KL_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KL" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Thereafter Asser seems to have divided his time between Wales and Alfred's court. Asser gives no information about his time in Wales, but mentions various places that he visited in England, including the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Ashdown_4459.html" title="Battle of Ashdown">battlefield at Ashdown</a>, Countisbury (which he calls Cynuit), and <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athelney.html" title="Athelney">Athelney</a>. It is evident from Asser's account that he spent a good deal of time with Alfred: he recounts meeting Alfred's mother-in-law, Eadburh, on many occasions; and says that he has often seen Alfred hunting.<sup id="_ref-KL_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KL" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Bishop_of_Sherborne" id="Bishop_of_Sherborne"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Asser.html" title="Edit section: Bishop of Sherborne">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bishop of Sherborne</span></h2>
<p>Sometime between 887 and 892, Alfred gave Asser the monastery of Exeter. Asser subsequently became Bishop of Sherborne, though the year of succession is unknown. Asser's predecessor as Bishop of Sherborne, Wulfsige, is known to have attested a charter in 892. Asser's first appearance in the position is in 900, when he appears as a witness to a charter; hence the succession can only be dated to the years 892 to 900. However, Asser was already a bishop prior to his appointment to the see of Sherborne, since Wulfsige is known to have received a copy of Alfred's <i>Pastoral Care</i>, in which Asser is described as a bishop. Asser may have been a <a href="../../../s/u/f/Suffragan_bishop.html" title="Suffragan bishop">suffragan bishop</a> within the see of Sherborne. However <a href="../../../g/i/r/Giraldus_Cambrensis_4db1.html" title="Giraldus Cambrensis">Giraldus Cambrensis</a> listed Asser as a bishop of St. David's in <i>Itinerarium Cambriae</i>; this was written three centuries later, in <a href="../../../1/1/9/1191.html" title="1191">1191</a> and thus may be unreliable. In addition, Asser mentions that bishops of St. David's were sometimes expelled by King Hyfaidd, and adds that "he even expelled me on occasion". This has also been interpreted as indicating Asher was a bishop of St. David's.<sup id="_ref-KL_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KL" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="The_Life_of_King_Alfred" id="The_Life_of_King_Alfred"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Asser.html" title="Edit section: The Life of King Alfred">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The <i>Life of King Alfred</i></span></h2>
<p>In 893, Asser wrote a biography of Alfred entitled <i>The Life of King Alfred</i>; in the original Latin, the title is <i>Vita Ælfredi regis Angul Saxonum</i>. The date is known from Asser's mention of the king's age in the text. The work is one of the most important sources of information on Alfred the Great.<sup id="_ref-KL_6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KL" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Asser drew on a variety of texts to write his <i>Life</i>. The style is similar to that of two biographies of <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_the_Pious_e7e4.html" title="Louis the Pious">Louis the Pious</a>: <i><a href="../../../v/i/t/Vita_Hludovici_f7f1.html" title="Vita Hludovici">Vita Hludovici</a> Imperatoris</i>, written c. 840 by an unknown author usually called "the Astronomer", and <i>Vita Hludowici Imperatoris</i> by <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thegan_of_Trier_e8b3.html" title="Thegan of Trier">Thegan of Trier</a>, and Asser may have known these works. He also knew <a href="../../../b/e/d/Bede.html" title="Bede">Bede</a>'s <i>Ecclesiastical History of England</i>; the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historia_Brittonum_4aea.html" title="Historia Brittonum">Historia Brittonum</a>, a Welsh source; the <i>Life of <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcuin.html" title="Alcuin">Alcuin</a></i>; and the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle_2487.html" title="Anglo-Saxon Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>. About half of <i>The Life</i> is little more than a translation of part of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for the years 851-887, though Asser adds personal opinions and interpolates information about Alfred's life. Asser also adds material relating to the years after 887, and general opinions about Alfred's character and reign.<sup id="_ref-Abels13_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Abels13" title="">[4]</a></sup> It is also clear from the text that Asser was familiar with <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgil.html" title="Virgil">Virgil</a>'s <a href="../../../a/e/n/Aeneid.html" title="Aeneid">Aeneid</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/e/Caelius_Sedulius_f450.html" title="Caelius Sedulius">Caelius Sedulius</a>'s <i>Carmen Paschale</i>, <a href="../../../a/l/d/Aldhelm.html" title="Aldhelm">Aldhelm</a>'s <i>De Virginitate</i>, and <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einhard.html" title="Einhard">Einhard</a>'s <i>Vita Caroli</i> ("Life of Charlemagne"). He quotes from <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_the_Great_c26a.html" title="Gregory the Great">Gregory the Great</a>'s <i><a href="../../../r/e/g/Regula_Pastoralis_efd5.html" title="Regula Pastoralis">Regula Pastoralis</a></i>, a work he and Alfred subsequently collaborated in translating; and from <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustine_of_Hippo_c35d.html" title="Augustine of Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</a>'s <i><a href="../../../e/n/c/Enchiridion.html" title="Enchiridion">Enchiridion</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-KL_7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KL" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Asser's prose style has been criticized for weak syntax, stylistic pretensions, and garbled exposition. His frequent use of archaic and unusual words gives his prose a baroque flavour that is common in Insular Latin authors of the period. He uses several words that are peculiar to Frankish Latin sources; this has led to speculation that he was educated at least partly in Francia, but it is also possible that he acquired this vocabulary from Frankish scholars he associated with at court, such as Grimbald.<sup id="_ref-KL_8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KL" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <i>Life</i> ends abruptly with no concluding remarks, and it is considered likely that the manuscript is an incomplete draft. Asser lived a further fifteen or sixteen years, and Alfred a further six, but none of the events after 893 are recorded.<sup id="_ref-KL_9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KL" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is possible that the work was written principally for the benefit of a Welsh audience. Asser takes pain to explain local geography, so he was clearly considering an audience not familiar with the areas he described. More specifically, at several points he gives an English name and follows it with the Welsh equivalent, even in the case of Nottingham, which seems unlikely to have had a native Welsh name. As a result, and given that Alfred's overlordship of south Wales was recent, it may be that Asser intended the work to acquaint a Welsh readership with Alfred's personal qualities and reconcile them to his rule.<sup id="_ref-KL_10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KL" title="">[2]</a></sup> However, it is also possible that Asser's inclusion of Welsh placenames simply reflects an interest in etymology, or the existence of a Welsh audience in his own household rather than in Wales. There are also sections such as the support for Alfred's programme of fortification that give the impression of being aimed at an English audience.<sup id="_ref-CampbellTASS142_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CampbellTASS142" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Asser's life omits any mention of internal strife or dissent in Alfred's own reign, though when he mentions that Alfred had to harshly punish those who were slow to obey Alfred's commands to fortify the realm, he makes it clear that Alfred did have to enforce obedience. Asser's life is a one-sided treatment of Alfred; though since Alfred was alive when it was composed, it is unlikely to contain gross errors of fact.<sup id="_ref-Abels13_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Abels13" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-CampbellTASS145_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CampbellTASS145" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition to being the primary source for Alfred's life, Asser's work is also a source for other historical periods, where he adds material to his translation of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. For example, he tells a story about <a href="../../../e/a/d/Eadburh.html" title="Eadburh">Eadburh</a>, the daughter of <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offa.html" title="Offa">Offa</a>. Eadburh married <a href="../../../b/e/o/Beorhtric.html" title="Beorhtric">Beorhtric</a>, king of the West Saxons. Asser describes her as behaving "like a tyrant" and ultimately accidentally poisoning Beorhtric in an attempt to murder someone else; he finishes by describing her death as a beggar in <a href="../../../p/a/v/Pavia.html" title="Pavia">Pavia</a>.<sup id="_ref-Campbell111_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Campbell111" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-KL5_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KL5" title="">[8]</a></sup> Note that this Eadburh is not the same as Alfred's mother-in-law, also named Eadburh, whom Asser mentions elsewhere.</p>

<p>The early manuscript of the <i>Life</i> does not appear to have been widely known in medieval times. Only one copy is known to have survived into modern times: the Cotton manuscript (see below) which was written in about 1000 and which was destroyed in a fire in 1731. The lack of distribution may be because the Asser had not finished the manuscript, and hence did not have it copied. However, the material in the <i>Life</i> is recognizable in other works. There is some evidence from early writers of access to versions of Asser's work, as follows:<sup id="_ref-KL3_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KL3" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/y/r/Byrhtferth.html" title="Byrhtferth">Byrhtferth</a> of <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramsey_Abbey_d3d0.html" title="Ramsey Abbey">Ramsey</a> included large sections of it into <i>Historia Regum</i>, a historical work he wrote, in the late tenth or early eleventh century. This may have been the Cotton manuscript. (The <i>Historia Regum</i> was until recently attributed to <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symeon_of_Durham_cb67.html" title="Symeon of Durham">Symeon of Durham</a>.)</li>
<li>The anonymous author of the <i>Encomium Emmae</i> (written in the early 1040s) was apparently acquainted with <i>The Life</i>, though it is not known how he knew of it. The author was a monk of St. Bertin's in <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flanders.html" title="Flanders">Flanders</a>, but may have learned of the work in England.</li>
<li>The chronicler known as <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florence_of_Worcester_9895.html" title="Florence of Worcester">Florence of Worcester</a> incorporated parts of Asser's <i>Life</i> into his chronicle, in the early twelfth century; again, this may have been the Cotton manuscript.</li>
<li>An anonymous chronicler at <a href="../../../b/u/r/Bury_St._Edmunds_7e49.html" title="Bury St. Edmunds">Bury St. Edmunds</a>, working in the second quarter of the twelfth century, produced a compilation now known as <i>The Annals of <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Neot_09de.html" title="Saint Neot">St. Neots</a></i>. He used material from a version of Asser's work that differs in some places from the Cotton manuscript, and in some places appears to be more accurate, so it is possible that the copy used was not the Cotton manuscript.</li>
<li><a href="../../../g/i/r/Giraldus_Cambrensis_4db1.html" title="Giraldus Cambrensis">Giraldus Cambrensis</a> wrote a <i>Life of St. Æthelberht</i>, probably at Hereford during the 1190s. He quotes an incident from Asser that occurred during the reign of <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offa.html" title="Offa">Offa</a> of <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercia.html" title="Mercia">Mercia</a>, who died in 796; this incident is not in the surviving copies of the manuscript. It is possible that Giraldus had access to a different copy of Asser's work; but it is also possible that he is quoting a different work by Asser, which is otherwise unknown; or even that Giraldus is making up the reference to Asser to support his story. The latter is at least plausible, since Giraldus is not always regarded as a trustworthy writer.</li>

<p>The history of the Cotton manuscript itself is quite complex. The list of early writers above mentions that it may have been in the possession of at least two of them. It was owned by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Leland_19fb.html" title="John Leland">John Leland</a>, the antiquary, in the 1540s; it probably became available after the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dissolution_of_the_Monasteries_9b7b.html" title="Dissolution of the Monasteries">dissolution of the monasteries</a>, in which the property of many religious houses was confiscated and sold. Leland died in 1552, and it is known to have been in the possession of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Parker_33ca.html" title="Matthew Parker">Matthew Parker</a> from some time after that until his death in 1575. Although Parker bequeathed most of his library to <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corpus_Christi_College%2C_Cambridge_85fd.html" title="Corpus Christi College, Cambridge">Corpus Christi College, Cambridge</a>, the Cotton manuscript was not included, and by 1600 it was in the library of Lord Lumley. By 1621 the manuscript was in the possession of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Bruce_Cotton_9594.html" title="Robert Bruce Cotton">Robert Cotton</a>. In 1712 the Cotton library was removed from Cotton House in <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster.html" title="Westminster">Westminster</a> to Essex House in the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strand%2C_London_512c.html" title="Strand, London">Strand</a>, and in 1730 it was moved again to <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashburnham_House_896b.html" title="Ashburnham House">Ashburnham House</a>, in Westminster. On the morning of Saturday, 23 October, 1731, a fire broke out and the Cotton manuscript was destroyed.<sup id="_ref-KL3_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KL3" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>As a result, the text of Asser's <i>Life</i> is known from a multitude of different sources. Various transcripts had been made of the Cotton ms, and a facsimile of the first page of the manuscript had been made and published, giving more direct evidence for the hand of the scribe. In addition to these transcripts, the extracts mentioned above made by other early writers have been used to help assemble and assess the text. Because of the lack of the manuscript itself, and because Parker's annotations had been copied by some transcribers as if they were part of the text, scholarly editions have had a difficult burden. There have been multiple editions of <i>The Life</i> published, both in Latin and in translation.<sup id="_ref-KL3_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KL3" title="">[10]</a></sup> A 1904 edition, by W.H.

<p>In addition to the <i>Life of King Alfred</i>, Asser is credited by Alfred as one of several scholars who assisted with Alfred's translation of Gregory's <i>Regula Pastoralis</i> (<i>Pastoral Care</i>).

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Asser.html" title="Edit section: Claims of forgery">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Claims of forgery</span></h2>
<p>During the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th centuries</a>, several scholars asserted that Asser's biography of King Alfred was not authentic but a forgery. A prominent claim was made in 1964 by the respected historian <a href="../../../v/i/v/Vivian_Hunter_Galbraith_1afd.html" title="Vivian Hunter Galbraith">V.H. Galbraith</a> in his essay "Who Wrote Asser's Life of Alfred?". Galbraith argued that there were anachronisms in the text that meant it could not have been written during Asser's lifetime. For example, Asser uses "rex Angul Saxonum" ("king of the Anglo-Saxons") to refer to Alfred; Galbraith asserts that this usage does not appear until the late tenth century. Galbraith also identified the use of "parochia" to refer to Exeter as an anachronism, arguing that it should be translated as "diocese", and hence referred to the bishopric of Exeter, which was not created until 1050. Galbraith identified the true author as Bishop <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leofric%2C_Bishop_of_Exeter_3168.html" title="Leofric, Bishop of Exeter">Leofric</a> of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_sees_of_Devon_and_Cornwall_3b8a.html" title="United sees of Devon and Cornwall">Devon and Cornwall</a> (became bishop <a href="../../../1/0/4/1046.html" title="1046">1046</a>, died <a href="../../../1/0/7/1072.html" title="1072">1072</a>). Leofric's motive, according to Galbraith, was to justify the re-establishment of his see at Exeter, by demonstrating a precedent for the arrangement. However, the title "rex Anglo-Saxonum" does in fact occur in royal charters that date to before 892, and "parochia" does not necessarily mean "diocese", but can sometimes refer just to the jurisdiction of a church or monastery. In addition, there are arguments against Leofric having been the forger; aside from the fact that Leofric would have known little about Asser and so would have been unlikely to construct a plausible forgery, there is strong evidence dating the Cotton manuscript to about 1000. The apparent use of Asser's material in other early works that predate Leofric also argues against Galbraith's theory. Galbraith's arguments were refuted to the satisfaction of most historians by <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorothy_Whitelock_bafa.html" title="Dorothy Whitelock">Dorothy Whitelock</a> in <i>Genuine Asser</i>, in 1967. More recently, in 2002, Alfred Smyth has argued that the <i>Life</i> is a forgery by Byrhtferth, basing his case primarily on an analysis of Byrhtferth's and Asser's Latin vocabulary. Byrhtferth's motive, according to Smyth, is to lend Alfred's prestige to the Benedictine monastic reform movement of the late tenth century. However, the argument has not been found persuasive; and few historians harbour doubts about the authenticity of the work.<sup id="_ref-KL_12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KL" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Smyth_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Smyth" title="">[15]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Abels321-324_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Abels321-324" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
