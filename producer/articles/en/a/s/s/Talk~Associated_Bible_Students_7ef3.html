	    <p>Yeah, this definitely needs work&#160;:)</p>
<p>This groups deserves attention because, well, it's relevant to the history of the <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_173f.html" title="Jehovah's Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>, and because they still look fairly active today. However, looking up on their history is a big of a mess ...</p>
<p>The name "Bible Students" seems also used by the JW, and can also refer to the JW before they changed their name - which definitely screws up any attempt to look up info with google.</p>
<p>I don't know if the <b>International Bible Students Association</b> is the same as the Bible Students, or if it's one of the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_instruments_of_Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_8d5e.html" title="Legal instruments of Jehovah's Witnesses">Legal instruments of Jehovah's Witnesses</a>.</p>
<p>(I'm also hoping that this page can help take a bit of the fire off of the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Taze_Russell_98a2.html" title="Charles Taze Russell">Charles Taze Russell</a> article).</p>
<p>Oh, and the Category:Jehovah's Witnesses tag seems like a fairly good approximation for a start, something better could be devised later&#160;:) <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlammifer_bbb8.html" title="User:Flammifer">Flammifer</a> 13:04, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

(They look mostly friendly, they aren't at war with each other as they are with the JW) I'm looking for the organizations that differenciate themselves from the JW.

<p>Aha, according to <a href="http://www.edition-temmen.com/timetable/" class="external free" title="http://www.edition-temmen.com/timetable/" rel="nofollow">http://www.edition-temmen.com/timetable/</a> , the groups in various countries didn't change thier names at the same time. may be relevant.

<p>I still don't know on which side the "International Bible Students Association" fell - probably with the JW. But google points it to the Bible Students. Hm.</p>

<p>Thanks <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlammifer_bbb8.html" title="User:Flammifer">Flammifer</a> for creating this much needed article. Hopefully it will enable the CTR article to deal more with his life and less the post-death controversy.</p>
<p>AFAIK, all three corporations founded by Russell are still under the control of JWs. I think that those who disagreed with Rutherford lost control of more or less everything Russell started, and succeeded from him in teachings and spirit only.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I reread it more carefully, it doesn'tt alk about the "split-off" Bible Students, but only about the JW (apparently), which it still calls Bible Students. It seems that JWs still referring to themselves as Bible Students after the split is relevant to the article, though. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlammifer_bbb8.html" title="User:Flammifer">Flammifer</a> 08:48, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><a href="http://quotes.watchtower.ca/" class="external text" title="http://quotes.watchtower.ca/" rel="nofollow">this site</a> has quite a few watchtower quotes.

</ul>
<p>I'm still looking for the actual founding date of the IBSA ...</p>
<dl>
<dd>From 1909 onward a monthly tract - first called "People's Pulpit ," then "Everybody's Paper," and still later, "The Bible Students Monthly" - was widely distributed annually in millions of copies, clearly explaining vital Bible truths and warnings the Gentiles nations of the fateful year 1914. And so during several years these earnest united workers became more and more widely known as Bible Students, or International Bible Students. In fact, in 1914 the identical work in the British field was legally established under law of Great Britain, being incorporated under the name INTERNATIONAL BIBLE STUDENTS ASSOCIATION. All three of these corporations were organized for identical purposes and they harmoniously work together. (W 1917 pp. 327-330, W 1914, p. 71)</dd>
</dl>
<p>... ah, that looks better. (source&#160;: <a href="http://www.biblestudents.net/history/daughters_tower.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.biblestudents.net/history/daughters_tower.htm" rel="nofollow">Bible Students website</a>) (The two other corporatinos were the NY and pennsylvania watch tower bible and tract societies).</p>
<p>But there seems to be mention of the IBSA before 1914&#160;:</p>
<dl>
<dd>In 1908/1909, E.C. Henninges, the Australian Branch Manager of the International Bible Students Association, and M.L. McPhail, Pilgrim for the IBSA and a members of the Chicago Bible Students, withdrew their support causing the second largest split in the Society's history (the largest being that of 1917).</dd>
</dl>
<p><a href="http://www.biblestudents.net/history/daughters_tower.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.biblestudents.net/history/daughters_tower.htm" rel="nofollow">source</a> (Bible Students website again). It's interesting because it's a split when Pastor Russell was still alive.</p>
<p>Also, this&#160;:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Prior to 1914, Bible Students advertised under the name "International Bible Students." When the IBSA was incorporated under the laws of Britain, it was advised that the independent classes no longer use the name, save a few exceptions [that being the Chicago Class and the New York Class] Since 1914 the Society advertised the "Associated Bible Students," it is these classes which eventually ceased supporting the Society, and now function independent of each other.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This looks quite coherent with what the JWs say on their forum (With quotes from the Watchtower&#160;!).</p>
<p>In Poland they had the IBSA II and IBSA III o.O</p>
<p>A lot of this is probably fairly irrelevant to the (modern) Bible Students, but I feel that the article will also necessarily contain a section on the use of the name "Bible Students"</p>

<dd>Good work Flammifer. It's certainly a complicated issue. I think that perhaps the articles for each of the corporations will have to redirect not to <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_instruments_of_Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_8d5e.html" title="Legal instruments of Jehovah's Witnesses">Legal instruments of Jehovah's Witnesses</a>, but a neutral page, as the BS seem to dispute that. However, AFAIK, Pastorrussell/PastorRussell is the only Bible Student contributing, so he may not be representing the views of the majority.

<dl>
<dd>One note: the IBSA that the CTR article talks about was formed in England in 1914. Therefore, an IBSA mentioned prior to that date is probably a United States association. --<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonrad_West_6f02.html" title="User:Konrad West">K.</a> 05:13, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know if it was an actual legal entity, or just a label they'd advertise other. I don't know much about association laws at that time.

<p>PastorRussell, why do you insist on removing (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bible_Students&amp;diff=19381422&amp;oldid=19381311" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bible_Students&amp;diff=19381422&amp;oldid=19381311" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bible_Students&amp;diff=19308221&amp;oldid=19300208" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bible_Students&amp;diff=19308221&amp;oldid=19300208" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) the link to BibleStudents.net&#160;? It looks like the most informative site on the topic, and has a detailed history section (that's better than those of the other sites). Plus, it also links to a lot of other related sites, so it doesn't look like a "heretical" or "splitoff" bible student group ...</p>
<p>Also, I don't think another link to your website pastor-russell.com is needed, there's already one at the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Taze_Russell_98a2.html" title="Charles Taze Russell">Charles Taze Russell</a> article, and it has less direct relevance to this article than the other links. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlammifer_bbb8.html" title="User:Flammifer">Flammifer</a> 05:22, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

Oh, none at all! The only thing I've removed is the title given to the link which states that it is somehow the official Bible Student website online. It isn't. It is a personal website made by a Bible Student in New Jersey. As a result, it should either be listed as a personal website, or one from New Jersey. Considering balance, I have included only one link per state. Most Bible Student pages link to each other anyway, so nobody is left out. The only official site is Pastor-Russell.com, therefore should be at the very least listed amongst the links. Many Ecclesia's also have their own webpages. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastorRussell_d5b9.html" title="User:PastorRussell">PastorRussell</a> 02:50, 03 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>PastorRussell, can you provide some evidence that pastor-russell.com is the official site of either CTR or the Bible Students. --<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonrad_West_6f02.html" title="User:Konrad West">K.</a> <small>AKA</small> <a href="http://www.konradwest.com" class="external text" title="http://www.konradwest.com" rel="nofollow">Konrad West</a> <small><b><a href="../../../k/o/n/User_talk%7EKonrad_West_3ef5.html" title="User talk:Konrad West">TALK</a></b></small> 02:55, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1) The title is not the "only" thing you removed. You replaced the .net with a .org (in fact, you just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bible_Students&amp;diff=20158678&amp;oldid=20157951" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bible_Students&amp;diff=20158678&amp;oldid=20157951" rel="nofollow">did it again</a>), effectively deleting the link.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2)I don't know how "official" that website is. It was never listed as "official", I put "Bible Students Online" as the title of the link because that's the name of the website. If you want to put another name ok, just <b>don't delete the link</b>. I'm particularly annoyed because that website looks like it has a lot of information on the Bible Students - more than the others.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3)You still insist that your own website should be somehow listed as "official". I don't see how it has more of a claim that biblestudents.net who, mind you, was never listed as such. - <small>unsigned post by <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlammifer_bbb8.html" title="User:Flammifer">Flammifer</a></small>

<p>I think there is a major misunderstanding here, on both our parts. First, when you listed the link at the top of the list with the name "Bible Students Online" it gives the impression that it is the official Bible Student website, which it is not. It is a personal website made by an individual - not even an Ecclesia - and as a result represents merely the ideas of that one person. Because Bible Students do not have a central headquarters like JWs, every Bible Student is free to have differing views of some points. Thus, no website is able to claim a representative and balanced view of Bible Student views except for Pastor-Russell.com which is backed by Ecclesia's worldwide. Yet, even some of those Ecclesia's disagree with each other on some of the finer shades of certain doctrines. The link to biblestudents.net should remain, I have no disagreement with that. The replacement by me of net with org was because .org is an Ecclesia website, and .net is an individual website. Therefore, of the two only one has the broader view more representative of Bible Students, although not entirely. (generically speaking) When referring to Pastor-Russell.com as "my" website, you are mistaken. I am not an individual on the prowl seeking to paste up "my own" website, it is supported by Ecclesia's worldwide, as mentioned a moment ago. Hopefully that clears a few things up. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastorRussell_d5b9.html" title="User:PastorRussell">PastorRussell</a> 03:15, 03 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think you are missing the point due to some unintentional ignorance on your part as to the situation. Honestly, I really am stymied by all the attempts to give a more official status to the JWs but to ignore us. We follow a congregational style of order, and therefore have no central "headquarters." This means that each congregation (Ecclesia) is independent of another. If your definition of 'official' means that something is run by an estate or central headquarters then we have two problems: (1) your definition is too narrow, and (2) nobody outside of a congregation has an 'official' anything. We operate differently and function differently. Certain entries in Wikipedia entries are broad and cover many areas, groups, and functions, and shouldn't be made to narrowly follow only one set order of things down to the very word else others are ignored and left out. Let me give you an example of the idea: when the Evangelical Alliance was formed in 1845 the Quakers and a few other groups objected to certain clauses of their charter because it would leave them out, in essence ignoring their existence. So, certain words were changed to acknowledge the problem and become more inclusive. As another example, the process of ordination merely means that one has been chosen by a group of individuals that agree to make one an elder, pastor, etc... It has nothing to do with being an accredited organized religion. If one were to assume that, then nobody can ever be considered chosen ("ordained") for anything. No minister outside of organized Christianity would have any validity. Under that assumption no Wikipedia entry of a minister would be 'proper' because 'he isn't properly ordained.' It also concerns me that a few of you guys seem to be following me around and "correcting" everything I do under cover of making sure things are edited properly. That is neither ethical, nor moral. Oh, of course I'm not perfect, and will make mistakes, but you aren't Bible Students, and you have no respect for Pastor Russell or his ministry. If you want to 'wikify' something, fine and good, but to follow me around and hound me is quite frightening and highly improper. Leave me alone. Leave the Bible Student entry alone. Leave the Pastor Russell entry alone. Let Bible Students work on it. It's about us, not you. If you want to make an entry on anti-JWs or anti-Bible Students, go right ahead. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastorRussell_d5b9.html" title="User:PastorRussell">PastorRussell</a> 14:05, 04 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If there is no way to define something as "official" in this context (because there is in others&#160;! - when an organization has a lot of legal standing, when a person has an estate, etc.), then it's better to leave the word out altogether.</dd>

<dd>What's bugging me is that on one side you're promoting a website pastor-russell.com, by putting links to it everywhere (ok, only three or four articles as far as I can remember), and on the other side, you seem quite keen on downplaying <i>another</i> general website on the Bible Students and their history - by deleting the link three times (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bible_Students&amp;diff=19381422&amp;oldid=19381311" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bible_Students&amp;diff=19381422&amp;oldid=19381311" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bible_Students&amp;diff=19308221&amp;oldid=19300208" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bible_Students&amp;diff=19308221&amp;oldid=19300208" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bible_Students&amp;diff=20158678&amp;oldid=20157951" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bible_Students&amp;diff=20158678&amp;oldid=20157951" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bible_Students&amp;diff=20161154&amp;oldid=19489037" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bible_Students&amp;diff=20161154&amp;oldid=19489037" rel="nofollow">claiming you didn't</a>; then by insisting that it's just a "personal website" and not as representative of pastor-russell.org. Well, we've only got your word that pastor-russell.com is "better" or "more official" or "has more support" than biblestudents.net. And since verifiability is important on wikipedia, that's not enough.</dd>

<dd>As for calling us to leave the Bible Students and Pastor Russell articles entirely in your hands, I'm sorry but it won't happen. I'm not interested in pro- or anti-, I'm interested in keeping up the quality of wikipedia by having good, balanced, well-researched and verifiable articles. You probably have the most knowledge around on the subject among all people participating, which is good, but you also don't seem <i>that</i> keen on following wikipedia policies. Maybe you should go try and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Opentask" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Opentask" rel="nofollow">improve a few articles</a> unrelated to the topic at hand, just to get a better feeling of how the wikipedia process works. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlammifer_bbb8.html" title="User:Flammifer">Flammifer</a> 01:41, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What I find interesting is that Pastorrussell.com is listed as the "Official website of everything Pastor Russell." My question is by whose authority? Who gave YOU the authority to put up a site and then call it "official"? You say Bible Students Online is an individuals website, yet everything affiliated with teh site is under Bible Student Ministries, ordering, payments, certain books, are under the name Bible Student Ministries. And yet pastorrussell.com is the actual individual website, accordingly it is owned and operated by a Eric Patterson. Now is Eric Patterson an individual or a corporation?</p>

<p>As "Bible Students" also refers to other groups, I renamed this page "Associated Bible Students".</p>
<p>I agree that Bible Students" *mainly* refers to this group, but, I think it's more clear this way, since there are also "Free Bible Students" that don't seem to have many (present) contacts with the group described in this page (they broke off before Russell's death). (Interestingly, the link to the german equivalent is "Freie Bibelforscher", "Free Bible Students", which may be misleading. Though the german page also seems to be talking of the same movement, and makes no mention of the 1909 split)</p>
<p>This page should also be better integrated with the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible_Student_Movement_040a.html" title="Bible Student Movement">Bible Student Movement</a>. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlammifer_bbb8.html" title="User:Flammifer">Flammifer</a> 04:20, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is no such thing as "Associated Bible Students". Nobody uses that name except certain Ecclesias. (congregations) The majority simply refer to themselves as "Bible Students". Why are just a few of you guys moving OUR history around when you have no connection to it? If you were a Catholic, and I attempted to write your history, you would be greatly concerned about accuracy, and would most definitely defend what you believed were the facts. The same applies here. What is going on is absolutely appalling. You have highjacked these two articles and attempted to make them in your own image (some of you more concerned with controversy than honesty). <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastorRussell_d5b9.html" title="User:PastorRussell">PastorRussell</a> 16:55, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>PastorRussell, it's best to leave accusations about motives out- <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>. As far as accuracy, everyone wants it to be accurate. If there isn't an "Associated Bible Students", then let's fix it. Better to make suggestions about fixing that having a go at people who are taking the time to help out with an article that they had no prior interest in (not me, I mean <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlammifer_bbb8.html" title="User:Flammifer">Flammifer</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> and others). --<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonrad_West_6f02.html" title="User:Konrad West">K.</a> <small>AKA</small> <a href="http://www.konradwest.com" class="external text" title="http://www.konradwest.com" rel="nofollow">Konrad West</a> <small><b><a href="../../../k/o/n/User_talk%7EKonrad_West_3ef5.html" title="User talk:Konrad West">TALK</a></b></small> 23:54, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Associated Bible Students" was the best name I could come up for what I see as a part of the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible_Student_movement_64d7.html" title="Bible Student movement">Bible Student movement</a>. I'm not the first one to use that name, and as far as I an tell it's the one most commonly used to seperate them from other groups like the Free Bible Students.</p>
<p>The Websites listed here only (or mainly, I haven't checked everything) link to each other. The "Free Bible Students" websites only link / talk about each other. The Layman's Home Missionary movement ignores the others. That seems pretty indicative of several "sub-movements", and it correlates pretty accurately with what I've seen in <a href="http://www.xjw-central.com/bsprofile.html" class="external text" title="http://www.xjw-central.com/bsprofile.html" rel="nofollow">other sources</a>.</p>
<p>If Protestants claims that, say that catholics are not christians, should that be enough for having the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> article talk only about protestants&#160;?</p>
<p>Maybe this article would be better as Bible Students (Associated Bible Students), or as a subsection of <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible_Students_eeeb.html" title="Bible Students">Bible Students</a>, I don't know. The way it was before, it implied that the Free Bible Students or the LHMM never existed. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlammifer_bbb8.html" title="User:Flammifer">Flammifer</a> 04:34, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
