	    <p>The <b>Association in Scotland to Research into Astronautics Ltd.</b> (<a href="http://www.astra.org.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.astra.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">ASTRA</a>), is a spaceflight and astronomical society which adopted its constitution on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_20.html" title="November 20">November 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>, when originally called the <i><b>A</b>ssociation in <b>S</b>cotland for <b>T</b>echnology and <b>R</b>esearch in <b>A</b>stronautics</i>, later changed to; <i><b>t</b>o <b>R</b>esearch into <b>A</b>stronautics</i> at the insistence of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Companies_House_444d.html" title="Companies House">Companies House</a>.</p>
<p>ASTRA registered as a charitable company limited by guarantee in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a> when <a href="../../../c/o/m/Companies_House_444d.html" title="Companies House">Companies House</a> forced the name-change.</p>

<p>The Waverider reentry vehicle was devised by Professor Terence Nonweiler of Queen's College, Belfast, and was intended to be the manned spacecraft in the British space programme based on the <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Streak_missile_a074.html" title="Blue Streak missile">Blue Streak missile</a>. The programme was cancelled by the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Macmillan_7e10.html" title="Harold Macmillan">Macmillan</a> government, but work on Waverider continued at the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Aircraft_Establishment_edec.html" title="Royal Aircraft Establishment">Royal Aircraft Establishment</a>, Farnborough - mainly with a view to establishing Waverider's potential as a Mach 6 airliner. During this period (1960 - 65) at least one Waverider was tested at the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Woomera+Rocket+Range&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Woomera+Rocket+Range&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">Woomera Rocket Range</a>, <s>mounted on the nose of an air-launched <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Steel_missile_8a09.html" title="Blue Steel missile">Blue Steel missile</a>.</s> There were rumours that free-flight tests were also conducted at this time. The nearest thing to it seems to have been tests of X and Y-winged projectiles - in effect, four or three Waveriders mounted back-to-back - at <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASA_1f99.html" title="NASA">NASA</a>'s <a href="../../../a/m/e/Ames_Research_Center_a528.html" title="Ames Research Center">Ames Research Center</a>.</p>
<p>Professor Nonweiler became a member of the precursor to ASTRA just after he became Professor of Aerodynamics and Fluid Mechanics at Glasgow University, and kept his membership after ASTRA's independence. He moved to New Zealand in <a href="../../../m/a/y/May.html" title="May">May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a> to become Professor of Applied Mathematics at the University of Wellington. At the ASTRA AGM that year Professor Nonweiler was nominated for Honorary Membership by the Ian Downie, and he accepted from New Zealand.</p>
<p>When Duncan Lunan spoke on "Man and the Planets" at the View from Earth symposium in California in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> ), it attracted the attention of the <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory_eec3.html" title="Jet Propulsion Laboratory">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a>, Pasadena, whose Dr. Jim Randolph attended the first ever rocket launch of a Waverider to free flight, at Brisbane Glen outside Largs, in September 1985 shortly after ASTRA member Gordon Ross solved the problem of subsonic flight stability.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../m/a/y/May.html" title="May">May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> Professor Nonweiler came back to Glasgow for a two-day conference with Jim Randolph, because by that time Waverider was a serious contender to be the carrier vehicle for the NASA/<a href="../../../j/p/l/JPL_878e.html" title="JPL">JPL</a> <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Starprobe+mission&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Starprobe+mission&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">Starprobe mission</a> to send an instrumented vehicle to within four solar radii (3 million km) of the surface of the Sun. In theory the mission could be accomplished by Jupiter slingshot, but the radiation hazards and the very long flight time made that unpromising. Aerogravity manoeuvres in the atmospheres of the inner planets could put the probe into a trajectory giving solar encounters every two to three months, but would require a carrier with a very high lift-to-drag ratio at high Mach numbers - for which Waverider seemed the best candidate, as Jim Randolph confirmed on his third visit to Scotland in April 1990.</p>
<p>In 1989 Gordon Ross completed a radio-controlled flying model, test-flown (another first for ASTRA) by Richard Newlands until it was crippled in a hard landing. It was rebuilt as an exhibition model, and it and the other surviving models from the 1980s are now in the care of <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow_Museum_of_Transport_7052.html" title="Glasgow Museum of Transport">Glasgow's Museum of Transport</a>.</p>

<p>ASTRA traces its roots back to <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a> when Oscar Schwiglhofer, a member of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Interplanetary_Society_663d.html" title="British Interplanetary Society">British Interplanetary Society</a> (BIS) (and a former student of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermann_Oberth_1412.html" title="Hermann Oberth">Hermann Oberth</a>, who was ASTRA's first honorary member), started a Scottish branch, leading to great success. This success was met with resistance from BIS London.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a> the society formally became ASTRA as the members had had enough of the BIS in London. Although no such animosity lives today!</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970s</a>, ASTRA was holding discussion meetings concerning how best to use the resources within the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_System_ac3e.html" title="Solar System">Solar System</a>, for example by mining the asteroids. Out of these discussions, three books were written by <a href="../../../d/u/n/Duncan_Lunan_6db6.html" title="Duncan Lunan">Duncan Lunan</a>, part of their sales proceeds going to ASTRA. In order to receive the sales proceeds it was decided to make ASTRA a registered charity, which in those days meant you had also to become a company, which ASTRA still is. Although these books are now out of print, they were translated into numerous languages and sold well in their day.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a> ASTRA registered as a charitable company limited by guarantee.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a> the <a href="../../../w/a/v/Waverider.html" title="Waverider">Waverider</a> shape was incorporated into a new ASTRA logo.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, ASTRA saved <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airdrie_Public_Observatory_9d65.html" title="Airdrie Public Observatory">Airdrie Public Observatory</a>, atop Airdrie Public Library, from being scrapped - the previous curators had not taken great care of the observatory and it had suffered badly in a storm. ASTRA offered to repair the telescope and drive if the then Monklands District Council would repair the dome. This they duly did and ASTRA has been running the observatory, now on behalf of North Lanarkshire Council, ever since.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> the 25th anniversary of ASTRA managing Airdrie Public Observatory was celebrated, and the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Society.</p>
