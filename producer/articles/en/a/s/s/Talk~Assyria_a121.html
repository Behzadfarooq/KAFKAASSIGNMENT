<p>It could be referring to the Assyrian <i>state</i> beginning during the time of Sumer and Akkad and the Assyrian <i>empire</i> after Babylon.

<p>Modern Assyrians are estimated between 3-5 million.They have been persecuted since the fall of their empire (Assyria).They speak Assyrian or "Syriac".It contains two dialects East and West Assyrian.They do relate to the historical Assyrians and the Assyrians have also kept the names of their kings as names of their sons Ashur.Sargon.Nimrod with more.Most Assyrians lives todays in Iraq about 1 million Assyrians lives there and 500.000 in Syria the rest are in diaspora.For more information i suggest to read in <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrians.html" title="Assyrians">Assyrians</a>.--<a href="../../../a/s/s/User%7EAssyria_90_1b6b.html" title="User:Assyria 90">Sargon</a> 10:05, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Are all of these references to the OT necessary? Isn't this meant to be an encyclopaedia, rather than a surmising of the Bible? I may be wrong here, and the OT may be our only source of historical knowledge on Assyria (which I sincerely doubt), but this entire page reads a hell of a lot like a paraphrasing of the OT. The following is my biggest bone of contention: "in fulfillment of the prophecies of Isaiah (10:5–19), Nahum (3:19), and Zephaniah(3:13)." I mean, what the heck is that all about? Is Wikipedia now a Christian apologetics ministry? I am going to remove this at once, and I am sorely tempted to remove the Bible references (and perhaps put them in a separate Sources section at the bottom for reference?). <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolocrunch_3682.html" title="User:Polocrunch">Polocrunch</a></p>

"Of the early history of the kingdom of Assyria, little is positively known. According to some Judeo-Christian traditions, the city of Ashur (also spelled Assur or Aššur) was founded by Ashur the son of Shem, who was deified by later generations as the city's patron god."</p>
<p>Does anyone have any information on this? I've never heard that he was deified, nor have I really heard of the process of the deification of mortals in general in Assyrian history. I'd like to know when these "later generations" were. NisabaGray</p>

<p>In the Old Assyrian City-State section, the city-state is spelled as "Ashur" and "Ashshur". I assume the latter is a typo, but it's in there twice. 12.149.13.1 16:11, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you really want to get technically correct, it's "Aŝŝur"... (ŝ) representing the sh sound... But one will encounter a number of different ways of rendering it in English, and it's not really a big deal... Recently someone has been changing instances of "Ashshur" to "Assur", which is also fine, only it looks like they must have missed a couple, that's all..

<p>There are <b>three main modes</b> of spelling the city/god “A” in the literature:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ashur</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Aššur</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Assur</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Some odd spellings also occur, such as <b>Ashshur</b>, <b>Asshur</b>, <b>Aschur</b>, and <b>Asur</b>.</p>
<p>The issue is of course how the ancient Assyrian <a href="../../../c/u/n/Cuneiform.html" title="Cuneiform">cuneiform</a> sign for the sound <i>š</i> should be written using our modern <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_alphabet.html" title="Latin alphabet">Latin alphabet</a>. Assyriologists prefer the use of letter <i>š</i> loaned from the <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavic.html" title="Slavic">Slavic</a> alphabet, but this is not easily recognized by non-experts in the field. Furthermore, the letter <i>š</i> is rarely found on most keyboards.</p>
<p>The sound <i>š</i> is the English <i>sh</i>-sound. Replacing <i>š</i> with <i>sh</i> is the easiest way of dealing with the sound. When double <i>š</i> occur, as in Aššur, one should not double-write <i>sh</i> as <i>shsh</i>, since this would only confuse the reader, implying the existence of an <i>h</i>-sound within the word. There is no difference in the pronounciation between a single or double <i>sh</i>-sound.</p>
<p>Another mode of writing is using <i>s</i> for <i>š</i>, like in Assur. Though easy to write, the pronounciation will not be correct. Furthermore, it does not distinguish between the two sounds <i>s</i> and <i>š</i>. Both occur in the <a href="../../../a/k/k/Akkadian_language.html" title="Akkadian language">Akkadian language</a> of the Assyrians.</p>
<p><b>NB.</b> When Hittite names were written in cuneiform, <i>š</i> was pronounced as <i>s</i> in the <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hittite_language.html" title="Hittite language">Hittite language</a>. Contrary to the case of the Assyrian capital <i>Aššur</i>, the Hittite capital <i>Hattuša</i> is better written Hattusa, not Hattusha.</p>
<p>There are also other anomalies in rewriting Assyrian names with Latin letters. However, the most important thing to keep in mind is <b>the consistent use of one mode of spelling</b>.

<p>I was looking up the history of Arabia in the Encarta encyclopedia and I found this piece of information: <b>The earliest known events in Arabian history are migrations from the peninsula into neighboring areas. About 3500 bc, Semitic-speaking peoples of Arabian origin migrated into the valley of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Mesopotamia, supplanted the Sumerians, and became the Assyro-Babylonians.</b></p>

<dl>
<dd>It sounds more like conjecture to me, since no dates from that long ago can be certainly known, and there are absolutely no records indicating that they came from the peninsula. Usually the more classical view we find is that they were migratory <a href="../../../a/m/o/Amorite.html" title="Amorite">Amorite</a>-related tribes who lived between the Jordan and the Euphrates, ie, West, not South, of Mesopotamia, but nowadays there are always those who, for one reason or another, want to push the idea that they migrated from further south. Also, 3500 BC seems like stretching it pretty far back if you ask me, 2500 BC would be much closer the mark. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 20:26, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for responding to my question. I probably misinterpreted the Encarta article on Arabia. The author perhaps used the term "Arabian" geographically (i.e. Assyrians came from the Arabian Peninsula). Because of the way it was phrased (i.e. Semitic-speaking peoples of Arabian origin), I had assumed that the author meant that Assyrians were ethnically Arab. I assume by your response that you understood what the author meant better than I did. Anyway, my knowledge of the history of Semitic-speaking people is very limited. But from what I have read, I can tell you that the scholars who claim Assryians came from South Arabia also claim that Amorites and Canaanites came from there as well. And this theory is based on recent "archaeological exploration." --<a href="../../../i/n/a/User%7EInahet_e93c.html" title="User:Inahet">Inahet</a> 22:00, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I doubt if it's based on anything that recent.

<li>As noted at the top of this page already in Nov 2004: "the only historical importance is how they conquered Israel. Great for some, but he may like to mention some of the more significant battles: Egypt, for instance." The "Assyrian Empire" could benefit from some editing. The battles with Israel was not the main events in the Neo-Assyrian period. Egypt/Nubia, Elam, Phrygia, Urartu and Babylonia in particular was the main concern of Neo-Assyrian foreign policy.</li>

<p>Dear Codex, as expressed in edit summaries, you are, in my opinion, messing up a perfectly good ToC. Biblical references are tangential to the history of the Assyrian Empire. Yes, the Tanakh has something to contribute to the 8th century history of Canaan. But it so happens that Canaan is on the outer fringes of the Assyrian Empire. Biblical stories without confirmation from independent sources are less than reliable. The section is of more interest to Bible studies than to Assyria. Canaan and the kingdom of Judah from the perspective of Assyria, was a moderately interesting province. Conversely, Assyria from the point of view of the kingdom of Judah was highly notable as the region's superpower. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 17:46, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please stop reverting. Every major history about the Assyrians that has ever been written about the Assyrians is chock full of Biblical sources; it is only the latest tactic of the revisionist crowd to cut them out as "marginal". The Hebrew sources are every bit as valid as the others. I must ask you to stop undoing all of the grammar corrections I made for the sake of edit warring, and cease edit warring pending discussion; we were on the verge of coming to an agreement here when you did this, that is borderline vandalism to undo improvements just for pushing pov. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 17:53, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>what "revisionist" crowd? The Hebrew sources are valuable, and they were a substantial part of people's knowledge about Assyria before the 1850s, when cuneiform was deciphered. This is the 2000s. And no, I will not "edit around" your minor edits. If you mess up the ToC combined with a few minor improvements, it is not my job to pick the good bits from the bad. Please be reasonable. It is perfectly normal to discuss the Biblical references in one place. Whatever can be gathered from them about the actual history of Assyria will appear in the "History" section anyway. It's not like we quote individual cuneiform tablets in the summary, so why should we quote individual Tanakh verses, especially if they are "every bit as valid"? You see revisionism where there is none. The Tanakh is the prime source for the history of Judah and Judaism in the 7th to 6th centuries. It is not a prime source for the Assyrian Empire. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 19:21, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>By wholesale reverting, you are obliging me to go through a second time and make all the corrections again, and that's assuming your changes have merit, which is disputable. I didn't mess anything up; this article has been in the older state with references to Israel integrated in the historical text from the beginning. Please be reasonable yourself and actually look at the changes before simply reverting. Surely there can be a Biblical section, but you have already admitted your intention is to marginalize the Bible as any source whatsoever. The Bible was certainly never taken here as a primary source about all of Assyria, it is only used to shed valuable light on Assyria's interactions with Israel. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 19:32, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>fine, I don't have the energy to nitpick about this with you. Just try to write a little bit "for the enemy", ok? In general, in my experience, you tend to vastly overestimate the value of the Hebrew Bible as a historical source, I imagine because you have some religious or emotional attachement to it. Yes I agree it is interesting to discuss the interactions of Assyria with Israel, but I don't see why there shouldn't be a section specifically dedicated to this topic. Otherwise you'll do a service neither to the reader interested in Israel (the references are scattered all over the article), nor to the reader interested in Assyria (the history section is spammed with 'Bible cruft' not relevant to Assyria itself). <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 20:31, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You've touched on such a very important question here, that I feel I should carefully try to find the words to clarify my position... Here goes... While the Bible does claim to contain the word of God that man must live by ("and not by bread alone..."), I feel that this claim is after all a private matter that an individual ought to decide for oneself, and not something that another can decide for someone. Even so, although its making such a claim may well cause some to 'overestimate' its value, at the same time, this claim may cause others to underestimate its value as the wealth of historical information that it is, as a cultural window on the general time and place of its writing, and on neighbouring peoples. In this regard, it may be compared to the testimony of the Vedas or Mahabharata with regard to the very earliest Indian history, as a very complete source that has been mostly carefully preserved for an area where there are relatively few other sources that are as complete or as well preserved. It should be neither overestimated nor underestimated, but if it is possible to match it up with the other records for some kind of synchronicity, this should not be obscured, not giving extra weight to any one testimony. In the Assyrian case this is more possible than in most cases, because there are plenty of records to match them up with. Like with the Vedas, we don't even have to take the other claims of being a handbook for morals into consideration for purposes of historical inquiry, and should not be led to 'minimalize' them on that account any more than we should 'maximalise' them. So that is how I try to adopt a NPOV when I look at it.</dd>

<dd>Getting to the matter at hand, as I have said, it's not that I object to a Biblical section, but I must say it seems kind of weird to excise Israel from the historical section, when we even have a map showing the route taken by the captives, it almost reminded me of the Egyptian pharaohs at times pretending Israel did not exist and scratching out their names on the hieroglyphs, or like segregating Israelites into their own ghetto or something. Practically no one denies that Israel was a real historical entity, so why should nearly every reference to it be segregated out from the historical section? The obvious solution is to leave a mention of the important historical events that involved Israel in the Historical section, even if there is a dedicated section to Assyria references in the Bible. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 23:15, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with you in principle. The Bible, for historical purposes, should be treated no other than any other Iron Age text, i.e. <i>critically</i>, neither more nor less favourably because of its lasting religious significance. The comparison with the Vedas, or Homer, is adequate: No-one would deny that there is a historical nucleus in these texts, but no-one would take the stories contained in these texts as historical truth (see <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historicity_of_the_Iliad_b865.html" title="Historicity of the Iliad">Historicity of the Iliad</a>). The Hebrew Bible is of an age comparable to Homer and to the Indian Brahmanas. It is a very important source for the Iron Age history of Canaan and the kingdom of Judah, which is certainly a historical entity. "why should nearly every reference to [Israel] be segregated out from the historical section?" (a) because this is the Assyria article; its scope is <i>not</i> the history of Israel, and (b) it is a logical fallacy to assume that if Israel is a historical entity, that the biblical stories must therefore be historically accurate. Viz., the Mycenaeans/Achaeans are historical reality, and yet the Iliad is certainly not historically accurate (<i>portions</i> may be, but these have to be scrutinized with extreme care before a judgement can be made.

<dd>no, man, we are not segragating the references to Canaan/Judah, we are segragating <i>Biblical</i> references, i.e. discussion of one particular primary source. How many specific Ugaritic, Mitanni, Urartian or Elamite texts are discussed in detail in this article? Is there a separate section discussing the Byblos tablets or the Ugarit cuneiform archives? The Bible is given special treatment in that it gets <i>more</i> attention than other primary sources. Don't tell me that distinction does not impress itself on you. Of course there can be references to Canaan or Judah in Wikipedia's voice in the summary of the history of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. <i>Mentioning</i> Judah is not equivalent to a full discussion of all Biblical references to Assyria. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 18:15, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with Codex that the biblical sources can and should be used in the historical section because 1) from the 8th century onward they are usually accurate and reflect contemporary sources and 2) they are the most complete record of Assyrian activities we have because they have been preserved. We <i>know more</i> about what Assyria did in Canaan than we know about what it did anywhere else. The mythical and legendary parts of the Hebrew Bible don't have anything to say about Assyria anyway; everything in the Bible about Assyria deals with the Neo-Assyrian period, for which we have plenty of corroborating archaeological evidence.--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob117_1059.html" title="User:Rob117">Rob117</a> 03:32, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>First, this dispute has <b>nothing</b> to do with the present situation of Assyrians in the Middle East. The Assyrian minority living in these countries are entitled to recognition and human rights, like all people. Should the Assyrians like to incorporate ancient Assyria into their cultural heritage it is a very good thing for the preservation and study of this ancient culture.</p>
<p>Yet there is a missing 700-year-old link from the ancient Assyrians living in Ashur and Nineveh to the early Christian Assyrians living in the Roman province of Assyria. There are no cultural or linguistic continuity between the two groups.</p>
<p>"i will revert every article with European countrys saying that "there are no proof that germans are germans" (<a href="../../../a/s/s/User%7EAssyria_90_1b6b.html" title="User:Assyria 90">user:Assyria 90</a>, 19 April 2006). That is correct, the citizens of the Federal Republic of Germany are not direct descendants of the ancient Germanic peoples, like the <a href="../../../g/o/t/Goths.html" title="Goths">Goths</a>, neither are the citizens of the French Republic <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gauls.html" title="Gauls">Gauls</a>. Such claims were popular in the early 20th century with catastrophic results for the people of Europe. I don´t see why emphasis of such <i>Rassenlehre</i> would help the contemporary Assyrian people. --<a href="../../../n/a/p/User%7ENaphureya_954b.html" title="User:Naphureya">JFK</a> 12:55, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well you obviously are unware of the importance of Assyrians under Persian rule between these times. Assyrians were the Persian empires fronline soldiers in every battle, as Assyria was considered a "satellite-state" to Persia.</dd>
<dd>You must not be aware of Babylonian king Nabunaid's mother who died in 539 BC, long after the fall of Nineveh, in an inscription mentions the surviving relatives and the officials of the Assyrian kings in Harran whom she accuses of not preforming food offering and libation to the graves of the monarchs who had done so much for them, but she contends that she did. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>If the relatives and the officials of the Assyrian kings had survived, there is no reason to believe the rest of the population was wiped out.</dd>
<dd>Now of course going back to Persian rule of the Assyrians from 547 BC to all the way up to until they were captured by the Romans.</dd>
<dd>In describing the Persian invasion of Assyria by the Persian king <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrus.html" title="Cyrus">Cyrus</a>; after defeating the Medes he marched north into Assyria in 547 B.C... "Arbela, for so many centuries overshadowed by Ashur and Nineveh, regained its prestige as the new capital of Athura. Cyrus crossed the Tigris below Arbela, and Ashur fell; the gods of Ashur and Nineveh were saved only through refuge behind the walls of Babylon..." <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>The mid 19th century translation of the Persian inscriptions attest to the existence of Assyria and Assyrians as part of the Persian empire.</b> The Nagshe Rostam inscription by Darius (512-48) which lists the national types of the Persian Empire includes the Assyrians . A reference to them reads as: "Iyam Asuryah", "this is an Assyrian" which is very similar to the term "Suryah" a name christian Assyrians have identified themselves by. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>The Behistun inscription of Darius in the beginning of his rule lists 23 countries as part of his empire including: "Persis, Huza (Elam), Babiru (Babylon), Athura (Assyria)...."</b><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>Proclaims Xerexes, the king: "By the favor of Ahura Meazda; these are the people/countries of which I was king of....Persia, Media, Elam, Armenia, Drangiana, parhia, Aria, Bactri a, Sogdia, Choresmia, Babylonia, <b>ASSYRIA</b>, Stagydia, Lydia, Egypt...." <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>In a Trilingual Persepolis inscription Artaxerxes II (436 - 358 BC) Or III (358 BC to 338 BC.) among the twenty throne-bearers of various nationalities Assyrian representative is identified as; '17. This is the Assyrian'. <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>The fifth century BC <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herodotus.html" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> describes the Assyrian troops as part of the Persian empire's army of king Xerexes</b> (486-465/4): "The Assyrians went to war with helmets upon their head, made of brass, and plated in strange fashion, which is not easy to describe. .... These people, whom Greeks call Syrian, are called Assyrian by the barbarians. Herodotus Barbarians meant the Persians, the Armenians and other none Greek." Assyrians and babylonians together formed the fifth infantry and were led by Otaspes son of Artchaies. <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></dd>

<p>In conclusion, it is <b>your opinion</b>to think there were no Assyrians during the time you mentioned. There are many historians think the other way thou, backed with historical Persian inscripts. It is disapointing nowhere in wikipedia there is information about how important the Assyrians were to the Persian empire during the times mentioned.

<dd>"Assyria" is a simple toponym at this point. There is no cultural continuity.
