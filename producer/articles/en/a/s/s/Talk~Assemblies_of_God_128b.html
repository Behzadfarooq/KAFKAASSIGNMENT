<p>I am a little concerned about edits made today by User:Christiantoday. What looks like 30 or 40 edits were made within a short space of time, making it extremely difficult for other editors to trace what changes were made.

<p>This church is a highly oppinionated church and tends to feel that what they feel God says to them is the only way. I would HIGHLY encourage anyone who is willing to investigate cults, to investigate this church and share your findings. Find out how many people have been cast out of the church and how many have walked away. Question the past of the pastor and his wife and look deeper then what may show on the surface... I believe it is in the best interest of everyone that the truth be known. May the truth be known.</p>

<p>Dear Robotbeat</p>
<p>This article is about the General Council of the Assemblies of God, other denomination bearing the same name should have their own article, as it is the case of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_Assemblies_of_God%2C_International_eec4.html" title="Independent Assemblies of God, International">Independent Assemblies of God, International</a>. Not all denominations named "Assemblies of God" shares the same doctrine and practice.</p>
<p>The most authoritative sources about the the AoG, for instance <i>David B. Barrett - World Christian Encyclopedia (2001)</i>, give 11-18 million to the Assemblies of God.</p>
<p>Some AoG leaders diffuse an inacurate and exagerated data about their membership, for example, in Canada, the AoG counts the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada and the Pentecostal Assemblies of Newfoundland (togather aorund 1,500 churches) as their members because they have mutual fellowship, however, the Canadian Assemblies of God, which is actually affiliated with the AOG, is much smaller, counting with only 30 congregations throughout Canada. Same case is the <a href="../../../y/o/i/Yoido_Full_Gospel_Church_807b.html" title="Yoido Full Gospel Church">Yoido Full Gospel Church</a> which appears in many statistics as a Assembly of God church, but in reallity just the pastor, Paul Cho, it is, and not the congregation. --<a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeonardo_Alves_2e4c.html" title="User:Leonardo Alves">Leonardo Alves</a> 22:38, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(First of all, please try to spell correctly. It's a pet peeve of mine. Sorry.&#160;;) )</dd>
<dd>If you actually tried looking at the sources I gave, you'd understand. If the Brazilian Census Bureau thinks it's reasonable to have a section called "Assemblies of God" and include other denominations besides the USA affiliated ones, then I think it's appropriate to include those numbers under an article titled "Assemblies of God." In fact, it really bugs me that you keep changing it back. Please use the "15 million" figure ONLY when talking about the General Convention Assemblies of God.</dd>
<dd>And I take exception that you say that AoG leaders exaggerate the data, when they clearly have the actual statistics on their webpage. the "51 million" number is 100% TRUE when talking about AoG in general (which, if I'm not mistaken, the article is about). If you still want to use the "15 million" number, then please make a different page for each division of AoG. Thank you. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotbeat_eb25.html" title="User:Robotbeat">Robotbeat</a> 03:26, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The saying that the assemblies of God is the largest. That's a crock! we Baptists dwarf you all be the millions.</p>

<dd>AoG is the largest <i>pentecostal</i> protestant denomination. Of course there are more baptists (I go to a Baptist university). <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotbeat_eb25.html" title="User:Robotbeat">Robotbeat</a> 22:49, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Could not help but jump in this discussion as I watch this article. To give some perspective, the World Assemblies of God Fellowship (WAGF) is the body which encompasses the General Council of the Assemblies of God USA (henceforth "General Council AOG") and all the national Assemblies of God fraternal organizations throughout the world, which may assume other names (e.g., Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada). This is the body which numbers over 51 million people and as of the year 2000 was growing at 10,000 converts a day. Unlike other denominations, the Assemblies of God fraternal organizations scattered throughout the world are autonomous to the mother denomination which sent the first missionaries (the General Council AOG). This unique characteristic is due to the indigenous church planting model assumed by the General Council AOG at the outset of its missionary work. This is a broad statement, however, as various Pentecostal movements were emerging simultaneously around the world at the turn of the twentieth century without the missionary impetus of the General Council AOG. Many of these later became fraternal organizations of the loose body of like-minded Pentecostals that recently became known as the WAGF. This is why many fraternal organizations (e.g., Australian Assemblies of God) claim that the Assemblies of God is unique among movements in that it claims no one person as its founder. As a matter of record, the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada, Newfoundland, and the Yoido Full Gospel Church (not just its pastor) are all duly affiliated fraternal organizations of the World Assemblies of God Fellowship. A cursory look through their websites, literature, staff biographies, vision, ministries and doctrine attests to the fact that they are affiliated with the WAGF. For instance, the Pentecostal Assemblies of Newfoundland's College ministry is Chi Alpha Christian Fellowship and the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada cites the WAGF as an affiliated body (its website is almost identical in header format and color to that of the General Council AOG). Something must be said for the almost exponential growth and influence of the WAGF and other Pentecostal bodies. As to the exaggerated numbers, there is plenty of research from the Barna Group and others, which demonstrates the fidelity of the WAGF's statistics. Although the General Council AOG is relatively small in the United States, the evidence is out there that it is one of the fastest growing Christian organizations in the U.S., while its sister fraternal organizations are the largest or second largest Christian denomination (not just Pentecostal) in several countries.

<dd>I wanted to jump into this discussion as well, regarding the Assemblies of God, as I am an A/G General Council (USA) licensed minister. I have also attended Gordon-Conwell and I am now attending the Assemblies of God Theological Seminary. The plain fact is that the A/G has now been proven to be the largest protestant church in the world. We have recently surpassed the Baptists in worldwide numbers. I want to also incert that we remain the fastest growing Christian church in the world. I would also add that about 2 to 3 years ago the Southern Baptists came to us for help with their missions because they have realized that we have been able to reach far more people than they have. Of course, we can only help them to an extent because it is the power of the Spirit that has made us successful and not some gimmick or scheme that we use. In truth, the A/G does not take a strong enough stand on Spirit baptism and many other issues. We allow people like the previous Baptist writer to attack us without atleast defending ourselves and the scriptures. We do defend the scriptures well in our beliefs but we need to become better about bringing doctrines that are clearly false to light (i.e. eternal security). The truth of the matter is that God is changing the church around the world. Dallas Theological is one of a very few seminaries who still partially deny the power of the Spirit and his gifts. This was finalized at a conference of all evangelicals in the 90's, when the major scholars of the "anti-Spirit empowerment" movements all agreed that they could no longer deny the Spirit for today. They agreed that the biblical evidence points to the contrary. Walter Kaiser actually stood up and said that they could no longer reject the biblical evidence but that they would need time and patience from the A/G in order to change their people's minds. It has been estimated that by the next century "if Jesus doesn't return first" the pentecostal church will be the only church, due to the rapid decline of the other churches and their new acceptence of the truth. However, I do want to say that we do not wish to wear the empowerment of the Spirit as a badge or something. The baptism of the Spirit is for everyone who is a Christian. It is obvious that God wished all believers to except the gift. However, some choose to remain ignorant and thus we pray that they will see an urgency in seeking his empowerment for the church. Coming back to the topic of numbers, the Baptists are the largest in America, not the world!</dd>

<dd>Today I removed Stone Church which had been listed as a Megachurch. I just called the Stone Church office, where I was told that their auditorium holds 600 people and they have 2 services Sunday morning. I've attended weddings at this church so I know that these numbers are correct. Maximum Sunday morning attendance of 1,200 does not qualify as a Megachurch. --BibleTeacher 18:10, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Leonardo:</p>
<p>Respectfully request that you research and report AG history with more accuracy. The previous article had the history pretty close and without prejudicial language. It was also concise, which made it even nicer.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The early denomination suffered a ideological split when the Jesus Only Controversy arouse. Between the World Wars the movement kept a relative isolation from other Pentecostal and Evangelical groups, but after the WWII the AoG started an aproximation with pentecostal groups overseas, like the Federation of Pentecostal Churches in Germany, and as well as establishing fellowship within the national borders, through the Pentecostal Fellowhsip of North America and the National Association of Evangelicals.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The AoG received the influence of the Latter Rain Movement in the 1950's, which the General Council condemned.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Today the fellowship is organized under the General Council of the Assemblies of God (USA), with a constituency of 2.7 million and 12,277 churches[1]. The American AoG is very ethnically diversified, reaching people of different races and cultures.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The AG had "approximation" with overseas pentecostal groups as of 1914. After all, representatives from various countries were involved with the formation of the AG to begin with. Furthermore, once indigenous fellowships were planted or joined with overseas, approximation ensued automatically. As a matter of record, the AG was instrumental in the formation of the National Association of Evangelicals. The comment about the ideological split is historical and significant.</p>
<p>Why mention the influence of the Latter Rain Movement if the General Council condemned it? From all evidence, any influence was small and transient. It affected people in all denominations, Baptists included. This comment is in line with some of the criticisms, and misimpressions, of those outside and critical of the Pentecostal movement.</p>
<p>The fellowship within the U.S. was organized under the name "General Council of the Assemblies of God" back in 1914. The "USA" in parantheses only distinguishes it from other general councils, and there are several so named, outside of the United States. As a matter of record, this article is about the largest Pentecostal denomination in the world which is universally referred to as simply the "Assemblies of God." Due to its widespread use and meaning, the name generally applies to fraternal organizations of the World Assemblies of God Fellowship or atleast those who identify with it. All others have to distinguish themselves from the WAGF lest they become confused with them due to the widespread association of this name with the WAGF. This fact is a part of every day reality all over the world. AG adherents in say Australia, Britain, and the Bahamas for instance would say they are "Assemblies of God" just as an American AG adherent would say they too are "Assemblies of God." AG adherents in Latin American would say they are "Asambleas de Dios," while those in much of Africa and France would say they are "Assamblées de dieu" and those in Italy would say they are a part of the "Assemblee di Dio." Who is the real "Assemblies of God" adherent? They all are. Who should this article represent? All of them. It just makes sense.</p>
<p><br />
Also, Eudorus Bell was the one who called for the convening of the first General Council through his periodical. I hope this helps in the evolution of this article. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny__dj__Morales_9ff2.html" title="User:Danny &quot;dj&quot; Morales">Danny "dj" Morales</a> 12:24, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>In addition, There was also a theological (not just racial) difference with the Church of God in Christ. The Assemblies of God is generally a "two-stage" denomination, believing in Salvation and Baptism in the Holy Spirit. The Church of God in Christ is "three-stage" believing in Salvation, an instantaneous Sanctification (versus gradual), and Baptism in the Holy Spirit. Regardless of the theological difference,the theological difference was not the definitve factor that excluded African-Americans in the early formation and leadership of the organization. The racial division was heavily influenced by the social and political atmosphere at the time under <i>Jim Crow</i> laws in the United States resulting in A/G early exclusion of African-American leadership.</p>
<p>Also, Central Bible College was originally called Central Bible Institute. The name was later changed. <a href="../../../r/e/p/User%7ERepublicson_e73d.html" title="User:Republicson">Republicson</a> 11:48, 2 December 2006 (UTC)<a href="../../../r/e/p/User%7ERepublicson_e73d.html" title="User:Republicson">republicson</a></p>

However, what exists now is the most extensive listing of AOG national organizations available on the internet, a very significant fact in terms of research.

<p>I'm confused and this article didn't alleviate that confusion. Looking through all different flavours of Christianity, all seem very open to fellow Christians; however in person when encountering various sects and cults of Christianity every one uses the principal of "Except a man be born again, he CANNOT see the kingdom of God" (John 3:3) and based on that also stipulate that Roman Catholics aren't 'Christian' yet they are baptised and 'born again'.</p>
<p>Where does this double-baptism requirement stem from? Further, for AOG as with most Pentecostal groups, do they all believe that other Pentecostal groups of various ministries are 'going to hell' like they do with other ministries and sects of Christianity?</p>
<p>These are legitimate questions I have been seeking an answer to for my own personal research, no matter where I search I find every ministry and every flavour of Christianity damning all other religions including other Christian religions yet on Wikipedia I see no reference to such, so if someone would alleviate this and help me in my search by defining what the double-baptism requirement (or must it just be an adult baptism? and if so what difference does age of baptism make if one accepts it regardless?) and where the whole ongoing theological maxim of 'this is the one true way all others are false' comes into play in relation to AOG? <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJachin_f2fc.html" title="User:Jachin">Jachin</a> 04:15, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dear Confused,</p>
<p>I am not with the Assemblies of God, but I'm very familar with their teaching, as well as the Bible.</p>
<p>The A/G does not teach a requiement of double baptism. To get into heaven all one needs is to be Baptized by Holy Spirit into the Body of Christ. Which is the same as being born again. Since that event is not visible to our fellow humans, water baptism is a physical event which represents the Spiritual re-birth or being born from above as described in John 3:3 and John 3:5. In this area, A/G is very similar to what most other Evangelical Christians believe. The A/G has never taught that all who disagree go to hell. In fact the A/G has been a very prominant member of the National Association of Evangelicals ( www.nae.net ) for over 50 years.</p>
<p>If you go to the NAE web site, you'll see a list of over 50 denominations which agree with the A/G about salvation.</p>
<p>The A/G does teach Baptism into the Holy Spirit by Jesus which is for the purpose of giving the believer who already received the Holy Spirit when he got saved (see John 20:22) an additional endument of power, just like the Apostle received in Acts chapter 2.</p>
<p>The purpose of this extra power is to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>It much easier to preach the gospel when your ministry includes healing the sick and raising the dead.</p>
<p>The current movie "End of the Spear" shows how missionaries often give their lives to reach primitive people with the gospel.</p>
<p>When the Apostles preached the Gospel they did so healing the sick and raising the dead. That's how the Gospel spread thru the world so quickly by 12 poor uneducated men.</p>
<p>The A/G believe and teach that those miracles should be occuring today in the life of the believer just like they did in the lives of the Apostles as recorded in the book of Acts.</p>
<p>If you have more questions feel free to ask. pastorarthur@earthlink.net</p>
<p>Please look at the statitics. It is very old. Need to be updated 203.101.48.96 20:48, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I am so sorry to let you know that we dont believe that you NEED to be baptize in/by the Holy Spirit to go to heaven we believe in the repentance of sins and after you accepted Jesus in your heart is your duty to seek the baptisim in/of Holy Spirit but its not something that will keep you from going to heaven</p>

<p>The article doesn't clearly, concisely, and boldly explain what this group believes in, nor what makes them different from another group. -- I don't know who wrote that question.</p>
<p>I disagree. It explains what they believe and how similar they are to many other Bible believing denominations.</p>
<p>There are clickable links in the early part of this article which point to the theological statements of the Assemblies of God.</p>
<p>The note listed above, addressed to "Dear Confused" appears pretty accurate to me as well. --BibleTeacher 18:13, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>What they believe can be found clearly <a href="http://ag.org/top/Beliefs/Statement_of_Fundamental_Truths/sft_short.cfm" class="external text" title="http://ag.org/top/Beliefs/Statement_of_Fundamental_Truths/sft_short.cfm" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Its not that difficult to figure out.</p>
<p>They don't believe baptism saves you. According to <a href="http://ag.org/top/Beliefs/Statement_of_Fundamental_Truths/sft_full.cfm#5" class="external text" title="http://ag.org/top/Beliefs/Statement_of_Fundamental_Truths/sft_full.cfm#5" rel="nofollow">this page</a>, "Salvation is received through repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord Jesus Christ. By the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, being justified by grace through faith, man becomes an heir of God, according to the hope of eternal life."</p>
<p>Basically they believe the Bible is 100% absolute truth, similar to Calvinists, but they have several significant but nonessential doctrines which are different mostly due to interpretation of key verses dealing with subjects such as eternal security, spiritual gifts, and others.</p>

<p>Seems to me like the AG themselves trace their origin to the Azusa street revival in LA in the early decades of the 20th century. Very odd that the history would omit that.</p>
<p>- Yes, that's correct – the AG church considers it's start to be at the Azusa revival.</p>
<p>-Actually, the AG considers it's start to be from the Charles Parham school. Although the Azuza Street Revival was an important element, the Charasmatic renewal that sparked the Assemblies of God started when Agnes Ozman spoke in tongues at the watchnight service, 1901 AD. Offically, it formed at the first General Council Meeting at Hot Springs Arkansas in April 1914. Source- "The Assemblies of God, A Popular History" by Edith Blumhofer</p>

<li>Just goto the Assembly of God Website or ask a local pastor of what the origin of the church is. Each church is independently ran but linked to the Assemblies due to missionaries and schools. Each person needs to seek out there own salvation. The A/G church believes 100% the Bible is the infallible Word of God. At the website, you will find the history of the Assembly of God Organization. We love everyone equal just as Jesus loved everyone. Visit one and let them show how welcomed you are.</li>

<p>Reverted the article to its version as of 7 January 13:39 UTC. The article split subsequent to that version was drastic in my judgement and done without any prior discussion. The split was also indicative of a lack of understanding of the history of all fellowships that bear the name "Assemblies of God." The first incorporation of such a body was in 1914. This incorporated body gave rise to what is today known as the World Assemblies of God Fellowship (WAGF). The WAGF is the largest Pentecostal denomination in the world with a global adherence of 54.7 million people as of late 2006 <a href="http://www.worldmissions.ag.org/downloads/PPT/AGWM_Current_Facts.pps" class="external text" title="http://www.worldmissions.ag.org/downloads/PPT/AGWM_Current_Facts.pps" rel="nofollow">AGWM PowerPoint on Current Facts and Figures</a>, the fastest growing fellowship in the U.S. <a href="http://pewforum.org/news/display.php?NewsID=10315" class="external autonumber" title="http://pewforum.org/news/display.php?NewsID=10315" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, and one of the largest evangelical bodies in many countries (Iran, Burma, Cuba to name a few). As I mentioned above, given the size of the WAGF and the fact that the other similarly-named fellowships came after the General Council of the Assemblies of God (USA) (the Assemblies of God International Fellowship for instance was founded in 1922 <a href="http://www.agifellowship.org/history/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.agifellowship.org/history/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>), I would argue that the day-to-day reality around the world is that the name "Assemblies of God" is synonymous with the WAGF. This body is what the article should mostly represent and then include links to the other similarly-named fellowships. That said, if the article should be less U.S.-centric, then discussion should be undertaken as how best to represent the worldwide phenomenon known as the "Assemblies of God" movement. The floor, as always, is open to discussion. Please let's do so before such drastic action is taken without regard to facts both past and present.<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny__dj__Morales_9ff2.html" title="User:Danny &quot;dj&quot; Morales">Danny "dj" Morales</a> 00:03, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Magnum Serpentine instead of nominating it for deletion I think it would be more constructive for you to contribute to the article and let your contributions stand up with articles, facts and figures that are verifiable (and I would hope non-pejorative). Leonardo - I am at a loss explaining to you that for all practical reasons the WAGF = the Assemblies of God and the Assemblies of God = the WAGF. Why? Because the other groups are so small in comparison and because they came AFTER what is today generally known as the "Assemblies of God" (founded in 1914):</p>
<ul>
<li>The Assemblies of God International Fellowship was founded in 1922 per their own website (not 1911) <a href="http://www.agifellowship.org/history/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.agifellowship.org/history/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></li>

<li>The Independent Assemblies of God International was founded in 1935 <a href="http://www.iaogi.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iaogi.org/" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></li>
<li>The United Pentecostal Council of the Assemblies of God Incorporated was founded between the years of 1919 and 1920 <a href="http://www.upcag.net/history.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.upcag.net/history.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The WAGF is a relatively new phenomenon and one that is not readily known even by Assemblies of God adherents. I challenge you to ask people who are familiar with the Assemblies of God and ask them if they use the name "World Assemblies of God Fellowship" or "Assemblies of God." I can almost guarantee that they will simply say "Assemblies of God" and by saying so they mean what you and I know as the "World Assemblies of God Fellowship." Or, alternatively, perform a Google search of "World Assemblies of God Fellowship" versus "Assemblies of God" and take note of the search results. I guarantee that the vast majority of the "Assemblies of God" results are talking about entities affiliated with the WAGF and those that are WAGF have references to just "Assemblies of God." In the end, there is no need for disambiguation and article splitting between the various fellowships that have the name "Assemblies of God." Furthermore, I think I was the first one to even reference the WAGF in this article when the statistics were being disputed last year (see above and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Assemblies_of_God&amp;diff=40628004&amp;oldid=39861914" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Assemblies_of_God&amp;diff=40628004&amp;oldid=39861914" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>). Before then the article only mentioned the "Assemblies of God."</p>
<p>Is there a need for making up a category for just "the General Council of the Assemblies of God USA." There may be. But it will open the door for "general councils" all over the world and fellowships affiliated with the WAGF. By doing so, you are laying the seed for even more Assemblies of God oriented articles on Wikipedia. Again, this is because the WAGF is huge - the size of many countries. And because it, along with other Pentecostal groups, is growing at a staggering rate - beyond the population growth rate in many countries. For instance, from 1990 to 2006, Assemblies of God (WAGF) adherents in Africa grew from 2.14 million to 13.3 million (521%) <a href="http://africashope.org/us/" class="external autonumber" title="http://africashope.org/us/" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. Given these facts, I'm sure those in the WAGF would not mind more online readership and traffic heading in their direction. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny__dj__Morales_9ff2.html" title="User:Danny &quot;dj&quot; Morales">Danny "dj" Morales</a> 07:47, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've found this article, besides being a mess, too much US-centered. Many AG denominations, such the Brazilian, is older and bigger, than the US General Council. Also the name "Assembly of God" has been used by many congregations since 1907, which most (but not all) became affiliated with the General Council. Here in New Zealand besides the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assemblies_of_God_in_New_Zealand_a600.html" title="Assemblies of God in New Zealand">Assemblies of God in New Zealand</a> there are three independent groups which uses this name: the Samoan Assemblies of God (not affiliated with the AGNZ, but indirectly in fellowship with the WAGF); the Brazilian Assemblies of God (not affiliated with the AGNZ, but indirectly in fellowship with the WAGF); and the Scandinavian-funded Assemblies of God (not affiliated with the AGNZ, neither with the WAGF). I vote for a more simple, neat, neutral entry. --<a href="../../../o/r/l/User%7EOrleaNZ_c13d.html" title="User:OrleaNZ">OrleaNZ</a> 19:43, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with the last point, I'll start the article for the Assemblies of God (USA). For the record, the General Council of the Assemblies of God of Brazil was founded in 1930 <a href="http://www.cgadb.com.br/sobre_a/historia_cgadb.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cgadb.com.br/sobre_a/historia_cgadb.htm" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. Yes, Daniel Berg and Gunnar Vingren started their work prior to 1914, but we are talking about organizational not individual works. If we want to discuss Assemblies of God at the individual level, most (not all) of the roads lead to the United States and the Pentecostal outpouring at the turn of the last century 1906, 1901 and even earlier. AG co-founders such as Berg, Vingren, Valdez (NZ/AUS), Wigglesworth (NZ, AUS, CAN) to name just a few, were all influenced by the revival in the United States (the first three came from the United States). This is why it is hard to separate the Assemblies of God from the United States. The two are intimately connected. However, thanks to the AG's indigenous missions vision (explained above) and the fact that several non-U.S. representatives were in attendance in Hot Springs Arkansas in 1914, the movement has been simultaneously non-U.S. as well. As a side note, it is well-known that the AG's largest growth is happening outside the United States and it will not be too long before AG missionaries are sent from other countries to the United States <a href="http://www.christianpost.com/article/20050806/3786_Assemblies_of_God_Celebrates_World_Missions.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.christianpost.com/article/20050806/3786_Assemblies_of_God_Celebrates_World_Missions.htm" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. However, the AG is still holding its own in the U.S. as the tenth largest fellowship <a href="http://www.ncccusa.org/news/050330yearbook.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncccusa.org/news/050330yearbook.html" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> and fastest growing <a href="http://pewforum.org/news/display.php?NewsID=10315" class="external autonumber" title="http://pewforum.org/news/display.php?NewsID=10315" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> (an amazing fact given that the General Council does not have a door-to-door missions strategy). OrleaNZ's - you bring up some great points. The AGNZ, Samoan, and Brazilian are all ethnic-based fellowships in New Zealand. The same phenomenon exists in the United States but on an even larger scale (Latin, Hmong, Indonesian, Sub-Continental Indian, Native American, Slavic, Deaf, Black (African-American), Korean, African, Samoan, Tongan, German to name a few). These are full-fledged fellowships, with staffs, missionaries, churches, and separate funding and all are headquartered within the United States. But, they all have one thing in common. When you ask adherents what fellowship they are a part of, they will simply say "Assemblies of God" and by that they mean they are a part of the WAGF <a href="http://ag.org/top/events/General_Council_2005/News/20050806_ethnic.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://ag.org/top/events/General_Council_2005/News/20050806_ethnic.cfm" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>. And they are all correct in saying so. Interestingly, when you go to the other fellowships with "Assemblies of God" in their name they always put their complete name. Not so with fellowships affiliated the WAGF, they frequently use just "Assemblies of God." For these reasons, and those listed above, it makes NO sense to disambiguate the WAGF from the Assemblies of God. They are one and the same.</p>
<p>Magnum Serpentine - (by the way I'm curious what does Magnum Serpentine mean?), you're right about it being confusing. This partly comes with the Wikipedia territory. This article has seen constant revisions by people who have their facts wrong/misconstrued, don't include references, or are approaching the article from a POV that is negative towards the Assemblies of God (just look at the discussion above). I don't think it a stretch to say that the Assemblies of God is hated and envied by many who have the liberty to come and edit the article to sway it towards their POV. For the longest time, the only quality in this article has been the external links to verifiable articles that truly give the reader an understanding into the movement. Also, I can tell you with absolute certainty that it had the most comprehensive listing of national fellowships to be found anywhere in the world. That is huge. The surrounding article changed dramatically (and forever will with questionable content), but the links and references largely remained constant.<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny__dj__Morales_9ff2.html" title="User:Danny &quot;dj&quot; Morales">Danny "dj" Morales</a> 23:24, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>From Wikipedia's disambiguation article: On deciding to disambiguate, ask yourself: When a reader enters this term and pushes "Go", what article would they most likely be expecting to view as a result? The article that presently exists fits this definition, is less U.S.-centered, and employs Wikipedia's <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Wikipedia:Disambiguation</a> templates and guidelines. On a side note (belaboring my point), when people use English acronyms to discuss bodies affiliated with the WAGF they use "AG" or "AOG," both of which stand for "Assemblies of God." A minor point, but one that underscores the fact that WAGF = Assemblies of God and Assemblies of God = WAGF. The major point is that when readers enter in "Assemblies of God," I bet the vast majority of them are expecting to see bodies affiliated with the WAGF.<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny__dj__Morales_9ff2.html" title="User:Danny &quot;dj&quot; Morales">Danny "dj" Morales</a> 03:10, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Church statistics will always be a bone of contention and area of great uncertainty. The numbers cited in this article may be as close to a verifiable number as we are going to get. They come from the Center for the Study of Global Christianity <a href="http://www.gcts.edu/ockenga/globalchristianity/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gcts.edu/ockenga/globalchristianity/" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. They are also reflected in their World Christian Database <a href="http://worldchristiandatabase.org/wcd/" class="external autonumber" title="http://worldchristiandatabase.org/wcd/" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>. As background, Gordon-Conwell has been led by trustees and presidents such as Billy Graham, Anne Graham Lotz, and Charles Colson. It is hardly a mouthpiece for the AOG. Their numbers are actually less than those claimed by the AOG (approximately 54.7 million <a href="http://www.worldmissions.ag.org/downloads/PPT/AGWM_Current_Facts.pps" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldmissions.ag.org/downloads/PPT/AGWM_Current_Facts.pps" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>). The number seems to hover around 50 million as is even attested to by neutral sites such as adherents.com that rely on multiple sources <a href="http://www.adherents.com/adh_rb.html#International" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adherents.com/adh_rb.html#International" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>. Public policy organizations such as the Pew Forum are also tracking the growth of the AOG, as well as other Pentecostal groups, and report interesting findings in several countries <a href="http://www.googlesyndicatedsearch.com/u/pewforum?q=assemblies+of+god" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.googlesyndicatedsearch.com/u/pewforum?q=assemblies+of+god" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>. As unbelievable as it may sound, the actual numbers of adherents may be greater than even the AOG is officially reporting. There are two main reasons for this: 1. the fellowship is active in as many as 46 "restricted countries" <a href="http://worldmissions.ag.org/downloads/PDF/agwm_current_facts_06.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://worldmissions.ag.org/downloads/PDF/agwm_current_facts_06.pdf" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>, where reporting presents great difficulty due to political reasons and 2. the 275,000 congregations include "preaching points" and "outstations" <a href="http://worldmissions.ag.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://worldmissions.ag.org/" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> where reporting presents great difficulty due to logistical reasons (e.g., read how the Philippine AG was formed through these remote congregations <a href="http://www.apts.edu/ajps/05-2/05-2-%20Seleky.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.apts.edu/ajps/05-2/05-2-%20Seleky.pdf" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>). Is there any way you can cite the missionologists and statisticians who dispute the numbers? - thanks.<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny__dj__Morales_9ff2.html" title="User:Danny &quot;dj&quot; Morales">Danny "dj" Morales</a> 05:18, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know if you are familiar with scholarly research, but there are many things to be taken into consideration. I'm familiar with the CGC at Gordon-Conwell Seminary, which has a reputation by its own, but as far as I know either Billy Graham, Anne Graham Lotz, or Charles Colson, has any degree or at least published research on Science of religion, missionmetrics, statistics, therefore are not authorities on the subject. On time, the database is not theirs, but is based on the work Dr. David Barrett's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/World-Christian-Encyclopedia-Comparative-Religions/dp/0195079639" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/World-Christian-Encyclopedia-Comparative-Religions/dp/0195079639" rel="nofollow">World Christian Encyclopedia</a>, and it is the best work on the field, and I am a constant user of it. However, how Dr.Barrett acknowledges, there is want of many data, and many inaccuracies, which is natural for a monumental subject as Christianity is. One reason for the inflaction of the WAGF numbers is that it is assumed that the Brazilian AG has 22 million members, while scholarly and Brazil's census gives 3.5 millions for the WAGF affiliated work there. If you draw the data from the World Christian Encyclopedia for the AGs, you'll find a lower number than 50 millions. I'm making a table with every AG national work, to post on the article. Altough being a fourth-generation AG member, I try to be unbiased in order to know more my church how it is.

<dd>I am familiar with research protocol, that is why I asked you for references. For instance, whoever put the dispute tag should have cited a reference along with their dispute. I mentioned the three above, not because they are behind the numbers (Dr. Barrett's), but because they are behind the organization that disseminates them. My point is that the numbers do not come directly from the AG, and CGC stands behind them enough to promulgate them. These numbers are now in the mainstream. As the son of someone who used to work for the U.S. Census Bureau, I would caution people about putting much faith in census numbers when it comes specifically to both political and religious constituencies. After all, according to census numbers there are many self-described "Jedi" knights and adherents around the world. So many variables make Census numbers in these two areas bad indicators. What constitutes an adherent? What questions are being asked? Official members vs. attendants? Do the numbers take into account children? How do they take into account faiths and families that span each other? Are their socio-political pressures for people not to report their adherence (e.g. religious persecution has historically been strong against Pentecostals in Latin America)? Are there people who claim their ancestral faith over their actual faith? What about new converts (and there are many - what do they claim)? If I am really serious about finding out how many people are say in a political party, I am going to go to their registrar (the party rolls) and their comptroller. The same applies to religious constituencies. Follow their resources and understand the checks and balances (i.e. in the AG at the local, sectional, regional, district, council, and international level). As someone who is well-versed in AG government, I can tell you that it makes no sense for general councils in any country to inflate their numbers. So many resource decisions made at all levels depend upon verifiable numbers from local congregations. The numbers drive Bible school development, missionary emphases, literature dissemination, financial loans, insurance, internationally-sponsored missions projects, church position-postings and intangibles like speaking itineraries. Within the last couple years, the AG in the United States has repeatedly emphasized that there is a leadership and church/Bible School construction crisis in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The growth in adherents has literally outpaced the ability for the general councils to train leaders, equip them (say with literature), and build churches and Bible Institutes. These are all good indicators that the numbers reported by the general councils are close. I'll go back to my original point, the numbers cited here may be the best we'll get for now. The following articles may prove insightful if for nothing else: <a href="http://africashope.org/us/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://africashope.org/us/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Africa's Hope</a>, <a href="http://worldmissions.ag.org/articles/church_growth_secret.cfm" class="external text" title="http://worldmissions.ag.org/articles/church_growth_secret.cfm" rel="nofollow">The Secret of Accelerating and Lasting Growth</a>, <a href="http://worldmissions.ag.org/articles/growth_LAm_churches.cfm" class="external text" title="http://worldmissions.ag.org/articles/growth_LAm_churches.cfm" rel="nofollow">Tremendous Growth in Latin American Churches</a>, and <a href="http://ctlibrary.com/16247" class="external text" title="http://ctlibrary.com/16247" rel="nofollow">Brazil's Surging Spirituality</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny__dj__Morales_9ff2.html" title="User:Danny &quot;dj&quot; Morales">Danny "dj" Morales</a> 11:57, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article " Brazil's Surging Spirituality " seems to contradict the WMAG relatories by giving 12 million members forn the AGs in Brazil. My knowledge on the AGs in Brazil limits to a personal contact with a CGADB missionary here and some general articles where the AG in Brazil is mentioned, but I am pretty sure that the name "Assemblies of God" is a generic name for classic pentecostals in Brazil, similar to the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_God_9c39.html" title="Church of God">Church of God</a> usage in the USA. Some are calvinistic others arminian, most of them are trinitarian, but there are some Oneness ASsemblies of God there, some has a episcopal church polity, others are extremely congrationalist. Anyway, the national AGs table in on its way, and we'll see the results soon.--<a href="../../../o/r/l/User%7EOrleaNZ_c13d.html" title="User:OrleaNZ">OrleaNZ</a> 19:49, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry for the delay. You are correct in saying that the CTI article cites 12 million and that the "Assemblies of God" is a broad term in Brazil (not so in the U.S. and for most of the world). My point in citing the article was not to yield any definitive information - just more insight. The article is almost seven years old. Given the recorded growth rates and the evangelistic zeal of individual members, the numbers across evangelical lines are sure to have multiplied. But beyond projected growths, the general councils around the world themselves are reporting their recorded adherence to bodies such as the Assemblies of God World Missions department <a href="http://worldmissions.ag.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://worldmissions.ag.org/" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>. These hard numbers are what I was referring to above. Just ask your CGADB missionary contact what his/her general council is reporting. Interestingly, it has only been within the last two years that the Assemblies of God (USA) has reported world adherence at over 50 million. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny__dj__Morales_9ff2.html" title="User:Danny &quot;dj&quot; Morales">Danny "dj" Morales</a> 07:50, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
