<dd><i>The association also seems uncertain about how traditional to be.

</dl>
<p>The ABC is very clear on its website that its map excludes most exclaves for convenience, and that "<i>Ross-shire</i> and <i>Cromartyshire</i> are show as one unit" (for purposes of a simple map), not that "<i>Ross and Cromarty</i>" is a county in itself. I don't know why it doesn't show the large exclaves of Morayshire - probably cartographical laziness. If you read the "postal directory" section of the website, it is clear to the ABC that Aviemore lies in a detached portion of Morayshire; this portion is not shown on their map "for convenience". The simple map is simply that - a rough impression of the Counties. It isn't a 'manifesto'. <b>Read</b> the text if you want the 'manifesto'. This sort of speculative mud-throwing about "being unsure" is complete poppycock. People should read and understand the ABC's position before trying to extract alleged inconcsistencies from a map that is displayed with the clear warning that it makes no claims to small scale accuracy and only shows a few named exclaves for graphical convenience. 80.225.40.210 18:56, 29 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's about a minor pressure group of nutters. It's oly because some of those nutters are on Wikipedia and determined to use it to push there reactionary views by adding traditional county articles to parallel the current counties.--84.9.194.234 13:36, 3 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>These people are not "nutters", they are proud of their history and determined that politicians should not take away their identity. As it happens the traditional counties have a continuing legal existence, but even if they didn't, it would be a laudable aim to try and keep the well-known and historic names and areas in the public conscience. <a href="../../../o/w/a/User%7EOwain_2b8c.html" title="User:Owain">Owain</a> <small>(<a href="../../../o/w/a/User_talk%7EOwain_57ea.html" title="User talk:Owain">talk</a>)</small> 14:13, 3 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Strange. Weren't the counties ESTABLISHED by politicians (European ones actually - Normans, who ran an Anglo-French-Irish empire) in order to govern the country more efficiently? In the North the Normans more or less ignored traditional divisions and created large counties such as Lancashire and Yorkshire. By 1974 Lancashire had a larger population than many independent nations. Why should not local government boundaries follow changes in population and the requirements of adminstration? Of course we can REMEMBER and celebrate the historic counties - but they exist only as lines on a map.</dd>

<dd>There is a standard set of counties that have a continuing legal existence and that people continue to use. There are any number of other overlapping mediæval kingdoms that could be used to describe where a place is, but they are entirely dependent on a time-critical context. In the context of counties, the traditional set are still relevant and used today.

<p>There seems to be a revert-war going on regarding the membership size of ABC -- as if to say it's irrelevant as an entity due to the membership size not being known.

<dd>I see no such campaign. I <i>do</i> see an attempt to astroturf. This organisation is essentially negligible, it's not even the most significant traditional counties group, and the traditional counties movement is of very little significance. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 13:48, 3 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You are clearly coming from a non-neutral point-of-view then. There are articles whose wording was agreed on a long time ago that have been edited recently to push one PoV. Have you done ANY research on traditional county groups? The ABC is the umbrella organisation for many other groups such as <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friends_of_Real_Lancashire_581d.html" title="Friends of Real Lancashire">Friends of Real Lancashire</a>, whereas <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Watch_e4a6.html" title="County Watch">County Watch</a> are merely a recently-created group of individuals.

<dd>I had never heard of these people before yesterday. I have done some reading up. I have yet to find any credible evidence that they are considered significant outside theor (unstated) membership. They get fewer Google hits than I do. But thanks for providing another data point to support the evidence that it's always the admins who are non-neutral and activists who are the defenders of balance and fairness&#160;:-) <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 14:40, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You haven't heard of them, therefore they are insignificant? Good argument. Please do not use the condescending attitude that admins somehow know more about any given subject than people who have read the legislation and been researching the subject for years. <a href="../../../o/w/a/User%7EOwain_2b8c.html" title="User:Owain">Owain</a> <small>(<a href="../../../o/w/a/User_talk%7EOwain_57ea.html" title="User talk:Owain">talk</a>)</small> 14:50, 3 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not here as an admin, I'm here as an editor. One of the more important things when assessing the importance and influence of an organisation is the number of members. Refusal (clearly not simply failure) to give this information undermines the group's credibility. You allude to affiliated organsiations - which ones? How many members have they? How influential? There is nothing in this article which establishes the significance of this group, and some things which definitely undermine it. I repeat: you get fewer Google hits than I do, and I am <b>not</b> notable in any way. I have a website too (which ususally <i>does</i> work after midnight GMT. One letter in the Telegraph? Big deal - I've had dozens of letters published in the press, and been interviewed on national radio. A name check in Hansard? Big deal - I've been invited to contribute to a government consultation, and I've had early day motions put oon my behalf, and I have corresponded with Ministers and MPs. I see lots of bluster here but no actual conrete verifiable proof of actual notability or importance. So, let's start with the number of members, shall we? That would give a good indication of the significance of the organisation. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 17:23, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">User:JzG</a> - I removed the sentence "The size of the group is not known or stated", because I don't think we can <i>quite</i> say that yet - until we have a statement which can be rigorously defended by evidence, it will be continually reverted. Of course, I think the NPOV tag should stay at least until we have sorted out a rephrasing for this.</p>
<p>My problems with it are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><i>..is not known...</i> implies nobody <i>at all</i> knows - this may well not be true. Just because <i>we</i> do not know from our research, doesn't mean <i>other people</i> don't know. There is no proof that there aren't people who know</li>
<li><i>...is not stated'</i> - well it's not stated <i>on the website</i>, but it might be stated on other materials, such as press releases or lobbying documents. We just don't know.</li>
</ol>
<p>There's a difference between information being available, and us actually having it. There's a difference between what we don't know and what we can't know.</p>

<p>If only we were to ask the ABC about their membership, they might well tell us! - we're just too busy sorting out edit wars instead... if they were to refuse to tell us however, <i>then</i> we could fairly say the information is not publically available, but until we do so (or we find documentary evidence saying this info has been withheld previously, say), we can't honestly say.</p>
<p>That the membership isn't available on the website is incontrovertible, but somewhat unnotable - but I personally wouldn't object to it being included if people insist, however <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquilina_e23d.html" title="User:Aquilina">Aquilina</a> 17:27, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't understand why this keeps coming up -- this is an article <i>about a group</i> that lobbies for something that some people may find contentious, but surely this article itself is perfectly neutral and eminently factual?

<dd>Agreed. The wording is mostly paraphrased from the ABC site itself. It is trivial to compare what it says here to what it says there and notice that they are saying essentially the same thing. As an organisation, they <i>obviously</i> have a PoV, so the addition of a non-neutral PoV template to this page is ludicrous. <a href="../../../o/w/a/User%7EOwain_2b8c.html" title="User:Owain">Owain</a> <small>(<a href="../../../o/w/a/User_talk%7EOwain_57ea.html" title="User talk:Owain">talk</a>)</small> 09:44, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Read <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. What it means is that the neutrality of the article is disputed - this is a flattering portrait of the organisation but neglects crucial facts. Lack of wider coverage, no information about size etc. You canot tell form this article whether the group are significant or not (and the number of genuinely significant groups whose website fails after midnight GMT is pretty small, I'd suggest). So until the article makes it clear that this is a quixotic bunch with very limited support it is not neutral. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 12:23, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>See, it's like this: I follow British politics reasonably closely. I am familiar with many of the pressure groups like the weights &amp; measures bunch and so on, but I have never once come across any single reference to this lot. I followed them up in a few news bases (I don't have access to the really good ones as they require subscription) and got precisely zero hits. I am having enormous trouble finding any coverage of this lot at all in reliable sources. Without coverage in reliable sources, a topic is officially unverifiable per Wikipedia policy. I've seen some evidence of this agenda being pused <i>on Wikipedia</i> but very little evidence linking <i>this group</i> to any significant events or movements in the UK (which is where I live). So I am left wondering: whose word do we have, other than theirs, that they are significant? <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 17:17, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You have never come across references to "this lot", but I have. What does that prove? Nothing. The reason you won't see any mainstream news articles about them is because they don't do headline-grabbing things like stealing administrative border signs. They do boring stuff like replying to government discussion papers and othery low-profile lobbying. I have given you a small list of affiliated organisations, so rather than attacking the article from your standpoint of no knowledge, do some proper research. There are plenty of reliable sources, unless you count the official record of the House of Commons and the British Library as 'unreliable'. <a href="../../../o/w/a/User%7EOwain_2b8c.html" title="User:Owain">Owain</a> <small>(<a href="../../../o/w/a/User_talk%7EOwain_57ea.html" title="User talk:Owain">talk</a>)</small> 17:38, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The world is full of groups who have excuses for the fact that they have failed to achieve widespread coverage. They remain groups who have not achieved widespread coverage. This group gets only slightly more coverage on Google than I do, and when the BBC covered the issue the only time ABC was mentioned was by one Owain Vaughan of Monmouth, who replied using the Feedback link advocating said group and describing the archaic counties as the "real" counties, which certianly indicates a point of view. Remember, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> means representing the balance of informed opinion, not avoiding hurting the feelings of every little pressure group. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 18:44, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>I was about to suggest giving it a new title, instead of maing it a redirect, to make clear that it is very POV, but the only new titles I can come up with are "<a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_of_British_Counties_36bd.html" title="Association of British Counties">Association of British Counties</a>" and "ABC counties". <a href="../../../l/a/u/User%7ELaurel_Bush_dd09.html" title="User:Laurel Bush">Laurel Bush</a> 10:36, 30 August 2006 (UTC).</p>

<dd><i>The significance of ABC is hard to ascertain, there being no data on membership published on its website, and no evidence of widespread coverage in the British news media.</i></dd>

<p>Hard for whom to ascertain? Should an encyclopaedia article provide data from which to 'ascertain significance', rather than patronising the reader in this way?</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The "traditional counties movement" does claim some minor successes.</i></dd>

<p>What exactly is the "traditional counties movement"? Where has it 'claimed successes'? If no-one can define what this 'movement' is, it shouldn't be mentioned. Where is the evidence?</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>There is no indication of ABC's role in these.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Does this imply the ABC has a role? This passage reads as an unsubstatiated remark about an undefined 'movement' and then states that there is no provable connection with that 'movement' to the subject of this article. What redundancy!</p>

<p>Who contends it? Evidence?</p>

<dd><i>For example, the historic county of Fife, in Scotland, might more justifiably be characterised as the historic Kingdom of Fife.</i></dd>

<p>Who characterises it thus? And who claims it might be more justifiable? Evidence?</p>

<p>Refering to the <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scare_quotes.html" title="Scare quotes">scare quotes</a> article: "<i>an author who uses the term scare quotes to describe them generally does so disapprovingly</i>" - thus how exactly is this sentence <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>?</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Otherwise, the ABC fears [citation needed], having a single historic county falling within more than one region could have an adverse effect on people's cultural ties to their home county . This point is debatable since the British population is quite mobile and also includes a number of ethnic and social sub-groups, so cultural identification with counties is not universal, although there is evidence of county identification in natives of counties with long-standing rivalries such as Yorkshire and Lancashire.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>If this point is debatable, who debates it? Either someone or group should be quoted, or it is basically original research. What is the 'evidence of county identification in natives of counties with long-standing rivalries such as Yorkshire and Lancashire'?</p>

<dd><i>However, it also states on its FAQ:</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Q. Does ABC seek further local government reorganisation&#160;?</dd>
<dd>A. No, but we do wish to see reforms to certain parts of local government terminology.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If it states this, why is it necessary to have this long preceeding passage <i>speculating</i> on local Government changes that the ABC would bring about, if it itself states (with real, quoted evidence) that it wouldn't:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Currently the border between the London region and the South-East and East regions straddles numerous former county borders - so these regions would probably need to be merged. Some areas not part of Yorkshire and the Humber would be moved to a different local authority in order that they could be part of this region, as region boundaries never split authorities. Also North East Lincolnshire and North Lincolnshire would become part of the East Midlands Region, where the administrative county of Lincolnshire is located. [etc.]</i></dd>

<p>It clearly isn't relevant if the previously mentioned sentence taken from the ABC's FAQ is true.</p>

<p>Again, what is the 'traditional counties movement'? What defines it? And who claims what successes it has had? Evidence?</p>

<dd>Because "traditional counties" are not the same thing as "historic counties". There is no commitment to redraw the boundaries to where they were before the 19th century, or even before 1974. What UKIP certainly wants is to abolish regional government. I don't agree with this, but it's a reasonable aim and has nothing to do with the ASC campaign to restore the old county boundaries. Of course, like many political manifestos, this commitment could be interpreted in several ways!</dd>

<dd><i>They allege the Act specifically called them "administrative counties"</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The Act did specifically create entities called 'adminitrative counties', and these entities were refered to as such in law until 1974, when a new act created new entities which it just called 'counties'. This isn't an 'allegation', it's a simple fact. So I have removed the word 'allege', as it is redundant.</p>

<li><b>Scare quotes</b> - fully agree. The job can be done better and verifiably with phrases such as "the pre-1974 counties" or "their preferred borders", and so on.</li>

<dd>"their preferred borders" works well for me.

<li><b>Ordnance survey, first edition</b> - that edit is down to me; I found that date on their website, and thought it tallied with some other source I found; either way I'll check up on that.</li>
<li><b>promoting the idea...</b> - might be better phrased as <i>promote the reintroduction for practical use of the pre-1974 county boundaries</i> or some such. I see your point, and we should work on that sentence.</li>
<li><b>Lord of the Manor</b> - I've wanted to remove that since it was put in, but didn't for some reason. Fully agree.</li>
<li><b>No political party</b> - the statement is true as it stands, and I think it's very important to say that the ABC has no mianstream political support, and that UKIP didn't promote the ABC explicitly. Perhaps <i>No major mainstream <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_political_party.html" title="British political party">British political party</a> has declared support for the ABC or their cause in their manifestoes; however, UKIP has declared it would use the traditional county borders for administrative use in its manifesto [cite]</i></li>

<dd>I'm not sure what you're refering to as the 'two responses', but I certainly agree, as I've already mentioned, that far too much of this article lack sources, citations or evidence of any kind. ABC sources are fine as evidence of what the ABC believes, but third-party sources are certainly necessary for many other things. There are far too many "<i>some believe that...</i>", "<i>however others claim that...</i>" and "<i>however this could be viewed as...</i>" type sentences, which seemed to be added by people on both sides of this argument in tit-for-tat fashion, none of which state whom these 'some' and 'others' are, when and where they stated their beliefs, and what consequence they are that they should appear in the article. <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.26.198.108.html" title="User:82.26.198.108">82.26.198.108</a> 23:24, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The next step might be to go through and put {{fact}} next to anything you think is currently unsourced and requires it - and if we can't find relevant material on the ABC website or elsewhere in the next few days strike it out ruthlessly.

<p>Regarding the juxtaposition of the words "traditional" and "county" in the UKIP manifesto [www.ukip.org/pdf/localmanifesto.pdf] discussed above, the following alternative interpretation does not appear to have been considered. UKIP's assertion that, if elected, they would</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>return powers to traditional county and borough councils</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>could well mean that they want to return to the traditional, two-tier <i>system</i> of local government, using counties and boroughs. It doesn't make any claim that they would use the "traditional counties" discussed at length on this page, or their boundaries. The fact that the words "traditional" and "county" are adjacent would therefore be just a coincidence, and doesn't suggest a manifesto commitment to, for instance, moving <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southport.html" title="Southport">Southport</a> back into <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancashire.html" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>. --<a href="../../../r/f/b/User%7ERFBailey_ef11.html" title="User:RFBailey">RFBailey</a> 13:25, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

UKIP will re-constitute those county councils which have been abolished in successive reviews to return democracy to the most appropriate level.".

<dd>Not necessarily. For instance it could include re-establishing <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_county.html" title="Metropolitan county">metropolitan county</a> councils (which were abolished by a review in 1986) or some of those (e.g. <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland%2C_England_200e.html" title="Cleveland, England">Cleveland</a>) which were abolished later, to provide two-tier local government. Again, you are interpreting the juxtaposition of the words "traditional" and "county" to mean the term "traditional county" as discussed on this page. The sentence you have chosen is from a section where UKIP is opposing the policy of regional assemblies, preferring the use of counties. It doesn't specify what the "counties" should be.</dd>

<dd>You may be right: maybe they <i>do</i> want to return to the pre-1965 counties.

<dd>The local election manifesto (since updated, why refer to the old one?) says "Dismantle regional government and r eturn powers to traditional county and borough councils", which supports the devolution rather than the traditional counties interpretatation. The current national namifesto says: "REGIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Besides restoring power for governing Britain to our own elected parliament, UKIP will return local government to local control. County and Borough Councils need to answer to their local communities rather than obey orders from central government." which can be taken as a clarification that the word traditional is indeed intended to mean administrative not geographic boundaries. Taken together these two documents clearly do not indicate a commitment to support the traditional counties agenda. These are, incidentally, the sole mentions of the words county or counties in the documents. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 15:38, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I grant you that this may be the case, but there isn't the evidence to state it as a fact, particularly given its ambiguity and previous commitments to <i>traditional counties</i> proper made by UKIP in its past manifestos (showing that the party seems to understand what is meant by the term). Why not contact UKIP and ask for clarification? Either that or remove the first half of the third paragraph altogether, as it nothing other than speculation at present. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStringops_3dcb.html" title="User:Stringops">Stringops</a> 15:55, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Clearly it cannot mean restoring ALL abolished county councils as some of them overlap, e.g. <a href="../../../h/u/n/Huntingdonshire.html" title="Huntingdonshire">Huntingdonshire</a> County Council and <a href="../../../h/u/n/Huntingdon_and_Peterborough_9d62.html" title="Huntingdon and Peterborough">Huntingdon and Peterborough</a> County Council. Perhaps the manifesto itself is ambiguous but various UKIP blogs maintained by UKIP members leave the reader in no doubt that they do want traditional counties restored for administrative purposes. <a href="../../../o/w/a/User%7EOwain_2b8c.html" title="User:Owain">Owain</a> <small>(<a href="../../../o/w/a/User_talk%7EOwain_57ea.html" title="User talk:Owain">talk</a>)</small> 16:54, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The list of aims in the article do not match those currently advertised by the Association on its web site. Its Aims page (<a href="http://www.abcounties.co.uk/aims.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.abcounties.co.uk/aims.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.abcounties.co.uk/aims.htm</a>) was apparently updated last November. In particular, with no current mention of their desire for the Government Office Region boundaries to be re-defined, there is now no need for the long following paragraph explaining what consequences this would have. There is now also no mention of lobbying the OS for county boundary inclusion or altering the lieutenancy area boundaries. In fact, apart from its own activities, the only things the ABC wants others to do is the altering of local authority names. However, I think it needs to be highlighted that it seeks to 'persuade' (though it doesn't specify how) media, the government and private organisations to use traditional county boundaries when talking about everything except central and local government.</p>
<p>Most of its aims seem to revolve around its own promotional activities, direct from itself to the public.</p>
<p>I believe the Other Policies section therefore needs to be comprehensively re-written.</p>

<dd>Gah, you're right! Their stance on <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regions_of_England_a07f.html" title="Regions of England">regional</a> boundaries is seemingly in contradiction to their stance on local government boundaries when the two are, by necessity, linked. They seem happy for local government to be split up in all sorts of ways, but when it comes to the regions, they're of another mind. I think they feel more threatened by the larger regions than by smaller local government areas. As the regions are approaching country size, it's harder to disassociate oneself from them. I agree about the North Yorkshire <a href="../../../c/e/r/Ceremonial_county.html" title="Ceremonial county">ceremonial county</a>; I can't understand why the government doesn't have them following local government boundaries in the same way as the regions do. Surely it's easier for councils to only have to deal with one Lord Lieutenant. And, if they're happy to make them different from local government boundaries, then why don't they go the whole hog and make them match the traditional boundaries like the ABC suggest?

<p>It appears to me that these people seem to be in denial of the local government reorganisation to the point of neurosis. Do they still deny the fact that the world is round?</p>
<p>Not only is their page heavily biased but (looking through various talk pages) contibutors to this page appear to vandalise any reference to 'new' counties made by anyone else.</p>
<p>Any article on a town or village in the United Kingdom should give the reader some basic information which should include the <b>current</b> administrative county.</p>
<p>Whether the ABC like it or not, people living in these new counties pay their Council Tax to that county and their public services (schools, children's homes, homes for the elderly, roads, libraries, leisure centres, refuse collection, etc.) are provide by that county.

<dd>You clearly have no idea what the ABC's objectives are. They do not wish to see further local government reorgansiation but want people to detach their notions of "where they are" from the ever-changing pattern of local government. This is all clearly explained in their FAQ. Many places in the UK don't have a "new county" as you put it, but unitary district/borough/city authorities, which is who they pay thir council tax to, &amp;c, but is of absolutely no geographical value whatsoever. This is what infoboxes are for — they explain who the police force are, who the local council is, what the Parliamentary constituencies are, &amp;c. These are all important and very different areas which are all given in the articles.

<dd>I wonder why the ABC feels that the counties of Scotland should be those that were organised in <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_Government_%28Scotland%29_Act_1889_dd47.html" title="Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889">Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889</a> which replaced, reorganised or at least renamed most of Scotland's districts/counties? Is the ABC merely trying to preserve the 19th century legislation passed regarding local government like <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_Government_Act_1888_1ae9.html" title="Local Government Act 1888">Local Government Act 1888</a> and the 1889 Scotland act. If so, it would surely realise that the Local Government Acts of the 1880s was only further reorganisation of local government, which is rather a transient and changes over time. (I am looking at this from a Scottish perspective and am rather ignorant of how the Acts effected England) Benson85 15:50, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wouldn't say that the LG(S)A 1889 replaced, reorganised or renamed most of Scotland's counties. Look at a map from 1888 and one from 1890. Do you see much difference? <a href="../../../o/w/a/User%7EOwain_2b8c.html" title="User:Owain">Owain</a> <small>(<a href="../../../o/w/a/User_talk%7EOwain_57ea.html" title="User talk:Owain">talk</a>)</small> 14:58, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes. Some map's do not differ, but local administration in Scotland changed, for example Dundee which had been a "County Corporate" became part of Angus. There are Shires that related to the Sheriff Courts (also Lieutenancy areas), but in terms of the actual administration of burghs, parishes and districts LG(S)A 1889 did replace a lot.

<p>Bleedin' Nora, people. Can't any of you see how ridiculous this particular section is? This is meant to be the discussion page of the <i>article</i>, not a place to vent personal angst for editors' actions on other articles or start slanging matches. Further, while I may disagree with the tone and content of some of these fairly threatening and insulting paragraphs in here, I do agree with 87.75.131.109 (or whatever IP they're currently using) that posts on discussion pages like this should not be reversed. If someone posts an insulting remark or even a pleasant remark that's completely off-topic, why can't people just ignore it instead of adding fuel to the fire by goading others? And I'm directing that to editors on both sides of the argument. To try and follow my own advice, therefore, would anyone mind replying to the section I started at the bottom a month ago? I did try to keep it relatively neutral, but I'd welcome anyone pointing out where I've erred. - <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeavens_To_Betsy_a06e.html" title="User:Heavens To Betsy">Heavens To Betsy</a> 16:00, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd just like to say that as a reader of this article I found it to have a strong undercurrent of hostility to the traditional counties point of view throughout. It's enough to make me wonder if Wikipedia, with its stated commitment to a neutral point of view, attributing opinions to their sources, is disproportionately edited by people with an anti–traditional counties agenda. 86.136.3.91 17:43, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>On the contrary, it suggests that you are one of these people with an unfortunate inability to accept that many of the views espoused by the traditional counties movement are pretty well-founded (e.g., their practice of reminding everyone that traditional counties have never been formally abolished, which if you check the relevant legislation you'll find they haven't) and supported by a large section of the public. The article should neither endorse nor condemn the ABC, but should seek to represent it in a reasonable manner. This looks like a poorly-executed rebuttal by the anti–traditional counties brigade of the ABC's views, or a poorly-executed attempt at investigative journalism by someone such as yourself trying to expose the 'nutters' you would doubtless claim constitute the membership of the ABC! 86.136.3.91 20:27, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No documents are needed as evidence the historic counties were created: a number of them pre-date the Norman conquest!

<dd>So no evidence of the creation of <b>Traditional Counties</b> so you cannot say they continue to exists if you cannot show that entities called <b>Traditional Counties</b> were ever created.

That can be anything references quotes from the Romans stuff in chronicles saga etc. You do not have any of this because it is a fantasy. Produce quotes from legislation and references to the text not just a reference to a large document.

<ol>
<li>Can someone explain why the association is described as an <i>outsider</i> pressure group. I’m not entirely certain what the adjective is trying to convey in this sense. Aren’t all pressure groups outside the general political will? It was added back in May when the interest group link was added.</li>
<li>Is it worth defining the term ‘mainstream political parties’? If no editor can find evidence of explicit association with the ABC, then shouldn’t this be ‘no political parties’ until such evidence is found? I don’t see any problem with this and, in the future, if evidence is found that a political party has always supported them or if a political party <i>starts</i> to support them, this can then be changed.</li>
<li>“ ... it would rather see an official distinction made between current administrative units known as counties, and those areas known as counties prior to the Local Government Reforms of 1974 ...” - Shouldn’t this date be altered? I thought the areas which ABC was trying to promote were those known as counties prior to the local government reforms of 1890. Those known as counties prior to 1974 were all legally abolished in that year, but were just another form of what are known as counties today (i.e. areas specifically designated as areas of local government). The ABC isn’t pushing for the recognition of the North Riding administrative county of pre-1974 (which was explicitly abolished), but the North Riding of pre-1890 (which doesn’t appear to have ever been). At least, that’s my understanding.</li>
<li>“”traditional counties movement”” - I agree that, since there is obviously more than one group with similar aims and that they try to advocate policies with the public and other bodies (policies that exist now but which did not before), this can be described as a movement. However, giving it a specific name like that I don’t feel is our place if it has not already been described as such or defined at all elsewhere. Does anybody have any feeling or information on this; on giving it such a label that we can’t prove we didn’t make up ourselves? Trouble is, I’m not sure what else to call it without giving it a rather cumbersome descriptor like, say, “the collection of similar personal and corporate policies associated with identifying legal parity between existing areas of local government and previously-defined, popular areas of geography”.</li>
</ol>

<p>When did ABC start? It doesn't seem to have existed when local government was reorganised in 1972 - 74 or 1985 - 86, at least it didn't appear in contemporary media. The earliest reference i can find is in the times of 20th July 1991, where they are described as having been "formed by about thirty county pressure groups". I'm not aware of 30 such groups existing today: maybe half a dozen: Friends of Real Lancashire, Yorkshire Ridings Society, Huntingdonshire Society, Saddleworth White Rose Society, there used to something called Voice of rutalnd, i think and some sort of Middlesex society, but they don't turn up on Google. <a href="../../../l/o/z/User%7ELozleader_fa06.html" title="User:Lozleader">Lozleader</a> 16:09, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are oblique references to some kind of "Rutland Freedom" movement in the 1960s/1970s, although I wasn't able to find anything specific. I also read a story that apparently Herefordshire protesters were sufficiently well-organised to drive a Hereford Bull down Whitehall (this from a 1970s reference) - that should show up in The Times! <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire_Ridings_Society_b25b.html" title="Yorkshire Ridings Society">Yorkshire Ridings Society</a> claim to have celebrated the first <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire_Day_2df6.html" title="Yorkshire Day">Yorkshire Day</a> in 1975.</dd>

<dd>Other groups that might be reasonably expect to exist would be Cumberland, Westmorland, Cheshire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Staffordshire, Durham, Northumberland. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 16:57, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By the way, frankly, I think by today's standards most of this article is original research and its debatable whether we should even have an article about this group, given that the only source about it is itself. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 16:58, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It does seem very difficult to find out much about this group. One purpose (not necessarily a good one) that this article serves is that it gives <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_who_advocate_traditional_British_counties_300f.html" title="Category:Wikipedians who advocate traditional British counties">these users</a> an air of legitimacy to their point of view. Somehow, it <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Association_of_British_Counties_14b5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Association of British Counties">survived an AfD</a> a while ago though. --<a href="../../../r/f/b/User%7ERFBailey_ef11.html" title="User:RFBailey">RFBailey</a> 17:41, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Giving legitimacy to a Wikipedian category (or 'an air of', as you call it) should not be a purpose that warrants an article's existence. And, yeah, I'm on there myself. I think being an existing group (lobbying, advocate, pressure, whatever) who try to affect people's opinions on a national scale (success or no) and who claim to respond to government white papers should warrant an article, though. As long as it's made clear in the article that all the things we've written about it so far are claims made by itself, then I don't think it warrants deletion. I obviously agree with you, however, that if it should ever aspire to become reasonably good, it needs several other sources to be cited. Please also remember that there's not necessarily any connections between <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_who_advocate_traditional_British_counties_300f.html" title="Category:Wikipedians who advocate traditional British counties">them</a> and any organisation. Who's to say that those people's individual views match those of the ABC, of County Watch or even each other? I think the category is intentionally vague and I probably wouldn't have joined if it had specified that its members are supporters of ABC. <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeavens_To_Betsy_a06e.html" title="User:Heavens To Betsy">Heavens To Betsy</a> 18:35, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The thing is, the critical examination of the groups claims is kind of original research: for example, its contradictory claims to seek to match the regional boundaries with its "counties", whilst claiming it doesn't want to reorganise local government again. We could gut the article leaving it only basically summarising the website, without any commentary on that.

<dd>I see what you mean there. Although we can see that they obviously contradict themselves on their own website, does it entitle us to point this out when the observation isn't published elsewhere? I make a similar point (in the section above this when I failed to get any response) about the article's use of the term 'traditional counties movement'. I have some of their journals from which I may be able to extract a bit more information to put on here but, since these are published quite amateurishly and are not available to the general public, I'm not sure if they count as suitable sources for Wikipedia. Can anyone confirm this and does anyone else have any feelings on <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen's</a> suggestion to gut the article down to the website's bare bones? That is, until we can quote some sources. I may even just contact the Association themselves to see if they keep any records of press cuttings, etc., where they've been mentioned. <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeavens_To_Betsy_a06e.html" title="User:Heavens To Betsy">Heavens To Betsy</a> 09:17, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

To be fair, even the FORL's site only includes a link to ABC's website and doesn't describe it or any of its actions, favourably or not, in their section giving extracts from their newsletter. <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeavens_To_Betsy_a06e.html" title="User:Heavens To Betsy">Heavens To Betsy</a> 11:46, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>it might be at web.archive.org, thinking about it. I'd be especially interested to know how it defined the historic county borders, if it actually bothered to do so. As a random point, it's interesting how many references to "historic counties" and "traditional counties" in Hansard, particularly by people supporting them, aren't actually compatible with the ABC's use of language - as an example look at <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Hooson_5965.html" title="Lord Hooson">Lord Hooson</a> <a href="http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040616/text/40616-09.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040616/text/40616-09.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> here - he comments very strongly indeed against Powys, describing it as "huge, unwanted, unmanageable" and noted it "ignored history, geography, loyalty, transport facilities and patterns", but nontheless uses the phrase "abolishing the historic counties of Breconshire, Radnorshire and Montgomeryshire". <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 14:47, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How do you mean his comments aren't compatible with the ABC? He disparages Powys (a principal area of 1996 which the ABC is presumably also against) and appears to lament Breconshire, Radnorshire and Montgomeryshire (which the ABC hold as traditional counties - albeit naming the first of those as Brecknockshire). <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeavens_To_Betsy_a06e.html" title="User:Heavens To Betsy">Heavens To Betsy</a> 15:52, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would say mention it (and I see you already have), if only because other information exists on this article quoting the English Democrats and UKIP.

The former is an article on the perceived entities themselves, while this is an article on an association of <i>people</i>. I agree, however, that there is some over-arching information on here not specifically about the association. Until such time as an article on the movement gets created, maybe that information belongs in a separate section on the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditional_counties_of_the_British_Isles_ff13.html" title="Traditional counties of the British Isles">Traditional counties of the British Isles</a> article which discusses the movement.

<dd>My main concern is that there are not any academic texts that purport to the existence of "traditional counties" as promoted by ABC. As both articles deal with the claims made by ABC (with considerable repetition) it would be more logical and concise for them all to go in one place. Mrsteviec 06:53, 26 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree with your first sentence, but not the second. I was always under the impression that they're not identical. ABC hold one specific view of how they feel the traditional counties should be perceived. They're not just saying, "There once was/is a county called Yorkshire in the North of England". They're saying, "We're telling you that this <i>is</i> Yorkshire, here are the specific boundaries, we are the authority, our view counts, other definitions are wrong". My view of the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditional_counties_of_the_British_Isles_ff13.html" title="Traditional counties of the British Isles">Traditional counties of the British Isles</a> article is that its intention is to describe them as the general, non-ABC adherent population understands them; as areas that have changed immensely over time, that don't conform to any one definition, that had influence on the emergence of modern local government and culture. However, even though I'm fairly certain that's the general population's view, you're right that there doesn't seem to be any source for the non-ABC view of the traditional counties. I say 'traditional counties' in the 2006 sense, though of course it would be easy enough to go far enough back and find a source for the counties published, say, 150 years ago. - <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeavens_To_Betsy_a06e.html" title="User:Heavens To Betsy">Heavens To Betsy</a> 09:54, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
