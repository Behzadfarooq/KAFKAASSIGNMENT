<p>I doubt if you are right to say that a Chaldean Church in India is the same like the church called Assyrian in other places. It is a few years back that I went thru all this but basically: there are 2 Aramaeic- language church traditions. Syrian-Orthodox (Western Aramaeic) and Assyrian Orthodox (Eastern Aramaeic). Western means: Basically from the old church inside the Roman Empire; Eastern: from the christian tradition east of the the Roman Empire - inside the Sassanid Persian Sphere. The difference was based on the cultural difference between East and West in the huge Aramaeic-Speaking culture area, and also the two separate political spheres - and coming out in doctrinal differences. Inside the Roman area the state tried to take a lot of influence on the doctrinal development of christianity - this was much less in the Sassanid area where Christians were never the official religion, if though also an important one. Thus in the west the aramaeic church joined the socalled "Monophysite" schism (together with Armenians and Egyptians including Ethiopians) - whereas the Church in the East gave refuge and a place to teach to followers of Nestorius when their line of thought was banned in the Roman Areas = the West.</p>
<p>The modern western terms are convenient although they are more or less different transscriptions of the same semitic word: They call themselves something like "siryan" - add the article "al" which is joint with an initial "s" thus making from "al-siryan" &gt;&gt;"as-siryan".</p>
<p>So basically we have Syrian Orthodox (West) and Assyrian Orthodox (East). From each of these there were groups entering into union with Rome. The Roman Catholic Church has been trying to form unions since the great schism with the Greek orthodox Church after 1056. They tried with the Greek Orthodox tradition, with the "monophysite" traditions and also with the Eastern "Assyrian" tradition. They had some success everywhere; sometimes whole dioceses went into union with Rome, sometimes only splinter groups. These make the present Catholic Churches of the oriental rites (That are the Catholics under the pope whose priests do marry).</p>
<p>Now in the Aramaeic Tradition these are mainly three uniate churches: A) The Maronites (from Syrian-Orthodox origin, early separated, complete union with Rome since crusades); B) the Syrian-Catholic Church (from Syrian-Orthodox origin since 18th century) C.) the Chaldean Church (from Assyrian Origin since 16th century)</p>
<p><br />
As far as India is concerned: Indian Old Christianity was connected to the "Assyrian Church" - largely separated from them thru the Portuguese influence in Southern India, then split: partly under Roman-Catholic, partly under Syrian-Orthodox, partly under Assyrian traditions and community. From what I hear Chaldean in India means the Catholic Uniate section of the old Indian Christian tradition (not the later Roman Catholicism like the one founded by Portuguese in Goa)- also called Syro-Malabar Rite *** --<a href="../../../k/i/p/User%7EKipala_c2f7.html" title="User:Kipala">Kipala</a> 22:05, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Im sorry but I cant dont find my sources at the moment but i have them on my mind and I will ask around for the sources. 450.000 Assyrians in the US (Almost all Assyrian Church of the East) 1.000.000 Assyrians in Iraq (700.000 Assyrian Church) 90.000 Assyrians in Sweden (40.000 Assyrian Church) 100.000 Assyrians in Germany (55.000 Assyrian Church) 600.000 Assyrians in Syria (500.000 Assyrian Church) USA.Iraq.Sweden.Germany and Syria together about 1.300.000 so then theres about 3 million more Assyrians and I and many others would say that more or less than half of them belongs to the Assyrian Church of the East.I shall try to get my sources again since my computer crashed but these numbers are mostly true. --<a href="../../../a/s/s/User%7EAssyria_90_1b6b.html" title="User:Assyria 90">Sargon</a> 18:07, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

That would be five time as much as pro-oriente.at states, which is usually considered a good source. Are we counting different things? Is pro-oriente.at only counting one of the two groups in schism? --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 19:36, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Pro Oriente is only counting the members of Mar Dinkha's church. Those who are of Assyrian ethnicity are not necessarily members of that church. The difficulty comes when Assyrian ethnicity is predicated on those who do not themselves claim it. This article is about church membership, so it might be easier to leave the issue of ethnicity for another article. Numbers in Iraq are a political hot-potato at the moment. I don't know of any accurate figures, and Assyrian political groups, trying to grasp some power, may inflate figures to their advantage (such is the way of all politicians). Because of the situation, I would be hesitant to take onboard the figures provided by political groups (I know <a href="../../../a/s/s/User%7EAssyria_90_1b6b.html" title="User:Assyria 90">Sargon</a> would disagree with me): all politicians may not be liars, but they do have ulterior motives. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 20:33, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes it would be easiest to leave the ethnicity based numbers out of this article. But surely we should state the Mar Dinkha (Chicago) and Mar Addai (Bagdad) numbers. (Did I get the name/base relationship right? I find this always most confusing).</dd>
<dd>As an aside, adherents.org which is a relatively sober source (but always only compiling from other sources), recently discussed that previous estimates on non-muslim faiths in the middle east may be severely underestimated, discussing the case of <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoroastrianism.html" title="Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrianism</a> <a href="http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html#Zoroastrianism" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html#Zoroastrianism" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</dd>

<dd>I dont really know..Gareth is a vise man but 400.000 its hard to belive since we are about 4 million Assyrians and the 3 strongest churches are the Assyrian Church.Syriac Orthodox Church and the Chaldean Catholic Church.The Syriac Orthodox Church has about 400.000 members and the Chaldean Catholic church i dont really know how many they have but id guess on 700.000 so together it would be 1.1 million so where would the rest 2.0 - 2.9 million be? The Assyrians dont have a lot of atheist nor muslims so we all must agree that the Assyrian Church of the East have more than 400.000 members or am I wrong Gareth and Pjacobi? And by the way Gareth ive learned that your a smart man and i cant disagree with you on all points but on a few i do so its up to us 3 to decide how many are estimated to the Assyrian Church since some sources are not true.--<a href="../../../a/s/s/User%7EAssyria_90_1b6b.html" title="User:Assyria 90">Sargon</a> 09:39, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is a difficult one. Historians, rather than theologians or religious historians, would generally use the word <i>Nestorian</i> to describe the type of Christianity that travelled along the Silk Road. This is especially noted in descriptions of the Nestorians in the service of the Mongol Empire. However, of course, these Nestorians were descendents of the Christians of Persia who had been tarred with that brush by the Roman Christians. The Chinese sometimes called them <i>Persians</i>, and the never called them <i>Assyrians</i>. It may be best to keep the title and add some explanation, as there is not a convenient way of expressing it otherwise. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 11:58, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've heard rumors that the remains of a very old church were found in Kyoto beneath a Buddist Temple. Can anyone confirm or deny this? If it is true, then the church would have spread all the way to one of the easternmost areas of Asia. Impressive indeed.</p>

<dd>In contrast to the <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syriac_Orthodox_Church_7abe.html" title="Syriac Orthodox Church">Syriac Orthodox Church</a> (part of Oriental Orthodoxy), the Assyrian Church is part of neither Eastern nor Oriental Orthodoxy, having split from the rest of Christianity in the <a href="../../../n/e/s/Nestorian_Schism_e709.html" title="Nestorian Schism">Nestorian Schism</a> of <a href="../../../4/3/1/431.html" title="431">431</a> AD, under the accusation that its believers heretically divided Christ into two persons. However, the Church does not characterise itself as Nestorian. It was active in the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity_in_China_1d6c.html" title="Christianity in China">spread of Christianity to China</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity_in_India_6403.html" title="Christianity in India">to India</a>, where it is known as the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaldean_Syrian_Church_6ca1.html" title="Chaldean Syrian Church">Chaldean Syrian Church</a>. Despite its historic importance, it is now a relatively small denomination.</dd>

<dd>Not Turkey or Syria, which were part of the Eastern Roman Empire. But Christians in the Persian Empire (Iran, Iraq etc.) and areas further east (such as India, China) were largely in this church. --<a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrygb_9b92.html" title="User:Henrygb">Henrygb</a> 00:59, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
