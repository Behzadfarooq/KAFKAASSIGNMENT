<p>The article starts out with "Assassination is the murder of a political figure or other important individual". That's fine. The list of assassins in the table shows people like Mehmet Ali Agca, who failed in his attempt. If he had failed in an attempt to murder Joe Bloggs the non-entity, he would not be called a murderer, simply because no murder occurred. Yet if he tries to assassinate the Pope, and fails, he's still called an assassin. This seems out of kilter with the opening sentence. Not sure how we can resolve this. Any ideas? <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 00:19, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>He would be called an 'attempted murderer', and might still be a viable example for the <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder.html" title="Murder">murder</a> article. What you really have seems a problem with the name of the table (which I renamed in the meantime to change the focus, BTW). Is it really necessary to make a mouthful of it and call it the 'Notable assassinations and attempted assassinations' subsection? I think not, though you are certainly technically correct. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadMaxDog_2e4c.html" title="User:MadMaxDog">MadMaxDog</a> 08:24, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not trying to make this harder than it needs to be. Simply put, Agca failed in his attempt to become an assassin. Does he really belong here at all? I have less of an issue with the title of the table than some of its contents. Maybe we can have a separate section listing some famous failed assassination attempts. It still troubles me as it stands now. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 04:47, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On brief reflection, what I think should happen is this: Have 2 tables, Notable Assassinations, and Notable Failed Assassination Attempts. Then we could remove the right-hand Comments column of the existing table. Those that succeeded would belong to the first table, and those that failed would belong to the second table. Any comments in the existing Comments column that are other than "succeeded" or "failed" could become footnotes to the relevant table. If you agree, I'm happy to do the work required. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 04:53, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree with you. I'll think about a name change again, but I find that splitting the table is pointless at this stage (and maybe at any stage, for it is not to be exhaustive, but only to list some notable cases for example reasons - therefore, it is doubtful whether two lists would improve the article, even if they are both good quality).</dd>

<dd>There is no article for <i>attempted assassination</i>, nor should there be.

<p>I realise this is a thorny issue, and this article is actually better than most when it comes to consstancy, but the article says that politics has to be a prime motivation, but then describeed the killing by Mossad or Palestinian guerillas as assasination. I make no comment on the morals of this, but surely taking out foot-soldiers is tactical not political? Personally I think this is because the definition is too narrow, rather than the mossad reference being incorrect. Epeeist smudge 16:24, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Israelis also consider it "sending a message", and whenever they can, they target major figures (though when those can't be found, they will go for lower level people - for, again, purely political reasons: they don't want to be seen doing nothing). So I think no change is necessary - but you can surely have a go at changing the definition, and we can then see if that takes care of your point without widening it too much. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadMaxDog_2e4c.html" title="User:MadMaxDog">MadMaxDog</a> 07:46, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Talk%7EAssassination_a374.html" title="Edit section: Terminology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Terminology</span></h2>
<p>I see a problem with terminology used in the table on Notable Assassinations &amp; Attempts. Currently they are listed as either "Failed" or "Successful". This immediately struck me as biased (reflecting the perspective of the assassin). I decided to change the terms:</p>
<p>"Failed" &gt;changed to&gt; "Attempt failed"<br />
"Successful" &gt;changed to&gt; "Leader killed"</p>
<p>My change was immediately reverted, with the comment that I was using too much "political correctness". This seemed an odd reason for reverting since I don't consider myself to be a big PC'er. But at the time I did not think of a solid rebuttal for asserting the change. ...then a few days ago it struck me that the reason why the old terms were inappropriate was that it violated the <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> policy. I re-implemented the change, citing the solid justification. Once again, this change got immediately reverted (although it took more than 9 hrs this time instead of 8 minutes - heh). The second reversion was presented with the rationale that "...'successful' is an adjective referring to an action, NOT a moral judgement". Here are my thoughts on that: I agree that 'success' is a word that refers to the action with no moral judgement. The problem is that it is a <b>biased</b> descriptor of that action. Put yourself in the shoes of a President's Secret Service agent. Can you imagine seeing your President die after taking a bullet and then calling the event "successful"? If not, then this is an indication that <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> is not being upheld.</p>
<p>I will refrain from re-applying the change to give some time to see if anyone can present a solid argument that "successful" does indeed fit with the <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> policy, or if it is in some other way a more appropriate term than "leader killed". ~ <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisnHouston_85f7.html" title="User:ChrisnHouston">ChrisnHouston</a> 22:59, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First off, I should have maybe avoided the words politically correct. As for the 'immediate revert', well, I do watchlist obsessively... Anyway, I still hold the opinion that using "successful", even with your comment explaining the view from the perspective of a bodyguard etc..., is not a violation of NPOV. Neutral point of view is concerned with an unbiased view - if you yourself agree that there is no moral judgment involved, why should it then be a problem?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We would not change a (well-referenced) Wikipedia statement saying <i>" X-land troops succeeded in crushing all remaining Y-land military units in the opening weeks of the Second Great Whatever War"</i>, even though it would certainly not be considered a very "successful" event to a Y-land citizen. Why should we act otherwise here?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am mostly concerned with replacing a simple, directly understandable word like "successful" or "failed" with a more complicated, and not as generally applicable construction. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadMaxDog_2e4c.html" title="User:MadMaxDog">MadMaxDog</a> 10:55, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>I see NPOV and morality as distinctly different issues. A comment can have absolutely nothing to do with morality, yet be infused with bias. Example: "The rower succeeded in winning the silver medal." If the goal was winning gold, then being awarded silver can be seen as a failure. A friend of mine got silver in the 84 Olympics, and to this day he considers it a failure. That is his point of view. My point of view is that his accomplishment was a success. Polar opposites, yet both valid.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is why words like "success" and "failure" must be used judiciously. The words are infused with a particular criteria that can be TOTALLY DIFFERENT from one user to the next. The author of an article may be totally oblivious that the values of major factions (perhaps even the majority) are not getting communicated. How many American Republicans would agree that the result of Ronald Reagan's shooting was a "failure"? How many Catholics worldwide would view the outcome of John Paul II's shooting a "failure"? I'd guess none, if not a very slim minority.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now I'll address your land troops example... I would not object given the wording you used because it is clear that "troops succeeded in crushing" is clear that "succeeded" fits with the goal of "troops". Now if the Assassination article would state something like, "shooter succeeded in killing", then I would not object there either (for the same reason). Likewise, I would be fine with a statement like, "Secret Service succeeded in foiling". In all of these examples, it is clear that "succeeded" represents the goal of the subject in the statement. The objection arises because the table in question does not have a distinct subject to make it clear who's values are being represented in the word "success/failure". The reason for a change to "attempt failed" is that it makes it clear that "failed" is the perspective of those making the "attempt".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do agree that it is important to avoid cumbersome terminology. But I don't see the change in question to be awkward at all. A statement you made that I totally disagree with is that the changed language is a "not as generally applicable construction". To say "leader killed" is much more general than "success", especially considering that a large group of readers (I'd say the majority) would consider a lot of these examples to be a "failure" in protecting the leader. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisnHouston_85f7.html" title="User:ChrisnHouston">ChrisnHouston</a> 03:17, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
