<p>The second attempt on the life of Mahatma Gandhi is not considered as much an attempt to assassinate, rather than an instance of anger showed by an angry young man. In May 1944 Mahatma Gandhi was released from Agha Khan Palace prison and in a very short period of time, he contracted <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaria.html" title="Malaria">malaria</a>. On the advice of doctors, he took a vacation to <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panchgani.html" title="Panchgani">Panchgani</a>, a hill station near Pune. During his stay at Panchgani, Gandhi was staying at Dilkush Bungalow. A group of 15-20 young men came to Panchgani after realizing that Gandhi was staying there. This young crowd led by Nathuram Godse came through a chartered bus. These youth held a day long protest demonstration and declined to talk to Gandhi when invited. However, by evening, during the prayer meeting, Nathuram Godse rushed towards Gandhi with a <a href="../../../d/a/g/Dagger.html" title="Dagger">dagger</a> shouting anti-Gandhi slogans. He was unable to reach Gandhi as he was overpowered by Mani Shankar Purohit (Proprietor of Surti Lodge, Pune) and D. Billare Guruji of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satara.html" title="Satara">Satara</a> (who later became a congress legislator from Mahabaleshwar).</p>
<p>The documentary evidence of this attack can be found in the disposition made by Mani Shankar Purohit and D.Billare Guruji before the Kapoor Commission set up to investigate the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. However the Kapoor Commission rejected this theory as many of the close associates of Mahatma Gandhi were not present during that time.</p>

<p>The third attempt was also a demonstration. However, people who testified before the Kapoor Commission referred it as an attempt to murder. <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahatma_Gandhi_e9af.html" title="Mahatma Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a> began his talks with <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammad_Ali_Jinnah_7d7f.html" title="Mohammad Ali Jinnah">Mohammad Ali Jinnah</a> on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_9.html" title="September 9">9 September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a> which lasted for 14 days. While leaving for <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Bombay</a> from Sevagram Ashram, a group of Hindu activists stopped him. They did not want him to go to Bombay and hold talks with Jinnah. However, these protesters were stopped by volunteers of the <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashram.html" title="Ashram">ashram</a> and the leader of this group, Nathuram Godse was again found in possession of a dagger. The policeman who found the dagger then looked up to him and joked,"Why do you want to kill Gandhi? Let's leave it to the leaders themselves... perhaps (Veer) Savarkar will finish off the job!" At which Godse retorted, "Gandhi does not require such an honour. Even the jamadar (sweeper) is enough for that!"</p>
<p>Dr. <a href="../../../s/u/s/Sushila_Nayyar_f9f5.html" title="Sushila Nayyar">Sushila Nayyar</a> testified to this effect before the Kapoor Commission and she considered this an attempt at assassination. This incident has also been portrayed in the film <i><a href="../../../g/a/n/Gandhi_%28film%29.html" title="Gandhi (film)">Gandhi</a></i> by Sir <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Attenborough_a7cb.html" title="Richard Attenborough">Richard Attenborough</a>. However in the film it is not portrayed as an attempt to murder but as a peaceful demonstration in which the demonstrators were waving black flags.</p>

<p><a href="../../../j/u/n/June_29.html" title="June 29">June 29</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>, the train carrying Mahatma Gandhi called <i>Gandhi Special</i> derailed between <a href="../../../n/e/r/Neral%2C_India_3704.html" title="Neral, India">Neral</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karjat.html" title="Karjat">Karjat</a> stations of Bombay Section. The report submitted by the motorman or driver of the train claimed that boulders were placed on the tracks of the train with the intention to derail it. The train had crashed into the boulders. The Pune police claimed that the boulders were placed to stop goods trains by looters. There were no goods trains on the section before or after the train known as the Gandhi Special carrying Gandhi and his entourage. The Police have not disclaimed sabotage and since the Gandhi Special was the only train on that route at that time, it is highly plausible that it must be the target.</p>

Except for Madanlal Pahwa and Vishnu Karkare, everyone else reached the venue through the rear entrance in a cab. Surjeet Singh was the cab driver. Madanlal Pahwa tried to bribe the driver at Birla Bhavan, named Choturam, to let him go behind the podium to take pictures of the Mahatma. However, Choturam became suspicious and asked Madanlal Pahwa, why he needed photographs from behind, and inquired about the absence of a <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camera.html" title="Camera">camera</a>. Madanlal Pahwa just left, having Choturam think he was going back to the taxi; however, he placed a cotton ball enclosing a bomb on the wall behind the podium and ignited it. The bomb went off without creating any panic. The team had left after abandoning Madanlal Pahwa.</p>

Gandhi and Jinnah in Bombay, September 1944</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>On interrogation, Madanlal Pahwa admitted that he was part of a seven member gang who wanted to kill the Mahatma. The plan was that <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madanlal_Pahwa_e204.html" title="Madanlal Pahwa">Madanlal Pahwa</a> would explode the bomb as close to the podium as possible while Digambar Bagde or Shankar Kishtaiyya would shoot Mahatma Gandhi in the head, ensuing panic and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stampede.html" title="Stampede">stampede</a>, using the chaotic situation to effect their escape. Vishnu Karkare was to compound the chaos by hurling hand grenades. However, faced with Choturam's suspicious attitude, Digambar Bagde decided not to act at the last minute, and also instructed Shankar Kishtaiyya (who was his servant) to do the same.</p>
<p>Later, Madanlal Phawa lead the police to the Marina Hotel where Nathuram Godse and Narayan Apte were staying and also to Sharief Hotel where all other gang members were staying. Everyone had left by that time and the police was only able to recover some letters and clothes which had the initials "NVG" on it. By this time they were able to identify that the members of that team were from <a href="../../../m/a/h/Maharashtra.html" title="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a>; however they were not able to establish the identity and the involvement of Nathuram Godse.</p>
<p>During the Mahatma Gandhi Murder trial, Madanlal Pahwa was identified by Mrs. Sulochana Devi, who had come to Birla Bhavan in search of her three year old son (who used to play in the servant quarters). She was the fifteenth witness in the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trial_%28law%29.html" title="Trial (law)">trial</a>, and Surjeet Singh, the driver was the fourteenth witness.</p>

<p>Is it true that on the day of the bomb blast during the search of the room at Marina Hotel clothes were found bearing the initials N.V.G. – Nathuram Vinayak Godse -? On the basis of which the police went to Bombay and requested the Bombay police to look for this person, the Bombay police assured the Delhi police to do the needful and asked them to return, but did nothing. Is it true that the Bombay Police failed in tracing Nathuram Vinayak Godse?</p>

<p>To comment on matters under investigation is both difficult and unwarranted. I can only say that after the arrest and interrogation of the bomber, an officer of Delhi police went to Bombay and briefed the C.I.D. in Bombay. After the briefing, it was decided that some people should be arrested but to arrest them immediately would lead to the other conspirators going underground. So the Delhi police and Bombay C.I.D. decided to defer the arrests for some time to enable them to uncover the conspiracy and all who were involved in it. It is true that the police were on a look out for them but all of them were not in Bombay</p>

<p>The last word(s) uttered by Mahatma Gandhi is still a matter of debate. Venkita Kalyanam, former personal assistant to Mr. Gandhi said that he was present at the spot and Gandhi did not utter a single word.</p>
<p>New Delhi's Tughlak Road police station's assistant sub-inspector Dhalu Ram says recorded Nand Lal Mehta's statement</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>...suddenly a man, who was later identified as Nathu Ram Godse took steps out of the crowd and fired three shots at Mahatmaji. Bullets hit him on the stomach and chest. The Mahatma fell down saying Ram-Ram...</p>

<p>There is no mention in the FIR that any doctor was called. It is still debated that as to why he was not rushed to hospital and was instead taken to the Birla House where he died later.</p>
