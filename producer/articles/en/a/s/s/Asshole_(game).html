<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Asshole_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Special Titles">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Special Titles</span></h3>
<p>There are 3 special titles for players during the game:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>President</b> - The winner of the previous round.</li>
<li><b>Vice President</b> - Second place in the previous round.</li>
<li><b>Asshole</b> - Last place in the previous round.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>After every hand, players must get up and switch seats so that the <i>Asshole</i> deals, and everyone is seated clockwise in order of their titles, with <i>President</i> on the dealer's left, and the player who got second to last on his right.</li>
<li>Each player is permitted to give drinks indiscriminately to any lower-ranked player.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Asshole_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Dealing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dealing</span></h3>
<p>The <i>Asshole</i> shuffles and deals the cards. All the cards are dealt, until none are left, in clockwise rotation.</p>
<p><a name="Playing" id="Playing"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Asshole_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Playing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Playing</span></h3>
<p>Play in Asshole is organized into <i>tricks</i>, much like <a href="../../../h/e/a/Hearts.html" title="Hearts">Hearts</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contract_bridge.html" title="Contract bridge">Bridge</a>.</p>
<p>The player on the dealer's left begins by leading any card, or set of matching cards. The player on his left may then play an equal number of matching cards with a higher face value, or may pass. Note that you must play the same number of cards as the lead. If the leader starts with a pair, only pairs may be played on top of it. If three-of-a-kind is lead, only three-of-a-kinds can be played on top of it. The next player may do the same, and so on. This continues until all players pass. The last person to play cards leads the next trick.</p>
<p>A few notes during gameplay:</p>
<ul>
<li>A two (2) is "clear", and a four (4) is "social".</li>
<li>When players pass, this does not limit them in any way from playing later, even during the same trick.</li>
<li>You can pass anytime you want, even if you have cards that could be played.</li>
<li>When a player matches the rank of the previously played card, the next player's turn is skipped.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Asshole_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: End of a Round">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">End of a Round</span></h3>
<p>When one player runs out of cards, he/she is out of play for the rest of the round, but the other players can continue to play to figure out the titles. Alternatively, once a player goes out, you can end the round and count remaining card values to establish titles, or simply count the number of cards remaining in each player's hand.</p>
<p>With titles decided, everyone needs to get up and move. The <i>Asshole</i> is the dealer, and the players must rearrange themselves around him so that they are seated in order of rank, clockwise.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Asshole_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Winning the Game">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Winning the Game</span></h3>
<p>The winner is the player who is <i>President</i> at the end of the game.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Asshole_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Basic Strategy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Basic Strategy</span></h3>
<p>The key to winning is getting rid of weaker cards first so that you have only stronger cards near the end of a game. If you're stuck with a low card, it will be very hard to get to play it and finish clearing your hand. However, as winning a trick lets the player lead any card to start the next trick, one weak card can be kept to be played last.</p>
<p><a name="Variant_rules" id="Variant_rules"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Asshole_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Variant rules">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Variant rules</span></h2>
<p><a name="Burn_Rule" id="Burn_Rule"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Asshole_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Burn Rule">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Burn Rule</span></h3>
<p>A variation of the Skip Rule. When a card or series of cards match the rank of the cards played during the previous turn, the round is ended. The next round begins with the player who 'burned' the last round, effectively a double turn. The burn rule is almost always used in conjunction with the 'Must match previous type' rule.</p>
<p><a name="Two_Clears" id="Two_Clears"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Asshole_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Two Clears">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Two Clears</span></h3>
<p>In the <i>Two Clears</i> variant, a single Two of any suit will end the round, and may be played at any time, regardless of the previously played cards. The player who played the Two starts the next round by playing the card(s) of his choice. In this variation, playing more than one Two at a time has no benefit, unless these are the only cards left in his/her hand. Many versions played using the <i>Two Clears</i> rule also state that if the deuce is the player's last card, or the player's last card is a deuce and one other card, then this player will automatically become the "Asshole".</p>
<p>Another possible addition to this rule is the "Red Three" Rule, in which a Three of Diamonds or Three of Hearts functions as a clear card. In this case if either black Three is played a Social is declared.</p>
<p><a name="Three_Holds.2C_Two_Clears" id="Three_Holds.2C_Two_Clears"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Asshole_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Three Holds, Two Clears">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Three Holds, Two Clears</span></h3>
<p>This is played identically to the <i>Two Clears</i> variant, except that Threes are ranked just below Twos. A single Three will hold the pile until another Three or a Two is played, and a pair of Threes will clear the pile. In this variant, then, the fours are the lowest cards, and whoever has the Four of clubs has to lead the first hand.</p>
<p><a name="Preview_Hands" id="Preview_Hands"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Asshole_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Preview Hands">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Preview Hands</span></h3>
<p>After the first round, the cards are dealt into piles equal to the number of players, but not given to any particular player. The last card dealt in each pile is turned face up. Each player chooses one of the piles in order of the players' ranks (i.e. the President chooses first, followed by the Vice-President, etc.). This allows the President to be guaranteed that at least one of their cards is of a reasonably high rank; usually a 2 if available. Tactics for picking the "best" pile include picking a pile in which the 3 of clubs is revealed if the rules state that that card always starts, or picking a pile with one fewer card in it if the deck could not be dealt perfectly evenly.</p>
<p><a name="Free_Trading" id="Free_Trading"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Asshole_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Free Trading">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Free Trading</span></h3>
<p>At the end of a round, free trading ensues between players of respective ranks (President with Asshole, Vice-President with Vice Asshole, etc.). The neutral players may join in, as long as there are other neutral players to match up with. Each player may trade any number of his/her cards with his/her trading partner, as long as both players agree to the trade. Players use their discretion as to which cards they disclose to their trading partners. Usually, once the President is done trading with the Asshole, the free trading is finished and the round begins.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Asshole_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Last card">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Last card</span></h3>
<p>If loser rules are being played, then a player reaches his or her last card, they must immediately yell "last card." If they do not do that, or if someone else yells it before them, then that player is automatically the asshole for the next round. If the player puts down the card and neither that player nor any other player calls him or her on last card he or she is in the clear; the player must be called out before their last card is put down. If a player has two of the same cards as the final hand (ie 8 of hearts and 8 of diamonds), they do not need to call last card since he or she has two cards.</p>
<p>In the case where a player has a 2 and any other card, the user can put down the other card (if it can be played), and give the 2 to whom ever he or she chooses without having to yell "last card." If the "2 Clears" variation is being played, then that move wouldn't make sense, because the player could end their turn simply by clearing with the 2, then immediately starting the next round by laying down the last card. For those playing the 4 is a social, 4s cannont be given away. 4s also may not be played as last card.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Asshole_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Social rule (or Socialism, Completion Rule)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Social rule (or Socialism, Completion Rule)</span></h3>
<p>A "social" occurs any time four cards of the same rank are on the table consecutively. When this happens, all players say "SOCIAL", and in drinking game versions everyone takes a drink.</p>
<p>If playing with the "Lateral Moves" variant, this may occur during normal game mechanics. For instance: A player will lay down two Sevens, and then the next player will lay down two Sevens. A single player laying down a four-of-a-kind is also a social.</p>
<p>Another version of the Social Rule allows the social to clears the cards similar to the "Two Clear" Variant.</p>

<p>This rule causes a joker to become a card which can social on anything. This allows the joker to be played just like a 2 in "2 Clears" rules, with the addition of being able to be played out of turn.</p>

<p>This is an extended social rule that can be used in single deck games. "Socialing" is the act of quickly playing cards out of turn in order to create a four-of-a-kind on the table. The opportunity to social is lost if the next player plays higher cards before the opportunity to socialize out-of-order is taken.</p>
<p>For example: You have two Sevens, and the last two people to play each put a single Seven on the table. You may then play out of turn and lay down your two Sevens, calling "SOCIAL!". If the next player played an eight before you had the chance to "socialize" with your two Sevens, you would not be allowed to social. The "special cards" (twos, jokers, or whatever you are using) cannot be socialed.</p>
<p>In some variants, the player laying down the social cards out-of-turn does so simply to get rid of extra cards: it doesn't change the last normal hand that was laid down on the table, and it doesn't change which player has the next turn. In other versions of the game, socializing like this ends the round, and the player who socialed is allowed to start the next round.</p>
<p>Playing with the Random Social Rule has the added benefits of increasing the speed of game play, and forcing players to remain highly attentive of the cards being played. Since the Social Rule allows particularly attentive players to get rid of their cards more quickly than others, and in some instances disrupt normal turn order preventing others from playing, it is desirable to block as many Random Socials as possible.</p>

<p>If three or more players lay down cards in sequence (ie: a 6 is laid down to open followed by a 7 and an 8) all players who played cards in sequence get to discard an additional card of their choice. If the run is in doubles, triples, or quadruples, the players get to discard two, three, and four cards, respectively.</p>

<p>From the Japanese Variant: At the beginning of a sequence, a player may lay down three or more consecutive cards of the same suit. The following players must play the same number of consecutive cards of a given suit until the pile clears. If they do so, the lowest card played must be greater than the highest card played before it.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Asshole_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Revolutions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Revolutions</span></h3>
<p>From the Japanese Variant: If a player plays a set of four or more cards, the order of the cards is reversed from descending to ascending, or vice versa. The following player must lay the same number of cards, following the new order. For example, if a player plays four 8s, the next player may play four 6s, but not four 9s. The next player could then play four 10s, but not four 5s. Sequences of revolutions may be played in this way until the pile clears.</p>
<p>Another variation of revolution is that when a player is dealt 4 cards of the same rank (or after the trading portion of the game) that he may lay all four cards down and declare revolution on the game. At this point, all the cards are re-dealt and the roles of all the players are reversed, whereas the Asshole becomes the President and vice versa. This rule is generally ignored due to its rarity, but is somewhat likely in 3-player games. If two people have a revolution dealt to them, the two revolutions would cancel each other out and the game would re-deal with everyone in their same rank or position.</p>
<p>In Israel, where cards are ranked from two to ace in order of importance, revolution is often declared by placing down a triplet of threes. When revolution occurs, the order of card placement is reversed for the entire duration of the hand, so play continues until an asshole is declared by being the last player to hold cards. This means that for the rest of the match, lower cards beat higher cards (kings beat aces, twos beat threes, etc.). This doesn't immediately make the asshole into a president, but it does give a strong advantage to any players still holding low-value cards, and taking away the advantage of all players still holding high cards, which often (but not always) results in rearrangement of the power structure at the end of the round. This prompts high-ranking players to keep threes to themselves during card exchanges. Some variations give players the ability to add any threes they are holding on top of a three or a pair of threes that have just been played, in order to complete a revolution. This cooperation may be restricted by some arbitrary rule. Once the round is over, the regular order (twos low, aces high) is restored for the next round.</p>

<p>Only the Asshole is allowed to touch cards on the table. Of course, this player has to deal the cards at the start of the game, and clear the table at the end of each round. If someone else does the Asshole's job by clearing the cards after a round (without the express consent of the President), then that player is penalized (Asshole Tendencies). In some games, it is enough for the President to make up a punishment. In other variants, a strict punishment is predetermined: The offending player has to exchange rank, place (when played with <i>Change seats after every round</i>) and cards with the Asshole, thus becoming the Asshole.</p>
<p>In some variations, the position of Asshole and President, in regard to making <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drinking_Game_Rules_d69d.html" title="Drinking Game Rules">(temporary) rules</a>, or assigning drink penalties, is reversed while the Asshole is dealing cards. (See Asshole "Powers" below)</p>

The card after that must then be of equal or greater rank, in accordance with normal game play. For example, if Player A plays a 7, Player B may play a 4, but player C must revert to normal rules and play a 4 or higher card. Similarly, pairs, triples, or quadruples of 7s must be followed by lower pairs, triples, or quadruples, respectively, in a parallel fashion as that described for single 7s.</p>

<p>In this version, the Jack can be combined with any card (or pair of cards) to automatically turn it into a double. (or triple, or quadruple, or quintuple, etc. . .) For example, a Jack could be played with an Ace to form a pair of aces, with a pair of sevens to create a triple seven, or you could chose to combine a pair of Jacks with a pair of tens to create quadruple tens. This power can be combined with nukes as well, often used in situations where nukes need to be played in pairs etc. to clear larger combination of cards. Jacks played by themselves however lose their wild property making their value proportionate to the skill of the user. During the card trades before the round, the President for instance may decide to pass up a two in favour of Jack if he or she wishes to.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Asshole_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Long Island Rules">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Long Island Rules</span></h3>
<p>Long Island Rules is a set of rules that takes a number of the above "optional rules" as fixed game mechanics, as well as adding its own unique mechanics. Combination Follow-up is in full effect, and players must conform to the number of cards (singles, doubles, trips or quads) until the pile is cleared (or 'swept') or no one can go. The most important change in LI rules are that Twos and Threes are clears (called 'Sweepers') and may end the round. However the number of sweepers needed must be one lower than the number of cards in play (x = y-1). For example: Three sweepers (2s, 3s, or a combination of 2s and 3s) are needed to clear a Quad, while two sweepers are needed to clear a triple. A person may use sweepers on their turn at any point in the game, and may place whatever they like on the table (single, double, triple, or quad) after the sweep. In games of more than three people, middlemen may free trade. President trades three cards with the Asshole, and may ask for whatever s/he desires (the Asshole has no say in what is traded). Vice-President trades two cards, in the same fashion, with the 'Vice-Asshole'. In games with many players, the rank of 'Senate' and 'House' may be put into affect (Senate is below VP, and House is above Vice Asshole) these ranks may trade 1 card in a 'free-trade' fashion. 'Presidential Powers' may only be enacted if initiated at the start of the game (not the round). Multi-decks are used in large games (usually 6+ players). Socials may only be used in a Drinking Game.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Asshole_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Trading Restrictions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Trading Restrictions</span></h3>
<p>Similar to part of Long Island Rules, some variations put additional restrictions on who is allowed to trade cards before the round, and what cards they are allowed to trade. Depending on how many players there are (more players = fewer cards per player and thus less flexibility to trade) the Asshole is required to give his/her three most valuable cards to the President. There is no choice in the matter, either by the Asshole or the President. The President is then required to trade back 3 cards of their own choosing, including (if they want) some or all of the cards given them by the Asshole. The Asshole can request specific cards to be traded back, but the President is not required to oblige. As President, one might be inclined to oblige the Asshole at least a little bit, however, since it is possible that they will have rank over you in a later round. Following the same rules, the Vice-Presdident trades 2 with the Vice-Asshole, and the Secretary trades 1 with the Vice-Vice Asshole. No other players are permitted to trade cards.</p>

<p>The President has the power to add <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drinking_Game_Rules_d69d.html" title="Drinking Game Rules">rules</a> to the game. Some variants only allow the President to make one rule during each term (hand), or only allow Presidents to make rules after winning at least three hands. But in many informal drinking game variants, the President may make rules at any time. A Presidential rule stays in effect until a future Presidential rule repeals or contradicts it. Some rules may influence game rules, such as invoking an optional rule that wasn't in effect when the game started (although the most basic rules of the game cannot be altered). Other Presidential rules are more social in nature. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thumb Master: When the President puts his or her thumb on the table, the last one to do so must drink.</li>
<li>Drinking ritual: An action or statement must be performed every time a person drinks (such as a salutation to the President), or that person must drink again.</li>
<li>The 3 D's: If the words "drink", "drank", or "drunk" are used, the user must take a drink.</li>
<li>"It's Good to be the King": This phrase must be uttered by the person playing a king.</li>
<li>Eye contact: It is illegal to make eye contact with the President when this rule is in effect.</li>
<li>Any of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Drinking_Rules_6b07.html" title="International Drinking Rules">International Drinking Rules</a>.</li>
<li>Beer Bitch: Assign one person the job of supplying the table with cold beverages.</li>
<li>Henchman: The President can assign the Vice-President (for instance) the job of enforcing game rules (useful when intoxicated players become forgetful), and grant that player the ability to punish offenders by ordering them to drink.</li>
<li>The Forehead Rule: Whenever the President drinks, everyone must put their forehead on the table; the last one to do so must also drink (try to avoid concussions and bloody noses in later rounds).</li>
<li>Table Laps: At any time, someone with a higher rank can make a lower ranking person get up and walk a complete lap of the table.</li>
<li>Last Man Standing: Often players will leave the table between hands, while the Asshole is shuffling and dealing. This rule punishes the last player to return to the table with a certain number of drinks.</li>
<li>No Names: If a proper name is spoken, the speaker must drink.</li>
<li>No Cursing: If a player curses, the player must drink.</li>
<li>Double Socials: Each social counts twice.</li>
<li>No Pointing: If a player points to another player, the pointing player must drink.</li>
<li>No Pronouns: Players are not allowed to use pronouns, such as "I", "he", "she", "it", "we", "you" or any other case of these pronouns. If a player uses a pronoun, he or she must drink. This rule can be exceptionally difficult and should only be attempted by advanced players.</li>
<li>Little Man: The players are told that a "little man" (sometimes called "the little green man") exists on the edge of his or her glass and can not be drunk with a drink. Therefore, before each player drinks, he or she must remove the "little man" from the glass. Once drinking is completed, the little man must be returned. If at any time the little man is drunk, the player must drink again.</li>
<li>The 69 Rule: If a player possesses both a 6 and a 9 card, these cards, if used together, wield the same powers as the 2 card.</li>
<li>The Waterfall Rule: The president at anytime during cardplay can declare a 'waterfall' to take place. A waterfall is the event where the everybody engages in drinking his/her beverage. Each player can only stop drinking as long as the player above them in the hierarchy has stopped drinking. For example, the vice president can not stop drinking unless the president stops drinking.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>(See: <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drinking_Game_Rules_d69d.html" title="Drinking Game Rules">Drinking Game Rules</a> for additional rules)</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Twice Twice: Every time someone speaks, they need to repeat the last word of their sentence twice.</li>
<li>Chain of Command Rule: Similar to the Waterfall Rule, this can be brutal when drinking is involved, especially if you have some players with a propensity to outdrink everyone they know or players looking for revenge/payback. This can be called by any player at any time, but must be approved by the president. The president is also the only one allowed to be excluded from this rule - priveledges of carrying out executive orders. Whoever calls for a chain of command becomes temporary president and assigns a vice-president, secretary, etc. Some players can be excluded, but this is left up to the temporary president. All players raise their glasses and begin to drink. Everyone must continue to drink until the player ranked above them stops. Ex. When the president stops, the vice-president can stop, followed by the secretary and so forth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Presidents can try to use tricky wording in order to have their rules aid them after their reign has ended. For instance, a President who decrees that "anyone who skips the President must drink" may find that their rule survives, since future Presidents will enjoy it, but it doesn't do the inventor much good after his or her reign is over. A clever President might decree "anyone who skips <i>me</i> must drink", thus allowing them to force someone who skips him or her to drink even after their reign is ended; although once the next President realizes that the rule is still in effect, they will most likely repeal it immediately.</p>
<p>Presidents are advised to be creative when thinking up rules. Although Presidents can be (and often are) tyrannical, a good President will make rules that are fun for all. Unpopular rules will not only be rescinded by future Presidents, but they may invite reprisals after a President "leaves office."</p>

<p>The Asshole is the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whipping_boy.html" title="Whipping boy">whipping boy</a> of the game, but sometimes the Asshole can be given limited, fleeting powers to make up for the grief they must undergo. While the new Asshole is shuffling and dealing the cards for the next hand, the Asshole has all of the powers of the President, and the President has no powers until the dealing is done. This means that the Asshole can give out drinks to anyone just like the President can during normal gameplay. The Asshole can also make rules, but those rules only apply during future shuffle and deal periods, they don't apply during gameplay. Assholes who are not careful with these temporary powers may dig themselves into an even deeper hole if they upset the President-elect. An Asshole who attempts to filibuster by taking too long to deal, in order to extend their power, is likely to face extreme punishment; also, if such delay tactics become problematic, a limit can be set on how long the Asshole may take to deal. Some versions penalize any player who touches his/her cards before the Asshole picks up his/her own hand by making them take a drink.</p>
