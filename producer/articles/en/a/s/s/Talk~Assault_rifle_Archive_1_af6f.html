<p>I've modified the article to work around some ambigious wording. The first paragraph read "Examples of assault rifles incorrectly include the AR-15", and then continued on after that point to list actual assault rifles. I've instead broken off the paragraph to give a short list of assault rifles (using the list and wording already provided), and added an addendum pointing out that semi-automatic rifles are not correctly called "assault rifles". <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosensteel_bf41.html" title="User:Rosensteel">Rosensteel</a> 19:27, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Assault rifles cause injuries more often than death. Doctrines vary concerning this effect. The U.S. military states that this is an intentional goal. "</p>
<p>Can anyone provide any citations for these facts? I have heard it thrown around frequently by gun shop commandos but never seen any actual documentation. It seems to me that purposely wounding without an attempt to kill would be contrary to the rules of war established by the Geneva and Hague conventions. If no one can do this I would suggest the passages about wounding be removed.</p>
<p>Not trying to get a full thread going, but: The idea of wounding, not killing to put more stress on the other sides resources is an "urban myth". My father was an old military man, fought New Guinea and later an instructor at the "Command College". He pointed out that the idea is just a sound bite and, (as with many things) the devil is in the details. 1) If you wound the guy and he keeps fighting he may kill you. 2) If you wound the guy and then capture him, you can either violate the Geneva convention or caring for him is now YOUR problem. 3) If you wound him and the enemy ends up with him, depending on their culture (Americans have a terrible time understanding this) they can shoot/allow to die or treat him. If he is considered more valuable treated and returned to combat, this is what they do. In either case, they DON'T violate the Geneva convention since he is their own soldier.67.174.53.196 17:51, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>This is a basically very good article, but I see two problems. I'd be bold in updating and correct it myself, but I'm afraid that I haven't really got the time this evening. (And I accidentally created a firestorm with my <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun_safety.html" title="Gun safety">Gun safety</a> page, so I'd like to let others handle this article.&#160;:-) )</p>
<p>1. The article should make the point more clear about the difference between fully-automatic and semi-automatic weapons. The article does make the distinction, but it describes 'assault rifles' as having a 'selective rate of fire', which is true only of true assault rifles, i.e. true military fully automatic rifles. The civilian versions are semi-automatic.</p>
<p>2. As much as I agree with the argument that the only <i>significant</i> difference between "assault rifles" and low powered hunting rifles is the selective rate of fire, I think this needs to be better supported.</p>
<p>Those who are in support of "assault weapons bans" often use dishonest arguments about "high rate of fire" and so forth. but there are honest defenders of these laws who point to such features as pistol grips as making these guns particularly suitable for "spray and pray" criminals. I don't agree with these poeple, but the argument needs to be noted as an honest point.</p>
<p>Is that political point even appropriate for this page? Perhaps it is. But we need to be careful to <i>present</i> the debate, rather than <i>take a side</i> in the debate. We can best present the debate by giving the strongest arguments from each side.</p>
<hr />
<p>The main part of the article is very informative, I like it! The bit about the ban in California seemed out of place, though ... I've moved it to a subpage for now.</p>
<p>I see that the politics tie somewhat into the definition that various groups tag to the "Assault rifle" term. Maybe just mention that on the page itself? Other than that, I think the gun politics should be confined to their own page ... --<a href="../../../r/o/b/Robbe.html" title="Robbe">Robbe</a></p>
<hr />
<p>I certainly agree with Robbe: All aspects realting to gun regulation politics should be located on a separate page (with a pointer from here perhaps) and this page dedicated to hard facts about assault rifles. I think it's a good article, informative and fairly exhaustive, some politics pruning and we should be home free&#160;:-) By the way, isn't an assauylt rifle a military weapon by definition? Is there such a thing as a civilian assault rifle? Ah, better put that on US gun politics, hehe. --Anders TÃ¶rlind</p>
<dl>
<dd>As a temporary measure, would be alright to shift the stuff on resisting tyranny to a /politics subpage? --Robert Merkel</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>I've bitten the bullet and moved it here for the moment. It needs to be made NPOV and shifted to a seperate politics page. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a></p>
<p><b>Effects on governance</b></p>
<p>Bayonet lugs, flash-suppression, large magazines and selective-fire are the significant functional differences between an assault rifle and a low-powered, lightweight hunting rifle. These are not large differences. Large capacity magazines and flash suppressors are easy to install. Lightly trained persons can simulate selective fire with any type of repeating rifle, including old-west lever-actions. Bayonet lugs serve only dire military situations.</p>
<p>Thus, as one would expect, forces armed primarily with true assault rifles are relatively ineffective except against unarmed persons. Non-governmental organizations with expedient arms have successfully resisted them.</p>
<p>In the U.S., most civilian weapons labelled "assault rifles" lack selective fire. Their magazines contain ten rounds or less. They fire once for each pull of the trigger, and have no way to act as "machine guns." This allows owners to avoid paying the $200 treasury fee and licensing required to own a small automatic weapon in the U.S. The weapons threaten members of civil government simply because they are effective small arms. Many owners see this as a check on tyranny, and training for civil defense.</p>
<hr />
<p>How about a section clearly stating the definition of the assault rifle as historically originated by the Stg44:</p>
<ol>
<li>select fire, with both semi-automatic and fully-automatic modes;</li>
<li>an intermediate cartridge, between a pistol and rifle round in power;</li>
<li>a large-capacity detachable box magazine, usually 20 rounds or higher.</li>
</ol>
<p>And the current usage, with a note on its controversy, of "assault weapon", which is quite different. I believe the most relevant codified definition of "assault weapon" is in the USA AWB of 1994.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The history-chapter seems to be rather long with all the examples, especially when most of the rifles already have their own separate articles. How about breaking the history to its separate article or at least breaking the example rifles to their own articles?

<p>ThereÂ´s not enough attention towards the AK-47. ItÂ´s still widely used and is propably the most plagiarized assault rifle in the world. At least it should be added to the "Significant models"-section.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Overhaul</span></h2>
<p>As promised, I've overhauled this article, removing speculation, original research, PoV, irrelevant material and moving excess text to more appropiate pages. Some of what I removed is reproduced below for historic record:</p>
<p>The low training time for US soldiers is often blamed for the known inability of the soldiers to control their fire (<a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Army_6d69.html" title="US Army">US Army</a> basic training is eight weeks, compared with 12 weeks for the Canadian reserve force and 13 for the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Marine_Corps_d398.html" title="US Marine Corps">US Marine Corps</a>.) Also the US focuses mainly on physical soldiering skills, whereas most other modern nations focus more on mental soldier skills ("boot camp" is typically used to describe military basic training, whereas calling the basic training of most other nations "boot camp" is considered a grave insult.)</p>
<p>Some later models of the Russian Kalashnikov <a href="../../../a/k/-/AK-47_b9b4.html" title="AK-47">AK-47</a> assault rifles can reduce the rate of fire below five rounds per second. Although this may aid logistics, lowered logistic loads is said to be a doctrine of secondary importance. The lower rate of fire is to help moderately skilled shooters, while it is said to limit better shooters. Many Russian troops apparently dislike this accessory, because it reduces the rate of fire during the assault, and is less reliable than a simple automatic sear. (<i>This was a copy n past from <a href="../../../a/k/4/AK47_4120.html" title="AK47">AK47</a></i>)</p>
<p>To reduce logistic problems, and still provide high rates of fire, some current military doctrines employ a <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squad_automatic_weapon.html" title="Squad automatic weapon">squad automatic weapon</a> used by one or a few specially-trained soldiers in a squad. The term squad is largely a US term, where the equivalent to a squad automatic weapon is a part of most normal <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_training.html" title="Military training">military training</a>. Fully automatic assault rifles can, at a pinch, replace a light <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machine_gun.html" title="Machine gun">machine gun</a>. Another very common method is to have one of the riflemen (the nearest and typically a fireteam partner), pick up the gun of a fallen machinegunner and thence, until proper unit reorg, become a machine gunner himself. Some weapons such as the AK-47, although classified as assault rifles, were designed as light infantry automatic weapons with <a href="../../../s/i/n/Single-shot.html" title="Single-shot">single-shot</a> capability, rather than rifles with the option of full-automatic fire, such as the <a href="../../../m/-/1/M-16.html" title="M-16">M16A1</a>. Therefore, the doctrines associated are often weapon dependent.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helicopter.html" title="Helicopter">helicopter</a> had become an important, perhaps the primary, means of resupplying embattled troops.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">My edit</span></h2>
<p>The reasons for my last edit are listed below in the order I edited, not from top to bottom in the article.</p>
<p>There are multiple assault weapon definitions, none of which (AFAIK) are the one added by Ve3. I added why the two terms are not interchangeable and fixed the reference to 10-round magazines.</p>
<ul>
<li>I did not write that definition- it was already in the article. You are wrong anyway, those 5 traits can indeed qualify a rifle as a "assault weapon". Your info that the two terms are not interchangeable was correct, which is why I have now left it. However, it important to mention the 1930s act restricting automatic firearms, which you had removed. Ve3 9 July 2005 03:27 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>An assault rifle is by definition not semi-automatic. AFAIK all current definitions of assault weapons refer to semi-automatic firearms. I think specifics on what an assault weapon is should go on pages about them.</p>
<ul>
<li>That paragraph already made that clear. I agree though it doesn't need to much detail. Ve3 9 July 2005 03:27 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no space in the word "cartridge".</p>
<ul>
<li>Good job on finding a typo. I too have corrected some on this page. Ve3 9 July 2005 03:27 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm leaving in the M1 info because it "marked first time such a intermediate weapon would massed produced in such large numbers", but it wasn't an assault rifle and that paragraphs really needs cleaning up.</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't think its a assault rifle either, but that is not the only reason to include it. Ve3 9 July 2005 03:27 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I changed the definition so it's clear there are others, but I feel selective fire is best where it is. If someone doesn't know what selective fire is, s/he can click on the link and understand the phrase better than if we attempted to re-define it here.</p>
<ul>
<li>American Heritage Dictionary defines a AR as: <i>Any of various automatic or semiautomatic rifles designed for individual use in combat</i>. I personally do not agree that definition exactly, but less technical language should be used. Ve3 9 July 2005 03:27 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>The BAR didn't introduce the idea of light automatic rifles, and I don't think I've ever seen it called an assault rifle without that claim being quickly beaten down, so I removed that paragraph.</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, it doesn't say that introduced the idea. Second, it didn't say it was a assault rifle. It was a light automatic rifle <i>used</i> like one for time and its has a much importance as the other weapons that are not always considered assault rifles (such as the italian ones). Ve3</li>
</ul>
<p>I noticed the AWB link redirected...IMO links should go straight to the destination with no redirecting or disambiguation.68.32.176.48</p>
<ul>
<li>I agree here (on AWB);it that was that way (generic link) to begin with and I didn't make it otherwise. Ve3 9 July 2005 03:27 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your edit was great! Why are you a not-signed-in user?!? Wikipedia will be better for us all if you go create a login, right now!&#160;:-) <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> 8 July 2005 23:53 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Ve3, I liked the previous version better than your edit, so I reverted. I agree with much of what is stated above. A specific disgreement I have with your version is that BAR was a machine gun, not an assault rifle. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> 9 July 2005 01:05 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I do not think the BAR is assault rifle. I included it because the entire first section includes things that are not universally considered assault rifles, but just light automatic rifles. It is a oversimplification to say the bar is a machine gun, really it is only a light machine gun. In WW1 it wasn't even really intended for the LMG role, but to be used for mobile suppressive fire and single aimed shots. It was only later that people used it strictly as a LMG, which is why they added bipods and other features to aid in this job. Ve3 9 July 2005 03:27 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>There's things I like and dislike about several of the versions. I still think the BAR paragraph seems out of place, but I'm don't wanna get in an edit war. Maybe discussion of the BAR is appropriate talking about the evolution of the assault rifle, but it certainly could flow better. It's nice to have a history section, but almost the whole article is in that section now. I'm not sure I like the "Unrelated terms" section either. There was discussion going on in <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assault_weapon.html" title="Assault weapon">assault weapon</a> about redirecting here (which certainly is inappropriate IMO). I can't decide though whether I think "unrelated terms" doesn't belong at all, or whether I just don't like it because it's awkward. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> 9 July 2005 04:03 (UTC)</p>
<p>I write too slowly...Friday keeps making my responses pointless by working on the main article!&#160;:p One thing that hasn't changed, yet: What was wrong with my revised M1 carbine paragraph?</p>
<p>I'll probably be making some more edits. I hope you'll find them less objectionable now that I have more of an idea where you're coming from. 68.32.176.48 9 July 2005 04:31 (UTC)</p>

<p>Actually it would be the M2 carbine because it was the select fire version of the carbine. By definition an M2 would qualify as an âassault rifleâ by default, not among the top ten for sure. ak-dave</p>
<p>I agree with your assessment of both the BAR and M1 Carbine. Some discussion is justified in order to compare and contrast with what an assault rifle actually is, but beyond that they don't qualify as assault rifles. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolidpoint_f212.html" title="User:Solidpoint">solidpoint</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Assault Rifle Lie</span></h2>
<p>Many of us who teach firearms understand that the phrases of "assault rifle," "assault pistol" and "assault weapon" are all lies. In a military tactical sense the idea of an "assault rifle" is unrealistic, assinine and impractical. When a military force wants to launch a REALLY effective assault, they use vehicles like tanks, armored cars and armored personnel carriers coupled with a pre-assault artillery barrage and/or series of airstrikes. I guess that the more accurate and true definition of an assault rifle would be the 120 millimeter rifle (cannon) mounted on M1 Abrahams tank. The first use of "assault rifle" came about as the result of a radical anti-gun nut using the term in front of America's most mentally challenged people: Senate politicians. What happened was that there was a Senate committee that was "investigating" the easy access or proliferation of firearms. Most of the people on the Senate committee were anti-gun senators who were looking for a way or catch-phrase to help further their anti-gun cause. The man who testified in front of the Senate DID TELL THE TRUTH but he did so in a way that was not morally correct. In other words, he DELIBERATELY lied "by omission" to make his cause SEEM more just or right. The man who testified about "assault rifles," particularly the MP-44, tried to link the MP-44 with Adolph Hitler. His attempt was to say that Hitler, an evil man, had referred to the MP-44 as "an assault rifle." The idea was that by linking something, a rifle, to an evil man then people, politicians, could be controlled into believing that the rifle was ALSO A BAD THING. In this idea, the easily led politicians would think that, "Evil man likes this assault rifle so that makes ALL rifles bad." Hopefully, the Senate committe would never stop to think things over or ask experts what was really true. Sadly, this is EXACTLY what happened and the Senators fell for the trick used by anti-gunners.</p>
<p>Here's what REALLY happened with Adolph Hitler and the MP-44. Hitler, a World War One veteran, was AGAINST the MP-44 being developed. Hitler, at the time of World War Two, wanted to use his nation's resources to manufacture those rifles that had ALREADY been developed, such as the Mauser K-98 rifles, because they were tried and true firearms. Hitler did NOT want to expend his nation's time, technology and material, at a time of crisis, on developing more new technology as far as firearms were concerned. With firearms, Hitler thought that the Mauser bolt-action rifle was the best thing to meet the infantry's primary firearms need. When Hitler found out that the MP-44 had been developed AGAINST HIS DESIRES, he was not a happy man. Hitler did, however, listen to his generals for once and looked over the MP-44. Hitler DID refer to the MP-44 as a "sturmgewher" or as a "storm rifle." Where the anti-gunner lied by omission is that he did NOT explain that Hitler's use of the word sturmgewher was ACTUALLY meant in the OPPOSITE MANNER. Hitler was, in his own way, actually calling the MP-44 a rifle to be used AGAINST STORMING (RUSSIAN) SOLDIERS in the east! Another way of saying it was that Hitler actually meant that the MP-44 was an "anti-assault or anti-attack rifle." The actual omission part was that in the German language, like in American slang, words take on the opposite meaning or another meaning. In the USA when somebody says, "That was one BAD pizza." they're actually saying that the pizza was great or really good. The SAME THING applies to the Germanic language. I tend to think that this is one of the reasons that defining an "assault rifle" is such a hard thing to do. Look at all the different LEGAL definitions of what is and is NOT an assault rifle. Until our politicians understand that they need properly define what is and isn't right, our nation will be legislating innocent people into becoming criminals with more and more complex laws. Such is the situation LEGAL gunowners find themselves. Politicians are being lied to and the gunowners become the victims of new laws. One of the most interesting facts is the over 99% of ALL guns have and NEVER will be used to commit crimes. The best way to explain the growth of the assault rifle lie can be summed up in the phrase, "Too much hype being used to spark uncontrolled emotional anger in an unrealistic manner to create new and overzealous laws that victimize innocent people."</p>
<p>The 120mm gun on the M1 Abrams can't be called an assault rifle,because it is a smoothbore. <a href="../../../d/u/d/User%7EDudtz_4295.html" title="User:Dudtz">Dudtz</a> 10/15/06 5:45 PM EST</p>

<dd>Well, this tangenital rant is half right, but you'd have made a lot more sense if you understood that "assault rifle" is a militarily accepted term with a pretty specific definition, and "assault weapon" is the generic catch-all meaningless phrase used by deceptive gun control advocates who want to scare you.

<p>1. I think we should be clearer why the M1 Carbine isn't an assault rifle: (a) design purpose, as defensive weapon for non-combatants and leaders, (b) low power, (c) lack of vertical rear grip, or (d) lack of autofire. I don't know much about (a); equipping paratroopers with the M1A1 implies an assault rifle role. (B) seems nit-picky. The 30 Carbine's muzzle energy is a (weak?) 955 foot-pounds; the Thompson's 45 ACP gives a (powerful?) 405 (from a pistol barrel; don't know about an SMG barrel); assault rifles like the MP 43 / Sturmgewehr did 1408 while the 5.56mm NATOs do 1325, and the AK-74 - which everyone agrees is an assault rife - does 1045. All this compares to the 30-06 with its 2500. Is there an arbitrary 1000 foot-pound cut-off that I'm unaware of? (C) seems superficial and doesn't apply to the M1A1. (D) is correct but doesn't apply to the M2. 2. I thought the B.A.R. was full-auto-only; am I wrong? Or were single aimed shots actually achieved with a really short trigger pull? 3. The "120 millimeter rifle (cannon) mounted on M1 Abrahams tank" is a smoothbore. (On an Abrams.) 4. I'm not convinced that the language in the 1994 assault weapons ban even uses the term "assault rifle" at all. It defines how different weapons - shotgun, rifle, or pistol - could qualify as an "assault weapon". Okay, so the military's idea of an "assault rifle" is very different from the 1994 legal definition of an "assault weapon". Let's not waste our breath talking about one term used in two different ways - it is two terms.</p>

Since Dr Roberts is actually part of the NIJ team I think he qualifies as a 1st party source.

<dd>Hello, I added a response and reverted your entry before I found and read this entry, so I apologise now. Your original entry had merit, but was uncited and moderately well written, so I rewrote it. I agree with you and I believe body armour will have an impact on assault rifles and the cartridges they use in the future, in fact, they must or risk having a diminishing value. "The future" section should obviously default to the future of assault rifles, but I believe should have subsections for items that will affect it, such as, body armour and cartridges, scopes etc. This framework will allow the growth of the article in a systematic and orderly way. I think having a basic framework for others to plug in information would be the best way to go. Or it has the potential to turn into spaghetti with everything mixed into one section. Thank you 69.156.78.7 16:17, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree that some mention of the potential for body armor to not just diminish, but render obsolete, the intermediate power rounds that characterize assault rifles is needed. I would like to see your wording strengthened accordingly. Weapons do become obsolete. Aircraft made battleships obsolte, tanks made trench warfare obsolete, mechanical warfare made horses obsolete, etc. etc.</p>
<p>I like your submission EXCEPT for the creation of a whole new category in which to showcase the DragonSkin SOV body armor in particular. This smacks of being an advertisement. Also, your citation is sub-standard in that it does not reflect the current state of affairs, it is speculative. The NIJ has not approved DragonSkin and the citation I gave you references DockGKR's up to date detailing of the proceedings so you don't need to speculate, you have links to data less than 36 hours old. (I am a huge fan of DragonSkin btw, and feel they have been badly maligned by the DOD - if you have any doubt of this please read my posts on the 65Grendel.com site - but this is not the place to grind axes. To do so calls into question the objectivity of everything else written on this page. Restraint is respect.)</p>
<p>You want to create categories for each thing that assault rifle are affected by? How about metals to make the cases out of, the mining industry that supplies the metals, polymers to coat them with, the entire plastics industry, trucks to carry them in, airplanes to ship them into theater, etc. etc. etc. The list is potentially nearly endless. Some discretion needs to be used. The current creation of an entirely new category for each and every possible impingement on the assault rifle is an invitation to disaster. The entire focus of the page will be lost.</p>
<p>Putting the shoe on the other foot, since body armor has been dramatically impacted by the desire to protect against assault rifles we could cut and paste the entire Assault Rifle page's content into the body armor page too, but the beauty of hyper-links is you let the reader decide if they want that additional level of detail. Any mention of body armor, beyond noting it has the potential to make assault rifles obsolete, should function primarily as a thumbnail for optional reader investigation.</p>
<p>In short, I would be quite happy if you just removed the new section and then reviewed your revision with an eye to minimizing any bias towards any particular maker of body armor. The actual text is quite good in my opinion. In truth, it will not be DragonSkin that renders the assault rifle obsolete, it will be whatever the other side fields - so the particular brand is not important to the consideration of whether assault rifles will be rendered obsolete or not.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering my request.</p>

<p>Somebody needs to get their head around some terms and then go edit the "The Future" section. A bullet is the thing that comes out of the end of the barrel. A cartridge is a piece of brass that just happens to also determine rather precisely the exact dimensions of a combustion chamber which the powder burns in.</p>
<p>In view of this it is clearly wrong to discuss "cartridge ballistics". The cartridge doesn't have ballistics, the bullet does. To be ballistic anything something has to at least move. A cartridge doesn't move except in and out of the chamber. A cartridge can influence internal ballistics and is usually the dominant consideration in internal ballistics, but ballistics is all about what the bullet does. It's the thing moving.</p>
<p>The NATO standard cartridge is also not 5.56, that is the bullet's diameter. The NATO, or one of them, standard cartridge is 5.56x45 where the 45mm is the length of the piece of brass known as the cartridge.</p>
<p>AK-47s ALLWAYS "accept"s ("chamber" is a much better word; "accepts" seems to imply it could reject it. This is nonsense) the 7.62 caliber but only if it is seated in a 7.62x39 Russian cartridge loaded with a 123 grain 7.62 caliber bullet. This combo is usually manifest as an M43 round. All of this is wrong though as the standard Russian rifle is now the AK-74 which fires a 5.45 caliber bullet from a 5.45x39 cartridge. If any of this is confusing to you the please stop âcontributingâ to this page. Itâs a big enough mess already thanks to the help of the ignorant.</p>
<p>The final bit of gibberish in this section is a reference to internal ballistics where armor penetration is concerned. Internal ballistics is all about how powder burns and makes pressure and pushes the bullet out of the barrel. It has absolutely nothing to do with whether a bullet is made of tungsten, lead, copper or Velveta cheese. The reference to terminal ballistics is almost as weak as this generally refers to the study of the bulletâs ability to wound and an armor penetrating bullet will not be focused on this. It will be focused on getting through armor so it can do any wounding at all.</p>
<p>I think Iâll give this a week to fix itself and then just delete this superfluous sub-section. The problem with getting off-topic is you end up making a fool or yourself.</p>

<dd>Wrong, the cartridge consists of all parts including the bullet, case, gunpowder and primer. It is not one section or the other. 67.71.154.35 10:17, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Right, only someone who buys the ammo someone else loaded thinks a cartridge includes the bullet, primer and powder. If your assumption were correct then given that there are something like 25 different bullets in 6.5 caliber I could create 25 different and distinct cartridges simply by loading the same identical cartridge with different bullets. Only sloppy thinking on the part of K-Mart shoppers allows for nonsense like this. A cartridge is a precisely dimensioned piece of brass which when chambered in a well-defined barrel constitutes a very precise combustion chamber with very precise dimensions and an attendant set of internal ballistic characteristics. Btw, is there some point to signing your "no-name" signature at the end of your post? Since you are too cowardly to abandon the safety of obscurity what's the point of signing?</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">SwatJester's Vandalism not appreciated</span></h2>
<p>The graphic I posted was prepared using Hodgdon pressure-safe load data from their online load tables and BC info from Sierra's website tables. The only round which required judgment was the Chinese 5.8x42 because the BC is not known in the West as far we could determine.</p>
<p>The conclusion that the 6.5 Grendel is THE MOST powerful assault rifle cartridge does not even depend on it carrying its energy better than any other. It is simply an observation that at 2,500 joules it is the most powerful round, period. Now if you werenât such a lazy sod and actually went and looked up this info, or checked out the very lengthy discussion as to how this information was derived on the 65Grendel.com website you would not resort to blantant vandalism of my post. Or perhaps you are one of these hang-wringing ninnies that can never get comfortable with any statement of an absolute. At any rate, I will revert to my original post and if you vandalize it again you will be reported for your vandalism.</p>
<p>In time FAQs regarding this .jpg will be answered in an annotated .pdf so that the assumptions and estimates will be bound and inseparable from the graphic. In the meantime you can either accept my conclusions or challenge the facts. Anything else is vandalism. Statements of fact are not "unencyclopedic" no matter how reluctant you are to accept that something will always be the best in its class.</p>
<p>Oh, and assault rifles, not ammunition. must maintain a delicate balance between competing factors, such as recoil. Bullets don't have recoil, weapons do. Heavier weapons have less, gas operated weapons have less, and light, bolt operated weapons have more. If you are purporting to be an expert RE: assault rifles nobody should have to explain this to you. Just because you can run a computer doesn't mean you are qualified to "contribute" as an expert on a subject. The fact that I am having to explain this to somebody ought to tip them off that they aren't an expert and should butt out and let people that are write this page. Beyond that I know exactly what was being discussed, assault rifles, not bullets because I wrote that paragraph and I know exactly what was on my mind when writing it. This is hardly a subtle point as a cursory read of the sentence in context should quickly reveal. Therefore, the correct heading is NOT "Ammunition", it is "Summary" as this is a discussion of whether the assault rifle will even have a place as a combat system in the future and what remedies are likely to prevent its obsolescence. It is absolutely NOT a discussion of ammunition, never was and never should be.</p>

<p>I've performed a cleanup and culled some junk from the article as well as making some changes to readability and factual corrections. I removed large chunks of speculation and two separate tangetially related discussions of American law and Body armor. These discussions don't belong in this article as they're repeated elsewhere. --<a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsams10_5cf0.html" title="User:Asams10">Asams10</a> 20:18, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
