<p>The references are the newspapers of the enemy of Ottoman government of the war time. How can a newspaper news be a scientific evidence! Some photographs of some dead people are reported to belong to Assyrians but how can we know? That is stupid! I think this new invention shows Wikipedia is no more a reliable source! IF ONE PARTY CLAIMS THAT THERE IS A GENOCIDE, THEY SHOULD GO TO COURT TO PROVE THIS. AND HISTORIAN WITH DIFFERENT IDEAS SHOULD ARGUE AND MAKE A DECISION. OTHERWISE THESE CLAIMS AND THIS ARTICLE ARE JUST SEEN AS PROPAGANDA!</p>

<p>I dont know what fairy tales they are telling you guys, but it doesnt make sense that there was a Christian Genocide in Turkey. First of all the claim is based on a wrong assumption that Ottomanswere seperating the people according to their religion in 1915. That was in much older times; and when they were, all the beliefs were respected. Please remember who took care of the Jews that were being massacred in Spain in 16th century. Around 1915 the military leaders of the country who came to power with a coup were positivists and their policy was not based on religion but race, namely Panturkism, which was a reaction to the nationalist-seperatist movements in the empire. On the other hand I do not believe that Greeks or Assyrians in Asia Minor were subject to genocide at any time during the Ottoman reign. I do not see a reason why they should be. Many Armenians were deported and were killed on the way during the war, because they were helping Russians. But I suspect that Assyrians could have helped Russians, considering where they live. And Turks are not Barbarians, the stories told on this page seem very exaggerated and unreal, because they depict Turks as lunatics cutting the finger joints one by one. I think there was a military code during the time to prevent such execution.</p>

<dd>First of all, this article is NOT an attack on the Turkish people, it's shedding light on the massacres committed by the Ottoman government, the members of which are most likely long dead now. As for the military code you are assuming, during times of war there is no such thing: take a look at the US soldiers and how they have tortured Iraqi prisoners and civilians, even under a so-called "military code". Go back nearly a century, and this "code" is less likely to have existed, let alone to have been obeyed. The problem with your argument is that it's all based on assumptions. The information from this article comes from extensive documentation. Now I don't know if you're supporting Turkish propaganda, but the genocide did happen. There are still many people from that generation alive today, and they have had to carry the horrors with them for nearly a century now. Also it wasn't mainly Ottoman troops that were carrying out the genocide, it was also largely the Kurdish paramilitary, to whom the Ottoman government offered incentives for their cooperation. There's a lot more behind this event which you obviously have not sufficiently researched. So before you deny the cold deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent people, please do the appropriate research.<a href="../../../%C5%A1/a/r/User%7E%C5%A0arukinu_88ac.html" title="User:Šarukinu">Šarukinu</a> 03:23, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If anyone, without a reasonable doubt, say that the events that took place circa 1915 were genocide, then let them show proof while they are saying it. There is nothing in this articvel that even remotely resembles any factual evidence. What you are doing here is complete and utter revisionist propoganda. I am deeply offended that in a intellectual forum such as WikiPedia, this type of behaviour is allowed. I urge all those who read this arcticle to question the motives of the authors. This "judge, jury, and executioner" type of behavior is vile and disgusting. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../o/g/u/User%7EOguz1_ed78.html" title="User:Oguz1">Oguz1</a> (<a href="../../../o/g/u/User_talk%7EOguz1_cec5.html" title="User talk:Oguz1">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Oguz1_b4fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Oguz1">contribs</a>) 17:44, 10 October 2006.</small></p>

<p>Just want to bring to your attention the <a href="../../../h/a/k/Hakk%C3%A2ri_Province_c292.html" title="Hakkâri Province">Hakkâri Province</a> page. I understand that it's a part of WikiProject Turkey, and Turkey hasn't acknowledged the genocide yet, but I still feel that the wording they used is negligent of the nature of the Assyrian deaths and relocations, and the assassination of the patriarch at that time, Mar Shimun. Here's what is written on that page, concerning the Assyrians:</p>
<p>"In Ottoman times, there were also numerous Assyrian tribes in the province, though fighting during the First World War forced most of into Persia and Iraq. The Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East was also resident in Hakkâri Province until then."</p>
<p>Since nobody appears to be taking part in the discussion on that page, I thought I'd bring it to our attention here, where more people seem to be discussing the genocide. Somebody please advise as to what actions we should take on that <a href="../../../h/a/k/Hakk%C3%A2ri_Province_c292.html" title="Hakkâri Province">page</a>.<a href="../../../%C5%A1/a/r/User%7E%C5%A0arukinu_88ac.html" title="User:Šarukinu">Šarukinu</a> 16:15, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article say that only 275,000 were killed during the Genocide though that number only represents the Assyrians under Mar Shimuns control in the Hakkari mountains. This is the number that their "clan" showed in the delegation held in Paris, but this number only referred to their losses. The losses in other parts of the Ottoman Empire were excluded and the total amount of Assyrians to die are between 500.000 - 750.000.</p>
