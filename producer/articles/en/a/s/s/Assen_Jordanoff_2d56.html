<p><b>Assen Khristov Yordanov</b> was the son of a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polyglot.html" title="Polyglot">polyglot</a> <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economist.html" title="Economist">economist</a>/<a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemist.html" title="Chemist">chemist</a>, Christo Yordanov. Christo graduated from the <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuttgart.html" title="Stuttgart">University of Stuttgart</a> in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> and later obtained a doctorate from the <a href="../../../a/a/c/Aachen.html" title="Aachen">University in Aachen</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, where he specialized in the analysis and production of <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wool.html" title="Wool">wool</a> and later <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silk.html" title="Silk">silk</a>, publishing several important findings on the process.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgaria.html" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, Christo worked in the Ministry of Economics and Agriculture as well as the <a href="../../../s/o/f/Sofia.html" title="Sofia">Sofia</a> bank. For this reason, the Yordanovs were fairly wealthy, and owned several <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coal.html" title="Coal">coal</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copper.html" title="Copper">copper</a> mines, as well as a family farm. In turn, Assen was educated early. Assen's mother, Dotchka Tzoneva, was the daughter of a rich <a href="../../../t/o/b/Tobacco.html" title="Tobacco">tobacco</a> producer from <a href="../../../r/a/z/Razgrad.html" title="Razgrad">Razgrad</a>.

<p>From a very young age, Assen Yordanov was interested in flight. He built kites as a child, and as an adolescent attended lectures on physics at the local university. In his teens, Yordanov invented a <i>dark box</i>, a simple substitution to the use of an entire <i>dark room</i> in photograph development. Later, his father would take Yordanov to <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, where Yordanov learned of the many new innovations in transportation, notably the <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorcycle.html" title="Motorcycle">motorcycle</a>. Assen was temporarily lodged in a boarding school in <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva.html" title="Geneva">Geneva</a>, where he learned <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a>. He continued his studies in Bulgaria.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Assen_Jordanoff_2d56.html" title="Edit section: The Glider">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Glider</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1912.html" title="1912">1912</a>, at the age of 16, Yordanov built his first workable glider. A local Bulgarian newspaper, dated <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_16.html" title="February 16">February 16</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1912.html" title="1912">1912</a>, published an article entitled 'First Bulgarian glider', which read:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In the last few days, on the field between the infantry camp and the pioneer barracks, a very young Bulgarian aviator drills with his glider built by himself. He is a high school schoolboy, Assen Yordanov, the son of the Administrator of the Bank of Agriculture. He is fifteen, passionately keen on aviation and as a child fashioned toys that could fly. Last year, when visiting France and Italy, he saw the biplane of Maslennykov and Tchernyak, and from then on thought seriously to conquer the air himself. His glider is a very simple, light affair, based on the constructions of the Wright brothers and of Farman. It is 7 meters long, 1.20 m wide, with a surface area of 14 m2 and weights 23 kg. Yesterday he flew for over 12 minutes and reached an altitude of 10 to 12 meters. This young man's glider deserves praise, especially from aviation specialists.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The exact date of the first flight is unclear, but after it, on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_5.html" title="February 5">February 5</a>, the young flier made a second test flight in the presence of an official commission. Young Assen was invited to take another trip to France by a rich couple from <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rousse.html" title="Rousse">Rousse</a>, who had no children, and to go with them on summer holiday to Paris. In 1912, the first <i>Salon de l'Aviation</i> took place in Paris, presenting the latest aeronautic achievements and the latest planes, demonstrated by the top pilots of the day.</p>
<p>In turn, Yordanov, above all, planned to find a means of admission to the well-known Blériot school in Etampes, knowing fully well the unlikelihood of a 16-year-old boy from then newly-formed Bulgaria to gain admittance. This was until he met the well-known Bulgarian aviator Lieutenant Simeon Petrov, who introduced him to <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Bl%C3%A9riot_f705.html" title="Louis Blériot">Louis Blériot</a> himself.</p>
<p>He wasn't officially enrolled and there was no diploma for him, but attending the famous flying school in the company of great aviators played a huge role in Yordanov's educational development. After graduation, all the Bulgarians in the school were gathered and notified that the Turks are planning to invade Bulgaria.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Assen_Jordanoff_2d56.html" title="Edit section: Balkan Wars">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Balkan Wars</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Balkan_War_9bbb.html" title="First Balkan War">First Balkan War</a>, led by <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgaria.html" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a>, and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a> against <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, was shortly followed by the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Balkan_War_29b2.html" title="Second Balkan War">Second Balkan War</a>, led against <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgaria.html" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> by its former allies. At 17, Assen Yordanov volunteered for the army, with his father's reluctant consent. Though never in any imminent danger, Assen Yordanov served his part during the war as car driver; most of his time he frequented the airplane hangars. Colonel Radul Milkov would later recall:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I would often see Maltchika, drawing paper in hand, sitting in hangars or in the repair shop and copying the design of the parts from dismantled machines. He would also note down measurements of the length, height and width of this or that part, for instance the ribs and flat surfaces of the plane or all that made up the fuselage.</i></dd>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Assen_Jordanoff_2d56.html" title="Edit section: First Bulgarian Airplane">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First Bulgarian Airplane</span></h4>
<p>In the <i>Aeroplanno Otdelenie</i> division, Assen Yordanov gained expertise, he designed the first Bulgarian-made airplane, and it was built in the summer of <a href="../../../1/9/1/1915.html" title="1915">1915</a>. Yordanov test flew the plane, and it was subsequently named the <i>Diplane (biplane) Yordanov-1</i>.He sold the planes design to the military and they started to produce it. In year time Bulgaria has 23 airplanes and in 1916 Bulgaria has more airplanes than America and Japan added together. This is why in 1916 Bulgaria becomes the biggest air force power in the world.</p>
<p><br />
<a href="../../../a/u/g/August_10.html" title="August 10">August 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1915.html" title="1915">1915</a> was considered as the beginning of Bulgarian aircraft industry. Yordanov already became known as designer, mathematician, and inventor at his young age. He introduced a valuable new device, namely a feature which prevents the plane from losing altitude, into the new plane.</p>
<p>Assen Yordanov's airplane was at a first look similar to the planes of that time. It was a <a href="../../../b/i/p/Biplane.html" title="Biplane">biplane</a> with relatively short wings, to decrease the body weight and with increased spacing between them to improve the <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerodynamic.html" title="Aerodynamic">aerodynamic</a> effect of the lower wing. The wing section was similar to that of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albatros.html" title="Albatros">Albatros</a>. The cockpit and the <a href="../../../f/u/s/Fuselage.html" title="Fuselage">fuselage</a> were conceived with great care to diminish drag. The landing gear was reinforced with double tires for stability and safety when landing. The tail, vertical and horizontal <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stabilizers.html" title="Stabilizers">stabilizers</a> and the ailerons were similar to those built by Louis Blériot. The innovation that helped at landing and at recovery from stalls was something like contemporary flaps, added between the wings.</p>
<p>Yordanov was awarded a scholarship to study abroad for his construction. His next and even more ambitious project was a heavier multi-engine plane. Unfortunately the rise of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> cancelled his plans.</p>

<p>After finishing secondary school in <a href="../../../s/o/f/Sofia.html" title="Sofia">Sofia</a>, Yordanov was drafted for <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>. He entered the military flying school at Bozhuriste, near Sofia, the capital. On graduation, Jordanoff was promoted to lieutenant and was assigned to the air force. He took part as pilot in 84 military missions. He ended the war being awarded several insignias of honour, most importantly the <i>Bravery Order</i>. The war was ultimately very costly for <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgaria.html" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, leaving the country with heavy war reparations and a virtually destroyed economy.</p>

<p>In May <a href="../../../1/9/2/1921.html" title="1921">1921</a> Assen Yordanov and his wartime friend, Alexander Stoyanov, read of a contest to fly around the Earth in 100 days. The first plane to make it would win one million dollars. Yordanov and his partner were granted with 6,000 dollars by the Bulgarian Ministry of War to take part in the great initiative and they travelled to the USA. But Yordanov and Stoyanov were the only candidates and therefore the contest was postponed and later cancelled. Nonetheless, Yordanov decided to remain in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, where he later found his new home. He also anglicized his surname to "Jordanoff".</p>

<p>Faced with the dilemma of knowing absolutely no English, Assen Jordanoff began his life in America shovelling snow in New York for ridiculous pay. After the snow melted, Jordanoff was able to find a construction work on a skyscraper that was being built. Having a job he spent all his free time at the Public Library, studying English by himself or reading books and manuals on subjects such as aeronautics, machinery, and mechanics. At that time he become known among his friends and colleagues as Jerry, rather than Assen, a familiar name that would stick with him for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Jordanoff then got a job at the <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curtiss-Wright_7840.html" title="Curtiss-Wright">Curtiss-Wright</a> Corporation. Having mastered his English, Assen Jordanoff went on to take university courses in <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineering.html" title="Engineering">engineering</a>, <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aeronautics.html" title="Aeronautics">aeronautics</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio.html" title="Radio">radio</a> <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronics.html" title="Electronics">electronics</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a>, and <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemistry.html" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a>. At the same time he graduated from a flying school; his instructor was William Winston, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Lindbergh_87dc.html" title="Charles Lindbergh">Charles Lindbergh</a>'s flight instructor. Jordanoff moved later to Curtiss-Wright, therefrom he would emerge as a test pilot and in parallel as a sales manager, a pilot of air taxis, a stunt pilot and above all a flying instructor. He also specialized in flying under complex weather conditions. Jordanoff was still just in his late 20s.</p>
<p>Learning of the popular Jordanoff, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Edison_ebd8.html" title="Thomas Edison">Thomas Edison</a> invited Jordanoff to visit him at his home in <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menlo_Park%2C_New_Jersey_fdcb.html" title="Menlo Park, New Jersey">Menlo Park, New Jersey</a> as he (Edison) was at the stage of developing a proto-<a href="../../../r/a/d/Radar.html" title="Radar">radar</a> and was also interested in <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helicopters.html" title="Helicopters">helicopters</a>, a research project in which Assen Jordanoff was involved at the same time.

<p>In the 1930s and early 1940s Jordanoff wrote a number of illustrated books on problems of aviation, which became a Bible for future aviators. More than 750,000 copies of his books were sold in the USA. Some of them were translated in other languages.</p>
<p>After <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a> began a major period in Assen Jordanoff's career. During the next ten years, he established and presided over his own business enterprises: The Jordanoff Aviation Corporation, followed by The Jordanoff Corporation and then The Jordanoff Company, before the creation in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a> of Jordanoff Electronics. In <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aeronautics.html" title="Aeronautics">aeronautics</a>, the Jordanoff companies collaborated with such firms as <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas.html" title="Douglas">Douglas</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chance-Vought_0a5e.html" title="Chance-Vought">Chance-Vought</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockheed.html" title="Lockheed">Lockheed</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curtiss-Wright_7840.html" title="Curtiss-Wright">Curtiss-Wright</a>, <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonnell_0f3d.html" title="McDonnell">McDonnell</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing.html" title="Boeing">Boeing</a>, North American, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consolidated.html" title="Consolidated">Consolidated</a>, and <a href="../../../p/i/p/Piper.html" title="Piper">Piper</a>.</p>
<p>At the request of many, Jordanoff himself, as a designer and engineer within his own enterprise, compiled instruction books and manuals for the operation and maintenance, inspection and repair for some well-known aircraft such as the <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockheed.html" title="Lockheed">Lockheed</a> <a href="../../../p/-/3/P-38_Lightning_8e83.html" title="P-38 Lightning">P-38 Lightning</a>, a very versatile aircraft used during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> mainly as high-speed, high-altitude fighter, long-range escort fighter and photo reconnaissance plane; the <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curtiss.html" title="Curtiss">Curtiss</a> <a href="../../../p/-/4/P-40_Warhawk_1a29.html" title="P-40 Warhawk">P-40 Warhawk</a>, America's foremost fighter in service when <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> began; the <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_B-17_Flying_Fortress_f81d.html" title="Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress">Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress</a> and the <a href="../../../b/-/2/B-29_Super_Fortress_6b52.html" title="B-29 Super Fortress">B-29 Super Fortress</a>, the best long-range bombers in WWII; the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consolidated.html" title="Consolidated">Consolidated</a> <a href="../../../b/-/2/B-24_Liberator_9446.html" title="B-24 Liberator">B-24 Liberator</a> and the North American <a href="../../../b/-/2/B-25_Mitchell_4756.html" title="B-25 Mitchell">B-25 Mitchell</a> bombers, and the <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas.html" title="Douglas">Douglas</a> <a href="../../../d/c/-/DC-3_e82c.html" title="DC-3">DC-3</a> transport aircraft.</p>
<p>A very important activity was the preparation and the distribution of thousands of copies of descriptive books and practical manuals for aircraft. Jordanoff also became renowned for his many articles and publishing on aviation, as well as his commentaries and editorials. He was presented as a prominent authority on all the areas of aviation. Jordanoff eventually became the largest American publisher and editor of specialized military manuals.</p>
<p>In the 1940s Jordanoff was assigned the task by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Defense_b846.html" title="United States Department of Defense">United States Department of Defense</a> to prepare instruction manuals for military aircraft, submarines and aircraft carriers, on topics like land support with <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio.html" title="Radio">radio</a> equipment, air <a href="../../../m/e/t/Meteorology.html" title="Meteorology">meteorology</a>, theoretic and flight preparation of the pilots for diurnal and nocturnal piloting. These were for crew use, inspection, maintenance and repair.</p>
<p>Aside from his many patents on plane design, Jordanoff also introduced the so-called <i>Jordaphone</i> from his Electronics company, a wireless telephone, with an answering function and <a href="../../../a/m/p/Amplifier.html" title="Amplifier">amplifier</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intercom.html" title="Intercom">intercom</a> functions. It was the first of its kind, and preceded the modern inventions of the answering machine and tape recorder by 5 to 30 years. Another invention was the <i>Frozen Gasoline System</i> for airplanes.</p>
<p>The idea was to super-cool the fuel in an aircraft's tank with <a href="../../../d/r/y/Dry_ice.html" title="Dry ice">dry ice</a> and alcohol, thus making it inflammable. This system was never finally implemented, but its principles were later adopted in different forms. Further inventions of note included <i>The Reverse Thrust device</i>, which was made to decrease the specific fuel consumption and to increase the thrust of jet engines. The world's first <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airbag.html" title="Airbag">airbag</a>, meant to ensure the safety of pilots and automobile drivers alike, was designed by Jordanoff in (<a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a>).</p>
<p>The Stratoport resumed Jordanoff's interest in aviation. A special company was established: <i>The Stratoport Corporation of America</i> (<a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a>). It owned the patent issued for a field of two unidirectional no-cross <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runway.html" title="Runway">runways</a>, set end-to-end and elevated to slow-down planes that are landing and to speed-up those taking off. The runways were screened by high perforated fences that reduced crosswinds. The high screens were also expected to reduce the noise as well as the elevated ends to reduce the length and the area needed for runways. Nonetheless, as was the case with the <i>Jordaphone</i>, the new concept was too ambitious and modernistic.</p>
<p>Jordanoff married in 1929 Alice Grant Patton. She was ten years older than him. They divorced in 1942. In 1942 he married his second wife Diana. They divorced in 1950 after his financial collapse. In 1955 he married Lucile Andrews. When in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a> Jordanoff retired, he settled with her in a small cottage in <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harrison.html" title="Harrison">Harrison</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>.</p>

<p>Jordanoff's popularity in America became almost legendary, as he was often the subject of many anecdotes and polemics.
