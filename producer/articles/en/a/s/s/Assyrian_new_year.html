Kha B'Nissan celebrations in the Iraqi area of <a href="../../../a/l/q/Alqosh.html" title="Alqosh">Alqosh</a> (2006)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Before embracing <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, the Assyrians celebrated new year on what would be the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregorian_calendar.html" title="Gregorian calendar">Gregorian calendar</a>'s <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_21.html" title="March 21">March 21</a>, according to the ancient <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_calendar.html" title="Assyrian calendar">Assyrian calendar</a>. In ancient times, the "Akitu" event were held in the first month of the year (Nison) in the Assyrian calendar. The word "Kha" means one or first in the Assyrian language, thus it is dubbed "Kha b-Nissan". The date then and as it is now, is the very beginning of <a href="../../../s/p/r/Spring_%28season%29.html" title="Spring (season)">Spring</a>. Centuries before the fall of the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_Empire_a07a.html" title="Assyrian Empire">Assyrian Empire</a> in 612 BC, other nations like <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medes.html" title="Medes">Medes</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persians.html" title="Persians">Persians</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs.html" title="Arabs">Arabs</a> celebrated the March 21 as the New Year for all the ancient world which had been adopted during the expansion of the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian Empire</a> by <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrus_the_Great_bb5e.html" title="Cyrus the Great">Cyrus the Great</a>.</p>
<p>After the Assyrians converted to Christianity in the first century and the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregorian_calendar.html" title="Gregorian calendar">Gregorian calendar</a> was established in the Christian world, the Assyrian also accepted the new calendar and they moved their new year from March 21st to April 1st. <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_peoples.html" title="Iranian peoples">Iranians</a> and other groups still today celebrate this day on March 21. (In Iran the New Years Day is called <i>Noruz</i> meaning "New Day".)</p>
<p>In Assyria, during ancient times, this festival was the most important event on the year. People from all over the Empire came to either the political capital, Nineveh or the religious capital, Babylon and participated in the celebration. There were elaborate and magnificent processions to and from the great temple in Babylon called “Esagila”.</p>

<p>Assyrians of today celebrate the 1st of April by holding parades and parties. They also gather in clubs and social institutions and listen to the poets who recite the story of creation. The men and women wear traditional clothes and dance in parks for hours.</p>
<p>After the formation of the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkish state</a>, Khab Nissan along with the Kurdish Newrouz were banned from public to celebrate. Assyrians in Turkey were first allowed to publically celebrate kha b-nissan in 2006, after organisers received permission from the government to stage the event, in light of democratic reforms adopted in support of Turkey's <a href="../../../e/u/_/EU_f2e6.html" title="EU">EU</a> membership bid. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>The priest of Easagila (Mardukh’s house) would recite sad prayers with the other priests and the people would answer with equally sad prayers which expressed humanity's fear of the unknown, that's why the high priest would head every day to the Eesagila asking for Mardukh's forgiveness, begging him to protect Babylon, his holy city. This prayer was called the "The Secret Of Easagila".</p>

<p>The same rituals would be followed as in the previous three days then at night the Epic of Creation "Enuma Elish" (when on high) would be recited, telling the story of how the universe and the seasons were created, then how all gods united in god Mardukh following his victory over Tiamat the dragon. The recitation of this Epic was considered the beginning of preparations for the submission of the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_Babylon_5082.html" title="King of Babylon">King of Babylon</a> before Mardukh on the fifth day of Akitu.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_new_year.html" title="Edit section: Fifth Day">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fifth Day</span></h3>
<p>The submission of the king of Babylon before Mardukh. The king would enter to the Easagila accompanied by the priests, they would approach all together the altar where the high priest of the Eesagila impersonates Mardukh then he approaches the king, begins to strip him of his jewelry, scepter and even his crown then he would slap him hard while the latter would kneel and begins to pray asking for Mardukh's forgiveness and submitting to him saying: "I have not sinned O Lord of the universe, and I haven't neglected your heavenly might at all"... Then the priest in the role of Mardukh says: "Don't be afraid of what Mardukh has to say, for he will hear your prayers, extends your power, and increases the greatness of your reign". After this the king would stand up and the priest would give him back his jewelry, scepter and crown then slaps him hard again hoping for the king to shed tears, because that would express more the submission to Mardukh and respect to his power. When the priest returns the crown to the king that means his power was renewed by Mardukh, thus April would be considered not only the revival of nature and life but also to the State as well. Thus, these ceremonies would make the greatest and most feared personalities of that time (kings of Babylon and Nineveh) submit to the greatest god , and live a humbling moment with all the population, sharing prayers to prove their faith before the might of God. Following his presence in his earthly home Babylon and renewing its king's power, god Mardukh stays in the "nether world mountain" (a tower composed of seven floors, known in the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah.html" title="Torah">Torah</a> as the Tower of Babylon) where was Mardukh's dwelling or the Easagila (in the Torah God would dwell on a "mountain" Psalms 74:2). During this day according to the tradition of Akitu, Mardukh would enter his dwelling and is surprised by the evil gods who will fight him, then he's taken prisoner and awaits for arrival of his son god Nabu who would save him from "Nought" and restores his glory.</p>

<p>The arrival of <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> <a href="../../../n/a/b/Nabu.html" title="Nabu">Nabu</a> in boats accompanied by his assistants of brave Gods coming from <a href="../../../n/i/p/Nippur.html" title="Nippur">Nippur</a>, <a href="../../../u/r/u/Uruk.html" title="Uruk">Uruk</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/s/Kish.html" title="Kish">Kish</a>, and Eridu (cities ancient Babylonia). The Gods accompanying Nabu would be represented by statues which would be mounted on boats made especially for the occasion]. Here the people in huge numbers would begin their walk behind their king towards the Easagila where Mardukh is held prisoner, chanting the following&#160;:"Here's he who's coming from far to restore the glory of our imprisoned father".</p>

<p>On the third day of his imprisonment Nabu frees Mardukh. The evil gods had closed a huge gate behind him when he entered his dwelling. Mardukh would be fighting till Nabu's arrival ,when he would break in the huge gate and a battle would go on between the two groups, until Nabu comes out victorious and frees Mardukh.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_new_year.html" title="Edit section: Eighth Day">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Eighth Day</span></h3>
<p>When Mardukh is set free, the statues of the gods are gathered in the Destinies Hall "Upshou Ukkina", to deliberate his destiny, there it is decided to join all the forces of the gods and bestow them upon Mardukh. Here, the king implores all the gods to support and honour Mardukh, and this tradition was an indication that Mardukh received submission from all the gods and was unique in his position.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_new_year.html" title="Edit section: Ninth Day">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ninth Day</span></h3>
<p>The victory procession to the "House of Akitu" where Mardukh's victory in the beginning of Creation over the dragon Tiamat (goddess of the nether waters) is celebrated. The House of Akitu which the Assyrians of Nineveh called "Bet Ekribi" (“House of Prayers” in old Assyrian language), was about 200 meters outside the city's walls, where there were wonderful trees decorated and watered carefully out of respect to the god who's considered the one to grant nature its life. The victory procession was the population's way to express its joy at Mardukh's (Ashur) renewal of power and the destruction of evil forces which almost controlled life in the beginning.</p>

<p>Arriving at "Bet Akitu", god Mardukh begins to celebrate with both the upper and nether world gods (the statues of gods were arranged around a huge table such as in a feast) then Mardukh returns to the city at night celebrating his marriage to goddess "Ishtar" where earth and heaven are united, and as the gods unite so is this union arranged on earth. Thus the king personifies this union by playing the role of marrying the highest priestess of the Eesagila where they would both sit at the throne before the population and they recite special poems for the occasion. This love is going to bring forth life in spring.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_new_year.html" title="Edit section: Eleventh Day">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Eleventh Day</span></h3>
<p>The gods return accompanied by their Lord Mardukh (Ashur) to meet again in the Destinies Hall "Upshu Ukkina", where they met for the first time on the eight day, this time they will decide the fate of the people of Mardukh (Ashur). In ancient Assyrian philosophy Creation in general was considered as a covenant between heaven and earth as long as a human serves the gods till his death, therefore, gods' happiness isn't complete except if humans are happy as well, thus a human's destiny will be to be given happiness on the condition that he serves the gods. So Mardukh and the gods renew their covenant with Babylon then he returns to his upper house (Heaven).</p>

<p>The last day of Akitu. The gods return to Mardukh's temple (the statues are returned to the temple) and daily life resumes in Babylon, Nineveh, and the rest of the Assyrian cities.</p>
