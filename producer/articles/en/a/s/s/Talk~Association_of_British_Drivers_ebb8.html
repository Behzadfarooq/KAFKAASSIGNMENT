<p>Currently, although the facts may be supported by citations, without attributions as to who's research throws up the following as criticism of ABD policies, they all fall foul of the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> policy. I have therefore, moved them here until their inclusion in the article is fully justified with reasons as to what they are actually criticising, and who made the original criticism case is established.</p>
<ul>
<li>Taxation per car in the UK is around the European average, similar to France and Italy, higher than Germany, much lower than the Netherlands or Ireland (<a href="http://www.cfit.gov.uk/factsheets/02/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cfit.gov.uk/factsheets/02/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>). Comparing individual elements of motoring taxation, such as fuel duty, between countries is of questionable relevance<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, as different countries strike different balances between fuel duty, vehicle excise duty and road tolls.</li>
<li>The overall cost of motoring in Britain in 2003 was below the 1980 level in real terms, although the real cost of fuel was 7% higher, and bus and coach fares rose by 34% and rail fares by 36% in real terms over the same period<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. According to the RAC Foundation the major cost of motoring is the capital and depreciation costs of the vehicle, with fuel costs and excise duty being around one third of the cost of running a small car<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>.</li>
<li>The ABD claim they are opposed to <i>inappropriate</i> automated speed limit enforcement, but this is widely seen as oppiosition to <i>all</i> automated speed limit enforcement, or even that they actually oppose speed limits. There is robust <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speed_Limit_79b4.html#safety" title="Speed Limit">evidence</a> that reducing speeds reduces both the incidence and the severity of collisions.</li>
<li>The idea that car ownership might be correlated with economic performance or standard of living is also questionable, particularly in highly developed economies such as Britain. For example, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a> experienced a <i>decrease</i> in car travel between 1993 and 1997, while its per capita <a href="../../../g/p/d/GPD_8cbe.html" title="GPD">GPD</a> and <a href="../../../h/d/i/HDI_67d9.html" title="HDI">HDI</a> grew steadily.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></li>

<dd>We won't increase the quality of it by reporting their assertions without the context that shows their assertions to be, in many cases, baseless. For example, their campaigning point about affordability - it is verifiably true that (a) car ownership is now cheaper in real terms than it was in 1980; (b) more people now live in a house with two cars than one with one; (c) it is public transport, not motoring, whihc has become less affordable; (d) taxation is in any case a long way from being the most significant element of the cost of motoring; (e) the desirability of increases in car ownership are in any case open to question, given the geographical constraints operating in the UK. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 15:10, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>ABD state that car ownership rates are low by international standards. ABD are wrong, as is made ab undantly clear when the figures are analysed. The statement of claims, by splitting the sentence as it does, implies that the claim is supported by a fact of low ownership, but the fact of low ownership is not established. I dispute DeFacto's assertion in edit summary that comparison by GDP is "irrelevant" - what the hell do you suppose people use to buy cars with? You can't compare figures and ignore context. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 09:42, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>They claim car ownership is low, the figures show that to be the case - 14th is low. GDP may also be low, but that doesn't alter the fact in question. -<a href="../../../d/e/f/User%7EDeFacto_97f0.html" title="User:DeFacto">De Facto</a> 10:02, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Don't be absurd. You previously said that the UK was the fourth richest nation on Earth but was only thirteenth in this list. As it turns out, we are ranked about the same by GDP and by car ownership. Which indicates that the ABD's argument is specious. Either remove the claim altogether, or give it in full context, including ranking by GDP. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 10:30, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is even more ridiculous. You have now added the text that of ranked by GDP, Britain is fourth. Without data for population that is utterly meaningless.

<dd>The ADB observe that UK car ownership is low by international standards - fine, ownership is lower than that of at least 13 other nations, and probably a few more besides - full stop. However, you attempt to discredit or diminish that fact by introducing the level of GDP per head as somehow nullifying the car ownership statistic, well it doesn't affect it. It may be another interesting statistic but is not relevant. -<a href="../../../d/e/f/User%7EDeFacto_97f0.html" title="User:DeFacto">De Facto</a> 12:10, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, ABD claims British car ownership is low by international standards, but ranking by car ownership per capita is not significantly different to that by GDP per capita, and rankking by total cars is not significantly different from ranking by population. Their claim is debatable. Viewed by population per unit area, four countries have denser population, of whihc two (including Japan) have lower car ownership per capita. All these facts are necessary in order to fully understand the nature and interpretation of ABD's claim. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 12:24, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>DeFacto, the way the sentence is written it appears to state that ABD members believe A and B is a fact. This can be cured by one of several means: either we leave the discussion of the low ownership claim to the separate section, or we run the two sentences together "A and B" (which may involve some awkward phrasing in this case), or we can make it a separate bullet as "That car ownership is low in the UK by international standards". But just slapping it back in there and <i>ignoring expressed concerns</i> is not up to your usual standards. We've managed ot get this far without a war, I don't think we need one right now. Incidentally, I believe you have now reverted that text four times. But let's not get into silliness, I think we can fix this. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 15:45, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm having real concerns that this article is getting longer and longer and more and more of the article is about claims and counterclaims. Any article with more than one third content about claims and counterclaims is getting offtrack. The problem faced is the use of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">pseudoscience</a> and overuse of web based resources (rather than visiting libraries full of books, particularly textbooks) by defenders of minority groups like the ABD. This is compounded by the lack of authoritive criticism as the holders of the majority/conventional view don't bother issuing press releases and commenting generally about such extreme views. For a good example of how bad an article can get see <a href="../../../s/a/f/SafeSpeed_12fd.html" title="SafeSpeed">SafeSpeed</a>. I would suggest trimming severely the claim and counterclaim in the article and leave it in the Talk pages which are a forum for debate (but the encyclopedia is not). <a href="../../../s/o/f/User%7ESoftgrow_68d6.html" title="User:Softgrow">Softgrow</a> 01:14, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's interesting that the entire low car ownership section has been removed by an anonymous editor on the grounds that "ABD make no such claim" - but DeFacto states that the claim was taken straight from their website. Where, I notye, not only is it included, but it is included <i>on a separate line</i> as I left it. If an ortganisation makes claims and those claims are problematic, we have a duty to make it clear that they <i>are</i> problematic. Otherwise poeple will go away with the misleading impression that ABD are a mainstream organisation backed by facts, rather than a pressure group representative of a vocal minority. The fact that British car ownership and taxation levels are neither unusually low nor unusually high is a matter of record, and the fact that ABD claims otherwise cannot be allowed to stand unchallenged. That would be a failure of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.

<dd>Maybe you should also point out that the author and administrator for this ABD section JzG is Guy Chapman who is anti-car ABD/SafeSpeed opponent using Wikipedia for his own personal vendetta. As for those facts about the ABD, there is more to the ABD than the single issue you are spending so much time on - if you wish to develop an impartial and accurate view then you need to present those facts (and sources) on both side of the argument in equal detail otherwise you become guilty of lacking those very same balanced principles you claim do not exist in the ABD and SafeSpeed websites.</dd>

<li>Population density is relevant because it influences car ownership rates (ask anyone who's lived in Tokyo or London, for example). Of most relevance is probably the proportion of the population which lives in major conurbations, but I'm not sure how to get that figure. We need to state it's a weighted average because the simple average is 425, and seeing the average stated as 465 without noting it's weighted is confusing. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 11:30, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The average (mean) of 465 isn't weighted, or confusing, it is the number of cars per 1000 population in the EU - the same units as the rest of the table. What is 425? -<a href="../../../d/e/f/User%7EDeFacto_97f0.html" title="User:DeFacto">De Facto</a> 11:53, 28 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If you take the average of the figures listed in the table, it's 424.76 (brought down by the likes of Denmark and Cyrpus). The weighted average by total population is 464.92. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 12:33, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Given your insistence that population density is significant when interpretting the cars per capita figures, how can you laugh at the inclusion of Luxembourg in the comparisons, and insist that the figure for the USA is a good benchmark for comparing with the UK, given the following population density figures:- USA: 30 people/km<sup>2</sup>, UK: 250 people/km<sup>2</sup>, Luxembourg: 180 people/km<sup>2</sup>. -<a href="../../../d/e/f/User%7EDeFacto_97f0.html" title="User:DeFacto">De Facto</a> 12:58, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's a rather puzzling question. Luxembourg is a very small, and very rich, principality, it is unquestionably not a place that the average Briton would consider when drawing comparisons, and it's not representative of anything much. The US is an obvious benchmark, since they famously take to their cars for any journey more than 600 feet and most Brits will have a picture of what US car ownership "looks" like thanks to their enormous cultural influence over us. There used to be a comparison in there which noted that only one of the countries above us in the table had higher population density, but it got removed. As I said, I think the real determinant is the proportion of the population which lives in conurbations. As it stands, though, I think the section is fair: it makes the point that Britain's car ownership is not, by any objective measure, particularly low. I don't know how the ABD would react if we were up there with Germany - imagine the effect of a 15% increase in traffic! As an aside, GDP per capita for Netherlands is $30,500, Belgium is $31,400, France is 29,900, Germany $30,400 and the UK is $30,300; it's not clear to me what advantage greater car ownership is supposed to confer. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 15:07, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On the one hand you say that population density is significant, but the US with a fraction of the density of the UK is a reasonable comparator. On the other hand you say that wealth and car ownership do not correlate but that Luxembourg, although it has a density approaching that of the UK is not representative because of its wealth. On the congestion issue, I've a feeling the ABD would say that if the UK people want cars let them have them, don't tax their use so that the less wealthy can't afford them, and do provide the necessary infrastructure to minimise congestion. The advantage of ownership is not, I believe, a concern of the ABD, it is the right to fair access to ownership which they campaign for. -<a href="../../../d/e/f/User%7EDeFacto_97f0.html" title="User:DeFacto">De Facto</a> 15:45, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So on what gorunds to ABD members assert that British car ownership is low, then? By comparison with what similar populations? The US is "the great car economy" - and we're the great car economy less six percent. You think we should aspire to be more like the French? I don't think too many ABD members love the French, from my conversations with them&#160;:-) Serisuly, comparing countries with similar GDP I find a pretty random distribution of car ownership, and comparing countries with similar car ownership I find a pretty random distribution of GDP. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 15:52, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The <i>Criticism</i> section seems to be a mere collection of assertions, which most people, including those in the ABD would probably agree with. Surely the section should contain actual criticism of ABD objectives or campaigns. The fact that some countries tax car ownership more than the UK is not a valid criticism of the notion that car ownership could be taxed less. 29% of households have two or more cars - that is a criticism of what - of the fact that they think that some of the 27% without one should have a fair chance to have one too? Car ownership costs have dropped in real terms and PT costs have risen - again it is a fact, it is not a valid criticism of the valid aspiration to allow all those who want one to have one. Please ask yourself the question "Which aspect of the ABD agenda is the criticism addressing?" before you write it - and then state that in the item, and support it with attributions of where the criticism arose, and with citations to support assertions. -<a href="../../../d/e/f/User%7EDeFacto_97f0.html" title="User:DeFacto">De Facto</a> 16:11, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I moved the following paragraph here from the main article so that we can clarify what aspect of the ABD or their works or policies is it criticising or opposing. It seems simply to be asserting accepted and undisputed statistics to me.</p>
<ul>
<li>The overall cost of motoring in Britain in 2003 was below the 1980 level in real terms, although the real cost of fuel was 7% higher, and bus and coach fares rose by 34% and rail fares by 36% in real terms over the same period<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>. According to the RAC Foundation the major cost of motoring is the capital and depreciation costs of the vehicle, with fuel costs and excise duty being around one third of the cost of running a small car<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>-<a href="../../../d/e/f/User%7EDeFacto_97f0.html" title="User:DeFacto">De Facto</a> 10:48, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The fact of the cost having dropped is from a reliable source, cited. The cost of depreciation and finance being the bulk of the annual cost ios also from a reliable source, cited. ABD campaigns on issues surrounding the cost of motoring and taxation, this proves that the cost is stable and that taxation is not the major cost anyway (see "Car ownership should be affordable to all levels of society — rich and poor."). It also points out that focusing non fuel excise duty, as ABD do, is misleading. It is relevant, valid and well supported. It adds to the facts regarding increasing car ownership to show that ABD's claims of unaffordability are essentially baseless. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 09:30, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Technology items tend to get significantly cheaper in real terms over the years, motoring hasn't, and largely because of the taxation elemnet. The ABD appear to want motoring taxes reduced. Is this supposed to be a criticism of of that desire? If it is why not put it in the article so that it is clear. -<a href="../../../d/e/f/User%7EDeFacto_97f0.html" title="User:DeFacto">De Facto</a> 10:26, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Which fails to explain why public transport is so much more expoensive, despite the heavy investment in new and improved technologies. But that is an aside: motoring has become more, not less, affordable, and more people now have cars as a result. Both of these are provable facts, but go against ABD's message of people being priced out of motoring by fuel duty. Since the cost is gogin down in real terms and the major cost is not fuel anyway, this is valid criticism.

<li>ABD assert that "Car ownership should be affordable to all levels of society — rich and poor." The fact that car ownership costs are stable and it's <i>public transport</i> which is getting less affordable address this view directly.</li>
<li>ABD assert that petrol taxation is too high. The facts that petrol taxation is calculated to be only a minor part of running costs, and that British motoring taxation is about average for Europe address this view directly.</li>
<li>ABD assert that they oppose "inappropriate" speed enforcement (i.e. enforcement of the law where it is inappropriate in the eyes of the criminals, a group not usually given much weight when deciding on enforcement policy).

<dd>OK, let's concentrate on just one of the beliefs: "Car ownership should be affordable to all levels of society — rich and poor". Are you asserting that the fact that car ownership costs have dropped a bit since 1980 is proof that car ownership is <i>already</i> affordable by all? That, of course, is not the only possible conclusion given that fact.

<p>Let's analyse the following paragraph from the article and see if it is worthy of inclusion:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>The ABD state that they are opposed to inappropriate automated speed limit enforcement, arguing for objective criteria to be used in establishing limits and enforcement policies in their manifesto[8], but this is widely seen as an evasion and interpreted as opposition to all automated speed limit enforcement, or even that they actually oppose speed limits.[9]</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Up to the first footnote reference ([8]) the sentence appears to be reflecting their stated position.</li>
<li>The next bit "<i>, but this is widely seen as</i>" appears to be a text-book example of <i>weasel words</i>, as described in <a href="../../../a/w/w/WP%7EAWW_3219.html" title="WP:AWW">WP:AWW</a>. A more acceptable form would be something like ". Journalist XXX, in his weekly column in <i>The YYY</i> newspaper, suggests that this is...".</li>
<li>The next bit "<i>an evasion</i>". Evading what? It isn't clear at all what is meant by this.</li>
<li>The next bit "<i>and interpreted as opposition to all automated speed limit enforcement</i>". Who specifically interprets their stated position as meaning this and where is the supporting citation, quote the precise sentence from the article to clarify this. I couldn't glean that from the cited article, so couldn't fix the problem.</li>
<li>The last bit "<i>or even that they actually oppose speed limits</i>". This is even more bizarre and an equally unsupported assertion.</li>
</ul>
<p>This paragraph is, in my opinion, POV-inspired, and not worthy of inclusion. It needs a serious clean-up, with all opinions clearly and verifiably attributed, or the whole lot should be removed. Remembering that <i>original research</i> is also excluded from articles - see <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, and paraphrasing, or "reading between the lines" of the cited article may well be construed as <i>original research</i>, so is probably best avoided.-- <a href="../../../d/e/f/User%7EDeFacto_97f0.html" title="User:DeFacto">de Facto</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/f/User_talk%7EDeFacto_6dea.html" title="User talk:DeFacto">talk</a>). 13:31, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The major problem here is actually <i>their</i> POV, in that many ABD members clearly interpret any speed limit lower than they want to go as inappropriate. Absent any verifiable standard for what is and is not an appropropriate speed limit, and absent any way of credibly measuring how those non-drivers affected view it (e.g. occupants of houses adjacent to roads subject to speeding), the "approrpiate" in inherently unmeasurable.

<li>Don't be silly, if I thought it was unsupportable OR I would not add it - and I'm not unaware of my own bias either. I have read quite widely on road safety issues, and it is generally accepted that most drivers overestimate their own ability, which is a key reason why drivers' own subjective judgments of what constitutes an appropriate speed need to be treated with scepticism. As long as the article makes this sufficiently clear - i.e. it points out that ABD's definition of <i>inappropriate</i> may not be inappropriate per any objective criteria, likely influenced by the fact that the benefit of speed accrues to the individual whereas the disbenefits apply to the wider community, I'll be happy enough. I thought this article had settled quite nicely, but it seems that every now and then you revisit it and try to cut out that which is not necessarily sympathetic to ABD. They are a libertarian fringe group, after all. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 11:04, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
