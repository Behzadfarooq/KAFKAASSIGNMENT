<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrians_in_Iraq_d993.html" title="Edit section: British Mandate">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">British Mandate</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>, Britain resettled 20,000 <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_people.html" title="Assyrian people">Assyrians</a> in Iraqi refugee camps in <a href="../../../b/a/q/Baquba.html" title="Baquba">Baquba</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandan.html" title="Mandan">Mandan</a> after Turkey violently quelled a British-inspired Assyrian <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebellion.html" title="Rebellion">rebellion</a>. From there, due to their higher level of education, many gravitated toward <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirkuk.html" title="Kirkuk">Kirkuk</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/b/Habbaniya%2C_Iraq_ddd0.html" title="Habbaniya, Iraq">Habbaniya</a>, where they were indispensable in the administration of the oil and military projects. As a result, approximately three-fourths of the Assyrians who had sided with the British during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> found themselves living in Kurdish areas of Iraq. Thousands of Assyrian men had seen service in the <i>Iraqi Levies</i>, a force under British officers separate from the regular Iraqi army. Pro-British, they had been apprehensive of Iraqi independence. Most of those thus resettled by the British have gone into <a href="../../../e/x/i/Exile.html" title="Exile">exile</a>, although by the end of the twentieth century, almost all of those who remain were born in Iraq. Assyrians living in northern Iraq today are those whose ancestry lies in the north originally. Many of these, however, in places like Berwari, have been displaced by Kurds since World War I. This process has continued throughout the twentieth century: as Kurds have expanded in population, Assyrians have come under attack as in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a>, and as a result have fled from Iraq. (Stafford, <i>Tragedy of the Assyrians</i>, 1935)</p>
<p>Unlike the <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurds.html" title="Kurds">Kurds</a>, the Assyrians scarcely expected a nation-state of their own after World War I, but they did demand <a href="../../../r/e/s/Restitution.html" title="Restitution">restitution</a> from Turkey for the material and population losses they had suffered, especially in northwest Iran, a neutral party in WWI invaded by Turkish forces. Their pressure for some temporal authority in the north of Iraq under the Assyrian patriarch, the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mar_Eshai_Shimun_XXIII_68dd.html" title="Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII">Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII</a>, was flatly refused by British and Iraqis alike.</p>
<p><a name="Independent_Kingdom_of_Iraq" id="Independent_Kingdom_of_Iraq"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrians_in_Iraq_d993.html" title="Edit section: Independent Kingdom of Iraq">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Independent Kingdom of Iraq</span></h2>
<p>In 1933, the Iraqi government held the Patriarch of the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_the_East_bbc4.html" title="Church of the East">Church of the East</a>, the Mar Shamun, under <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_arrest.html" title="House arrest">house arrest</a>. When he left Iraq to appeal to the British with regard to how the Assyrians were being mistreated in Iraq contrary to the agreement at Iraq's independence to refrain from discrimination against minorities, he was stripped of his <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizenship.html" title="Citizenship">citizenship</a> and refused reentry.</p>
<p>During July 1933, about 800 armed Assyrians headed for the Syrian border, where they were turned back. While <a href="../../../f/a/i/Faisal_I_of_Iraq_4179.html" title="Faisal I of Iraq">King Faisal</a> had briefly left the country for medical reasons, the Minister of Interior, Hikmat Sulayman, adopted a policy aimed at a final solution of the Assyrian "problem". This policy was implemented by a Kurd, General <a href="../../../b/a/k/Bakr_Sidqi_5d21.html" title="Bakr Sidqi">Bakr Sidqi</a>. After engaging in several clashes with the Assyrians, on 11 August 1933, Sidqi permitted his men to kill about 3,000 Assyrians, including women and children, at the Assyrian villages of <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumail.html" title="Sumail">Sumail</a> (Simele) district, and later at Suryia. Having scapegoated the Assyrians as dangerous national traitors, this massacre became a symbol of national pride, and enhanced Sidqi's prestige. The British, though represented by a powerful military presence as provided by the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930, failed to intervene, and indeed helped white-washed the event at the League of Nations.</p>
<p>The Assyrian repression marked the entrance into Iraqi politics of the military, a pattern that has periodically re-emerged since 1958, and offered an excuse for enlarging conscription. The hugely popular Assyrian massacre, an indication of the latent anti-Christian atmosphere, also set the stage for the increased prominence of Bakr Sidqi. In October <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>, Bakr Sidqi staged the first military coup in the modern <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_world.html" title="Arab world">Arab world</a>.</p>
<p>The <i>World Directory of Minorities</i> states that there are over 300,000 Chaldean Assyrian Christians in Iraq and that they live mainly in Baghdad. Until the 1950s, Chaldeans were mostly settled in Mosul -- in 1932, 70 percent of Iraqi Christians (Assyrian and Chaldean) lived there, but by 1957, only 47 percent remained, as they migrated southward due in part to violence and regional and political tensions. It was estimated that about half of Iraq's Christian's lived in Baghdad by 1979, accounting for 14 percent of that city's population</p>
<p>This period also marks the intensification of denominational antagonism among Aramaic speakers in Iraq as some church institutions began to distance themselves from the members of the Church of the East who were seen as magnets for Muslim antagonism. It is from this period that, as the new Mosul-born patriarch of the Assyrian Apostolic Church of Antioch and All the East (Jacobite) came into the pinnacle of this church's hierarchy, he began to move the Church away from the term Assyrian and toward the term "Syrian." At the same time, this Church moved its See to <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damascus.html" title="Damascus">Damascus</a>, Syria.</p>

Syriac was to be the language of tuition at all primary schools in which the majority of pupils spoke that language in addition to Arabic. Syriac was also to be taught at intermediate and secondary schools in which the majority of students spoke that language in addition to Arabic. Special programmes in Syriac were to be broadcast on public radio and television and three Syriac-language magazines were to be published. An Association of Syriac-Speaking Authors and Writers has also been established. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> The bill turned out to be a failure. A radio station created as the result of this decree was closed after a few months. The two magazines were allowed to be published printed 90 percent of their material in Arabic. No school was allowed to teach in Syriac. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>In modern times, Assyrians, for whom no reliable census figures exist in Iraq (as they do not for Kurds or <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkmen_people.html" title="Turkmen people">Turkmen</a>), have been doubly mistreated; first by their Kurdish neighbors, then by <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam_Hussein_75a3.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>'s <a href="../../../b/a/a/Baath_Party_abf8.html" title="Baath Party">Ba'athist</a> regime. Assyrians were deprived of their cultural and national rights while at the same time the Ba'athist regime tried to co-opt their history. In northern Iraq today, a similar pattern is emerging as Kurds attempt to rewrite the history of the region to give it a Kurdish flavor and diminish its historic Assyrian heritage. As in Ba'athist Iraq, there is a strong tendency in Iraq today to recognize only two ethnic groups: Arab or Kurd. However, the <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdish_Autonomous_Region_3692.html" title="Kurdish Autonomous Region">Kurdish Autonomous Region</a> has claimed that it has been instrumental in the renovation and support of Assyrian churches and schools.</p>
<p>After Saddam Hussein's fall in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_Democratic_Movement_fadc.html" title="Assyrian Democratic Movement">Assyrian Democratic Movement</a> was one of the smaller political parties that emerged in the social chaos of the occupation. Its officials say that while members of the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_Democratic_Movement_fadc.html" title="Assyrian Democratic Movement">Assyrian Democratic Movement</a> also took part in the liberation of the key oil cities of Kirkuk and Mosul in the north, the Assyrians were not invited to join the steering committee that was charged with defining Iraq's future. The ethnic make-up of the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_Interim_Governing_Council_bc61.html" title="Iraq Interim Governing Council">Iraq Interim Governing Council</a> briefly (September 2003 - June 2004) guiding Iraq after the invasion included a single Assyrian Christian, <a href="../../../y/o/u/Younadem_Kana_176e.html" title="Younadem Kana">Younadem Kana</a>, a leader of the Assyrian Democratic Movement and an opponent of Saddam Hussein since <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>.</p>
