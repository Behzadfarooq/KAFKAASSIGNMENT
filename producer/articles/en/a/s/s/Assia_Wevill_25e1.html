<p>Assia Gutmann was the daughter of a Jewish physician of Russian origin and spent her youth in <a href="../../../t/e/l/Tel_Aviv_6d0d.html" title="Tel Aviv">Tel Aviv</a>. Cited by friends and family as a free-spirited young woman she would go out to dance at the British soldiers' club, where she met and married her first husband, Sergeant John Steel, with whom she moved to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> in 1946. They later emigrated to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> where she enrolled in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_British_Columbia_eb6a.html" title="University of British Columbia">University of British Columbia</a>, Vancouver, and where she was to meet her second husband, Canadian economist <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Lipsey_f32c.html" title="Richard Lipsey">Richard Lipsey</a>.</p>
<p>In 1956, on a ship to London she met the 21-year-old poet <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Wevill_1dab.html" title="David Wevill">David Wevill</a>, eight years her junior. They began an affair and Assia divorced Lipsey, marrying Wevill in 1960.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

Wevill was also very accomplished in advertising and helped produced several commercials for television that were considered pioneering.</p>
<p>Regarded as a stunning beauty, Wevill's sister Celia said that she greatly feared aging and losing her beauty. Assia gradually become severely depressed in the years following Shura's birth. However, she was reported to have been a very devoted mother to her.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Assia_Wevill_25e1.html" title="Edit section: Ted Hughes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ted Hughes</span></h2>
<p>In 1961, poets <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Hughes_ee58.html" title="Ted Hughes">Ted Hughes</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/l/Sylvia_Plath_537e.html" title="Sylvia Plath">Sylvia Plath</a> rented their flat in Chalcot Road, Primrose Hill, London to Assia and David Wevill, and took up residence at <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Tawton_073b.html" title="North Tawton">North Tawton</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devon.html" title="Devon">Devon</a>.</p>
<p>Hughes was immediately struck with her, as she was with him, and Sylvia noted it.</p>
<p>Soon after, Ted and Assia began an affair. At the time of Plath's suicide, Assia was pregnant with Hughes' child, but terminated the pregnancy soon after.<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,3857472,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,3857472,00.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> The actual relationship, who instigated it, and its circumstances have been hotly debated for many years.</p>
<p>Hughes moved her into Court Green (a Mid Devon home that he had bought for Plath) where Assia helped care for Sylvia's children, Frieda and Nicholas. Wevill was reportedly haunted by Plath's memory; she even began using things that had once belonged to the poet<a href="http://www.uta.edu/english/tim/poetry/sp/the%20people%20in%20sylvia.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uta.edu/english/tim/poetry/sp/the%20people%20in%20sylvia.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> In the biography on Assia, <i>Lover of Unreason</i>, the authors maintain that Assia used Sylvia's items not out of obsession, but rather for the sake of practicality as she was maintaining a household for Hughes and his children. On March 3, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a> at age 37, Wevill gave birth to Alexandra Tatiana Eloise, nicknamed "Shura", while still married to David.</p>
<p>However, being quite ostracized from her lover's friends and family, and eclipsed by the figure of Sylvia in public (and private) life, she began becoming anxious and suspicious of Ted's infidelity, which was real enough. He began affairs with Brenda Hedden, a married acquaintance who frequented their home, and Carol Orchard, a nurse twenty years his junior whom he married in 1970. Wevill's relationship with Ted was also fraught with complexities derived from his callousness, which has recently come to light in a collection of Hughes' letters to her that have been acquired by Emory University <a href="http://blogs.smh.com.au/entertainment/archives/undercover/009391.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://blogs.smh.com.au/entertainment/archives/undercover/009391.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. She was continually distraught at his seeming reluctance to commit to marrying and setting up a home with her while treating her as a "housekeeper". Most of Hughes' friends indicate that while he never publically claimed Shura as his daughter, his sister Olwyn said that he did believe the child was his.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_23.html" title="March 23">March 23</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, Assia Wevill took her own life and that of their daughter in a manner that closely reenacted Plath's suicide. Dragging a mattress into the kitchen, Assia sealed the door and window. She then lay her sleeping child down on the mattress and dissolved some sleeping pills for herself in a glass of water. Taking the pills, she turned on the gas stove, and lay down next to her daughter.</p>

<p>Ted Hughes' book "Crow" was dedicated to the memory of Assia and Shura. His poem "Folktale" deals with his relation to Assia:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>She wanted the silent heraldry</i></dd>
<dd><i>Of the purple beach by the noble wall.</i></dd>
<dd><i>He wanted Cabala the ghetto demon</i></dd>
<dd><i>With its polythene bag full of ashes.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>In 1995, Hughes published half a dozen poems he had written for Assia, which were hidden among the 240 poems in <i>New Selected Poems</i>. "When her grave opened its ugly mouth/ why didn't you just fly,/ Why did you kneel down at the grave's edge/ to be identified/ accused and convicted?" he wrote in The Error. In The Descent, he wrote: "...your own hands, stronger than your choked outcry,/Took your daughter from you. She was stripped from you,/The last raiment/Clinging round your neck, the sole remnant/Between you and the bed/ In the underworld..."</p>
<p>In the feature film <i><a href="../../../s/y/l/Sylvia_%282003_film%29.html" title="Sylvia (2003 film)">Sylvia</a></i>, Assia Wevill was portrayed by <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amira_Casar_df54.html" title="Amira Casar">Amira Casar</a>.</p>
