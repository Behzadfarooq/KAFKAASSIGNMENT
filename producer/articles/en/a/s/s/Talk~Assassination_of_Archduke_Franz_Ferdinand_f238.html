<p>There have recently been extensive additions to this article detailing not only the original assasination plot but alleged subsequent conspiracies by Serbia, France and even Montenegro. There are no supporting citations and much of the new material seems to be classic "Balkan conspiracy" conjecture. The result has been to swamp the original fairly factual account of the assasination, its background and implications with dubious suppositions presented as fact. Perhaps the article could be edited into entirely separate historic account and conspiracy theory sections.</p>

<p>I've seen a few times the story that the Duke's wounds perhaps would have been treatable had he not been sewn into his uniform (as dictated by current fashion), thus slowing doctors' efforts to save him. This story was cited from "Isaac Asimov's Book of Facts" on one site. Is this really true? <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFelosele_6777.html" title="User:Felosele">Felosele</a> 27 June 2006</p>
<p>I don't think that it is. I have seen the actual uniform on display in the Heeresgeschichtliches Museum in Vienna. It is torn on one side of the chest - about where his medals would have been, but there are no signs that it was sewn tight or that he had to be cut out of it. Of course he may have been wearing a corset - that was a fashion of the time for corpulent wearers of tight military uniforms and that would have delayed medical treatment.</p>

<p>I've heard from several sources that the bomb, or dynamite, was actually thrown inside the archduke's cart, but that he threw it out himself. And I also heard the guy who killed them was in a bar, drunk. Did anybody else, too? <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Star_8693.html" title="Red Star">Red Star</a></p>
<p>My AP history teacher showed us a movie from the history channel, which said the guy who threw the grenade forgot that grenades have a delay and the archduke hit the grenade away when he saw it fall in the car.</p>
<p>Count Harrach, and many others including the bomb thrower himself make it clear that the Kragujevac bomb bounced off the folded back hood of the car in which Franz-Ferdinand rode and then landed in the street its timed detonator going off as the next vehicle passed. The confusion comes from a New York Times article that was in error and one witness with a bad view. These bombs were armed by banging the detonator against a hard object such as the light poll used in this case. It appears the detonator cap seperated from the bomb in midflight and the cap scratched the Arch-Duchess' cheek as it passed. Franz-Ferdinand it seems raised his hand to try to block the detonator cap but missed.</p>

<p>A note on the bottom of page 344 of Michael Balfour's book, "The Kaiser and his Times," Houghton Mifflin (1964) states:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The chief instigator of the assassination was almost certainly the Serb director of Military Intelligence, in his private capacity as head of the secret society 'The Black Hand'. The Russian Miltary Attache at Belgrade equally certainly was in the secret. So was the Serb Prime Minister, Pasic who, although frightened of what war would mean for Serbia, was even more frightened of the 'Black Hand'. Pasic did send a warning to Vienna but by the time it had passed through several intermediaries, it became so muffled as to be disregarded."</dd>
</dl>
<p>[User: Domenico Rosa, 29 June 2006]</p>
<p>The "private capacity" portion of which does not square well with the confession of Serbia's Chief of Military Intelligence:</p>
<p>“As the Chief of the Intelligence Department of the General Staff, I engaged Rade Malobabić to organize the information service in Austria-Hungary. I took this step in agreement with the Russian Military Attaché Artamonov, who had a meeting with Rade in my presence. Feeling that Austria was planning a war with us, I thought that the disappearance of the Austrian Heir Apparent would weaken the power of the military clique he headed, and thus the danger of war would be removed or postponed for a while. I engaged Malobabić to organize the assassination on the occasion of the announced arrival of Franz Ferdinand to Sarajevo...." (This is the english translation appearing on page 398 of "The Road to Sarajevo", by Dedijer of the confession of Dragutin Dimitrievic to the Serbia Court Martial in French Occupied Salonika where he was being tried on other charges.)</p>
<p>One needs to be skeptical of this "private capacity" claim popular in Entente capitals. Heads of government spy agencies don't have a private capacity to conduct clandestined actions. Its like saying Iran-Contra was a private act of CIA director Casey; but at least in Iran-Contra, charges were brought by the government. In the case of Franz-Ferdinand's assassination, no one was ever charged with any act in the assassination by Serbia or any other Entente Power. Werchovsky 00:30, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Italian historian Leo Valiani was born in 1909 in Fiume, which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Valiani wrote the following in "The End of Austria-Hungary," Alfred A. Knopf, New York (1973) pp 9-10 [translation of: "La Dissoluzione dell'Austria-Ungheria," Casa Editrice Il Saggiatore, Milano (1966) pp 19-20]:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Francis Ferdinand was a prince of absolutist inclinations, but he had certain intellectual gifts and undoubted moral earnestness. One of his projects--though because of his impatient, suspicious, almost hysterical temperament, his commitment to it, and the methods by which he proposed to bring it about, often changed--was to consolidate the structure of the state and the authority and popularity of the Crown, on which he saw clearly that the fate of the dynasty depended, by abolishing, if not the dominance of the German Austrians, which he wished to maintain for military reasons, though he wanted to dimish it in the civil administration, certainly the far more burdensome sway of the Magyars over the Slav and Romanian nationalities which in 1848-49 had saved the dynasty in armed combat with the Hungarian revolution. Baron Margutti, Francis Joseph's aide-de-camp, was told by Francis Ferdinand in 1895 and--with a remarkable consistency in view of the changes that took place in the intervening years--again in 1913, that the introduction of the dual system in 1867 had been disastrous and that, when he ascended the throne, he intended to re-establish strong central government: this objective, he believed, could be attained only by the simultaneous granting of far-reaching administrative autonomy to all the nationalities of the monarchy. In a letter of February 1, 1913, to Berchtold, the Foreign Minister, in which he gave his reasons for not wanting war with Serbia, the Archduke said that 'irredentism in our country ... will cease immediately if our Slavs are given a comfortable, fair and good life' instead of being trampled on (as they were being trampled on by the Hungarians). It must have been this which caused Berchtold, in a character sketch of Francis Ferdinand written ten years after his death, to say that, if he had succeeded to the throne, he would have tried to replace the dual system by a supranational federation."</dd>

<p>I've heard security was a major issue here--the Austrio-Hungarian government didn't provide much, if any, and the Bosnians of course didn't care to provide it. If anyone knows more than I do it would be a good to mention in the article.</p>

<p>I think this should be called <b>Assassination of Franz Ferdinand</b>, or <b>Franz Ferdinand Assassination</b>.

<dd>The event is commonly known in history as the Assassination in Sarajevo. Other encyclopedias also call it that. The naming convention is to use the most common name, which migh not necessarily be the most logical, accurate or consistent one. Redirects from those should of course be provided. I'll move the article back here. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 01:22, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It would be interesting to find out what the event is called around the world. I had certainly never heard of it as the <i>Assassination in Sarajevo</i> before looking it up on Wikipedia today. I was astonished to read references on different pages saying that this was the common term. I've always heard it called <i>The Assassination of Archduke Ferdinand</i> and could not have said for sure which city it occurred in. Now I'm not proud of not knowing which city it had happened in, but I wonder if other people may be the same. - <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussell_Brown_5678.html" title="User:Russell Brown">Russell Brown</a> 09:22, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>He should be called by his title "Archduke" because he was heir-apparent and in fact was already taking over responsibilities as head of state. "Assassination in Sarajevo" does not indicate who was killed.</p>

<p><i>The authorities thought the imprisonment would be arbitrary, until one member, Danilo Ilić, lost his patience and told the authorities everything, including the fact that the guns were supplied by the Serb government.</i></p>
<p>I'm not sure what "arbitrary" is supposed to mean here. Certainly the people doing the arresting thought they had the right people.

<p>OK, a not-logged-in user keeps changing the phrase "saved from lynching" to "tried to save from lynching" in a photo caption. If Princip had been lynched, he would have been killed, yes? Since he wasn't killed by the mob, he was successfully saved. I guess maybe the individual in question didn't necessarily save him, but the phrase "tried to save" definitely implies that he was killed. --<a href="../../../j/f/r/User%7EJfruh_0123.html" title="User:Jfruh">Jfruh</a> 8 July 2005 14:25 (UTC)</p>

<p>The former last paragraph - what isn't wrong (not Chaos Theory; causes of WWI much more complex) or speculation (Cold War) here is obvious, it could be said about most such events that a chain of coincidences led to them. And it doesn't belong in the Relics section. Clearly a somewhat random addition. <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFlux.books_88d7.html" title="User:Flux.books">flux.books</a> 15:49, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It may also be worth noting that the assassination was one of the finest examples of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaos_Theory_a66d.html" title="Chaos Theory">Chaos Theory</a> in action. The assassination was, it could be said, caused by Ferdinand's driver taking a wrong turn. This in turn gave the assassin a second chance to carry out the assassination, which led to the outbreak of World War One, which caused 20 million deaths. World War One set the stage for World War Two to start two decades later, which in turn caused another sixty million deaths and caused the Cold War - which easily could have destroyed humanity had it become a hot war. These events shaped the modern world, and will indeed shape human history in the centuries to come.</dd>

<p>The section labelled 'Consequences' makes references to a 'July Ultimatum' set by Austria to Serbia in revenge for the assassination, and mentions that Serbia accepted all but one of the terms, which set off World War I. However, those terms are never described, giving the section a feeling of incompleteness. There is a link to the July Ultimatum article, but shouldn't at least a synopsis be published here for readers' benefit?</p>
<p>Only point #8 was completely acceded to. Convincing the world that they had acceded to almost all of the points was a propaganda coup and is perpetuated in text books today, but put the ultimatum and the response side by side and you will see this was trickery or simply read the Austrian critique.</p>

<p>As all of the conspirators were under age, they were sentenced to prison rather than execution (except for the older Danilo Ilić, who was hanged).</p>

<p>Danilo Ilic, Veljko Cubrilovic and Misko Jovanovic, who helped the assassins kill the royal couple, were executed on 3rd February, 1915.</p>

<p>Also, it states in the Ilic article that Ilic was arrested after Princip ratted him out, yet on this page it states that Ilic ratted everyone out..?</p>
<p>1. Misko Jovanovic and Veljko Cubrilovic were not amongst the seven lying in wait for the royals (their roll was in transport and storing weapons) and so they are often not counted.</p>
<p>2. The police arrested Cabrinovic and Principe on the spot, and immediately began rounding up everyone these two had been seen with including Ilic (Principe was living with him). Ilic did give some true information to the authorities but mixed it with lies as did all of those arrested who knew anything; if you read the trial transcripts you'll see Ilic had trouble keeping all his stories straight. Ilic has been demonized by Serbs looking to make Principe a hero. In reality, Ilic knew the most about the conspiracy and told the least, keeping his contacts with the Serbian Military (Colonels Dimitrievic and Popovic) secret to his death, and telling nothing to the authorities about the planning meeting in Tolouse, France and so on.</p>

<p>After allowing the murders to take place, the Serbian Civilian Government worked to cover up the full extent of the plot. This including denying it had conducted an investigation, denying it knew about the plot and providing safe haven to the conspirators (many conspirators were eventually arrested on other charges, but none were charged with the crimes of Sarajevo), refusing to cooperate with the Austro-Hungarian investigation, and continuing to keep known conspirators on the government payroll. The government briefly arrested Major Tankosic, but quickly released him and sent him back to his unit. Rade Malobabic was arrested but released on the request of Colonel Dimitrievic and Malobabic was given a commission operating a military supply store.</p>

<p>Mohamed Mehmedbasic escaped the Austro-Hungarian-police dragnet into Montenegro, where he bragged in a café about his role in Sarajevo and was therefore arrested by the Montenegrin police. Montenegro and Austria-Hungary had a reciprocal extradition treaty with regards to individuals who attack a sovereign of the state or members of his family, and so Montenegro was bound to arrest and turn-over Mehmedbasic.</p>
<p>Mehmedbasic told all to the Montenegrin authorities, including about the Tolouse planning meeting in January 1914. The Montenegrin Foreign Minister called in the French Ambassador and informed him of the details and then Montenegrin authorities illegally allowed Mehmedbasic to escape to Serbia where he joined with Tankosic’s unit. France and Montenegro kept the results of the interrogation a secret until part of it was divulged when the cable of the French Ambassador back to Paris was published after the war. Had Mehmedbasic been turned over to Austro-Hungarian authorities another avenue of investigation would have opened up outside of Serbia, including the rounding up of Paul Bastaic, Mustafa Golubic, and Vladimir Gacinovic. With them in custody, Danilo Ilic could have been confronted with taking orders from Belgrade and perhaps could have been forced to give up Apis; but France and Montenegro elected instead to obstruct the investigation.</p>
<p>(“Documents Diplomatiques Francais III Serie 1911-14, 3”, X Doc. 537 states that the January meeting took place in “<i>Tours</i>”, not Tolouse with the implication that this is the reason the Sûreté Générale found nothing when it investigated. The self-serving italics notwithstanding, with Mehmedbasic imprisoned on other charges in French controlled territory in 1916 and 1917, France elected not to perform its legal duty to investigate and arrest the conspirators giving the conspiracy France’s seal of approval.)</p>

<p>On June 26, 1917, in French occupied Salonika, Serbia executed Colonels Apis and Ljubomir Vulovic and Masterspy Rade Malobabic. Before their execution, these three men had confessed to their own involvement in and details of the conspiracy to assassinate Franz-Ferdinand including fingering the Russian Military attaché and Serbia’s top military officer. Apis, as mentioned earlier, made a written confession to the Serbian Court. The confession was suppressed by Serbia until its capture by the Axis during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. Vulovic made his statement at court-martial, the transcripts of which were briefly published and then pulled back and then published again after World War II. Malobabic made his statement to a priest hired by Serbia to report what he said. This too was kept secret. The executions were controversial at Entente capitals. To stifle criticism of the executions, Prime Minister Pasic put it this way to his embassy in Britain: “The officers in the Salonika affair had to be condemned, Vulovic and Malobabic were ordinary criminals (sic), and Dimitrijevic besides everything else admitted he had ordered Franz Ferdinand to be killed. And now who could reprieve them?” [from Black Hand on Trial, Salonika 1917 page 392]</p>
<p>In 1916, Serbia’s government in exile arrested Apis and many of his fellow conspirators. The arrests were politically motivated as Prince Regent Alexandar and Prime Minister Pasic eliminated a powerful rival. The arrests were also diplomatically motivated. Austria-Hungary was seeking a secret and separate peace with France and offered the return of Serbia (now occupied by Austria-Hungary and her allies) on condition that those behind Sarajevo would be punished. Serbia, without territory of its own, sent some of the accused to French Prisons and others were put into a concentration camp and an officers’ prison on the French controlled Salonika front. Peace talks floundered, but the prisoners were brought to trial nevertheless on various false charges, none of which could be made to stick even with a packed court and denial of choice of counsel and witnesses. Finally in mid-trial a new charge of attempting to kill Regent Aleksandar was brought and though this charge was false too (the verdicts were overturned posthumously) the defendants were found guilty and many received a death sentence. Responsibility for the murder of these key witnesses rests not only on Serbia, but on the occupying authority and willing jailor and transporter of the accused, France.</p>

<p>A salient point in Apis’ confession was that Russian Military Attaché to Belgrade Artamonov provided the funds required for The Outrage, and promised Russia’s protection from Austria-Hungary. This facilitation was broadly corroborated by Artamonov’s assistant, Alexander Werchovsky, a captain at the time of The Outrage to Louis Trydar-Burzinski, after which Werchovsky stopped talking. Artamonov denied his involvement saying whatever payments he made to Apis were for other work.</p>
<p>There is no evidence of advanced approval of The Outrage by Czar Nicholas II and it would seem out of character for him to authorize a royal assassination. There is evidence, however, that by June 14, 1914 (June 1 old calendar) members of the Russian Diplomatic Corps knew of the impending Outrage as Schel'king reports during the Czar's visit to Constanza on June 14, 1914 members of the Russian Diplomatic Corps, outside the presence of the Czar, were discussing the implications of Franz-Ferdinand being "out of the way".</p>
<p>Russia helped to cover-up the conspiracy primarily through a telegram that a) advised Serbia to reject those terms of Austria-Hungary’s letter that infringed on Serbia’s sovereignty, and b) promised Russian diplomatic and military support and c) by denying its own involvement including a present day claim (“Rossiiskaia Kontrrazvedka I Tainaia Serbskaia Organizatsii ‘Chernaia Ruka’") that Russia had not one single agent in Serbia at the time of the Sarajevo assassinations.</p>

<p>“…and in reply to questions from the present writer &lt;Mehmedbašić &gt; gave an exact account of the decisions taken at Toulouse and of what took place after the meeting, an account which differs from that of Bogićević. His story is that his friend Golubić persuaded him to join the Black Hand and they were both eager to carry out an act of <b>terrorism</b> to revive the revolutionary spirit of Bosnia. He knew Gacinović and Ilić, who had administered the oath required of all members of the Black Hand. At the end of December 1913 he received a letter from Golubić on behalf of Gacinović asking him to go on an important matter to Toulouse. There, at the Hôtel St. Gérôme was Golubić who said that Gacinović and Paul Bastaić were also expected. Actually only Gacinović came and urged that Bosnia must be wakened up by acts of <b>terrorism</b>.</p>

By what logic were the perpetrators "terrorists"? Surely this was not an attempt to instill fear in a civilian population. At worst it was an act of armed insurrection with a narrow political aim.</p>
<dl>
<dd>If I remember right, the Black Hand were a terrorist organisation. It's more like if Osama tried to kill Karzai himself — he would be a terrorist, but not simply because he tried to pull off the assassination <a href="../../../n/y/t/User%7ENyttend_9f62.html" title="User:Nyttend">Nyttend</a> 00:06, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But again, it begs the question. What grounds does anyone have to call the perpetrators "terrorists"? If the act of assassination by itself is not sufficient for a person or group to be branded a "terrorist", then what justification does anyone have for attributing that label in this case? Austria-Hungary was not a democracy by any stretch of the imagination, and had annexed Bosnia only six years earlier. This was essentially insurgency against a despotic regime, and not an attempt to terrorize a civilian population.::</dd>

<p>Yes, i fully agree that perpetrators cannot be called terrorists. If we closely look to definition of terrorism - "Terrorism is a term used to describe violence or other harmful acts committed (or threatened) against civilians by groups or persons for political, nationalist, or religious goals." - we cannot find any elements to describe Princip and other perpetrators terrorists. It was an act against Austrian opressive regime, not against civilians by any means.

<p>I'm not entirely happy with this move. The given reasons ("I thought it means something else", "It's not consistent with Kennedy assassination") are not very good. Obviousness and consistency are not crucial factors, otherwise we'd be moving "Battle of Waterloo" to "Battle between Napoleon and the Duke of Wellington", lest somebody confuses it with a general article about fights in Waterloo, Belgium, or Waterloo station, London.</p>
<p>"Assassination in Sarajevo" is the common <i>name</i> (as opposed to <i>description</i>) of this event, and if nobody offers proof that it is an incorrect name, I will use the prorogative of the original author to chose between equally valid editorial choices and move the article back. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 15:23, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If we don't know what the article refers to, then it has bad name.

<dd>We know that "Assassination in Sarajevo" is one of correct names. I'm asserting that it's the most common name of the event, and that the often seen "assassination of Franz Ferdinand" is a descriptive way to refer to it, not its name. And sorry, random editors with shaky arguments do not automatically outweigh the preference of the article's author(s). <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 23:37, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's true, but it's also the case that the author(s) don't automatically outweigh other editors. Nobody "automatically outweighs" anybody else here.

<dd>Your editors comment is correct. Turning it around, it's also true that the article's author(s) don't outweigh random editors.

<p>OK, let's clear some things up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether you know what a word or expression means has nothing to do with whether it should be the title of the article. If you knew what everything means, you wouldn't need an encyclopedia.</li>
<li>The article that has stayed at this name for years was moved because a group of people said "I like the other name better". You should be demanding proof and verificiation from people who wanted to move the article, not from me.</li>
<li>You may notice that all other Wikipedias which use latin script (except for Dutch), call the event "Assassination in Sarajevo" or "Sarajevo assassination". That's some indication that that's the internationally known name of the event.</li>
<li>Google test says that <tt>("Assassination in Sarajevo" OR "Sarajevo assassination" OR "Assassination at Sarajevo") -wikipedia</tt> produces <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=(%22Assassination+in+Sarajevo%22+OR+%22Sarajevo+assassination%22+OR+%22Assassination+at+Sarajevo%22)+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=(%22Assassination+in+Sarajevo%22+OR+%22Sarajevo+assassination%22+OR+%22Assassination+at+Sarajevo%22)+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">~25.000</a> results, while <tt>("Assassination of Franz Ferdinand" OR "Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand") -wikipedia</tt> produces <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%28%22Assassination+of+Franz+Ferdinand%22+OR+%22Assassination+of+Archduke+Franz+Ferdinand%22%29+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%28%22Assassination+of+Franz+Ferdinand%22+OR+%22Assassination+of+Archduke+Franz+Ferdinand%22%29+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">~27.000 results</a>. There's no overwhelming majority for either, and bear in mind that the second option is a description that's likely to also show up in many articles which call the event "Assassination in Sarajevo."</li>
</ul>
<p>So, unless somebody actually offers some evidence that the name I originally used is violating the naming convention, I think that further discussion is unnecessary. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 10:46, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have contributed to this article and related ones a number of times over the past year. I did not vote in the recent requested move because I was undecided. The requested move was conducted legitimately - even if a minority think that it was not the best decision. It is always possible to start another requested move process. But it is entirely inappropriate for anyone (even the original editor of the article) to unilaterally rename the article at this stage. <a href="../../../m/c/f/User%7EMcferran_2c68.html" title="User:Mcferran">Noel S McFerran</a> 13:44, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Wikipedia is not ruled by majority, and it doesn't matter which view happens to be in minority. No decisions are final, and move requests are not required - any user but newbies can move articles. While move requests can provide additional legitimacy to the renaming of an article, that legitimacy depends on the arguments presented in the request. This article was moved because 4 people said they liked the other title better, without providing any sort of evidence for it being better. So unless somebody actually provides some evidence that this name is in more conforming to the naming convention than the other one, I see no reason why I shouldn't move it back. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 16:17, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You're right that Wikipedia is not ruled by majority. The chief reason that you shouldn't move it back is symmetry: if you're justified in moving it back, then someone else is justified in moving it back again, etc, etc. The solution to this problem is to leave the page where it is, wherever that is, unless it's clearly incorrect.</dd>
<dd>I closed the move request and moved the article, and it's true that I didn't demand proof that "assassination of archduke franz ferdinand" is the most common name. I took several factors into account. The policy <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAME_8ce9.html" title="WP:NAME">WP:NAME</a> instructs us to choose a name that is (a) recognizable to a majority of English speakers, (b) unambiguous, and (c) natural to link to. "Assassination in Sarajevo" is possibly ambiguous, while "Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand" is not. They seem equally easy to link from other articles. For which is the most recognizable, I looked at a basic Google test, and then I tried a modified test to find sites that used one name and not the other. My results:

<dd>I consider it my job as an administrator to refrain from treating these discussions as vote-counts. I read the discussion, and people noted the possible ambiguity of the title <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassination_in_Sarajevo_caf3.html" title="Assassination in Sarajevo">Assassination in Sarajevo</a>. Nobody opposing the move made a policy-based argument. It's true that I did some googling of my own, but I'm not prohibited from doing that. It's not like we're in court, and I can only consider evidence presented in a formal setting.</dd>
<dd>I've explained why I closed the request as I did: the title to which I moved the article seems to be slightly more common, and less ambiguous. Like you say, my opinion is worth neither more nor less than anybody else's here, and I invite you to request that my closing be reviewed by other administrators, or by whomever you like. I'm willing to be overruled, if it's determined that my decision was wrong. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 08:36, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There's no need for review of anybody's actions - we're not in a court of law, and it's not as if this is a hugely important decision. We're simply expanding on the discussion from the move request. If anything, GTBacchus is to be commended for taking the time to research before blindly following the votes. IMO, my Google test is better, because variations should be included (anybody who knows what Assassination at Sarajevo means will know that Assassination in Sarajevo is the same thing), and pages which mention both names should be counted for Assassination in Sarajevo (the other option is a description that's likely to turn up in a typical definition of Assasination in Sarajevo).</p>
<p>As said above, the solution to endless page moves is to leave the page where it is, wherever that is, unless it's clearly incorrect. So far we've established that the original name was correct, usage is on the same order of magnitude, other wikipedias mostly use the "in Sarajevo" variation, and the only policy-based objection brought up was that the name is potentially ambiguous. Is it really? Do we expect anybody to write an article about assassinations in Sarajevo in general? Do we have such articles for other cities? <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 12:43, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's not <i>particularly</i> ambiguous. The more descriptive name is more accessible, it seems to me, because a reader who doesn't know some context can't tell much from the title. Then again, we don't call the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trail_of_Tears_d650.html" title="Trail of Tears">Trail of Tears</a> article Forced relocation of Native Americans from the Southern United States, although such a title would tell readers more. I don't know of any city unfortunate enough that we have an article about the assassination there, as a general topic.</dd>
<dd>One might also consider which phrase is likely to occur in another Wikipedia article, and to link here. At the end of the day, I can't see that it makes much difference one way or the other, but to clear the backlog at <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>, I had to close it one way or the other, and I made a call.

<dd>First of all, we do not count votes. The number of people who favored the move is entirely irrelevant. The article was originally titled Assassination in Sarajevo, and no case was ever established for moving it apart from several editors liking the other title better. I'm sorry, but that just isn't enough. If nobody presents a case (and evidence) for the current title being better than the original title, I will move the article back tomorrow and consider this case closed. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 04:08, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Allow me to repeat my strong objection to a unilateral move by one editor contrary to a perfectly valid vote on a requested move. I was not moved either way by the arguments made in that requested move - and so I did not vote. But that does not mean that "no case was ever established for moving it". Other editors clearly believed that a case was established for the move. Merely because Zocky doesn't agree with the reasons put forward, does not mean that they aren't reasons. If Zocky wants a move, he should initiate another requested move process. The discussion which has taken place since the last one has certainly helped me to decide which is the better page name. <a href="../../../m/c/f/User%7EMcferran_2c68.html" title="User:Mcferran">Noel S McFerran</a> 04:27, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Let me reiterate what I just said above. The number of people and the amount of bureaucracy which were/was involved in the last RM is wholely irrelevant here. RM is <i>not</i> a requirement for moving a page (look, there's a move button on top of every page).</dd>
<dd>It doesn't really matter whether I agree with the reasons, the point is that the given reasons are not grounded in policy. Consistency (the "Dallas" argument) does <i>not</i> override actual names of things/events, dumbing down (the "I don't know what it means" argument) is <i>bad</i>, not good, there is no ambiguity (even if there was, we don't preemptively disambiguate names) and we have established that both names have about the same usage on the internet. And yes, I know somebody said that history books they read more often call it Assassination of Franz Ferdinand. However, that argument is easily countered by the argument that history books I read more often call it Assassination in Sarajevo. Not useful either way, but there you have it. So, is there any actual policy-related evidence that this title is better? <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 04:44, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

It would also be mentioned (but with less detail) in the article on <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarajevo.html" title="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a>. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> maintains that "the event is commonly known in history as the Assassination in Sarajevo.

So far he has provided no evidence to support that claim (merely restating the claim multiple times isn't evidence). <a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a> has provided some evidence to the contrary based on Google searches. If one looks at the titles of English-language books specifically on this topic, here is what one finds:</p>

<p>Not one of these books uses the name which <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> says is commonly used, i.e. Assassination in Sarajevo. The one which is closest (<i>Assassination at Sarajevo</i>) is a children's book. A Google Books search comes out like this:</p>

<dd>OK, let's get to the point. 150,000 Serbs from Sarajevo were probably raped and killed, like it was in Srebrenica '95 when terroristic muslim forces killed 8000 inocent serbs is, but that is not point of this descussion. First of all, you are talking about population of Sarajevo. Citizens of sarajevo didn't remove the plaque, City council did it. And ethnic structure of citizens of Sarajevo isn't (wasn't) important in this case because that did not affect on the city government witch removed the plaque. And city council wasn't 100% bosniak when the plaque was removed. --<a href="../../../k/a/h/User%7EKahriman_e4b2.html" title="User:Kahriman">Kahriman</a> 17:02, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There were complaints as to bias and inadequate citations regarding the conspiracy to assassinate Franz-Ferdinand and the subsequent cover-up. Also there was a complaint about the use of the word "terrorist". I have redone the section dealing with the assassination conspiracy below. Only the 3 assassins from Belgrade and Mehmedbasic are now referred to as terrorists. This word was chosen because Cabrinovic threw a bomb into the street wounding many civilians, Prinicip and Grabez stated at trial that they were terrorists, and because Mehmedbasic said he was eager to carry out acts of terror and plotted them in Tolouse ("Origins of the War, Vol. 2, pp88-9). In other places I have used the word revolutionary, irridentist, or youth. I have also cited the books and page numbers for all the major facts. Frankly I think it is overkill. Next, I set about deleting unnecessary references to the "Black Hand" that someone had put in. All the key members of the Black Hand stated under oath that by 1914 the "Black Hand" no longer was a functioning organization, its president dead, its secretary disinterested, its secret links between cells broken by losses in the Balkans Wars, its coffers empty. What was left was a group of friends of Apis. Since, in his confession, Apis said he organized the assassination in his role as Chief of Military Intelligence, this title should suffice as he was never President or Secretary of the "Black Hand", and under the bi-laws of the "Black Hand" only the President or Secretary could order an action such as the assassination of Franz-Ferdinand without a vote of the entire committee (for which there is no evidence and for which I have found no historical work saying there was such a vote). Finally, I deleted those sentences which seemed to be conclusions. After leaving some time for comment on this portion, I will move on to Russia, France and Montenegro. It seems there was one complaint about citing "Documents Diplomatiques Francais III Serie 1911-14, 3”, X Doc. 537", this is a broadly published diplomatic archive available in most major university libraries and the document in question is cited by major historical works such as "Origins of the War" by Albertini. If you can explain a little better about what is wrong with citing it directly rather than indirectly through Albertini I would appreciate it. By the way, its footnote is misnumbered, it should be "2" rather than "1" if you take a look at the document. Please give me your feedback.</p>

<p>Does the conspiracy material really have to be reincorporated in this article? Editing by several contributors has now streamlined the text to the point where it could again be a serious candidate for "good article" rating. Re-incorporating a mass of conjecture and supposition would undo this good work and return the article to the muddled state that it was in last year.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>If you have particular problems with the text below please cite them. I tried hard to follow Wikipedia rules in the text below and I think its important information that the assassins were not Bosnian revolutionaries acting alone but were part of a broad Serbian conspiracy centered on the Chief of Military Intelligence. Its hard to convey that convincingly without a lot of detail which I therefore provide.</p>

<p>In late 1913, Danilo Ilić came to the Serbian listening post at Užice to speak to his handler and recommend an end to the period of revolutionary organization building and a move to direct action against Austria-Hungary. Colonel Popović stated to the historian Albertini that he passed Danilo Ilić on to Belgrade to discuss this matter with Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijević (Apis)(“Origins of the War”, Vol II, pp 27-28, 79). Ilić and Apis took the secrets of their discussion to their graves, but soon after their meeting, Apis’ right hand man, Major Vojislav Tankosić, called a Serbian irridentist planning meeting in Toulouse, France (“Origins of the War”, Vol II, pp 76-77). This is established by the statement of Paul Bastaić and Mustafa Golubić to the diplomat and historian Milos Bogićević. During this January 1914 meeting, various possible Austro-Hungarian targets for assassination were discussed including Franz-Ferdinand, but ultimately, at this meeting, it was decided only to dispatch Mohamed Mehmedbašić to Sarajevo, to kill the Austrian Governor of Bosnia, Oskar Potiorek.</p>
<p>Mehmedbašić was delayed and before he made an attempt on Potiorek, Apis ordered the assassination of Franz-Ferdinand (as evidenced by Apis’ confession to the Serbian Court “The Road to Sarajevo” page 398). Mehmedbašić told the historian Albertini that Ilić summoned him to Mostar and informed him that Belgrade had scrapped the mission to kill the governor in favor of the murder of Franz-Ferdinand and that Mehmbedbašić should stand by for the new operation (“Origins of the War”, Vol. 2, pp78-79; please note the date error, 25 July should read 25 June). Ilić recruited the Serbian youths Vaso Čubrilović and Cvjetko Popović shortly after Easter (April 19, 1914), for the assassination as evidenced by the testimony of Ilić, Čubrilović, and Popović at the Sarajevo trial (“The Sarajevo Trial” pp117-118, pp129-130, pg 131, pp140,142). Three Bosnian Serb youths living in Belgrade, Gavrilo Princip (“The Sarajevo Trial”, pp58-9), Trifun Grabež (“The Sarajevo Trial pp93-94), and Nedjelko Čabrinović (“The Sarajevo Trial”, pp26-27, pg.30, pp27-28) testified at the Sarajevo trial that at about the same time, (a little after Easter) they were eager to carry out an assasination and approached Milan Ciganović and through him Major Tankosić and reached an agreement to transport arms to Sarajevo and participate in the assasination.</p>
<p>At trial, the 3 youths from Belgrade testified that Tankosić, directly and through Ciganović, not only provided six hand grenades, four Browning Automatic Pistols and ammunition, but also money (“The Sarajevo Trial”, pg. 59) suicide pills (“The Sarayevo Trial”, pg. 41, 46), training (“The Sarajevo Trial” 93-94), a special map with the location of gendarmes marked (“The Sarajevo Trial” pp109-110), knowledge of contacts on a special channel used to infiltrate agents and arms into Austria-Hungary (“The Sarajevo Trial” pg. 106) and a small card authorizing the use of that special channel (“The Sarayevo Trial”, pg. 59, pg. 40). Major Tankosić confirmed to the historian Luciano Magrini that he provided the bombs and revolvers and was responsible for the terrorists’ training and that he initiated the idea of the suicide pills (“Il Dramma Di Seraievo” by Luciano Magrini pp94-5 [In Italian]).</p>
<p>After receiving this training and support from Major Tankosić and his associates, the three conspirators traveled from Belgrade to Šabac and handed the small card to Captain Popović of the Serbian Border Guard. Popović, in turn, provided them with a letter to Captain Prvanović and sent them on to Loznica, a small border town (“The Sarajevo Trial”, pp36-8). When they reached Loznica, Captain Prvanović summoned three of his revenue sergeants to discuss the best way to cross the border undetected. Sergeant Grbić accepted the task and led Princip and Grabež with the weapons to Isaković’s Island, a small island in the middle of the Drina River that separated Serbia from Austria-Hungary, (Čabrinović crossed at another point without weapons) and then handed off the two terrorists (They admitted in open court to being terrorists [“The Sarajevo Trial”, pg 56, 109].) (“The Sarajevo Trial”, pg. 59) and their weapons to the agents of the Serbian Narodna Obrana for transport into Austria-Hungarian territory and from safe-house to safe-house.</p>
<p>The terrorists and weapons were passed from agent to agent until they arrived in Tuzla where the terrorists left their weapons in the hands of the Narodna Obrana agent Miško Jovanović (“The Sarajevo Trial” pp61-64). The agents reported back their activities to the Narodna Obrana President, Boža Milanović, who in turn reported to the then Caretaker Prime Minister Nikola Pašić (“The Road to Sarajevo” 388-9). The report adds the name of a new military conspirator, Major Kosta Todorović, apparently the immediate superior of Captains Popović and Prvanović. Pašić’s handwritten notes document the Prime Minister’s advanced knowledge of the plot and that he was able to connect Major Tankosić (“The Road to Sarajevo”, pg. 503). The Austrians captured the report, Pašić’s handwritten notes, and additional documents corroborating the Civilian Government’s foreknowledge of the plot, and the involvement of Major Todorović and Captain Prvanović (“The Road to Sarajevo”, pg. 390, pg 505). From Tuzla, Grabež and Čabrinović went on to their parents’ homes to lie low until Franz-Ferdinand’s arrival and Princip stayed at Ilić’s mother’s house and there met Ilić. After meeting Princip, Ilić went to Tuzla to bring the weapons to Sarajevo. Miško Jovanović hid the weapons in a large box of sugar and the two went separately by train to Doboj where Jovanovic handed off the box to Ilić (“The Sarajevo Trial” pp185-6). Ilić brought the weapons back to his mother’s house on June 15 and kept them in a suitcase under a sofa (“The Sarajevo Trial” pp118-9). Ilić testified that on June 18 he went to Brod (“The Sarajevo Trial”, pg 126) and here begins an interesting twist in the plot as put forward by Vladimir Dedijer in “The Road to Sarajevo”, because Ilić claimed that from this time on he opposed the assassination. According to Čeda Popović, Đuro Šarac was sent to Šabac by Tankosić to meet with Ilić and cancel the assassination (“The Road to Sarajevo” pg. 393). It is about 100km along the river Sava from Brod to Šabac.</p>
<p>In further testimony Ilić, Princip and Grabež describe how after Ilić returned from Brod he tried to prevent the assassination (“The Sarajevo Trial”, pg. 120, pp122-3). But then, and this is a point of some controversy, on the eve of the assassination, Masterspy Rade Malobabić arrived in Sarajevo on the orders of the Chief of the Serbian General Staff, Marshall Putnik, and apparently gave the final go ahead on the assassination and only then did Ilić hand out the weapons to the assassins. The evidence of this is Rade Malobabić's confession to a priest (“The ‘Black Hand’ on Trial, Salonika 1917” pg. 391, “The Road to Sarajevo” pg. 391), Colonel Ljubomir Vulović's statement to the Serbian Court that he received orders from Putnik and sent Malobabić into Austria-Hungary (“The ‘Black Hand’ on Trial, Salonika 1917”, pg.241-2), witness accounts from Sarajevo (“The Road to Sarajevo” pg. 394), and Dragutin Dimitrijević's confession to the Serbian Court that he had ordered Malobabić to organize the assassination. Still all these statements and accounts are open to multiple interpretations and its possible Malobabić was conducting other business on behalf of the Serbian Military on this particular visit to Austria-Hungary.</p>
<p>Caretaker Prime Minister Pašić learned of the assassination plot and informed members of his cabinet in late May or early June according to Ljuba Jovanović in the article "The Blood of Slavism" (“Origins of the War”, Vol 2, pg. 90). Other evidence making it clear Pašić had sufficient advanced warning to have prevented the attack include Pašić’s handwritten notes on the briefing by the Narodna Obrana and the statement of Serbian Military Attache to Vienna, Colonel Lešanin to the historian Luciano Magrini (“Il Dramma Di Seraievo” by Luciano Magrini pp115-6 [In Italian]). The statements of Colonel Lešanin, and Ljuba Jovanović cite two half-measures taken by the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>The half-measures were doomed to failure. The first half-measure was the instruction to the border guards to block the assassins. Jovanovic’s account makes it clear that the Prime Minister did not give his order immediately, but rather reviewed it with his ministers while the assassins were on the move, and the Prime Minister gave the order through the Minister of the Interior rather than asking The King of Serbia to deliver it. In the Spring of 1914, the Serbian Civilian Government was in the process of trying to establish its authority over the Serbian Military and the Serbian Military was resisting by all means available including refusing to follow orders (“The ‘Black Hand’ on Trial, Salonika 1917” pg. 43), forcing Prime Minister Pašić to resign (“The Road to Sarajevo” pg. 398), and, when the Prime Minister was reinstated, an attempted putsch in Macedonia. The second half-measure was to give Austria an oblique warning through Serbia’s embassy in Vienna. The ambassador was a known ally of the military conspirators and his instructions were carried out poorly (“Origins of the War”, Vol. 2, pg 106) and not followed up on. By Colonel Lešanin’s account, Prime Minister Pašić did not share the details he knew about the assassination with his ambassador such as the name of one of the assassins, the agents who passed them along, and the fact that the weapons were in Tuzla with Misko Jovanovic.</p>
<p>Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijević, Colonel Ljubomir Vulović, and Masterspy Rade Malobabić were convicted for a fictious crime (posthumously exonerated) by a Serbian kangaroo court and executed (“The ‘Black Hand’ on Trial: Salonika, 1917” in entirety). These executions were orchestrated largely by Prime Minister Pašić. Prime Minister Pašić made the private explanation that Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijević had to be executed because he had confessed he had ordered Franz Ferdinand’s assassination (“The ‘Black Hand’ on Trial: Salonika, 1917” pg. 392). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.161.19.156_dd76.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.161.19.156">67.161.19.156</a> (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.161.19.156.html" title="User talk:67.161.19.156">talk</a>) 08:13, 9 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>The article appears to be in error. Mehmedbasic was armed by Ilic with only a bomb. He was positioned by Ilic in front of the Garden of the Mostar Cafe. From "The Road to Sarajevo", pg. 313: "The first was Mehmedbasic, the oldest, who had to wait in front of the garden of the Mostar Cafe..." and further down the page: "On the way he (Ilic) gave him (Mehmedbasic) a bomb, with brief instructions on how to handle it." There were only four revolvers for 6 assassins, 2 had to make due with only bombs. There is a story that Mehmbedbasic obtained a pistol in Stolac, but even if true, I find no evidence he brought it to the assassination.</p>

<p>"Unification or Death", also known as the Black Hand, was not a "fringe political group". All three words are somewhat in error</p>
<p>Not from the Fringe: As the assassins and their weapons were on their way from Belgrade to Sarajevo, Dragutin Dimitrievic, a member of the Supreme Central Directorate of "Unification or Death!" organized a successful no-confidence vote leading to the resignation of Serbian Prime Minister Pasic and his government. In the period between the Prime Minister's resignation and his reinstatement pending new elections Dragutin Dimitrievic was active in organizing a new government. "Unification or Death"'s goal of the unification of all Serbs was popular as was its leading personality, Dragutin Dimitrievic.</p>
<p>Not what we normally think of as Political: Politics is a broad term and its use could lead to a serious misunderstanding. "Unification or Death" was a secret organization. It did not field candidates for elections. "Unification or Death" was established primarily as a counterweight to IMRO which on behalf of Bulgarian interests engaged in a dirty war against the Turks and Serbs in Macedonia. "Unification or Death" did the dirty work the Serbian Government felt it could not do directly. "Unification or Death"'s actions include propaganda, terrorism, revolution, and organizing fifth columns and auxiliaries.</p>
<p>Organization not Group: "Unification or Death" was a formal organization founded in 1911 and winding down in 1913. During its funtioning period it had a constitution, organizational structure, treasury, and it paid a salary to its secretary. Thus "Organization" is more apt than "group". After 1913 "Unification or Death", due to poverty and attrition, was no longer capable of functioning in accordance with its constitution and instead its rump was functioning indeed as a "group" of friends of Dragutin Dimitrievic.</p>
<p>A more accurate discription of "Unification or Death" is a Secret Organization aimed at the Unification of Serbdom by propaganda ('Pijemont'), revolution, assassination and terror.</p>

<p>My understanding is that the collapse of relations between Serbia and Austria-Hungary did not begin until roughly 10 years before the assassination; starting soon after the 1903 assassination of the King and Queen of Serbia, the Queen's brothers, and two cabinet members in 1903. Can the person who wrote the "Arcane" sentence please list the disputes prior to 1903 he has in mind that contributed significantly to the assassination?</p>

<p>Dedijer describes Jevtic as "Being a fiction writer first and only afterward an objective witness of a historical process, Jevtic did not take much care with his facts..." Albertini mentions the uncorroberated nature of various statements of Jevtic. The fantastic nature of the account [including 22 (unnamed and armed with unknown weapons) assassins is not credible without details and corroberation] leads me to recommend deletion.</p>

<p>I agree. This article should be a straight-forward account of the assasination, its historic context and consequences. By all means put rambling conspiracy theories or doubtful material such as the Jevtic addition on the discussion page but try and keep the main section factual and npov 210.246.12.232 20:15, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Although a few articles were published prior to WWI with "Young Bosnia" or "Young Bosnians" in the title, no such organization existed at the time. Rather, "Young Bosnians" became a popular term after the war to refer to many individuals or groups dedicated to the revolutionary destruction of the Hapsburg empire prior to the war. The term includes Serb Ultranationalists like Gacinovic, advocates of a true Yugoslavia, and those like Princip who favored a south-slav republic with Serbia as Piedmont. See "The Road to Sarajevo" on the subject starting on page 175. Under the popular definition after the war, any south slav to make an attempt against the Dual Monarchy would automatically be a member of "Young Bosnians", and so, as used in this article, "Young Bosnia" is a term which implies something, but which actually signifies nothing.</p>
