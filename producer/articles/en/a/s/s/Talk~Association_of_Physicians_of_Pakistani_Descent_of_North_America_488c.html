	    <p>Tuberculosis in Balochistan By Achakzai Baseer Khan</p>
<p>Summary Tuberculosis or TB is an infectious disease primarily caused by Mycobacterium Tuberculosis affecting mainly the Lungs. Like the common cold, it spreads through the air. When infectious people cough, sneeze, talk, spit, laugh or sing they propel TB13 germs in the air. An infected patient is transferring this disease to 10-15 persons annually, if healthy un infected persons, at close contact inhail air containing the bacteria, they can become infected and develops the disease and become sick. If untreated, the disease can lead to death within months or within few years. Moreover, persons that are not properly treated can spread the diseases to other people. The factors associated with higher risk to TB include close contact with people with active TB diseases HIV infection, poverty and malnutrition. Each year around the world, TB kills about 2 Million people and 8 Million becomes sick, and nearly 3 Million of these TB cases occur in south East Asia. Objectives TB is a major public health problem in Pakistan, having the seventh highest burden of TB cases amongst 22 countries in the world. (WHO 2006 report and country Profile) The current estimated annual TB caseload is 177-cases/100,000 populations giving more than 250,000 new cases annually in the country. Placing a high priority on control of this deadly disease, Government of Pakistan has revised the National TB Control Program (NTP), whose overall goals include reducing the mortality, morbidity and transmission of TB and to prevent drug resistance.</p>
<pre>
Socio- demographic Profile of Balochistan:
The population of the province is estimated 7.75 million i.e. about 5% of the country’s population. The annual population growth rate is 2.5%, with 47% of the population comprising persons less than 15 years of age. The average population density is 19 per square kilometers (range: 4 in Awaran, Chaghi and Kharan to 286 in Quetta). The geographic distribution of the population is uneven, with76.1 percent living in rural areas. Agriculture sector serves as backbone of the provincial economy, about three quarters of population living in rural areas depends mainly on agricultural activities. About 4.5 percent of the total area is cropped in Balochistan. Average household size is 6.7 ranges between5.1 to 8.5. The dependency ratio ranges between79.4 to 128.3.The unemployment rates among men of productive age group ranges between  11.5% to 55.9%. 
</pre>
<p>The over all electricity coverage in districts is 46.6%. The access to drinking water in the province is 25.8%. The adult literacy rate is 24.1% (men: 33.3%, women: 13.4%). Expansion of DOTS: Balochistan accounts for about 5% of the disease burden in the country. The total estimated annual incidence is 13700 (i.e. 177/100,000) (Director General Pak report) whereas annual incidence of smear positive TB cases in the province is around 6200 (i.e. 80/100,000), about two third of which belong to productive age group. There are 5133 registered TB Patients in 96 Diagnostic centres in Balochistan, where the female ratio is high as compare to male due to socio-economic reasons. We are expected more then 8000 new cases be registered in 2006, which reflects our expansion of services to remote areas in Balochistan. Design Balochistan is a province that covers an area of about 347, 190 sq. kilometers (largest in the country). The geographic distribution of about 7.2 million people is uneven. Balochistan has primarily an agrarian economy with almost 76.1 percent of its population living in rural areas. Balochistan constitutes about 5% of tuberculosis burden in the country. According to informed estimates, the incidence of sputum positive tuberculosis is 80/ 100,000 per year, about two third of which belong to reproductive age group i.e.15-45 years of age. The program endeavors to cure the infectious cases i.e. sputum smear positive pulmonary TB patients on a priority basis. The strategy for TB Control is directly observed treatment short course (DOTS). The targets for TB control are to achieve (i) 85% cure rate (ii) 70% case detection rate, and (iii) put 100% of detected TB patients under DOTS strategy. This project is already implementing under the above policies in the province of Balochistan through Government commitment, case detection, and provision of DOTS for at least all new smear tuberculosis positive cases, regular free supply of drugs and proper supervision, and evaluation. The Provincial Tuberculosis Control Program (PTP) is already integrated with the general health services and is collaborating with other primary health care programs such as Malaria, EPI, Leprosy and AIDS control program. The DOTS has gradually been expanded to the all twenty eight districts of the province The implementation of DOTS program in the province comprises three types of activities i.e. consolidating DOTS in all the districts, expanding DOTS coverage in remaining tehsils/ sub- tehsils, and encouraging relatively new interventions to enhance program performance in all twenty eight districts of the province. Till the completion of the project the case detection rate will be increased up to 70% of the new cases in the majority of the districts. The program activities will focus in and around under-served and under-privileged rural areas and urban slums.</p>
<p>The main strategies for enhanced performance of the Provincial TB Control Program Balochistan: The Provincial tuberculosis control program (PTP), under department of health Government of Balochistan, is responsible for coordinating the planning, implementing, managing and financing of the tuberculosis activities in the province. The PTP is involved in supporting the district health services, and other partners, especially the private sector for effective implementation of DOTS in the districts. Initiatives have been taken to give partnership to private health care providers as 70% Secondary and tertiary health care services are being provided by private sector. Combating TB- The DOTS strategy: Tuberculosis is completely curable with short-course treatment. By treating TB cases who are sputum-smear positive (and who can therefore spread the disease to others) at the source, it is also the most effective means of eliminating TB from a population. To combat TB, WHO has recommended adoption of a new strategy called DOTS (Directly Observed Therapy Short-course). This strategy has five components, which has been successfully implemented in 28 Districts of Balochistan with 100% success rate, each of which is essential: 1-Political commitment: TB can be cured and the epidemic reversed if all Governments accord its top priority, provide adequate resources and administrative support for TB control.</p>
<pre>
2-Good quality diagnosis: 
</pre>
<p>Diagnosis primarily relies on sputum-smear microscopy of patients presenting to health-facilities. 3-Good quality drugs: An uninterrupted supply of anti-TB drugs is essential for treatment success 4-Short-course chemotherapy given under direct observation:</p>
<pre>
A health worker or other trained person who is not a family member watches and helps as the patient swallow’s anti-TB medicines in his/her presence. DOTS thus shift the responsibility for cure from the patient to the health system and health care provider.
</pre>
<p>5-Systematic monitoring and accountability:</p>
<pre>
Treatment success is monitored by sputum smear examination during and at the end of treatment and a recording and reporting system which monitors and evaluates the outcome of every patient treated
</pre>
<p>The Provincial TB Control Program Balochistan Planning is as under: • Consolidate and expand public sector DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment Short-course. • Strengthen management capacity, including supervision, at provincial and district levels. • Strengthen the laboratory network for sputum smear microscopy, especially quality control arrangements at provincial and district levels. • Develop public private partnership for enhanced coverage and quality of TB care • Mobilize communities for enhanced case detection and better treatment outcomes. • Ensure continuous and effective supply of anti TB drugs for the recommended period (8 months). • Provide continuous training/ refresher training for all newly recruited staff &amp; existing staff involved in the program at all levels including all doctors working in Rural Health Centres and Basic Health Units, all chest specialists, medical specialists, pathologists and all doctors working in units of TB and chest diseases. All paramedics from RHCs and BHUs should also get training/ refresher training. • Establishment of referral laboratories at former divisional head quarters level. • Enhance the role of private sector in advancing social sector services delivery including health. Conclusion: For DOTS expansion the Province of Balochistan is spending huge resources to combat TB with a 5 years plan(190.0 Millions Pak Rs) as public health problem but efforts are required to STOP TB in Balochistan by better health care services and staff development. These services definitely required technical expertise from WHO and other partners, as the Provincial TB Control program has started an initiative to on board the private health care providers to STOP TB as 70% services are being provided by Private sector as to less the bourdon of TB in Balochistan.</p>
