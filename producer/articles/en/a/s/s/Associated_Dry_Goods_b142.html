<p>The chain began when Henry Siegel, who had founded department store Siegel, Cooper &amp; Co. in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, obtained financing from <a href="../../../g/o/l/Goldman_Sachs_c8e6.html" title="Goldman Sachs">Goldman Sachs</a> for a store in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> in the early <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twentieth_century.html" title="Twentieth century">twentieth century</a>. Though Siegel failed, the remnants of the chain were merged with John Claflin's stores H.B. Claflin and Co., including <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_%26_Taylor_72ee.html" title="Lord &amp; Taylor">Lord &amp; Taylor</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stewart%27s_%28department_store%29.html" title="Stewart's (department store)">Stewart &amp; Co.</a>, and <a href="../../../h/e/n/Hengerer%27s.html" title="Hengerer's">Hengerer's</a> (with financing from <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._P._Morgan_%26_Company_5e33.html" title="J.

Other stores were spun off to <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercantile_Stores_Co._3f49.html" title="Mercantile Stores Co.">Mercantile Stores Co.</a></p>
<p>Through the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s ADG continued to expand through acquisitions (see below) and also in the 1970s created a new St. Petersburg, Florida-based department store, Robinson's of Florida.</p>

<p>In the early and mid-1980s ADG attempted to rationalize its department stores, focusing on high-growth areas. Several of its non-profitable department store chains were sold, including The <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powers_Dry_Goods_1edf.html" title="Powers Dry Goods">Powers Dry Goods Company</a> (9 locations) in <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minneapolis%2C_Minnesota_b081.html" title="Minneapolis, Minnesota">Minneapolis, Minnesota</a> (to <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allied_Stores_4c53.html" title="Allied Stores">Allied Stores</a>' <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donaldson%27s.html" title="Donaldson's">The Donaldson Co.</a>) in 1985 and Stix Baer &amp; Fuller (12 locations) in <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis%2C_Missouri_7f9c.html" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a> (to <a href="../../../d/i/l/Dillard%27s.html" title="Dillard's">Dillard Department Stores</a>) in 1984. ADG also closed the small <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Diamond_cb45.html" title="The Diamond">Diamond</a> division (2 locations) of <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Virginia_4016.html" title="West Virginia">West Virginia</a>, merged Hengerer's of Buffalo, New York into <a href="../../../s/i/b/Sibley%27s.html" title="Sibley's">Sibley's</a> in 1981, merged Cincinnati-based Pogue's into L.S.

<p>ADG was acquired by the <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_Department_Stores_d7c2.html" title="May Department Stores">May Department Stores</a> Company in October 1986 as part of a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_dollar_db5c.html" title="United States dollar">US$</a>2.2 billion merger. After 1986, May converted or merged most of the former ADG stores into its own divisions with the exception of Lord &amp; Taylor.</p>
<p>During the final year of retail operation, ADG operated over 155 department stores, in addition to <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caldor.html" title="Caldor">Caldor</a> (a northeast upscale discount chain), and <a href="../../../l/o/e/Loehmann%27s.html" title="Loehmann's">Loehmann's</a>, (a specialty off price retailer). However, ADG was most well known for its upscale New York City based <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_%26_Taylor_72ee.html" title="Lord &amp; Taylor">Lord &amp; Taylor</a> division, with over 55 locations across the country. Lord &amp; Taylor was ADG's largest and most profitable division.</p>
<p>Out of all of ADG's former divisions, <i>Lord &amp; Taylor</i> and <i>Loehmann's</i> are the only nameplates that survives intact today.</p>

<p><b>The Denver Dry Goods Co.</b> <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver%2C_Colorado_0409.html" title="Denver, Colorado">Denver, Colorado</a>. Was acquired by ADG in 1966. The division consisted of 12 stores in Colorado. After the 1986 May/ADG merger, it was largely shutdown and sold-off and the remaining units absorbed by May D&amp;F (May Daniels &amp; Fischer) in 1987. (May D&amp;F ended up absorbing 3 stores from The Denver Dry Goods Co.) In 1989, May D&amp;F also absorbed ADG's former Goldwater's location in Albuquerque. In 1993, May D&amp;F was merged into May's Foley's division of Houston. After May was bought by Federated, it was announced that most Foley's stores (including the former Denver Dry Goods/May D&amp;F locations) would either be converted to Macy's or sold.</p>
<p><b>The Diamond,</b> <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Virginia_4016.html" title="West Virginia">West Virginia</a>. This was a small 2 store division located in West Virginia. ADG sold this division in 1983 due to limited growth potential.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../g/o/l/Goldwaters.html" title="Goldwaters">Goldwaters</a></b>, <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix%2C_Arizona_97f7.html" title="Phoenix, Arizona">Phoenix, Arizona</a>, founded in Gila City, Arizona, in 1860 and moved to Phoenix in 1872, was acquired by Associated in 1963. It consisted of 9 locations in Arizona, New Mexico, and Nevada. Became a division of May as part of the May/ADG merger in 1986. May dissolved the division in 1989, and split the stores into three other May divisions. Eventually May D&amp;F, May Company California and J.W. Robinson's absorbed various stores and the Tucson-area stores being sold to Dillard's Department Stores.</p>
<p><b>The H.&amp; S. Pogue Co.,</b> <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati%2C_Ohio_33af.html" title="Cincinnati, Ohio">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>, was a division of Associated Dry Goods Corp., having been acquired in 1962. In 1984, it was merged into L.S. Ayres &amp; Co. of Indianapolis. After the May/ADG merger, its former locations were swiftly shuttered or sold to Hess's and JCPenney in 1987 and 1988.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../h/a/h/Hahne_%26_Co._69d4.html" title="Hahne &amp; Co.">Hahne &amp; Co.</a></b> <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newark%2C_New_Jersey_17a7.html" title="Newark, New Jersey">Newark, New Jersey</a>, was part of the 1916 conglomeration of American Dry Goods (later renamed Associated). After relocating its flagship from downtown Newark in the mid 1980s to the former Gimbels at Garden State Plaza, its 9 stores were shut down by May in 1989, with most of them (six) being absorbed by Lord &amp; Taylor, while the large Garden State Plaza store was bought by Nordstrom.</p>
<p><b>The William Hengerer Co.,</b> <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffalo%2C_New_York_0d75.html" title="Buffalo, New York">Buffalo, New York</a>, founded in 1874 as Barnes, Bancroft &amp; Co., adopting the Hengerer name in 1895, was a division of Associated Dry Goods Corp. from its inception in 1916. In 1981, ADG merged Hengerer's into Sibley, Lindsay &amp; Curr Co. of Rochester. After the May/ADG merger, Sibley's was merged into May's Kaufmann's division in 1992. After May was bought by Federated, it was announced that most Kaufmann's stores would either be converted to Macy's or sold. All the former Hengerer's locations became Macy's in September 2006.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../h/o/r/Horne%27s.html" title="Horne's">Joseph Horne</a> Co.,</b> <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh%2C_Pennsylvania_b3a2.html" title="Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</a>. This was historically the carriage-trade department store of Pittsburgh. For several decades was in direct competition with cross-town rival Kaufmann's (a division of May). Was acquired by Associated Dry Goods in 1972 - and eventually acquired by May in October 1986 as part of the May/ADG merger. Due to anti-trust concerns and legal action by the City of Pittsburgh, it was promptly sold in December 1986 to an investor group. After several years of private ownership, it was announced the Dillards would be buying the chain to combine it with the Dillard/DeBartolo co-owned Higbee's stores based in Cleveland. However, the deal collapsed and was not completed. Eventually the Joseph Horne Co. was sold off in parts, with Dillard's acquiring its three Ohio stores in 1992 and Federated Department Stores's Lazarus division acquiring its remaining ten Pennsylvania stores in 1995. Federated eventually merged all of its divisions (including the former Joseph Horne/Lazarus locations) into Macy's.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../l/2E/s/L.S._Ayres_b555.html" title="L.S. Ayres">L.S. Ayres</a> &amp; Co,</b> <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indianapolis%2C_Indiana_cff5.html" title="Indianapolis, Indiana">Indianapolis, Indiana</a>, acquired by Associated Dry Goods Corp in 1972. L.S. Ayres had previously absorbed Pogue's of Cincinnati in 1984 and Stewart's of Louisville in 1985. Upon completion of these mergers, L.S. Ayres consisted of 25 stores in Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky, After the 1986 May/ADG merger, the under-performing locations of both former chains were swiftly divested by May in 1987 and 1988. L.S. Ayres was operationally consolidated with Famous-Barr in 1991 (but continuing to operate under the L.S.

Ayres stores would either be converted to Macy's or sold.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_%26_Taylor_72ee.html" title="Lord &amp; Taylor">Lord &amp; Taylor</a></b> - <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York%2C_New_York_5001.html" title="New York, New York">New York, New York</a>, precursor founded in 1826. Was a founding member of the Associated Dry Goods Corp. organization (then American Dry Goods) in 1916 and became part of May in the 1986 May/ADG merger. While a part of Associated and under the leadership of CEO Joseph E. Brooks, during 1970s aggressively expanded into Texas, Illinois, and Michigan and in the early 1980s south Florida saw 11 stores opened in quick succession. Partially withdrew from the oil-shocked Texas and southern Florida markets in 1989-1990 after the 1986 May/ADG merger. After May assumed ownership, ADG's Hahne's division (several New Jersey locations) and several former John Wanamaker (Philadelphia) locations were combined with Lord &amp; Taylor. Since 1995 Lord &amp; Taylor has occupied the former John Wanamaker landmark store in downtown Philadelphia. During the 1990s and early 2000s, May attempted to take the chain national. Under the leadership of CEO Marshall Hillsberg, Lord &amp; Taylor once again entered the expansion mode in the 1990s, opening stores as far west as Denver, with plans to enter the Las Vegas, Nevada, market. At one time, Lord &amp; Taylor had as many as 86 stores across the country. After continuing tepid results and repeated tinkering with its merchandising, May gave up its national ambitions for the division. Newly appointed President and CEO Jane Elfers announced the shuttering of 32 stores in 2003 (which represented only 18% of total sales), many of them only a few years old, retreating to what it called its "core" East Coast Corridor markets (New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington DC metro) along with locations in Chicago, Detroit, and St. Louis. The new strategy is to return Lord &amp; Taylor back to its roots - mainly a more upscale shopping experience - leaving behind its recently adopted middle of the road merchandising. However, since May was purchased by Federated in June 2005, it will be difficult to determine if this goal will be attained. Terry Lundgren, Federated's chairman, president and chief executive officer, announced on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_12.html" title="January 12">12 January</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> that Federated Department Stores would be selling the Lord &amp; Taylor chain by the end of the year.</p>

In 1985, it was acquired by The Donaldson Company (of Minneapolis, a unit of Allied Stores Corp.), which gave Donaldson's some breathing room against dominant rival Dayton's. In 1987, after Campeau Corp.'s buy-out of Allied Stores Corp., Donaldson's was purchased by Carson Pirie Scott &amp; Co. of Chicago which renamed its stores with its own imprimatur. Carson's in its turn was acquired by P.A. Bergner &amp; Co. of Milwaukee (and formerly of Peoria, Illinois) in 1989, which in turn filed for bankruptcy in 1991. In 1995 Carson's sold the rump of the former Minneapolis locations (formerly Powers/Donaldsons) to Dayton's parent Dayton Hudson Corp., which re-opened many of them under its moderate Mervyn's chain, mostly in a move to prevent serious competition in its Twin Cities stronghold. In 2004 when Dayton's successor Marshall Field's was acquired by May, it also agreed to buy the former Donaldson/Powers locations, which Mervyn's promptly shuttered, and May responsible for disposing of the real-estate.</p>

Robinson</a></b> - <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles, California</a>, was a division of Associated Dry Goods since 1957, and consisted of 21 locations in California. J. W. Robinson's was acquired by May in the October 1986 May/ADG merger. It was historically a carriage-trade department store and operated in tandem with May's own middle-tier May Company California division for several years. In 1989 it took over operation of the Goldwaters stores in Phoenix, Arizona. In 1992, as part of divisional consolidations by the May Company, the J.W. Robinson Co. division was merged with the May Company California division to form a single Los Angeles based division to be called Robinsons-May. After May was bought by Federated, it was announced that most Robinsons-May stores would either be converted to Macy's or sold.</p>
<p><b>Robinsons of Florida</b> - <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Petersburg%2C_Florida_3698.html" title="St. Petersburg, Florida">St. Petersburg, Florida</a>, was a division of Associated Dry Goods when acquired by May in 1986. It had been founded in the 1970s as an attempt by ADG to emulate the success of its upscale J.W. Robinson stores (of Los Angeles) on the fast-growing Florida Gulf Coast. Rather than invest in the then stagnant Florida market, May sold the division in 1987 (seven stores) to Maison Blanche/Gouchaux Co. of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to be operated as Maison Blanche stores. The bulk of the former Robinsons of Florida locations were subsequently sold by Maison Blanche to Dillard Department Stores in 1991.</p>

It consisted of 14 locations in NY. It had previously absorbed the William Hengerer Co. in Buffalo in 1981. In 1992, Sibley's, as it was then known, was merged into Kaufmann's. After May was bought by Federated, it was announced that most Kaufmann's stores (including the former Sibley's locations) would either be converted to Macy's or sold.</p>
