<p>I will be adding an editor's note to each {{fact}} tag today, pointing to what I think needs to be cited. Hopefully this will point us in the right direction for getting the sources cited quickly or, if they are found to be unsubstantiated, removed.

<li>It is certainly leaning in that direction. I've spent some serious time scouring the web via google and other search engine looking for published criticism, but can't seem to find anything outside what we already have for this specific statement. If no further citation can be found, I believe it should indeed be changed as you have suggested. It may also be removed altogether, as it would become redundant with the criticism from Maestro Martinez and Ken Mondschein (the Maestro and student I believe you reference) in the Literature section. - <b><a href="../../../x/i/l/User%7EXiliquiern_de49.html" title="User:Xiliquiern"><font color="#D20000">xiliquiern</font></a></b><a href="../../../x/i/l/User_talk%7EXiliquiern_f0bd.html" title="User talk:Xiliquiern"><font color="black"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 14:29, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>An interesting proposition, to be sure. The reviews are, after all, not really criticism of <i>ARMA</i>, nor are they really criticism of Mr. Clements as a representative of the group. Instead, they criticize two pieces of literature written by him and used by a variety of individuals. (As on criticism states: <i>"...</i>anyone <i>wanting to become a more skilled swordsman will benefit by studying this book."</i>) Since neither book has its own article, I don't know whether or not this is POV or properly relevant to this page. I hadn't ever thought of it like that. I think I'll browse around to see if any precedents have been set in similar situations. Anyone else have thoughts on the subject? -- <b><a href="../../../x/i/l/User%7EXiliquiern_de49.html" title="User:Xiliquiern"><font color="#D20000">xiliquiern</font></a></b><a href="../../../x/i/l/User_talk%7EXiliquiern_f0bd.html" title="User talk:Xiliquiern"><font color="black"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 22:31, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>As I said before, these are still (definitely) up for discussion as to their necessity and their specificity (I don't want to be pointing someone in the wrong direction for a source).

<p>So far the modus operandi with xiliquiern seems to be to remove some citations and then later to remove the criticism as uncited. Now he has shifted to demands of multiple citations for well-cited criticism. That's a wonderful lack of integrity that would go completely unnoticed if people didn't look closely. Likewise, editors like Mr. Pleasant routinely libel other editors without any citations whatsoever. Its an amazing double standard and typical of what I have come to expect from the ARMA members who have been whitewashing this article to promote their own agenda.</p>
<p>I've given up hope that this article will ever be anything but propaganda. Seriously, if ARMA wants to advertise, they should pay for advertising like anyone else, but don't try to call this anything close to unbiased editing. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 204.180.221.45 (<a href="../../../2/0/4/User_talk%7E204.180.221.45.html" title="User talk:204.180.221.45">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_204.180.221.45_e441.html" title="Special:Contributions/204.180.221.45">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li>Just out of curiosity, when did I remove citations and then later remove the criticism as uncited? If I did so, it is likely that I did indeed do so wrongly, though not with ill intent. If you would point out the specifics of this situation, I would be more than happy to rectify it.</li>
<li>However, I ask for <i>multiple</i> citations when a plural subject is used (maetro<b>s</b>, instructor<b>s</b>, researcher<b>s</b>). Citing <i>one</i> source from one individual is not citation of agreement by <i>multiple</i> individuals, as indicated by a pluralism.</li>
<li>I hope that the article is not propoganda - I have supported the existence of criticism by working towards its current state. I totally recognize that some people do not like individuals within ARMA or, for some reason, come to hate everyone in it without even knowing them personally. I understand that others may have high regard for the organization but still find issue with technique elements of it. <b>There is nothing wrong with criticism - I welcome it.</b> However, criticism <i>does</i> need to be cited, and the citations actually have to support the criticism and meet Wikipedia standards. I have spent several hours now searching a variety of websites hoping to find some articles to finish up <b>adding</b> (not removing, like you say), criticism citations to this section of the article. I do not ask you to leave, as you say you have 'given up'. I really genuinely welcome you to bring any grievances with the current state of the to bear here on the talk page. As far as further editing - if you can provide a significant criticism and citation of it, there is no reason it shouldn't be in the article. Similarly, if you can provide citation for any of the current criticism, please do so. - <b><a href="../../../x/i/l/User%7EXiliquiern_de49.html" title="User:Xiliquiern"><font color="#D20000">xiliquiern</font></a></b><a href="../../../x/i/l/User_talk%7EXiliquiern_f0bd.html" title="User talk:Xiliquiern"><font color="black"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 00:05, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>As for the citation that none of the Maestro's have shown a geneology, I have yet to see one anywhere publicly available, and, from my understanding, none have been given upon request to prospective students. That alone is not enough to cite the source, obviously. It is especially difficult to cite negatives, it seems.

<p>It has been over a month since specific citations were requested by myself on this page. (And, in some situations, over three months since original requests were made by others on the article page.) Some of them have been cited and, despite efforts, others remain without citation or verification. I believe that the statements remaining uncited on the 10th of December, 1 month and 4 days after <i>specific</i> request for citation on the talk page, should be removed from the article per wikipedia guidelines. Uncitable or undocumented information is not encyclopaedic. Please voice your opinion below. If someone wishes to extend the time for an honest and earnest attempt to cite some sources, please say so. If you wish the information to be removed as proposed, please voice your support or opinion. If you feel this is rushed or undue, please say so. This long process is finally drawing to a close, and I do not want to rush or hurry things now. -<a href="../../../x/i/l/User%7EXiliquiern_de49.html" title="User:Xiliquiern"><font color="#D20000" style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva; font-size:15px;">xiliquiern</font></a><a href="../../../x/i/l/User_talk%7EXiliquiern_f0bd.html" title="User talk:Xiliquiern"><font style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva"><sup>Talk</sup></font></a> 22:23, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What exactly are we trying to get across with this section? I do not know, or wish to know, the gory details, but as far as I am aware, ARMA is controversial because of:</p>
<p>1) Personal and political conflicts between various members/groups - these do not belong in an encyclopedia. There is some coolness between ARMA and some other groups, and maybe that is relevant, but we don't need a long section on it. I think saying that JC is controversial is fine, but we don't need to quote a dozen book reviews. His books had many errors, as he himself freely admits.</p>
<p>2) Actual technical debates over various subjects, e.g. the relevance of modern classical fencing to Renaissance fencing reconstruction, the rapier cut thing, the dreaded edge-vs-flat, how early and how much sparring there should be in training, whether post-17th c fencing is any good, and so on. Everyone else disagrees about these things to some extent too, quite apart from ARMA and JC. These debates might belong, but as they are typically 95% semantics, shades of grey, and political bullshit, any detailed explanation would be (I suspect, feel free to prove me wrong) inappropriately long.</p>
<p>The lineage/fraud thing is a good example, I think. The cited articles only vaguely refer to uncited claims of unspecified maestros. It's all rank hearsay. We don't know who the accused are, or what they actually said, only that they supposedly exist and supposedly said things that JC doesn't think they have backed up. Now I am not claiming that there aren't any fencing masters who have made bogus claims, only that the citations in this article are utterly inadequate. Some fencing masters have, IIRC, argued that Italian classical fencing is descended from Italian rapier fencing, and that their knowledge is applicable to the reconstruction of rapier (or even earlier) fencing. These are perfectly reasonable arguments to make. One can also argue against this, perfectly reasonably. But this is a technical debate, not some sort of exposé of fencing fraud. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegalophias_4932.html" title="User:Megalophias">Megalophias</a> 21:39, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well. Let's look at it and see what we want done. Your point that this <i>is</i> an encyclopedia is important. Currently, we basically have:</p>
<ul>
<li>ARMA made claims against myths and misconceptions in the field, and received negative criticism, especially from those most targeted.</li>
<li>ARMA made claims that no living lineage exists.</li>
<li>ARMA called those who make the claims "frauds and deceivers".</li>
<li>At least two modern schools claim to have such a lineage to Masaniello Parise, a 19th Century fencer, and, through him, back to an 18th Century man.</li>
<li>John Clements takes some flak for his statements.</li>
<li>His books are criticized by some in the community.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now. How much of this is really worthy citeable criticism of the Association for Renaissance Martial Arts? I'd argue that non of it is Criticism. How much of it is worth mentioning? After taking a break from WP for quite some time - very little of it. The crux of the first portion hangs on a larger level: the living-lineage debate and is, in my opinion, not really a worthwhile addition to the article. IMHO, there are many pieces of this article that could be removed to make it more poignant. What do you all think? --<a href="../../../x/i/l/User%7EXiliquiern_de49.html" title="User:Xiliquiern"><font color="#D20000" style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva; font-size:15px;">xiliquiern</font></a><a href="../../../x/i/l/User_talk%7EXiliquiern_f0bd.html" title="User talk:Xiliquiern"><font style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva"><sup>Talk</sup></font></a> 23:20, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Several of us have worked hard to improve this article—the changes that were made to the criticism section were discussed in particular, and most of us agreed that the article was significantly improved. If you want to include potentially defamatory material, you're going to have to discuss it here, and I highly recommend you register a username at Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/a/d/User%7EJade_Knight_0f74.html" title="User:Jade Knight">The Jade Knight</a> 18:32, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>None of the information presented is defamation or more correctly libel.</p>

<p>Stating that classical fencing masters have no living tradition is provably false and could be considered libel. I'm confused as to why it's acceptable to attack one group without factual basis, but providing quotes from cited reviews of books that clarify the criticism of the organization and author is considered "libel". The reviews and the opinions of the authors are factually presented even if the review itself is purely an opinion. (In other words, we can demonstrate factually that these people hold these opinions regardless of whether the opinions themselves are valid.)</p>
<p>The issue you have is with the opinions of the reviewers. These reviews express the opinion of the respective authors and their reviews of the ARMA texts are not libel anymore than Siskel and Ebert's movie reviews would be libel. If ARMA wants to be critical of others, then that opens them to the same criticism from others and demonstrating that is not inappropriate.</p>

<p>I should have expected as much when this article is little more than free advertisment space for ARMA.

<dd>Jade Knight, I just want to be clear. It's your position that the Italian fencing tradition that started with Fiore, continued through Vadi, Manciolino, Marrozzo, Agrippa, Di Grassi, Fabris, Giganti, and Alfieri is completely unrelated to Parise unless a master-to-master lineage is demonstratable? Is that correct? That's your position even though all factual evidence points to the contrary?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe aliens showed up in Naples and taught them fencing that was strangely similar to all the fencing used before, with the same terminology, but was actually in no way related! Maybe it's Intelligent Design applied to fencing? God made them fence that way?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's your belief that the classical Italian tradition appeared out of nowhere? It's your position that classical Italian fencing is in no way a part of the living tradition of Italian swordplay? Because at the point you admit that it **might** be, your argument collapses.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Even then, the motivation for making such a statement is entirely suspect. It's a weak and self-serving argument and you know it. It is a convenient straw man argument to divert attention away from the documentable fact that Clements has no instruction within the Italian tradition. He's at best an amateur passing himself off as a guru without any teaching credentials and trying to raise his own status by casting doubt on people with legitmate certification. There are plenty of talented amateur instructors out there teaching great fencing, but none of them employs the same forms of venomous personal attacks that Clements has become known for.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The real issue is the need to drag down others to prop-up Clements. It's a damn shame because if ARMA had a few less monkeys at the top of the tree, they might be taken seriously as an organization. There are plenty of ARMA practitioners that are good people, but until ARMA regains the confidence of the rest of the community, they will continue to be pariahs. When Clements (and his attitude, and his safety record) is gone, that may happen.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Xiliq, What I see is you and two other ARMA members writing an advertisement for the organization. Maybe that's not what your intention is, but don't even try to paint a picture of neutral consensus. You're fooling yourself if you think otherwise.</dd>

<dd>This is getting off topic but I feel I must respond. Given that ARMA is the largest organization in the world focused upon the reconstruction of Medieval and Renaissance fighting arts as true martial arts it is silly of you to suggest that ARMA should be seeking the confidence of those groups who members are still running around in milti-colored stocking engaging in role-playing, sword-tag, and edge-hacking. What ARMA does as an organization is completely different from what those other groups do - ARMA does not seek their confidence! If you are interested in safety records I would suggest talking to those organizations who's members have suffered a broken neck, a practice daggers in the eye, a hit in the head with a rapier, rather than wasting you time with ARMA, which has probably the best safety record in WMA. Will these silly flames never end? <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERanp_c007.html" title="User:Ranp">Ranp</a> 16:27, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Reviewing the archives, I see that I am not alone in finding this "encyclopedia entry" to be little more than a thinly veiled advertisement. The article was originally created by an ARMA (Jaerom Darkwind) member to promote his group and is continually revised by members (Randall Pleasant and Xiliquiern) of the organization to portray it in a favorable light. ARMA's wikipedia entry is unique in that other martial arts schools typically do not have a Wikipedia article plugging their school, its merits, and it's founder.</p>
<p>The ARMA article was created by members of ARMA.</p>

<dd>Don't make a new article for your own product or Web site. Most often, when a person creates a new article describing his or her own work, it's because the work is not yet well-known enough to have attracted anyone else's attention, much less verifiable sources.

<p>This page meets the following criteria:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Blatant advertising. Pages which exclusively promote a company, product, group, service, or person and which would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become encyclopedic. Note that simply having a company, product, group, service, or person as its subject does not qualify an article for this criterion; an article that is blatant advertising should have inappropriate content as well. If a page has previously gone through a deletion process and was not deleted, it should not be speedily deleted under this criterion.</dd>

<dd>The ARMA article is not advertisement. <b>The history of the modern reconstruction of Western Martial Arts simply cannot be described in Wikipedia without an article giving a clear description of the largest and most significant organization in WMA</b>. Since the mid-1990s ARMA has been the primary driving force in the reconstruction of Western Martial Arts and it's scholars have produced more books and articles than another other organization. Should those contributions be completely overlooked just because you and a few other people who like to hide in the shadows don't like the director of ARMA? <b>Wikipedia is about providing the truth to the public, to not acknowledge ARMA's role in the reconstruction of Western Martial Arts is simply nothing less than a lie</b>. The ARMA's advertisement is it's world wide reputation for hard-core martial arts and the ARMA Web Site, which is the largest and most predominant WMA web site on the Internet. ARMA currently has an acceptance rate of less than 50% for new applcations, which greatly suggest that ARMA does not need more advertisement.<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERanp_c007.html" title="User:Ranp">Ranp</a> 15:54, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I disagree with the proposal to delete the page entirely, as ARMA has contributed to the WMA community in its own particular way.</p>
<p>However, as currently worded, large sections of the page read more like an advertisement for the club than as a factual representation of the organization. I have added "citation needed" to those statements (or paragraphs) most in need of such clarification.

<dd>The reason I left Wikipedia was because of stuff like this. Minor, petty accusations (or nearly that) and arguments over little tiny relatively inconsequential details. It's also important to remember - this is just Wikipedia. We aren't writing the ultimate record of mankind's knowledge, news, and activities - at least not until significant changes are made to the system, anyway.</dd>
<dd>Now, as we all know, there are some rules to wikipedia, some of which are spoken more than others. For instance, WP articles are ideally to be cited thoroughly. Statements should simply be supported with information so that they are not blind claims. That applies to this article as well, as far as I'm concerned. The "citation war" on the criticism section began for just that reason, and occurred there first as it was a form of attack on the organization - individuals had posted un-cited and un-citeable information for the sole purpose of discrediting the group. And that's not what Wikipedia is about.</dd>
<dd>As the criticism section stands, I still think elements of it are somewhat...outside the realm of the article. However, they will be left in until there is standing consensus to remove them.</dd>
<dd>Also, it should be said, as Jade Knight recommended, that those of you posting the citation requests in the article in an effort to improve its accuracy and credibility should take some time to look for the information. When I posted citation requests in the criticism section, I spent <i>hours</i> reading through websites and forums looking for a respectable source that could be cited. All I found were indirect "I heard from a friend's friend's brother..." stories and criticism of the books by Clements- the first not suitable for citing a source on here, and the second already present and cited. I also asked others, I believe, to do the same, but no-one could come up with much. So, as I've asked individuals before, let's work <b>together</b> on this. Let's not alienate ourselves from one another, call each other names, or teeter on the edge of accusation and personal attack. Let's go about this is a real and factual manner, meaning that we should all be serious about citing sources and discussing edits when necessary. --<a href="../../../x/i/l/User%7EXiliquiern_de49.html" title="User:Xiliquiern">Xiliquiern</a> 16:37, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While we are changing things about, would anyone be opposed to the removal of the ARMA InTheatre section?

<dd>I think in this case, the problem is the word "accurate" which is debatable. See the "true" rapier discussion previously. - Parry_4 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Parry_4 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Parry_4_66e6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Parry 4">contribs</a>).</small>
<dl>
<dd>Well, the ARMA uses 'stock' training weapons from companies like New Stirling Arms (wasters), Albion Swords (blunts and sharps), and Arms and Armour as well as other vendors for their weaponry. As far as I know, these sort of vendors are also used by just about every other HEMA organization, so there is nothing inherently more inaccurate about the ARMA's choice of weaponry than any other organization. It's not as if ARMA has smiths within the organization custom making strange weapon forms just for ARMA use. As noted in the "true" rapier debate, however, ARMA has decided to subdivide rapier training into two primary regions - the rapiers that are well-edged and prone to capable cuts, and those that are less edged and less capable in cutting action, both of which existed historically and undoubtedly coexisted.</dd>
<dd>If there is still a desire to bring about criticism of the ARMA <i>technique</i> in teaching rapier combat rather than the actual <i>equipment</i> used, which is, as I stated, essentially the 'industry standard' that many other groups use, that information should go in the criticism section with a cited source. This phrase, however, deals with either the state of the replica arms and armour as accurate (in which case we can only the designers of the weaponry such as Paul Champagne or Peter Johnsson), or the use of replica arms and armour. -<a href="../../../x/i/l/User%7EXiliquiern_de49.html" title="User:Xiliquiern">Xiliquiern</a> 17:42, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Try to avoid picking a fight where none exists. You asked a direct question and got a direct answer. The word "accurate" is a subjective and qualitative term and by your own admission, ARMA uses the same tools everyone else uses. If you drop the word "accurate" you eliminate a value judgment and the issue goes away. - Parry_4 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Parry 4 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Parry_4_66e6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Parry 4">contribs</a>) 18:09, 5 March 2007 (UTC).</small><small>— Parry_4 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Parry_4_66e6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Parry 4">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>

<dd>I apologize for any perceived ill intent - there was none meant at all. Please note that I did not say 'everyone'. There are a few organizations that use training tools that many other organizations, often including ARMA, deem unsuitable. An example includes the Japanese shinai which is too short, too light, and unbalanced, in comparison to a longsword. It is also unedged, making edge alignment difficult to interpret. Despite these notions, some groups use shinai in longsword fencing. All the statement concludes is that ARMA puts importance on accuracy, which the cited reference (and many other references on the ARMA site) confirms. It does not say that others don't work in an accurate manner or that others are wrong in their pursuits, so I struggle to see the issue. Perhaps the term should be operationally defined? -<a href="../../../x/i/l/User%7EXiliquiern_de49.html" title="User:Xiliquiern">Xiliquiern</a> 20:27, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the word "accurate" is going to be used, you need to support that with evidence. Who says that your weapon simulators are acccurate? What evidence do you have that shows this? (The writer's old maxim: "Don't tell me. Show me.") Keep in mind, I'm not trying to push your buttons, but if you have a citation or an alternative phrasing, you should use it.</dd>

<dd>That makes perfect sense, and was what I had asked originally. We are looking for sources noting the authenticity and accuracy of WMA training gear. In that case, I can think of a few possible sources.</dd>
<dd>1) <a href="http://www.myarmoury.com|" class="external text" title="http://www.myarmoury.com|" rel="nofollow">MyArmoury</a> is an online collectors and, to some extent, WMA "hangout" that reviews a wide number of available products giving honest and earnest opinions. Of course, with the hundreds of different tools in use, it would be difficult, using this method, to pin down the accuracy of the weapons in general, but would allow more in depth notes on them.</dd>
<dd>2) The manufacturers themselves. Often the manufacturers claim historical accuracy and research. Some talk more about it than others (Albion Swords, for instance, has a number of pages detailing the process of measuring originals, the handling of originals, and then the construction based strongly on these originals).</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>3) Individual reviews - a number of individuals, some training in WMA and others not, make note of some brands and provide public feedback like <a href="http://www.newstirlingarms.com/woodwasters.html|" class="external text" title="http://www.newstirlingarms.com/woodwasters.html|" rel="nofollow">this</a>. As you can see, a few individuals from MA organizations approve of the product as being, essentially, accurate.</dd>

<dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>4) Expert consultations. There are a number of reviews and editorials (of sorts) on the ARMA page wherein a leading authority on swords (mostly Smiths, I believe, including Paul Champagne and Peter Johnsson, and (I believe) the late Ewart Oakeshott) that provide information about 'what a sword was', what is accurate, what isn't, etc.</dd>

<dd>5) It may also be of note, though indirectly, that ARMA has started group "sword fund" for the purpose of purchasing original weapons so that contributors may be able to handle the 'real deal'. It doesn't get much more accurate than that, but again, this would not be a widely used training device.</dd>

<dd>I think we must keep the word "accurate" in the sentence because it makes clear that ARMA uses arms that are very close to what was used historically. Removing the word "accurate" could leave readers to believe that ARMA uses round sticks like the SCA or heavy rebated swords like stage actors. One only has to compare an Albion sword to a Starfire sword to understand why it is important to say ARMA uses only "accurate" arms. Removing the word ""accurate" changes the accuracy of the sentence. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERanp_c007.html" title="User:Ranp">Ranp</a> 22:59, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do you think any of those, or a combination of the above, would be beneficial in citing this?

<dd>The problem with that is that as far as I know ARMA doesn't regulate it's training weapons. Last I saw, they were using padded swords in some cases, wasters in others, sometimes schlagers, and other times del tins, or anything else. While some of those are more accurate than a fencing foil or a shinai, I wouldn't call a schlager, waster, or padded sword demonstratably "accurate". (That's another discussion entirely.) You might be able to argue that **some** of the tools "are accurate according to these sources". You could argue that evidence exists that similar tools were used for training by the original practitioners, but even a blunted steel longsword isn't completely accurate. Afterall, it's blunt. - Parry_4 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_204.182.3.237_523e.html" title="Special:Contributions/204.182.3.237">204.182.3.237</a> (talk) 00:58, 6 March 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>Really? Although way off topic I again feel I need to reply to this silliness. It is enlightening to learn that ARMA's respect in the academic world, and I guess the rest of the world too, depends upon your opinion? Since you haven't noticed I need to point out to you that ARMA's respect in the academic world is reflected in its list of consultants, which includes Dr. Sydney Anglo. As for ARMA's respect in the real world (is that different from the academic world?) I should point out that people like Matt Larsen, the Director U.S. Army Combatives Program and the author of FM 3-25.150, consults with John Clements, which suggest that Larsen has some respect for ARMA (Larsen is about as real world as one can get). I would also think that teaching classes in 10+ countries of the world also indicates some respect in the real world. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERanp_c007.html" title="User:Ranp">Ranp</a> 20:06, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

Using this quote in an article about ARMA does not in any way bring up an issue about how accurate those arms really are. But just in case there is still any confusion, the quote means that ARMA uses wasters rather than the round sticks like the SCA, it means that ARMA uses blunts from Albion rather than the heavy thick rebatted swords from vendors such as Starfire, and it means that ARMA uses sharps from Albion whenever possible. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERanp_c007.html" title="User:Ranp">Ranp</a> 20:06, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
