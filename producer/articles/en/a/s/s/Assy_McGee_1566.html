<p><i><b>Assy McGee</b></i> is an <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animated_television_series.html" title="Animated television series">animated</a> <a href="../../../s/i/t/Situation_comedy.html" title="Situation comedy">sitcom</a> which takes place in a fictional version of <a href="../../../e/x/e/Exeter%2C_New_Hampshire_ef05.html" title="Exeter, New Hampshire">Exeter, New Hampshire</a>. The show features Assy McGee, a vigilante police officer who is literally a walking pair of <a href="../../../b/u/t/Buttocks.html" title="Buttocks">buttocks</a>. Larry Murphy voices all of the main characters. The series premiered on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_26.html" title="November 26">November 26</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, on <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adult_Swim_e7c7.html" title="Adult Swim">Adult Swim</a>. While the show was already approved and produced well before this point, it was delayed for several weeks because, according to Adult Swim, "it's hard to find sponsors for a TV show with a talking ass." Six episodes have been aired so far and fourteen more are scheduled to begin airing in Summer of 2007.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Assy_McGee_1566.html" title="Edit section: Assy McGee">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Assy McGee</span></h3>
<p>Assy McGee is a rough, gritty, walking, talking pair of <a href="../../../b/u/t/Buttocks.html" title="Buttocks">buttocks</a>. As a rebellious tough-as-nails detective for the Exeter police department, Assy is often in conflict with the chief of police. Assy is a parody of the <i><a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirty_Harry_c2fd.html" title="Dirty Harry">Dirty Harry</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../c/o/b/Cobra_%28film%29.html" title="Cobra (film)">Cobra</a></i> stereotype of cops: trigger-happy, tough, in conflict with the force, and contemptuous of crime. Assy has a slurred style of speech similar to <a href="../../../s/y/l/Sylvester_Stallone_7277.html" title="Sylvester Stallone">Sylvester Stallone</a>, though it is far more muffled, possibly due to his anatomy. Some times, when out of breath, or even just peeved, Assy will flatulate. Assy walks backwards, and even jumps backwards. Assy has stated that he is of <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuban</a> descent. His supposed Cuban hertiage is backed up in the episode, "Conviction" when a childhood picture of Assy with a Cuba hat is shown in the background. Assy loves refreshing himself at Bill W's bar, which is the show's typical tavern.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether Assy possesses <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genitalia.html" title="Genitalia">genitalia</a>, though it is implied on a few occasions. He has been shown walking in profile with no visible genitaliac protrusion or covering, but he requested a <a href="../../../h/a/p/Happy_ending.html" title="Happy ending">happy ending</a> from a <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masseuse.html" title="Masseuse">masseuse</a> in the episode "The Flirty Black Man" and is perfectly capable of urinating in the standard fashion. It should also be noted that in the 1st episode, "Murder By the Docks" Assy requested a handjob at a masseuse's parlor as Sanchez was attacked by ninjas</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Assy_McGee_1566.html" title="Edit section: Detective Sanchez">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Detective Sanchez</span></h3>
<p>Detective Sanchez is Assy's partner and a version of the good cop stereotype. He has a wife and three children. Sanchez is often called by Assy about a case in the middle of the night and is highly tolerant of Assy's antics. Sanchez is sometimes overexcited by events; a prime example, from "Mexican Rain", is when Sanchez suffers a heart attack after witnessing illegal immigrants falling out of a <a href="../../../p/i/%C3%B1/Pi%C3%B1ata.html" title="Piñata">pinata</a> during a kid's birthday party.</p>
<p><a name="Greg_.22The_Chief.22" id="Greg_.22The_Chief.22"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Assy_McGee_1566.html" title="Edit section: Greg &quot;The Chief&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Greg "The Chief"</span></h3>
<p>Greg, almost always referred to as "The Chief", is the chief of the Exeter police department. He often argues with Assy over cases, yet is mesmerized when Assy is able to solve a case. The chief also seems to despise the mayor.</p>
<p><a name=".22The_Mayor.22"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Assy_McGee_1566.html" title="Edit section: &quot;The Mayor&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">"The Mayor"</span></h3>
<p>As the head of the city, the Mayor of Exeter is corrupt and idiotic. He is also obsessed with re-election, as he disregards the facts of a case so that he can be re-elected more easily. The Mayor frequents massage parlors. The character is voiced by H. Jon Benjamin.</p>
<p><a name="DiLorenzo" id="DiLorenzo"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Assy_McGee_1566.html" title="Edit section: DiLorenzo">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">DiLorenzo</span></h3>
<p>DiLorenzo is a thick-headed, light-skinned deputy for the Exeter police department. DiLorenzo often teases Assy and doubts his actions. He was instructed by the chief to follow Assy around while Detective Sanchez was in the hospital following a heart attack.</p>
<p><a name="Glen" id="Glen"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Assy_McGee_1566.html" title="Edit section: Glen">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Glen</span></h3>
<p>Bartender for Bill W's (the bar that Assy often attends). Glen once bailed Assy out of prison, despite being the person that put him there in the first place.</p>
<p><a name=".22Father_Goose.22"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Assy_McGee_1566.html" title="Edit section: &quot;Father Goose&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">"Father Goose"</span></h3>
<p>The father (a priest) is the currently nameless religious figure from whom Assy often seeks spiritual healing &amp; guidance. He is usually found sitting at the bar in Bill W's.</p>

Despite being suspended by the chief for doing so, Assy investigates the case of the hooker anyway. What he fails to realize throughout the investigation is that the hooker was killed by none other than John Adams in 1799. He falsely accuses Actor John Adams in the parade as the John Adams that murdered the dead hooker. Coincidentally, the man Assy shot was wanted in 28 states, so the chief ends up reinstating him. It is revealed during the episode that the chief's actual name is Greg.</p>
