<dd>Can this guideline be cited in a discussion? Otherwise we need Wikipedia:Assume the assumption of assumption of good faith. Seriously, this one may not solve the problem:

<ul>
<li>This is supposed to be more of a guideline to live by, not one to cite. However, I think it can be cited by simply saying: "please only cite AGF in obvious cases of bad faith assumption." So, you would cite AAGF when someone has truly misinterpreted your statements, or when it's not an obvious case of bad faith assumption. Maybe this guideline can be tweaked to cover AAAGF, AAAAGF, etc, by simply saying "don't talk about good faith or bad faith unless youre talking to newbies, or to people who have clearly misinterpreted statements). — <small><sub><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#444444">0918</font></a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left:-24px; margin-right:-24px;"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="#222222">BRIAN</font></b></a></span></sup> • 2006-03-30 23:25</small></li>

<p>This essay is a sophism. The only possible situation where you would cite AGF is because you have substantial evidence in the editor's behavior that he is not assuming GF. And the AGF rule is only an assumption that can be overcome by an evidence. So if someone says "you are in bad faith" and there is not evidence for that bad faith he's talking about, then you can say he is not respecting AGF, and you don't break the rule.

<li>I agree with Brian, who I note created the page. It's not a guideline, and certainly not a policy. There is also no proposal to make this a guideline, from what I can see, and I would hope there isn't: as Brian says this is a view that may be taken to be "common sense" (to those to whom it is self-evident).

<li>Well, if you make policy of every single thing that is common sense, that's certainly instruction creep. In this case, I am not even convinced that, as it is currently written, this page is really common sense (it says that you should follow a policy but cannot ask others to do the same). Personally, I am contrary to this as a guideline, but if you are proposing it, it's a proposed guideline by definition&#160;:-) Let's see what others think. - Liberatore(<a href="../../../p/a/o/User_talk%7EPaolo_Liberatore_53e0.html" title="User talk:Paolo Liberatore">T</a>) 09:36, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>You can cite AGF when talking with newbies unlikely to have read the guideline, or in obvious cases of bad faith assumption, but shouldn't when you cannot be absolutely sure that you are judging the situation correctly.

<li>Which makes it a matter of interpretation and judgment. I don't think making this a guideline will help.

<p>I'm sorry but the ideas put forth by this page make no logical sense. It says that that "the very act of citing AGF assumes that the opponent is assuming bad faith." This is not true. If I make an edit, and someone else disagrees with it, but rather than politely open a dialogue with me, they accuse me of vandalism (which <i>has</i> happened), then their failure to adhere to GF is not an "assumption" on my part, but a fairly obvious <b>statement of observation</b>. Good Faith is essentially an extention of civility. It just means that one does not assume the worst motive on the part of an editor. Is this page seriously suggesting that uncivil behavior and unproven accusations are anything other than <i>self evident</i>? Whether a person is acting in good faith is easily determined by the approach they take when disagreeing with another editor. The page also says that it is best not to cite the rule. But why? If a policy or guideline is being violated, then how else is it to be enforced if not with a polite admonishment? I'm sure its originators had the best of intentions, but this page looks completely ill-conceived, and the only "change" I think is appropriate is deletion. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightscream_713e.html" title="User:Nightscream">Nightscream</a> 08:28, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your edit made this page show up on my watchlist; thinking of it, I realized that there is a fundamental problem with the idea, even assuming Carbonite's law at face value. Essentially, Carbonite's law says "citing AGF is a sign that you are not acting in good faith". Citing <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> is a sign of not acting in good faith (an effect, not a cause). As a result, not citing <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> would be an effective way to conceal that you are not acting in good faith.</dd>
