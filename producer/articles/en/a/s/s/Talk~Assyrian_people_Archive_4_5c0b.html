<p>There is no dispute.<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESargonious_9f62.html" title="User:Sargonious">King Legit</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, just a start: the very title is disputed. It claims to include all the people who at some point in time or still refer to themselves as <i>Suryāye</i> (or a variety on that theme), but its title suggests that it's only about a part of that group.</dd>
<dd>So I'd suggest either renaming the article, or narrowing it down in order for it to refer <i>solely</i> to those people who identify <i>themselves</i> as Assyrians, and have a separate article for the modern Aramaeans (if necessary about the Chaldaeans, as well), and one article dealing with all the people that make up Syriac Christianity. --<b><a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenne_3d1e.html" title="User:Benne">Benne</a></b> ['bɛnə] <sub>(<a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenne_fa1a.html" title="User talk:Benne">talk</a>)</sub> 15:33, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_people_future_page_f265.html" title="Assyrian people/future page">Assyrian people/future page</a> is coming along quite well. That page will replace this page when we feel it's ready. Then we have the proposal that we create a page for all people who are traditionally Christian and traditionally speak Syro-Aramaic: these two criteria then can be interpreted quite broadly to include Assyrians, Chaldaeans, Syriacs, Aramaeans, Maronites and Melkites. The last two groups have quite different histories, but were originally Aramaic-speaking Christians. The first four groups are much more closely related: most Chaldaeans see themselves as Assyrian and a significant number of Syriacs do also. So, the idea is that we have a page for each name, with one page that puts it all together. — <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 15:50, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think that's fair and reasonable. As long as the group as a whole is not called "Assyrian", for example, if we were to sum up the ethnic groups in Turkey. The same counts for the list of villages, and famous Syriacs. We will yet have to find a solution for those articles as well. What about reviving the old project you'd started? Perhaps we could call it "Syriac Christianity". --<b><a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenne_3d1e.html" title="User:Benne">Benne</a></b> ['bɛnə] <sub>(<a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenne_fa1a.html" title="User talk:Benne">talk</a>)</sub> 15:57, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>One more thing. The statistics for Turkey on both the current and the future page are the same. That cannot be true if the current one is dealing with all Syriacs (which it claims to do), and the future one is to deal with only the people identifying themselves as Assyrians.</dd>
<dd>Besides, I think that number (5,000) to be quite low if it were to comprise all Syriacs, i.e. Syriac Orthodox, Syriac Catholics, members of the Assyrian Church of the East, the Chaldaean Catholic Church, and Protestant Syriacs (as far as I've seen, they usually call themselves <i>Süryani</i>, some consider themselves to be ethnic Aramaeans, some others Assyrians). I wonder if there are that many Chaldean Catholics and Assyrian Church members left in Turkey, since the forced evacuation of Hasana. But anyways, the total number should me more than 5,000, I reckon. --<b><a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenne_3d1e.html" title="User:Benne">Benne</a></b> ['bɛnə] <sub>(<a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenne_fa1a.html" title="User talk:Benne">talk</a>)</sub> 16:12, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are much more differences among other ethnic groups such as the Kurds, Arabs, Jews, and Chinese. I do not see such discussion on their pages. I for one am a member of the Chaldean Church and have always considered myself, and the rest of my family, as ethnically, Assyrian. Its funny how opposition is only coming from non-Assyrians or clergy influenced by a handful of Syriac scholars with highly opinionated and unfounded theories. My suggestion is that you leave our people and our national and ethnic beliefs alone.--FirasJatou 07:51, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">I have never heard someone call themselves Aramaean.</span></h2>
<p>You people overseas think you have it all figured out. You leave your people and really forget who you are. Us Kurds call these people Assyrian and know that they are the same people call themselves Chaldean. Where do you get Aramaean? They don't even call the language that. I hear them say Sureet. To me that sounds like Syria which everyone in the middle east knows is based on the great Assyrian Empire. Some people overseas mess everything up for the people back home because they with their so called education are actually less educated on their people because they're hearing their history from an outside source who only read about it and never witnessed it.<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaitan_Al_Mahdi_1d60.html" title="User:Shaitan Al Mahdi">شيطان</a></p>

<dd>Not true again... Inheritors does not mean direct descendants. As far as indegenous groups, they are indegenous to Mesopotamia in any way that you look at it. Even Aramaeans that want nothing to do with Assyrians claim Mesopotamia as the homeland of Aramaeans. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESargonious_9f62.html" title="User:Sargonious">King Legit</a></dd>

<dd>Ok, so since your article says "many of the ancestors of the modern-day Arabs, Kurds, Mongols, Persians, and Turks were originally Christian or converts". I can say many Arabs are indegenous to Mesopotamia too, right?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Embarrassing</span></h2>
<p>It is embarrassing for me as an Aram-Assyrians to tolerate what you are doing on this site. It says "we consider ourselves to be the inheritors of Mesopotamia", the whole world knows we are and we dont need any proof. The kurds who arent an ancient people and have never been, theyre like 800 years old and came from the zagros mountain and are iranians have a better page then us and they claim they are descended from like 15 different people, what idiot would ever belive on this? all arabs,assyrians,iranians and turks know this is nothing more than bullshit! i hope one day we will rise and make you people like you who make this page so embarrassing will fall.</p>

<p>Hello guys. I am really sorry to see this page protected. Well, i've not been part of the discussions and most probably i won't. However, i'll just be trying to help you reach a concensus in order to move forward.</p>
<p>After reading this talk page and some relevant parts of the archives i could say that <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenne_3d1e.html" title="User:Benne">Benne</a> is <i>totally</i> right when it comes to references (that doesn't mean i endorse his comments apart from those related to the lack of references). Most (if not all of them) of the references listed on the article are unworthy to be mentioned. There's no bibliography section, no further reading section.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Could you please suggest any other bibliography. Once we have that in place, contributors can focus on discussing them instead of wasting their time arguing about POVs. That would definitely help the issue.

<dd>As soon as this page is unprotected it will return to its usual status of Neo-Assyrian propaganda site. Unless you are willing to invest time in constant watching, this article will be dominated by cranks forever. So whom are you talking bibliography to? They don't need books written by Europeans.
