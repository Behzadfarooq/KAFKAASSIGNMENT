<p>I fail to see the logic of having an article specifically about "Street Thunder". The page for the movie is hardly too big to handle this content. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleduc_26ee.html" title="User:Cleduc">Cleduc</a> 04:39, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I feel that the gang are quite a large part of the film, and quite different from antagonists in other films, and therefore justifying the separate page. Also, many films and books, described on wikipedia. have separate pages for their characters/entities (Eg Terminator franchise, T-1000, T-X, T-850; Alien, Weyland Yutami Corp). Anthony 23:20, 24 December 2005</p>
<p>I second Anthony's opinion. <a href="../../../s/u/l/User%7ESullenspice_d94d.html" title="User:Sullenspice">Sullenspice</a> 01:48, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Merge undone. This merge was poorly conceived. You essentially deleted a fairly detailed mid-length article, whittled the content down to a poorly-written synopsis, and pasted it into this article with no regard for how it fit (stylistically or thematically).</dd>

<dd>More importantly, Anthony made a convincing case (see above) for keeping the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_Thunder_d203.html" title="Street Thunder">Street Thunder</a> article, and nobody else refuted his argument--a fact you completely ignored (or deliberately disrespected). The treatment of Street Thunder should have been decided by consensus on this talk page before any action was taken. One random person's opinion is not sufficient reason to make such a drastic, rash move. You should reflect on this because, judging by some of the other comments on your user talk page, you seem to have a made a habit of disregarding ongoing discussions on article talk pages and acting impulsively. <a href="../../../s/u/l/User%7ESullenspice_d94d.html" title="User:Sullenspice">Sullenspice</a> 01:22, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just added a soundtrack section since I was surprised to find that there was no mention in this article of its score which is actually considered particularly influential. To be honest I was shocked to find that a film which has seperate articles for some of its characters and even the silent gang didn't mention its score which is considered by many to be its most prominent feature (and by some the only part of the film worth mentioning)! Anyway it's done now and I hope people are happy with it. --Thetriangleguy 17:30, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please leave the 1976 poster image at the top of the article. It is always preferable to use original movie art. In this particular case, the poster art better represents the movie. The DVD cover art, which is of much more recent date, depicts a New York skyline when the movie is actually set in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>There should be "DVD release" section in the article, and the DVD cover art could be placed there.</p>

<dl>
<dd>I second this. Also, please remember that original poster art speaks to the graphic sensibilities that were actually contemporary with the movie's release. Finally, there is a wikipedia consensus that original art is what goes into the infobox (wherever possible.)</dd>

<p>Just to let you know the poster isn't the US theatrical poster, its actually the Australian, because it has the Australian R18+ rating near the title.</p>

<li>Great catch, I've edited the caption and description to remove "US." In my defence, the source I used (IMPAwards) uses US posters almost exclusively, and is usually careful to identify the Non-US versions. I will try to reearch this further, because I feel a US film ought to use a US poster from the time of the film's release. However, I've found that frequently "foreign" posters of US films are slighly modified versions of the US poster. I sort of hope that's the case here, b/c I've grown fond of the image. However, it's still more appropriate for the infobox than any DVD cover. <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReimelt_5d48.html" title="User:Reimelt">Reimelt</a> 02:34, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Article states that among the staff on board at the station are <b>the station's two secretaries, Leigh and Julie</b>. I always thought Leigh was a detective: she certainly seems to act like one, greeting Bishop on his arrival, expressing her failure to save the life of a murdered co-worker, unlocking the cells, arming her self with a shotgun while showing no unease (apart from her arm injury) at having to operate or load the weapon (she knows how to do it without being shown). Furthermore Bishop has no qualms about her being armed and attempting to shoot dead intruders: he would hardly allow a secretary to do that without any firearm instruction? Wells even calls her a cop and neither she nor Bishop correct him. If she was a mere secretary, her attraction to Wilson hardly carries the same sting that it does if you think of her as a detective. However, I have seen the film many times and it does not actually explicitly clarify what her job is. Format 03:29, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Granted, there is no dialogue in the movie that explicitly states what Leigh's job is. While it is not beyond the realm of possibility that she is supposed to be a "plainclothes" officer like Starker, it seems more likely that she is a secretary. I think the choice to have her dressed in a manner similar to Julie (who is clearly a secretary/switchboard operator) is deliberate. If John Carpenter had felt strongly enough about making the point that she was an officer, he probably would have had her in uniform or explicitly stated it in the dialogue.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, there is absolutely no reason why a secretary wouldn't know how to fire a gun--especially if she worked with police for years (as Leigh indicates later in the film); and she would probably have to know how to lock and unlock cells in case of emergency. Regardless of what her job description actually is, Leigh is clearly a strong, tough, self-reliant character--that's the most important point. That she is a secretary (or a "mere secretary" as you rather unfortunately phrased it) doesn't take that away from her. In fact, one could argue that Carpenter is deliberately subverting gender stereotypes by portraying a woman in a traditionally "female" occupation as a force to be reckoned with. Furthermore, Bishop gives convicted killers guns, why would he have qualms about giving a gun to an intelligent, reliable, strong woman just because she happens to be a secretary?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Why would she bother to correct Wells, anyway? Wells is about to go out and do something extremely dangerous, why would she (or anybody for that matter) pipe up and say, "...well, no. I'm actually a secretary." In Wells's world view, he probably defines everyone associated with the police as "cops." I think the sentence should be left as is unless there is a reliable source that contradicts it. <a href="../../../s/u/l/User%7ESullenspice_d94d.html" title="User:Sullenspice">Sullenspice</a> 14:54, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was addressing your question point by point. That's what talk pages are for. This is one of my favorite movies, and I happen to know quite a bit about it.

<p>There is no reason to alter any of the names in the cast list. The actors are listed in this article under the names they used in this film's credits. Nancy Kyes is credited as "Nancy Loomis" in AOP 13 (as she is in most of her film appearances). I created a "Nancy Loomis" redirect page last year, ergo the "Nancy Loomis" link on this page goes to the "Nancy Kyes" article. Changing it to "Nancy Kyes/Loomis" as 24.195.208.152 did is utterly nonsensical.</p>
