<p>Advocacy is that process in which an individual (an Advocate) provides assistance to a particular Wikipedian or group of Wikipedians involved in a dispute. This assistance generally includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing access to and explanations of, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicy_Library_99e5.html" title="Wikipedia:Policy Library">Policy</a> (particularly pages like <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_resolution_5252.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict resolution">Wikipedia:Conflict resolution</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/t/Wikipedia%7ETutorial_f7c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Tutorial">Wikipedia:Tutorial</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/l/Wikipedia%7EHelp_desk_5342.html" title="Wikipedia:Help desk">Wikipedia:Help desk</a>, <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Foundation_issues" class="extiw" title="m:Foundation_issues">M:Foundation issues</a>, etc...)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Representing their party's side in the dispute and helping to articulate their point of view in accordance to policy through Mediation or Arbitration.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Being an example of policy accordance and <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">civility</a>, especially when involved in Advocacy of an "official" nature.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Advocacy is not mandatory</b>, neither the advocate nor the advocee is obligated by wikipedia policy to engage in the advocacy process. Some editors appreciate the informality that this optional nature affords the advocate.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>A lawyer-client relationship.</b> - Although Advocates are the closest thing to lawyers on Wikipedia, an Advocate should see their Advocacy relationship more like that of an older sibling, or an informal <a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward_%28law%29.html" title="Ward (law)">wardship</a> or <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charge_%28youth%29.html" title="Charge (youth)">charge</a>; Advocates should at all times stand against <a href="../../../w/l/_/WP%7EWL_5eab.html" title="WP:WL">WikiLawyering</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>An official Wikipedia procedure.</b> - The AMA is a voluntary user-group and, as such, Advocates will take cases on a volunteer basis. It is the advocates themselves, by consensus and as individuals who determine how to best solve disputes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>A method to coerce the breaking up of a dispute by Administrative action.</b> -- Some Advocates are Administrators, others are not. The advocacy process will very rarely involve the use of any special 'admin powers' on the part of an advocate.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>A Complicated and Difficult Wikipedian Procedure</b> -- For those requesting an Advocate's help, the procedure is usually as simple as talking to a friend who will listen. For the Advocate, the process is often as simple as giving good advice to a friend. For more difficult cases, an Advocate can obtain help or advice from other Advocates. New and unique problems rarely arise, and almost anything can be solved with good communication between all parties concerned.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssociation_of_Members%27_Advocates_AMA_Handbook_83fd.html" title="Edit section: How to be a good Advocate">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">How to be a good Advocate</span></h2>
<p>Being a good Advocate is not hard. Good communication is the key, both in assessing the problem, and in offering solutions.</p>
<p>The voluntary nature of the advocacy process means that some editors may be somewhat hostile at first, and not be especially cooperative at the outset, however, the fundamental policy of <b>assume good faith</b> allows you to <b>be firm in expecting that all parties want to and will cooperate</b> with efforts to reach an appropriate solution.</p>
<p>Patience is absolutely vital, as problems are often actually caused by one or more parties losing their patience and doing something rash. On the other hand, it helps to understand that you may be dealing with parties that have already used up all of their patience and to be gentle with everyone concerned.</p>
<p>It can help for an Advocate to be willing to read multiple long-winded pages of what can at times verge on irate and almost incoherent ranting, and to distill that down to a short paragraph of summation. <b>Don't expect people who are already aggravated to be willing to read more than a few short paragraphs</b>. Rather than a long thorough dissertation, dumped in one lump on an editors talk page, it is often very helpful to have brief exchanges of succinct dialog.</p>
<p>Short paragraphs are almost certain to be read thoroughly.</p>
<p>Respect the efforts disputants are willing to make to reach a resolution and be sure to thank everyone, in advance, for the time they have spent helping you reach an effective solution.</p>
<p><a name="Being_a_good_listener" id="Being_a_good_listener"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssociation_of_Members%27_Advocates_AMA_Handbook_83fd.html" title="Edit section: Being a good listener">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Being a good listener</span></h3>
<p>Advocates should understand and try to present the advocee's point of view in a clearly understandable, rational and succinct manner, while staying detached from the conflict itself. Being a good listener takes time, patience, good reading skills, and the ability to get a feel for the situation. Often disputants are having difficulty in expressing their problem, and in this case it is good to present them with your interpretation of their position or question in order to clarify if this is indeed the case.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssociation_of_Members%27_Advocates_AMA_Handbook_83fd.html" title="Edit section: Clear understanding of policy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Clear understanding of policy</span></h3>
<p>Wikipedia policies are in place due to the consensus of editors. They're not perfect, but then again their design allows for this.</p>
<p>Advocates are most useful to the dispute resolution process when they are able to provide authority to back up their advocee's perspective(s), (as well as to explain opposing viewpoints) and thus they should be quite knowledgeable in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Copyrights</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../g/e/n/Wikipedia%7EGeneral_disclaimer_3e44.html" title="Wikipedia:General disclaimer">Warranty Disclaimers</a></li>

</ul>
<p>and all such similar information that is available in the Wikipedia namespace.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssociation_of_Members%27_Advocates_AMA_Handbook_83fd.html" title="Edit section: Don't abuse your tools">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Don't abuse your tools</span></h4>
<p>Being a good Advocate requires you <b>to know Wikipedia policy</b>, guidelines and customs. Think of policies as <b>tools</b> and <i>know what tools are at your disposal, but don't abuse them</i>. <b>Nobody likes to be hammered on by a wikilawyer quoting policy to them</b>.</p>
<p>Advocacy is a voluntary process, and just as you are donating <i>your</i> time, so is everyone else. Nobody has to talk to you, or help you, or even acknowlege you, so while being firm, be gentle as well. Remember <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick" rel="nofollow">WP:JERK</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, Advocates should acquaint themselves with the customs and policies of any of the various Wikiprojects which may be applicable, and in general research everything which pertains to the dispute in question, by reading previous versions of articles, by interviewing involved parties, and even if necessary, to read external references. The advocacy step and and the effort you spend researching your issue now can avoid burdening the community later with unnecessary arbitration, mediation, etc.</p>
<p><a name="Patience_and_tact" id="Patience_and_tact"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssociation_of_Members%27_Advocates_AMA_Handbook_83fd.html" title="Edit section: Patience and tact">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Patience and tact</span></h3>
<p>It is very helpful for Advocates to cultivate their own patience and tactfulness, as sometimes <b>these two attributes alone can resolve problems</b>. The research and interview process can be lengthy in some cases -- being willing to thoroughly research the dispute, and to <b>tactfully</b> and <b>patiently</b> reason with people who may be feeling aggravated and exasperated already -- will go a long way to an equitable solution. Again, tact, patience and diligence during the advocacy step can avoid burdening the community with further dispute resolution procedures.</p>

<p>Most disputes on Wikipedia fall into one of several easily-recognisable categories. These categories don't encompass every possible problem one may come across as an Advocate, but are a good framework to work from in deciding what course of action to take when confronted with particular recurring patterns.</p>

<p>Although there are a number of questions that Wikipedian who files for Advocacy answers to begin with (see <i><a href="#Advocacy_Procedures" title="">#Advocacy Procedures</a></i> below), these opening questions are very useful to ask either side of the dispute as they generally help to ascess the situation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Would you prefer to discuss this privately?/Would you mind if we discuss this on your talk page?</li>
<li>How would you describe the problem?</li>
<li>Is (insert summary as you understand it) an accurate summary of the issue?</li>
<li>Would you like me to try and articulate this to (insert username(s))?</li>
<li>Are you acquainted with (insert applicable policy)?</li>
<li>How do you understand (insert applicable policy)?</li>

<li>What outcome did you expect to obtain by requesting an Advocate?</li>
<li>What outcome do you think would be best for you? Would this be the best outcome for Wikipedia as a whole?</li>
<li>How important is this issue to you? How important do you believe this issue is to the community and to Wikipedia?</li>
<li>What do you feel caused this problem, and is there anything you could have done to avoid it?</li>
<li>Do you understand why (insert username(s)) believes what they did was proper?</li>

<p>Wikipedia, at the time of writing this handbook had <b>43</b> official policies. You should be aware of these policies, but more importantly, be aware of what they mean, why they exist, and the spirit behind the rules.</p>

<p>Above all, you should know these three policies by heart, as they are the crux of the Advocacy position.</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">Resolving disputes</a> (DR)</dt>
<dd>This is by far the most important policy that an Advocate should know, as it is the policy that the AMA was founded to protect and help along:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Talk to the other parties involved. <b>This is number one for good reason</b> and quite often is all that is needed, the more effectively you apply this step the more likely you will reach a quick resolution.</li>
<li>Informal mediation. See the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_9d17.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal">Mediation Cabal</a> for an example of informal mediation.</li>
<li>Discuss with third parties. Options for doing this include: <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comment</a>, the main avenue for general disputes, <a href="../../../t/h/i/Wikipedia%7EThird_opinion_ae73.html" title="Wikipedia:Third opinion">Wikipedia:Third opinion</a>, for disputes involving only two editors, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiquette_alerts_4982.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiquette alerts">Wikipedia:Wikiquette alerts</a>, for problems with <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">uncivil</a> editors, and setting up a survey, see <a href="../../../s/t/r/Wikipedia%7EStraw_polls_a7e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Straw polls">Wikipedia:Straw polls</a> for advice.</li>
<li>Formal mediation. Be prepared to show that you tried to resolve the dispute using the steps listed above, and that all parties to the dispute are in agreement to mediate. See <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_mediation_71be.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for mediation">Request mediation</a>.</li>
<li>Finally, <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFARB_0da3.html" title="WP:RFARB">Arbitration</a>. Again be prepared to show that you tried to resolve the dispute using the steps listed above.</li>
</ol>
<p>Throughout this process, The Advocate must be encouraging to the Advocee, and attempt to find a workable consensual solution between all parties. Each step should be conducted as thoroughly as possible, as the more thorough you are, the fewer steps you will have to take.</p>

Sometimes this can be tricky as an Advocate, especially when the party who is against your case makes ill remarks or inappropriate actions. In some cases this can be even worse when your Advocee may break faith. The best shot at fixing this is to discuss the issues in a calm manner and always follow the AMA's motto: <i><a href="../../../a/u/d/Audi_alteram_partem.html" title="Audi alteram partem">audi alteram partem</a></i>.
