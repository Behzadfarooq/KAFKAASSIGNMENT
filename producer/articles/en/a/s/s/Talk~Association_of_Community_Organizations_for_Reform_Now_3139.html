	    <p>It was with hesitance that I cited an editorial since it was oppponion. I was not aware of their history of attacking ACORN. I was hoping that something such as judicial decision, which to me appears to be clear cut, would be able to be used as neutral.</p>
<p>Actually, those aren't ACORN members, who are dues-paying community residents much like members of a church or union, those were part-time employees hired specifically to register people to vote who subsequently defrauded both ACORN and the electoral systems in those states. Citing the Wall Street Journal's editorial page is also not a neutral citiation, since the WSJ has repeatedly attacked ACORN's work and reputation. Citing from their news stories would be a neutral source, but editorials are, by definition opinion.</p>
<p>You may wish to know there have also been ACORN members already convicted in Wisconson and Colorado.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. Also before you say it is partisan and is being done by the conservitives check out the articles on what the Justice system is doing.</p>
<p>Almost all the citations of voter registration fraud come from a report put out by the American Center for Voting Rights. While it has an innocuous name, it is headed by a Republican lawyer and fundraiser. It has a vested interest in destroying ACORN's reputation. This is not necessarily to say that the information is therefore ipso facto wrong, but it is to say that everything in the report is an accusation, none of which have been borne out by investigations. In fact, newspaper stories and documents from law enforcement agencies note that none of the accusations made against ACORN as an organization have been substantiated. Many accusations against employees who were caught forging VR cards were borne out and those individuals charged and convicted. In short, I do not think the AC4VR citations are legitimate and they distort the record of ACORN's activities. Note that I am not arguing against criticism of the organization, just against inclusion of sources that distort the actual events they purport to report upon.</p>
<p>I still don't find this article NPOV, and think it should be flagged and edited for NPOV. It reads like it was written by ACORN. I think it is an article that needs to be kept, but the part before criticism needs to be less of a hagiography. I'm going to tag it for NPOV. 65.96.190.185 01:09, 3 January 2006 (UTC)Charles, Jan 2, 2006</p>
<p>This article needs some major NPOV edits. As it currently stands, it reads like a PR brochure.</p>
<p>Some things to add: When seeking a referendum to raise California's minimum wage, ACORN hired paid petitioners to gather signatures. To reduce costs, ACORN filed suit to gain an exemption from California's minimum-wage and overtime laws.</p>
<p>Occurrences such as these should definitely be in there--made NPOV, of course, but still should be in there.</p>

<p>While I would agree that the bulk of this article would be better placed under a title "The History of ACORN," your nomination for deletion is absurd and offensive. I have not yet split the page into "ACORN" and "The History of ACORN" because I have not yet had the time for such a major undertaking.</p>
<p>I have been steadily improving the NPOV.</p>
<p>Almost all referendums use paid petitioners.</p>

<li>It is. Once an item is listed, it should stay. Usually, no one will object if the nominator removes the VfD tag in a landslide vote. No one else should, and, honestly, the nominator shouldn't, either. Let the 5 days go by. The tag will do no harm, and we won't forget to assess the votes properly.

If you wanted this article NPOVing you could have done it yourself, or brought it to people's attention in the usual way, but instead you tried to have it expunged from Wikipedia.

<li>1) No, I do not hold "extreme right-wing views", and I have no clue what gave you that idea. My ideology is very much NOT right-wing. 2) Your assertion notwithstanding, several people suggested to me that the only way to get attention brought to it to help clean it up was to list it on VfD, and following their suggestion, I did.

<li><b>Comment</b> I regret not knowing the etiquette, but I must say I disagree with it. There have been no delete votes (even the user who called the vote won't vote for deletion). There was no proper justification for the tag in the first place, and if we agree that VfD should not be used to draw attentiont to the page, then why do we reward those who would use it thus?

<dd>You may have a point here. If someone put a VfD tag on a big article like <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> (for example) it would be removed immediately, and there wouldn't be a five day debate on the matter. I don't think you need to worry about anyone being rewarded for misuse of VfD though. A string of "keep" votes shows the community's disapproval. The VfD banner will disappear from the article in a few days and then the important work of <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">NPOVing</a> can begin.

<p>I started reviewing this article and found that it needs a complete edit for NPOV. A lot of things presented as fact are claims by the organization, the overall tone is very much one of advocacy for the organization, and even the categories listing is a hodgepodge. Why on earth is this article in ALL of those categories, one or two would be nice.</p>
<p>I'm more than willing to have a crack at it but it's going to be a major undertaking and for me to detail each and every edit here in discussion before hand would be an endless task. So perhaps if I tackled the first couple of sections and then got response we could start there.</p>

<p>I had my first crack at revising the introduction which included properly distinguishing facts from claims made by the organization, and altering the "objectives" of ACORN to reflect their platform. I found no reference to immigration in their platform so that was completely removed.</p>
<p>I then moved on to the first section which is the founding of the organization ("ACORN takes root" was just way too flowery for me) and eliminated about 3 graphs of 60s history that really weren't relevent at all. Instead, I cut right to the chase regarding the group's founder and what his first actions were surrounding the founding of the organization.</p>
<p>I think you will find these revisions bring the tone much more into NPOV. BTW, the original piece was pretty much word for word form the group's website.</p>
<p>Comments welcome.</p>

<p>The ACORN website is not the end-all source of information on ACORN.</p>
<p>The People's Platform was last updated I think in 1992 or something.</p>
<p>If you need evidence of ACORN organizing around immigrant rights, or any other issue, provide your email and I'll send the text from a couple newspaper articles.</p>
<p>As I've previously stated, the history went up on the website only shortly before it went up on wikipedia. I am responsible for the original content of both. I made modest efforts to NPOV the article, but I think it makes more sense for others to do so, for obvious reasons. I will continue to make corrections as needed.</p>

<p>This paragraph under the "Allegations of voter registration misconduct" section seems non-NPOV to me:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>ACORN uses a comprehensive quality control program developed by Project Vote. Separate quality control staff visually review all collected registration applications and then call applicants to verify submitted information. ACORN maintains a zero-tolerance policy against fraud and, by implementing these procedures, is able to identify and terminate any employee submitting fraudulent registrations. This system was vindicated in the wake of the fraud allegations against ACORN as every single lawsuit against the organization was dismissed with prejudice and every single investigation cleared the organization of wrongdoing.</dd>

<p>The part I took on community organization is a theme throughout ACORN's publications that I have collected. I sense this is from their strong background in organized labor. The portion on community organization is directly from their website:</p>
<pre>
ACORN organizes the unorganized.
</pre>
<pre>
Although no stranger to coalition politics, ACORN's first priority is building organization in low-income communities. Because ACORN
believes that social change comes from the bottom up, organizers are on the streets every day, knocking on doors and recruiting new
members. Major campaigns, whether around housing, or jobs, or voter registration, are designed to reach the unorganized majority of low
and moderate-income people - the key constituency that must be mobilized for a progressive movement for social change in this country
to succeed
</pre>
<p>I still haven't found any reference to immigrant rights in any of their information or any news stories so oif you have something on that please provide a source and I won't object to it being listed but I don't see it listed as one of their goals.</p>

<p>I think someone should add a cited source to this. I'm sure theres a newspaper clipping or somthing. But it should be cited somehow.</p>

Being a progressive organization is not a controversy. I'm fine with there being a criticisms section, but only if there are actual criticisms.</p>
<p>"This organization did not love Reagan and yet they CLAIM to be non-partisan." does not count as controversy. Dig a little deeper, you'll find plenty to bash if you look hard enough.</p>

<p>Finally LegCircus, the community showed a CLEAR indication that this article needed to be rewritten with a NPOV. The History section you posted is WORD FOR WORD from ACORN's own history pages and obvioulsy not NPOV. Threatening to delete edits to present the other side of the facts and thus bring the article more into NPOV compliance is not very good etiquette. I encourage you to check out the <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">Be Bold Section</a> for some more guidance on this fact. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 00:24, 8 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>The link has been updated, it is now in the article itself. I also reworded the section concerning Dooley so that it is more clear he was indicted for forging signatures and not being paid to gather them. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 00:39, 8 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks! I still think it's invalid criticism, but now it's a slightly less invalid criticism.</p>
<p>However, regarding your link, I have little idea where you got the idea that these workers (who, by the way, had been on staff less than 2 months) organized with SEIU. I believe this to be false. The linked pdf mentions SEIU only once, and from what I gathered, it was indicating that the ACORN staff had met with an SEIU staffer so that the 3 of them could form a union of organizers. ACORN and SEIU work together closely, and in some cases share office space.</p>
<ul>
<li>You say you don't know where I got the idea from and then point out that they are listed in the NLRB decision. The decision clearly states the petitioners (the three employees who filed with the NLRB) were from the Dallas ACORN office and met with a tenant next to the ACORN offices which was the SEIU. I don't have anything to prove, it's right there in the NLRB decision. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 02:56, 8 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think you'll find that the IWW is the group these organizers sought to affiliate with. What deadline will you give yourself to prove it? <a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegCircus_2b0d.html" title="User:LegCircus">LegCircus</a> 01:09, Sep 8, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Fair enough, I changed the article to reflect that they first met with SEIU and then IWW, both are mentioned in the NLRB decision. I'm sure this makes a big difference in ACORN circles seeing as the founder is closely tied with SEIU but the fact remains, the initial organizing talks in the Dallas office were with SEIU members. Leave me out of the union politics, I really don't care and SEIU is, one last time and by your own admission, named in the NLRB decision. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 02:56, 8 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>I've completed my revision of the article to bring it more into NPOV. I have tried to condense the article choosing to hit on the organization's major accomplishments and initiatives.</p>
<p>In keeping with an NPOV view I saw the need to introduce a category for controversies or criticism of ACORN. I knew absolutely nothing about this organization before I undertook the revision and have researched the ACORN website, news articles, press releases, and any other sources I could find in trying nto give the article NPOV and that included criticisms since, again, I knew nothingn of them.</p>
<p>As part of my research I did confirm ACORN's recent activity concerning illegal (or undocumented if you want to be PC) workers. I found it interesting that although President Bush has been very vocal in calling for amnesty for current undocumented workers I couldn't find a single press release or article where ACORN supported the president's position. Instead, all I found was sharp criticism of the president on education reform particularly No Child Left Behind and added a section on that.</p>
<p>If you look at articles where ACORN has been quoted and their press releases they have been extremely critical of the president (and, FYI, I'm a Libertarian so criticizing the president is nothing new for me although I certainly applaud his amnesty initiative). However, I found it odd that they wouldn't support him on this point. The education attacks certainly raised some questions in my mind regarding ACORN's ties to organized labor. These ties go back to the founding of the organization and obviously are very deep today.</p>
<p>I tried to bring this out as a counter-point to the group without taking a position on it. Most articles I found critical of ACORN considered ACORN almost in the same breath as organized labor.</p>
<p>So, I am hopeful the revisions will be welcomed, they have been grand in scale yet I feel I have accurately hit upon many of the organizations key issues and accomplishments while trying to remain neutral.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../a/c/o/ACORN_20d0.html" title="ACORN">ACORN</a> page got shreaded. About two thirds of the article was deleted, and a bogus criticisms section was added. A lot of the work done was good, helpful work, but too much was deleted for no good reason.

<li>Leg -- go back and read all the comments from the VFD action. Almost all of them reference that quite obvioulsy the article was bloated and needed NPOV revisions. That's exactly what I did. This is an encyclopedia, not a vanity page for any group that wants to put them up. There's a link to ACORN if people want your exhaustive history of the organization with its biased (understandably so) point of view. I think you have a general lack of understanding of what this is about.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As far as my edits, there isn't some prize for number of edits. It seems to me since you can't disprove the facts I've presented backing the information you've resorted to ad hominem attacks (you don't have many edits). You don't know who I am or what my accomplishments are. In fact, your posting reminds me of many a cub reporter's cry when his 60 inch article went under the editor's blade. I personally think it's a great article now with a lot of information on the organization and its accomplishments.</li>

<p>No, actually I think the stuff you back up is good. Part of the problem is you don't go back and erase the misinformed opinions, and when I do point out false information, you don't change it (as with SEIU). You assume that I've an agenda other than to provide an article about a community organization I am part of.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once again, by your own admission SEIU is referenced in the NLRB decision, go read it again. I didn't come up with a union off the top of my head, they are in there as the FIRST group that the petitioners in the NLRB case contacted. There's nothing misleading in there at all, it says they talked with SEIU and then IWW, what the heck is the major hangup here? Have I offended some SEIU sensibilities? Are you an SEIU member Leg?</li>

<dd>The article needed some NPOVing because it drew heavily from material on the organisation's website and as such was not neutral. It needed cleanup for the same reasons — the tone and wording was appropriate for a piece put out by the organisation, but in places didn't seem right in an encyclopedia. What you appear to have done is cut out vast swathes of text and inserted a spurious and bloated "Controversy" section. Its content is telling: you have named the first subsection "Left-Wing Orientation" (sic, with regard to capitalisation of headings), as if there's something obviously objectionable about that. Facts such as the inclusion in <i>People's Platform</i> of advocacy of progressive taxation are presented as something the reader should shake their head in dismay at ("What a terrible thing to suggest! I'm glad this article shows these people for what they really are!") when really they belong in a section about ACORN's political positions. The only thing clearly worthy of inclusion in the controversy section is the apparent inconsistency of being supportive of unions while themselves trying to prevent their own employees from unionising (and can we have some good references in the news media for these allegations?). What you describe as NPOVing has gone too far — this is an entirely innocuous organisation now portrayed as something sinister. I hope agreement can be reached as we are all sane and civilised contributors and I trust no one wants an edit war. Nonetheless, some work will have to be done to redress the balance in this article. It's far from neutral at this point. — <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> <a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">(Talk)</a> 00:27, 9 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>It didn't "draw heavily" it was word for word from the website which LegCircus apparently has written for ACORN. That's fine, just don't publish the whole thing here as an entry reflecting an encyclopedia. I have no issue with the groups <i>People's Platform</i> and when I changed the introductory graph to draw more heavily on it LegCircus went back and changed it back to what he wrote which seems to be a hodgepodge of what he thinks ACORN is about. If you look at the platform some of what he mentioned isn't even in there and much of what is there isn't mentioned here. I think there should be a section of this article that covers the platform, it would make logical sense.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>So I'm to understand that you don't think the Voter Registration Misconduct controversies in New Mexico and Ohio are worthy to include in the controversy section? Despite that ACORN has admittedly terminated employees related to this and despite the fact one of its employees has since been indicted? You're assessment that the group is "totally innocuous" is your own personal opinion and has no basis in fact wahtsoever. Again, I knew nothing of this organization before I saw this article on the revision list, that's how I stumbled into it. The group has many positions that are extreme left wing (read the plank on taxation, we're talking about Robin Hood type philosophy which is their right to believe but obviously that's controversial).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The long and short of it is that this article, by many members who reviewed it before had major POV issues and was a PR piece for the organization. I trimmed the fluff, much of which was claiming victory after victory, if you read ACORN's website you would think they single handedly go the Motor Voter Act passed and that's hogwash. I removed claims that I couldn't find based in fact or where focused on the minutia of particular issues. I think the article nicely conveys the overall view of the organizatoin, I don't think it's slanted against it. Heck, I added the last section about their grassroots activism, their activity on undocumented workers, all the photos in the article. It needed a major revision and it got one, I'll let others decide on how fair it was. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 03:28, 9 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>First, I have stated here NUMEROUS times that SEIU is clearly cited in the NLRB decision yet LegCircus deletes the reference every time, this is plainly ridiculous. Why, I don't know, he won't say, he just deletes it. Also, I haven't seen any evidence the employees elected not to return but whether they did nor not is not germaine to the article.</p>
<p>Secondly, despite numerous news articles about the election registration controversy this section keeps getting deleted. <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;q=acorn+voter+registration&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;q=acorn+voter+registration&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. It's now back, new and improved with continuing developments regarding this issue.</p>
<p>There are numerous articles, there are court cases underway in Albuquerque and the New Mexico Supreme Court, an ACORN director took the 5th on the stand in the Albuquerque case, these issues are very germaine to the article. LegCircus continues to delete the references without a shred of reason as to why. If they are removed again, I will revert them again and escalate the matter further and seek to have this article moderated.</p>
<p>Finally, he's deciding for himself that this article doesn't need any NPOV work when obviously there are still disputed sections, I restored the tag.</p>
<p>BTW, for the most part I think the new section is quite good but needs some NPOV work, the language overall is just not very neutral (ACORN won this, fought that, etc).</p>

<p>The SEIU thing is just wrong.</p>
<p>As is the idea that ACORN is under investigation for voter fraud. Individuals are under investigation after being caught and turned in by ACORN. It's like saying that WalMart shoplifted $3 million dollars worth of merchandise, because you find that employee shoplifting at WalMart cost the company $3 million.</p>

As far as SEIU then I would urge ACORN to take it up with the NLRB, it's in the decision.</p>
<p>As far as the voter fraud issue (thank you for not removing it), by your logic then any mention of "Iran-Contra Hearings" should be removed from Wikipedia? I'm sure you would agree that would be ludicrous as is removing an issue where an ACORN director has taken the 5th Amendment.</p>

<p>LegCircus, once again you've deleted items that are factual and we've discussed a number of times. You have no justification for it. You also removed this article from the NPOV tag as well, which, quite obviously is still a problem.</p>

<p>The Arizona section was really confusing. The lawsuit was not about fraudlent registrations, those alleged registrations were used to show why registrants from canvassers should have to show ID. The source article was actually horrible, in that it was only slightly less convoluted than the Wikipedia page. I tried to clear up the relationships, but I'm a bit concerned that it's still too wordy. Also, does one really need to mention the party affiliation of the Sec State, Sec Elections, and local board in the lawsuit description?</p>

It's New Mexico and not Arizona, I corrected that. You got the SoS' name right though. Other than that thanks for tightening up my wording, made for a much easier read.</p>
<p>I restored the SEIU reference which I'm sure that LegCircus will delete when he sees it despite it's a point of fact in the NLRB decision.</p>
<p>A few Colorado voter registration fraud cases have been resolved so I updated that. I haven't seen any updates on the NM or OH cases. I readded the reference that these workers were paid for each voter registered, I think this is an important point and it very germane considering that was the sole nature of their employment and they have been accused or convicted of crimes concerning it.</p>
<p>There's a MD case that involves some embezzling of funds or misuse of funds but appears to be some political infighting, I didn't think it relevent to include at this piont.</p>

<p>The current version, while misleading, I think is okay a compromise to end the revert war. The quotes around field organizer are unneccessary and unencyclopedic.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The workers, all "field organizers" with ACORN, began discussions with the Service Employees International Union and later sought to organize under Industrial Workers of the World in response to their $16,000 annual salary for a 54-hour work week. The NLRB ordered the employees be reinstated in their former jobs and ACORN cease from interrogating employees about organizing activity.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the MD case all charges were dropped and an external audit revealed no misappropriation of funds.</p>

<p>This article is a mass of unsourced statements. I have added "citation needed" tags everywhere that something needs a source. I also added a notes section, and converted the two sources that did exist (NLRB decision and 2006 St. Louis fraud article). Those two are good examples of how everything else in this piece should be sourced. This needs a LOT of work. Before it becomes a problem, I would point out that statements on the ACORN website can be used as sources IF they are non-controversial claims about their own organization, such as who is the current president of ACORN. ACORN press releases can be used to source claims about ACORN, but not claims about anyone or anything else. Pretty much any other claim that someone might dispute has to be sourced by a third party secondary <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. - <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 15:03, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>So I kind of gave up on this page, since I feel the majority of people contributing to it have a decidely biased take on the organization. However, I am at a loss as to how to cite some of the places where self-proclaimed conservative activists have demanded citation (i.e. nearly every sentence in the piece).</p>
<p>For example the first sentence states, "ACORN is the largest . . ." This statement is verified by any number of US newspapers on just about any date of the year. How should I cite this?</p>

<dd>Well, either put in a reference to the newspaper article (a hint: SF Chronicle URLs live forever, even if they stop showing up on searches),or find an article which compares ACORN to similar groups which says that ACORN is the largest. There are plenty of references for all the sleazy things ACORN does which are mentioned in the article; you can copy the formatting of those if you're unfamiliar with Wikipedia citation style. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></small> 06:51, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Is the comment opening this section supposed to be some kind of personal attack against me? I'm the one who added quite a few cn tags. I was attempting to improve the article by bringing it into compliance with the sourcing and verifiability requirements of Wikipedia, without removing large sections of unsourced statements. LegCircus, you have answered your own question above. If it is so easy to source these claims by any newspaper on any day, then I suggest that you do so, rather than resorting to personal attacks against other editors. If you think my suggestions are stupid, then I will be hard assed and do what I should have done previously, and gut this article of anything that is unsourced and unverified. I consider myself reasonable and willing to work with people I don't agree with.

<li>OK, I'm calmed down now. FYI, if a single source can source the information in an entire paragraph, then there can be one cite at the end of the paragraph. I tagged each individual statement of fact needing a source, but that does not necessarily mean that each tag must be replaced with an individual cite. There were just a lot of claims in this article that weren't sourced at all.

<dd>Because OMG conservatives are not NPOV. ACVR in particular lacks objectivity, as well as credibility. For example, if the ACORN website claims that Senator Elizabeth Dole doesn't give a fuck about her constituents, that doesn't count as a citation on the Elizabeth Dole article. I have to find a neutral study that specifies in an non-biased manner exactly how Elizabeth Dole puts her own goals above the needs of her constituents, if I wish to include that statement in the Dole article. If any citation was acceptable, wikipedia would lose it's NPOV, as it's NPOV would be dependant on the decidedly partisan real world. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerimee_41b0.html" title="User:Jerimee">Jerimee</a> 21:37, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>As an eevil neocon, I am going to brush away teh hand of Rove in this instance, and agree with Jerimee that the AC4VR sources are probably being improperly used in this article, but for different reasons than Jerimee states. They are primary sources, and the information is all covered by the reliable secondary source that is cited at the end of the paragraph. Unless I'm missing something, there's no good reason to cite them there. However, it might be appropriate to include them in the external links section, unless there is some dispute over their authenticity. I think one link to the page at AC4VR that indexes all the documents would be sufficient. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 02:50, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>If AC4VR has provided reliable sources for their original research, why not use those sources directly, rather than via AC4VR? Is that what you meant? I feel the connection between AC4VR and ACORN is that AC4VR was founded to inhibit voter regsitration efforts, and ACORN engages in voter registration. Other than this, I see no reason to include them on this page at all. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerimee_41b0.html" title="User:Jerimee">Jerimee</a> 19:06, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No reputable source claims that ACORN, or any other entity, engages in voter registration fraud in order to produce fraudulent votes. Voter registration fraud occurs when workers feel that it will be easier to falsify voter registration documents, than to actually register voters. This is massively illegal, as well as being counter-productive, even without the resulting attacks by conservatives.</p>
<p>For ACORN members to have an impact on elections, more people have to actually vote. Registering them is the first step. When some idiot copies names out of a phonebook, this will not enable these people to actually vote. The idiot's purpose is not to influence any election, but to get out of 5 hours hard work actually talking to unregistered citizens. If someone writes your name on 16 registration forms, this doesn't help you to vote 16 times, if anything it can hurt your ability to vote at all. It is a serious problem, and it's result is NOT increased votes.</p>
<p>So the natural criticism is why in God's name does ACORN not screen these cards to check for fraud. ACORN does, and when fraud is found, those persons are turned over to the authorities. That's why you continue to hear about these idiots. The right then blames ACORN, not because they are opposed to ACORN preventing registration fraud, but because they are opposed to increased voter registration. AC4VR and like entities can't come out and say, we oppose voter registration, but they can muddy the waters in order to associate voter registration efforts with fraudulent voter registration.</p>
<p>Call up the political science professors at your local university or community colleges if you are interested. Or see if you can find any newspaper reports of the dead actually voting in any number that would have any remote chance to change any election. It's not that this would be easy to detect, it's that, if this occured, it would be apparent immediately.</p>
