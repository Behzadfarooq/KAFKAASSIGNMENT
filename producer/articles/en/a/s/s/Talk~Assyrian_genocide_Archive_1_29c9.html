<p>Can there really have been 750,000 Assyrians killed, if the Armenian genocide killed "only" a million? I'd like to see some references here. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 03:29, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The number of relocated people including Armenians (and supposedly Assyrians) in 1915 is being inflated since 1960s. It started with 200.000 and increased upto 1.5 million. The controversial claims also started to say that 1.5 million poeple perished. But recent documents revealed that the exact number of relocated people, including only Armenians was 924,158. The number of deaths is not known. At this point it is inaccurate to claim that a million people died. And it is also inaccurate to say 750.000 Assyrians were killed while there are no documents in non of the involved parties' archives. - <a href="../../../y/c/e/User%7EYce_5bbf.html" title="User:Yce">Cansın</a> 14 May 2005</p>

<dd>This is untry, Talaat numbers included only over 10 most populous cities, and converge with Cemal memopirs 1.5 million revacuated Armenians. Those excludes other peoples, Assyrians in fact, were even more undercounted than Armenians in Ottoman Statistics, for reasons that I would state later, but in any cases, numbers did not inflate in the 1960s. The 1.5 million deaths originate from German documents, not Armenians. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix">Fadix</a> 15:19, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix">Fadix</a>, Talat's notes are the first hand historical documents. And I am providing you the numbers of relocated Armenians from 18 cities he had recorded; Ankara-47.224, Erzurum-128.657, Adana-46.031, Bitlis-109.251, Halep-34.451, Bursa-66.413, Diyarbakir-61.002, Sivas-141.592, Trabzon-34.500, Elazig-74.206, Izmit-54.370, Samsun-26.374, Balikesir-8.290, Afyon-7.327, Kayseri-47.616, Maras-27.101, Nigde-5.101, Konya-4.381, Total:924.158. These are from written documents. Could you please provide the link (but an official resource, please) of the source you have used for 1.5 million? In his notes he had also written down the estimate of Armenian population in Ottoman Empire. According to his notes, by 1914 there were 1.187.818 Gregorian Armenians, 63,967 Catholic Armenians are living in the Empire and the total number was 1.256.403. He also added that there might be an error and he estimated the total population approximately as 1.500.000 which matches with Britain archives. I can also give the detailed demography of Armenian population according to his notes. And another record from his notes; after the relocation, the number of the Armenian orphans was 10.314 mostly in Halep who were later given to Turkish families in order to be brought up. He noted that after the relocation the number of the Armenians who were living in the cities, to which relocation policy had been applied, was 284.157. He also noted that there might be errors and he estimated the number as 250.000 to 400.000 (After the relocation). Besides, according to the Ottoman archives (mostly telgrams), the relocation policy was not applied to any other Christian rather than Armenians. Those, who did not obey this policy and tried to apply it to other Christians were harshly punished by Ottoman government itself. I am not a historian and my major is totally different. I cannot devote myself to these discussions, since I cannot spend effort to make an extensive research on the events. However, I believe, as the administrators your main duty should be to evaluate the historical documents of both sides. I believe you are only under the influence of very biased or one sided figures. I wish you become more neutral and more open in evaluation of this matter. --<a href="../../../y/c/e/User%7EYce_5bbf.html" title="User:Yce">Cansın</a> 23.09, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../y/c/e/User%7EYce_5bbf.html" title="User:Yce">Cansın</a>, you have converted this article from one that seems exagerated to one that almost suggests that nothing untoward happened. Neither point of view can be considered neutral. Accurate information on these events is difficult to come by. The best thing to do, for now, is to compromise. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 19:33, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a>, I disagree that the changed atricle suggests nothing happened. The references over this issue even on the web is unreliable and insufficient. Some Syrians even claim that "Assyrian" name was adopted by European missionaries which was wrong(according to some Syrians) and actually so called Assyrian people are Syrians. Currently, there is a big population of Assyrians in Syria and northern Iraq. However "genocide" claims have never been credited and internationally yet discussed nor disputed. The only well-established history regarding the events in 1915 is the uprising of Assyrians against Ottoman government alongside with Britain. The biggest mistake, which is usually made (intentionally or not), is the easy use of the word "genocide". Official UN documents recognize only one Holocaust; Jewish Holocaust. There are folders among UN documents with the names of Rwandan Genocide, Bosnian Genocide, Cambodia Genocide, Paraguay Genocide, however none of them are recognized as "genocide" yet due to the ongoing trials of the defendants. There is one folder with the name of "Armenian problem" however UN genocide convention does not recognize it as "genocide" as well. But at least Armenian claims are internationally disputed, recognized by some parliaments(even it sounds funny and too much political to me, since if there is no court decision noone can claim any defendant is guilty) and discussions over the issue is ongoing unlike the Assyrian claims. --<a href="../../../y/c/e/User%7EYce_5bbf.html" title="User:Yce">Cansın</a> 14 May 2005</dd>

<p>If you added the word <i>controversial</i> three times to an article as short as this, would it not suggest that you were making a point. <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a> is a binding policy: the point of view of the Assyrians and Syriani cannot just be overwritten. I felt the article as was, originally written by an Assyrian, was too one sided, but I believe that there should be balanced. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 21:56, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dear <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a>, I wish you had shown the same sensitivity to neutrality when a Assyrian had written the previous version also acknowledged by you as <b>too one-sided</b>. I am not really sure about your suggestions on how to make it more balanced. By the way you are right about your point on the use of "controversial", I am removing them since "claims" is enough. --<a href="../../../y/c/e/User%7EYce_5bbf.html" title="User:Yce">Cansın</a> 22.05, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for lightening the tone of the article. I can assure you that I did speak to the original author, and have felt it necessary to revert some POV edits made in this and other articles. I don't claim to be neutral, but I desire to be. The official line of the Turkish government needs to be heard as well as the claims of Assyrians. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 12:38, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Discussion</span></h3>
<p>Mr. Coolcat, exactly why did you move the article from Assyrian Genocide to Assyrian Massacres? And why did you violate Wikipedias policies by doing it unilaterally? I have requested that the article should be moved back, until you archieve a concensus for a move. Anyway, I for one strongly oppose any move of the page as the subject discussed in the article clearly is an 'Assyrian Genocide'. Another fact is that Assyrian Genocide seems to be the most widely used term for the events discussed in this article. Google give me only 115 hits on 'Assyrian Massacres' <a href="http://www.google.dk/search?hl=da&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Ada-DK%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22Assyrian+Massacres%22&amp;btnG=S%C3%B8g&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.dk/search?hl=da&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Ada-DK%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22Assyrian+Massacres%22&amp;btnG=S%C3%B8g&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and no less than 956 when searching for 'Assyrian Genocide' <a href="http://www.google.dk/search?hl=da&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Ada-DK%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22Assyrian+Genocide%22&amp;btnG=S%C3%B8g&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.dk/search?hl=da&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Ada-DK%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22Assyrian+Genocide%22&amp;btnG=S%C3%B8g&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStereotek_fc8d.html" title="User:Stereotek">Stereotek</a> 18:57, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">My take before I vote</span></h3>
<p>First of, the figure presented for the number of Victims does not make sense,(it is too absolute) in fact, it is more difficult to estimate the Assyrian losses than the Armenian losses.</p>
<p>Second of, while I agreed that the Assyrian massacres/genocide should have it's entry, I doubt it now, maybe what happened in Iraq in the 30s could have its own entry, but what happened in the last year of the Ottoman era, can not, in my opinion have its own entry.</p>
<p>This is why I believe this: What happened to the Assyrians is mentioned in most cases and Western works as a componment of the Armenian genocide, while I disagree with this, I believe articles should converge... on what most says, regardless of if its the truth or not. Because people should know how really positions are presented in the real world.</p>
<p>For those reason, I believe that the main page, should be added in the Armenian genocide entry, and that other entries regarding the Assyrian population estimates, and losses should be build. Much like the Holocaust entry that does not only include Jewish deaths.</p>
<p>Many officials in the Ottoman could even not make the differences between Assyrians and Armenians, in the East, both communities were so closer with eachothers.</p>
<p>That there is to be no Assyrian main page, can be compensated by the fact that there is much more visitor in the Armenian genocide entry, which makes justice to the victims.</p>
<p>But if that was to happen, the article already there, is not a Wiki article, and lack many important parts. I propose myself to marge the Assyrian cases in the Armenian genocide entry, and change the Armenian genocide timeline in a new entry, to save place for this new change.</p>

<dd>First of all, when I first moved the "Assyrian Genocide" to "Assyrian Massacres", I didn't know about the Wiki policies. I apologize if I did it in wrong way.

Assyrian page can be merged with Armenian page based on the fact that the historical documents about the Assyrians are vague and there can not be a well established history according to google hits. --<a href="../../../y/c/e/User%7EYce_5bbf.html" title="User:Yce">Cansın</a> 19.27, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since when does a genocide must be recognized by countries? Moreover, unlike the armenians the Assyrians are a very weak people and therefore cannot 'lobby' their cause. Mass killing occured against this people so it's a genocide.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Suggested move: Sayfo</span></h2>
<p>Since the dreadful events described in this article affected a people that have a variety of ways to call themselves (Arameans, Assyrians, Chaldeans, Suryoyo), I suggest to move the page to "Sayfo", since this is the name under which it is quite generally known among the people concerned (also Saypâ, Saypo), and to a growing extent also among people with a different background, that's at least my impression.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are some difficulties in terminology. <i>Sayfo</i> is readily understood in West Syriac communities, but I'm not sure how widespread the use of the alternative pronunciation <i>Saypâ</i> is among East Syriacs. The name <i>Assyrian</i> is difficult because it was a label used by many of those killed at the time of the massacres, and it still hasn't widespread support among their descendents. Perhaps we should take note that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Holocaust_8edb.html" title="The Holocaust">the Holocaust</a> is not headed <i>Ha-Shoah</i> in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 20:17, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Or do you have a better alternative? In the end, <i>Assyrian genocide</i> is not acceptable.

<p>I have moved this page from Assyrian Genocide to Syriac Genocide. I know this is a very sensitive topic, prone to edit wars, but the page title could in my opinion not be continued.

<p>A lot of people doesnnt know what Syriac is. Most think of it as a language, and again it is a language. Syriacs, Chaldeans, Arameans, Assyrians are all the same people and everyone knows that.

<p>The word "alleged" imediately makes a fact look like it is false, or at least dubious. Fotr example the British comedy show "Have I Got News For You" can make ludicrous comments and "news" reports every week, so long as they slip a couple of "allegedly" words in, and thus can't be sued. If I were to say that somebody was "allegedly" a bestiality-loving serial killer and child rapist, it wouldn't be defamation or slander because the word "alleged" makes it look untrue, or at least biased. Thus the word "alleged" in this article is in fact pro-Turkey and thus biased. I suggest removing the highly controversial "alleged" words, and sticking the "totaly disputed" tag on top, until such time as THAT can be removed, and the undeniable fact of the Genocide can be accepted by certain people.....

Its like some Italian in America likes to call himself American, but not Italian - it doesn't stop him being under the number of Italians in American. Go to any part of of Iraq (were the majority of Chaldean reside,) they don't deny being Assyrian. They see themselfs as Assyrian first, before Catholic.</dd>
<dd>Syriac is not a ethnicity. It is a term to coin Assyrians and Meronites, since Meronites don't like to be called arab, and preffer Syriac. As far as I can remember, <b>no Meronite were massacred.</b> It was only Assyrians in what is today Turkey and Iran.</dd>
<dd>"the name is not unanimously supported by scientists " - Prove it. The people you metioned are Europeans/Westerners. We have to remember that we are talking about an event that occured in the ME. And we have to listen to ME "scientists" first, before Westerners, Specially the ones that witnessed it/was part of their time. If you have no source, your not credable.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In conclusion, I would only aprove the term "Syriac Genocide" if Meronites were massacred in a genocide way too (in terms of the numbers and the way they were killed.) <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaldean_d16d.html" title="User:Chaldean">Chaldean</a> 18:47, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am still waiting for you to show me any person that calls himself Aramean. I call myself Chaldean, but that doesn't replace my ethnicity. How come the Armenian genocide isn't called the "Armenian Orthodox" Genocide?</p>

<dd>This has nothing to do with what we're talking here: Armenian, Assyrian and Greek civilian populations were massacred, deported and again massacred or starved to death in 1915-1918 by the Ottoman army under the <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Turks_61fd.html" title="Young Turks">Young Turks</a> regime for political (<a href="../../../p/a/n/Panturkism.html" title="Panturkism">panturanism</a>) and strategic (they were considered as a <a href="../../../f/i/f/Fifth_column.html" title="Fifth column">fifth column</a>) reasons, their genocide(s) (I'd rather think there was only one genocide including all of them) was the result of a deliberate policy. Whereas the famine in Lebanon during the WWI killed people of all creeds and ethnicities. As for the pre-WWI massacres of Maronites (reciprocal massacres of Maronites and Druzes) they should be addressed to in the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Lebanon_a9de.html#Sectarian_conflict:_European_Powers_begin_to_intervene" title="History of Lebanon">History of Lebanon#Sectarian conflict: European Powers begin to intervene</a> section.

<p>There are plenty of people who call themselves "Arameans", "Aramaeans", "Aramäer", "Araméens", or "Arameeërs". Don't turn a blind eye to this fact, no matter how many "scientists" state otherwise. It cannot and should not be denied that they also belong to the people who suffered so bitterly, especially in the year 1915.

<p>1. Nobody calls themselfs aremean. 2. Suryoye is used mostly by despora Meronites who do not wish to be called arabs, and despora Assyrians, Chaldeans, people of the Syrian Orthodox church who want to be united politically. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaldean_d16d.html" title="User:Chaldean">Chaldean</a> 20:49, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>(answer to <a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a>)</i> The only problem, again, is that for religious and political reasons some activists and clerics, mostly belonging to the (very small) Syriac Orthodox church whose Patriarchal see is in Damascus (in Syria, whose governemnt is Arab nationalist and not respectful of non-Arab minorities), try to favorize the use of "Syriacs" (which is only a religious denomination) or "Arameans" (which is a linguistic, not an ethnic, denomination). <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaldean_d16d.html" title="User:Chaldean">Chaldean</a> is right, "Arameans" is only used here in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany by the medias and by some activists (because it stresses the fact that they speak "the language of Christ"). Among themselves, they identify as members of the Syriac Orthodox Chruch (<i>süryani</i> in Turkish) and as Christians. You must also keep in mind that if they migrated towards Western Europe, that's mostly because they were caught between the Turkish army and the Kurdish insurgents, most of their families were very rural, many didn't even speak Turkish, they were not political activists, just refugees from a region where a civil war was going on, in which they were no active part, only "collateral damages". Many of them don't want to have any part in politics, even at the local level here in Belgium (there's only one municipal councillor from their community, and he's become quite controversial lately because of a chuchr dispute over the designation of a new bishop next Sunday in Brussels). --Pylambert 13:59, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's not true. <i>Süryani</i> doesn't mean "Syriac Orthodox", it is the Turkish equivalent (originally Arabic) of the self-appellation <i>Suryoye</i> (West Syrian pronunciation) or <i>Suryāye</i> (as pronounced by East Syrians), and has for centuries been translated as "Syrians".</dd>

<dd>Benne, you are simply not right. I have asked you to show me people in the middle east that call themselfs aramean, and you have not. And even if they did, nothing justfying changing the title of a event out of nowhere because of some people decided to call themselfs something different. Throughout history, the event was never called Sayfo or Syriac genocide. It has always been the Assyrian genocide. Plain it simple. You can't change history for your own interest. You know what would be neutral? Calling all of the genocide of armenians, assyrians and greeks "Asia Minor Holocoast." But it didnt happen, and historians and the people of that time decided differently. They choose the Armenian Geonocide and Assyrian Genocide. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaldean_d16d.html" title="User:Chaldean">Chaldean</a> 20:23, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

You can call yourself whatever you want, you can't change your ethnicity. And I once again state the most important part of this whole debate: <b>these terms of armeans or syriacs are not found in present day Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Syria.

the empire did not promise an independent state, they called for jihad and the protection of islamic soil, kurds joined in and fought alongside turks the empire was weak and fought only for their survival , kurds were considered as loyal and good troops the role of the kurds in otoman history is not known enough , kurds played a big role in fighting off shia incursions from persia , and prpotecting the land against the imperial russian army the kurdish lords were in fact independent states under otoman supremacy , until the otoman empire made the first contract with german weapon companies, a lot of the weapons were in fact produced by kurds and kurdistan or kurdish areas were home to over 700 fortresses , kurdish tribal armies fought sometimes by themself against invading iranian armies and onetime they even invaded baghdad and azerbaijan atatürk or the young turks talked about turkey , being the country of kurds and turks , it was until turkey was independence , and the state strong enough to centralize power , that they forbid kurdish language and everything kurdish to create a new upper identy , turkish modelled after italy and france that is why , today there is no enough resarch about it , they did not promise an independent state but an equal state , in which bote people can live that is why , the turkish liberation war should be called , kurdish-turkish liberation war kurds were the only non turkish population group fighting to the end alongsode turks and until turkey was independence</p>

It seems the article has already portrayed the Assyrian experience as an uncontestable example of genocide, but I would like to see proof of this. --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 19:50, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As someone wrote it here, it would be more inclusive to say "Asia Minor genocide", or "genocide of the Anatolian Christians". But as Armenians pushed for its recognition as the "Armenian genocide", others, like the Assyrians and the Pontic Greeks, didn't have the choice and used their ethnonyms to name "their" genocide. The recognition of the Armenian genocide is in reality inclusive of the two other ones, they're not distinct. --Pylambert 20:23, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree there, the Military tribunal has not equated Christians with Armenians. Also, the Assyrian genocide term is much too vague, does it exclude what happened in Iraq in the 30s? For many reasons, that was why I already proposed in the past to move it in a section of the Armenian genocide article, because it is hardly quoted in books alone but nearly always reffered in works covering the Armenian genocide. The Pontus Greeks tragedy on the other hand can be separated and is isolated by its specific date.</dd>

<dd>Exactly, its not like the Armenians genocide and the assyrian genocide were to different events at two different locations. Almost all Assyrians villages had population of Armenian. It was a selfish mistake by the armenians to do what they did, but what can we do know? Assyrian people reffer to it now as the assyrian genocide and armenians call theirs armenian genocide. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaldean_d16d.html" title="User:Chaldean">Chaldean</a> 22:11, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What you call selfishness does not originate from Armenians, the Germans isolated the Armenian cases, so as the allies, so as the Military tribunal, some like Nogales does sometimes use the term Christians, but still isolate the Armenians. This can be compared with the Holocaust, which generally refers to the destruction of the European Jews, but may also includes the Gypises even thought some Uniqueness pushers like Lewy will object to such an inclusion. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 02:54, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Official sources within the <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syriac_Orthodox_Church_7abe.html" title="Syriac Orthodox Church">Syriac Orthodox Church</a> always use <i>Sayfo</i> (which is translated <i>sword</i>), and I believe that the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_Church_of_the_East_3c63.html" title="Assyrian Church of the East">Assyrian Church of the East</a> officially refers to the genocide as <i>Qatel d'Ama Aturaya</i> (which is translated <i>Assyrian genocide</i>). So, the official, church sources use different names. Technically, anything other than these is a new coinage.

<dd>Maybe a more general article over ethnic and religious cleansing, massacres and genocides in the late Ottoman Empire, including Armenians, Pontic Greeks and the various Neo-Aramaic Christian speakers, but also Yazidis and some others. Anyway, there are historical and legal definitions of what can be called a genocide and we're dealing here with a mix of ethnic and religious cleansing, massacres and genocides. The article should also include more about the instrumentation of the various minorities in the Ottoman Empire by the Great Powers of the time, who are ultimately not quite innocent in these matters: Russia and the UK ("Assyrian levies"), but also France ("bataillon assyro-chaldéen" created in 1921 in the French Mandate in Syria) used all these people like France did in Algeria with Harkis or Israel with the the South Lebanon Liberation Army, or the USA with the Montagnards/Hmongs in Indochina. --Pylambert 14:33, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, it should be changed and all references to "Syriacs" replaced by "Assyrians", with an introductory note saying that the term Assyrians here includes all Neo-Aramaic speaking Christians, regardless of their church denominations. And the page should be protected just afterwards against any new attempt to move/rename it, and against its modification by not-registered (IP) users. After that, it'll be time to merge the Syriacs, Chaldeans, Assyro-Chaldeans and Assyrian people articles in one same article Assyrian people with the same introductory note, and protect all four pages against attempt to move/rename them (or recreate them under "Syriac people", "Chaldean people" or "Assyro-Chaldean peopl", "Chaldeo-Assyrian people" or "Chaldoassyrian people"). A third step will be to suppress the Syriacs box, there's already a category:Assyrians, that's enough. We need to move on, it is not a question of democracy, but of accuracy and of respect towards the students and other lay users of wikipedia, who are presently deceived by all these erroneous articles. --Pylambert 10:32, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that this article needs a LOT of improvement in the way it's written. I quickly went through it yesterday and today, and tried to remove the most obvious ones. There's still a lot of language mistakes, spelling mistakes, etc. There also is a lot of repetition (e.g. it gives some background info, and then says that the people were massacred over and over and over again). For example, the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> article doesn't tell the 10 000 different incidents, but just the general info. I think that it's enough if just the general info is told, and not a story of every time 60+ people were killed. Even after reading the article, I don't really get what happened. The article just doesn't tell the big picture of things. It's like... it's the same if in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> there were descriptions of each battle, but no text of the big picture, like "Operation Barbarossa", "D-day", "Pacific theater", etc. Also, there's way too many long quotes.
