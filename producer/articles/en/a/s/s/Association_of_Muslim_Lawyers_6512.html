<p>The <b>Association of Muslim Lawyers</b> ("the <i>AML</i>") has been active since <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> and since its official launch in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a> its membership and influence have been steadily growing. The various talks, seminars, conferences and careers workshops organized by AML since its inception have helped bring Muslim lawyers together - both professionally and socially - and have helped them to help not only the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_in_the_United_Kingdom_642f.html" title="Islam in the United Kingdom">Muslim community</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, but also society as a whole.</p>

<p>The AML logo features the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_alphabet.html" title="Arabic alphabet">Arabic letters</a> <i>alif, 'ayn, mim, lam</i>. From these four letters, four key words can be derived&#160;:</p>
<p><i>ayn mim lam</i>: (noun) meaning 'action'<br />
<i>alif mim lam</i>&#160;: (noun) meaning 'hope'<br />
<i>alif ayn mim lam</i>&#160;: (verb, imperative) meaning 'do' or 'act' (appears twice in the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a>&#160;: 34.11, 41.5).<br />
<i>alif ayn mim lam</i>&#160;: (noun, plural) meaning 'actions' (appears four times in the Qur'an&#160;: 10.41, 23.100, 27.19, 46.15).<br /></p>
<p>Thus the meaning of the <i>AML</i> Logo is&#160;: <i>Act with hope</i> â€“ and this is what its members seek to do.</p>

<p>The main aims and objectives of <i>AML</i> are&#160;:</p>
<ul>
<li>To promote the provision of <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_advice.html" title="Legal advice">legal advice</a> and assistance to anyone in need of justice, irrespective of their <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationality.html" title="Nationality">nationality</a>, <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnicity.html" title="Ethnicity">ethnic</a> or <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race.html" title="Race">racial origins</a>, colour, <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender.html" title="Gender">gender</a>, or <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religious beliefs</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To promote the legal rights of Muslims and the availability of advice in accordance with the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shari%27ah.html" title="Shari'ah">Shari'ah</a> of Islam.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To promote research into both the Shari'ah and <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_law.html" title="English law">English law</a> with regard to specific social, political and legal issues, and to hold seminars and publish the results of any such research.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To facilitate the achievement of a fair and just society by means such as increasing understanding, educating and lobbying.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To facilitate entry into the legal profession for men and women, and to assist them in the furtherance of their legal development.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To liaise and co-operate with any other individuals or organizations who are willing and able to assist in the realization of these Objectives.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To do all such things as shall be conducive to the attainment of the above.</li>
</ul>
<p>In seeking to realize these aims and objectives the Association of Muslim Lawyers not only facilitates contact between Muslim lawyers and with Muslims, but also works with many other organisations and institutions, including for example, the Union of Muslim Organisations, the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim_Council_of_Britain_00a5.html" title="Muslim Council of Britain">Muslim Council of Britain</a>, Muslim Lawyers (Europe), the Minority Lawyers Conference, the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commission_for_Racial_Equality_d313.html" title="Commission for Racial Equality">Commission for Racial Equality</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_Hall_1d00.html" title="City Hall">City Hall</a>, the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Office_c781.html" title="Home Office">Home Office</a>, the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a> and the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Lords_efb8.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a>. During 2005 a series of seminars jointly organised by the <i>AML</i> and the <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_Society_d4fc.html" title="Law Society">Law Society</a> were held at the <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_Society_d4fc.html" title="Law Society">Law Society</a> in Chancery Lane, London.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_of_Muslim_Lawyers_6512.html" title="Edit section: Lobbying for protection of muslims in the UK">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Lobbying for protection of muslims in the UK</span></h2>
<p>One of the main issues about which <i>AML</i> has been advising and lobbying for several years is the lack of protection afforded to Muslims under English domestic law. Until the <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_3.html" title="December 3">3 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, anyone in the UK was free to subject a Muslim to abuse and discriminatory treatment simply because he or she is a Muslim with impunity. The <a href="../../../e/m/p/Employment_Equality_Regulations_64b3.html" title="Employment Equality Regulations">Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003</a> are now in force and afford some protection from religious discrimination in the work place. This development in the law has been due more to the implementation of the Employment Directive adopted under Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty in November 2000 than as a result of AML's efforts!</p>
<p><a name="Other_activity" id="Other_activity"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_of_Muslim_Lawyers_6512.html" title="Edit section: Other activity">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Other activity</span></h2>
<p>In all other spheres of life, including the provision of services, education and housing, religious discrimination is still not illegal. Representatives of the <i>AML</i> made detailed submissions to the House of Lords Select Committee on Religious Offences (whose report was published on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_10.html" title="June 10">10 June</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>) who declined to make any recommendation that Muslims should be protected by law from incitement to religious hatred or by an updated law of blasphemy which would apply just as much to Muslims as to Christians. This matter is currently being debated in the Houses of Parliament.</p>
<p>Some bodies, such as for example the Commission for Racial Equality and the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar_Council_c136.html" title="Bar Council">Bar Council</a>, realising that there exist serious lacunae in the law, have written into their codes of practice an all encompassing anti-discrimination policy which includes the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion as well as of race, sex and disability. After several requests by AML spanning a period of several years and spurred on by the Employment Directive, the Law Society reviewed and extended its anti-discrimination rule to include discrimination on the grounds of religion.</p>
<p>By virtue of the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights_4a1c.html" title="European Convention on Human Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</a> and the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_Rights_Act_1998_1431.html" title="Human Rights Act 1998">Human Rights Act 1998</a>, the government is under a duty, by passing secondary legislation, to secure the basic rights of freedom of religion, freedom to practise one's religion and freedom to educate one's children in accordance with one's religion. Until recently, all political parties were united in attempting to pretend that religious discrimination is synonymous with racial discrimination, even though this is clearly not true â€“ but now that the Muslim block vote can affect the outcome of both local and national elections, their leaders are beginning to adopt a more pragmatic approach and it is hoped that they may take the duty required by the Convention more seriously in the future.</p>
<p>The <i>AML</i> (UK) is also in contact with Muslim Lawyers (Europe) and the Protect-Hijab Campaign regarding the illegal infringement of Muslims' rights in Europe by state governments â€“ including <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> â€“ whose hijab bans are in blatant contravention of European Muslims' Article 9 and Article 14 European Convention Human Rights.</p>
<p>A more long term aspect of this initiative to have Muslims' rights legally recognised in practice as well as in theory has been the proposal that Muslim personal law should be recognised by English domestic law, so that Muslim marriages and divorces are recognised as legally valid â€“ and the estates of Muslims who die without leaving a Will are automatically distributed in accordance with the Shariâ€˜a , not the laws of intestacy. This means that the decisions of properly constituted Shari â€˜a courts will have to be recognised by the English civil courts as being legally binding and enforceable in the civil courts. In effect this mechanism will be another form of Alternative Dispute Resolution which should serve to lessen the workload of the civil courts.</p>
<p>In the meantime <i>AML</i> has been active in encouraging Muslims to make Islamic Wills which are valid as regards the technical requirements of English law and which stipulate that their wealth is to be divided in accordance with the Shariâ€˜a after they have died. As part of this initiative <i>AML</i> has also been involved in training lawyers who wish to provide an Islamic Wills service.</p>
<p>The disturbing development of individual, group and state terrorism in recent years has resulted in a significant erosion in civil liberties and an abandonment of due process worldwide, even by those governments who claim to be the guardians of civilisation and the rule of law. It is becoming more common for people to be arrested on mere suspicion and detained indefinitely without charge or trial or even access to a lawyer, even in the United Kingdom and especially in the alleged â€˜land of the free', America. Clearly organisations such as the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Human_Rights_Commission_4602.html" title="Islamic Human Rights Commission">Islamic Human Rights Commission</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberty.html" title="Liberty">Liberty</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/n/Amnesty_International_6202.html" title="Amnesty International">Amnesty International</a> are better equipped and have more resources at their disposal to monitor and publicise the worst abuses in the hope that those responsible will not be allowed to get away with murder. However <i>AML</i> has also formed its own Working Party on Human Rights and Civil Liberties whose members are doing what they can to help those who are oppressed by arbitrary and unjust laws using legitimate means.</p>
<p>In conclusion, <i>AML</i> provides services across the board, not just to ethnic minorities. Some of its members and beneficiaries, for example, belong to a religious minority within a racial majority, that is to say, they are Anglo-Saxon Muslims! Its members and beneficiaries are predominantly Muslims, but also include non-Muslims, and <i>AML</i> has members and beneficiaries from virtually all ethnic groups, however large or small. <i>AML</i> is primarily involved in all issues relating to the basic duties and rights of British Muslims - and accordingly its objectives are social, educational and charitable as well as political, with the overriding imperative that human beings should be treated with due respect and justice, whatever their racial background and, even more importantly, whatever their religious beliefs.</p>
<p>In formulating appropriate policies it is important to distinguish between tolerant integration and forced assimilation. Much can be learned, for example, from the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Spain_033d.html" title="History of Spain">history of Spain</a>. At one point in time Muslim, Christian and Jewish communities lived side by side for centuries in relative harmony, each community self-governing in respect of its personal law and settlement of internal disputes â€“ because the law of the land recognised diversity. At another point, thousands of people were slaughtered and thousands more forced to flee for their lives â€“ because the law of the land required blind conformity.</p>
<p>In our current multi-cultural, multi-racial, multi-religious society, it is important that the lessons of history can be applied wisely by allowing people to be different, within reason. As far as religious groups are concerned, this can best be achieved by not only granting them equal rights under the law, but also ensuring that these rights are secured by the law, so that they can be exercised under the law with the full protection of the law.</p>
