<p>I think the correct definition for Asshole when described to a personality type should be: Anyone who enjoys giving bad news. Just to say somebody you do not like is and asshole is bogus. Assholes have a useful place in society and should be given some respect. I can say this with authority because I suffer from ass-a-hole-ism. ````Markymarky</p>

<p>Sometimes I feel like saying this to people who are loudly shifting the blame, like that drunk guy on BART who was ranting about some woman who didn't treat him like he wanted to be treated. On the other hand, this is a self-deprecating question that one may apply to oneself all too often, if one is chronically melancholy. Strange that the human society has room for these opposites: Them that say, "It's all, always, all my fault," and them what says "It's anyone's-but-mine fault!" Two very different ways of being in the center of the universe. There are probably lots of ways of being in the happy middle on this one.</p>

<dd>Among fans of American professional wrestling (mainly WWE) assclown has become extremely popular due to Chris Jericho's use of the word in his promos. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarryl_Hamlin_f0c9.html" title="User:Darryl Hamlin">Darryl Hamlin</a> 07:09, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It'd be better if the usr/bin/w00t link actually went to a strip which used the word "asshat".</p>
<p>"Asshat" may have an origin (or at least a source of popularization) in dialogue from the Coen brothers' film Raising Arizona (1987), where Gayle says (during a robbery of a "hayseed bak"): "Anyone caught bipedal in five where's his ass for a hat!" Or maybe I just like the trivia. "Assclown" also has significant film usage; in Office Space (1999), Michael Bolton (a character, computer programmer) uses it to describe the pop singer with the same name (if I remember correctly). <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrent_Gulanowski_fe00.html" title="User:Brent Gulanowski">Brent</a> 14:23, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>"This word is found in colloquial speech in a number of cultures (in both English and in direct translation to other languages)" implies that it originated in English, and in other languages is a mere "translation" (loanword). No evidence supports that. According to <a href="../../../../de/a/r/s/Arschloch.html" class="extiw" title="de:Arschloch">de:Arschloch</a>, the German and English words seem to be coetaneous (early Middle Ages).

<p>On the subject of ass vs arse, would it be logical to assume 'arse' came about through <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypercorrection.html" title="Hypercorrection">hypercorrection</a> in non-rhotic speakers?</p>
<dl>
<dd>If we didn't know better, that would be plausible enough. But we do know better. <i>Arse</i> came first and has cognates in other indo-European languages. It's worth noting <i>ass</i> and <i>arse</i> are not pronounced the same by most British speakers of English, be they non-rhotic or not. The first usually has a short vowel, the second a long one. In the north of England, of course, speakers may use a short vowel in both. Scots tend not to make such distinctions of length, but then Scots tend to be rhotic too, so they distinguish. I'd guess (and I'm being lazy and not looking this up now) that the similarity of <i>arse</i> and <i>ass</i> led the second to be used euphemistically for the first, but I might be wrong. Either way, the /r/ is no hypercorrection. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarik_9c52.html" title="User:Garik">garik</a> 22:28, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A more modern cultural definition is the (traditionally college-based) drinking game <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_%28game%29.html" title="President (game)">Asshole</a>. It requires simply a deck of cards and for each error or break in rules, players must take a sip of their drink. Typically, players are ranked and any player who wins three times in a row (earning the title of "President" three times) gets to make a new, temporary rule. Games may get out of hand when players of higher rank force lower ranks to drink at their whim for any reason.</p>

<p>Asshat originated in Battlefield 1942, due to helmets in the shape of buttocks on the Axis side.</p>
<p>By the way, in NO way shape or form did this word or "pwn" or "own" or "frag" originate in Warcraft. Warcraft in itself is unoriginal, just as Starcraft is, both which ideas were stripped from Warhammer and Warhammer 40,000. Blizzard openly admits to this. Just decided to put this out there since it refers to internet slang as well. --Combatwolf 07:42, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>For starters? Asshat did not originate in Battlefield 1942. I saw it used years before BF1942 even came onto the drawing board. Secondly; don't trash Warcraft and Starcraft because they are 'unoriginal' when your vaunted Warhammer games are just as bad. Warhammer is but a rip-off of Tolkien, who is but a rip-off of mythology. WH40K is but a rip-off of <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alien_%28movie%29.html" title="Alien (movie)">Alien</a> and other sci-fi crap. Thirdly? Sign properly, or not at all.</dd>
<dd>About the only thing you managed to get right is the fact that "pwn", "own" and "frag" did not originate with Warcraft. --–<a href="../../../x/o/i/User%7EXoid_9ec6.html" title="User:Xoid">Xoid</a> 07:09, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
