<p>This is not a question, but seeing no specific place for such a comment, I chose this one. I am voluntarily offering my resignation from the Association of Members' Advocates. I do not make this decision lightly, but on the basis of an ongoing dispute with a rather contentious member of Wikipedia, of whose predilection to combativeness I was aware before choosing to stir the pot with him. If I am unable to resist rising to the bait in this case, I quite frankly do not feel I would serve another member well in a similar situation. Perhaps in another, more mature incarnation, I can assist here.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Rules</span></h2>
<p>My Fellow Advocates,</p>
<p>I believe we have a sufficient number of Advocate-Members to commence a discussion on the procedures of this office, so therefore I should like to comment on what is to be determined. This office, established by the Learned Advocate Alex756, seems at present to be unofficial and unrecognized. Therefore, I humbly submit that the Office apply to the Committees for recognition. Also, insofarasmuch as the rules of this Office are concerned, I find that the following ought to be addressed:</p>
<ul>
<li>The official relationship between the Office and the Committees.</li>
<li>The role each Committee will have in establishing rules of the Office.</li>
<li>The role and title of the coordinator (perhaps "Director" would be more suited).</li>
<li>The number of coordinators. (If the Office grows, it would become more difficult for a single coordinator to coordinate all Advocates.)</li>
<li>The procedures of Advocacy. (This last should be determined after the Arbitrators at least an outline of their plan.)</li>
<li>Advocacy during the Emergency sessions of the Arbitration Committee.</li>
</ul>
<p>-- <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Emsworth_c212.html" title="User:Lord Emsworth">Emsworth</a> 23:20, Feb 9, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>My dear Advocate and Lord Elmsworth, regarding recognition: I put a plea on the <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_a514.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee">Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee</a> policy page at: <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia_talk%7EArbitration_policy_b4cd.html#Can_members_have_representation.3F" title="Wikipedia talk:Arbitration policy">Wikipedia talk:Arbitration policy#Can members have representation?</a>. We are awaiting an answer. In regards to mediation this might be more flexible and I have made a statement about our potential role there at: <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_eaa9.html#Advocates" title="Wikipedia:Mediation">Wikipedia:Mediation#Advocates</a> regarding the consensual nature of assistance that we are offering other members. Perhaps certain members can make inquiries amongst members of the Committees to determine if they may be receptive to "official" recognition of our status, though I imagine that our efforts to be of real assistance to various members will demonstrate the validity of our endeavors to all concerned.</p>
<p>Insofar as the the other rules of this Office are concerned we should have a meeting in the near future to discuss this so a proposal can be put forward for our own Bylaws or "Rules of the Association of Advocates". We should also have a charter that demonstrates our high principles. Regarding a Coordinator or Director it would be a good idea to have an operating committee that can delegate group responsiblities or be an oversight body if we get more members. For now I suggest consensus as a good way to develop a collegial atmosphere amongst the volunteer Advocates.

<dd><i>I would like to clarify one point for anyone who may be confused. Arbitration, unlike mediation, does not have to be consensual. Thus, our right to arbitrate this case comes from its direct referral by Jimbo Wales: not from Theresa Knott, and not from Mr. Natural Health. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 18:32, 7 Feb 2004 (UTC)</i></dd>

<p>This is a bit confusing. I don't really agree that it is not consensual. We as Wikpedians are a community, arbitration should be a consensual process that comes from community statements. It is called "binding arbitration" because once you voluntarily submit to the will of the community (which is consensual) then you give up your right to object, as long as the process is fair. Arbitration is not a legal system and despite my tongue in cheek statements this is not an autocracy. See <a href="../../../w/r/i/Wikipedia%7EWrit_of_Wikimedius_3e7a.html" title="Wikipedia:Writ of Wikimedius">Wikipedia:Writ of Wikimedius</a>. The bylaws specifically give the authority to overturning or recognizing arbitration to be within the power of the Board, not just the Chair of the Board (Jimbo) <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Trustees" class="extiw" title="meta:Board_of_Trustees">meta:Board of Trustees</a>, see Article III, § 4.4 <a href="http://www.wikimediafoundation.org/bylaws.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wikimediafoundation.org/bylaws.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. It also states that the Disciplinary Board should be appointed by the whole Board of Trustees, not by Jimbo alone. See Article V, § 2, <i>ibid</i>.</p>
<p>Is there any consensus that we should try and make a representation to the Arbitration Committee about the source of their authority and clarify the scope of Jimbo's referral power? I know that this "Emergency Session" power is an interim thing but there is also supposed to be an election within ninety days of the adoption of the bylaws to elect two other members to the board to represent members concerns, these two directors should be people with whom we can work as an association to keep Wikipedia's rules fair and responsive to community needs. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">— Alex756 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Alex756 talk]</a> 09:06, 10 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Forgive me butting in here, but I think there's a bit of misunderstanding. The Arbitration Process on Wikipedia <b>is</b> consensual with regard to <b>all</b> Wikipedians as opposed to those <b>being</b> Arbitrated. In other words, because the Arbitration Process has the blessing of "Wikipedia" in the abstract, this gives it jurisdiction over individual Wikipedians. Otherwise any individual <s>troll</s>Wikipedian (not naming anyone in particular obviously&#160;:-) could just say "I don't consent to being Arbitrated" and that would be that. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Boswell_c574.html" title="User:Phil Boswell">Phil</a> 13:56, Feb 10, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you Phil for stating that. I am wonder what Cimon Avaro is objecting to, it is not clear. Is Cimon (Jussi-Ville) stating that sie believes that we cannot have a position about a issue of policy that differs from the opinions of the "Official Bodies". I do not understand why not? Isn't this what advocates are for, to review the evidence and try to argue for a particular position? I think that coming to a consensus about an mis-interpretation of how the Arbitration Committee sees itself will protect Wikipedians not be an exercise of arbitrary political lobbying. What we are talking about here is rational argumentation that can be used to get people to be reasonable, fair, responsive and willing to listen to alternative points of view rather than their arrogant self appointed ideas of power. I see nothing about that which is political — it is dealing with official power and attempting to see that it is excersised fairly and that the people who are exercising it do so in a manner that treats all Wikipedians equally under the principles enumerated by various international human rights instruments, etc.. I really don't know what Heiskanen is getting in a huff about, perhaps sie could restate hir opinion in <a href="../../../../simple/index.html" class="extiw" title="simple:">Simple English</a>; or consider resigning from an association due to a belligerent, negative attitude about what advocacy is all about. I should state the saying that Wikipedians do not have the right of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_association.html" title="Freedom of association">freedom of association</a> is not an attitude an Advocate can have; if the others disagree that is their right.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ethical issues</span></h2>
<p>I agree that people should not act as advocates while they serve on the arbitration committee. Also, while it may be appropriate to encourage mediators to also be advocates, I feel some points need to be addressed, to preserve the integrity of the conflict resolution process. For your consideration, I suggest:</p>
<ol>
<li>A user should decline to act as mediator in a case where the user has previously acted as an advocate.</li>
<li>A user should decline to act as advocate before the arbitration committee in a case where the user has previously acted as a mediator.</li>
<li>When participating in mediation, users who are both advocates and mediators should state clearly in which capacity they are acting.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's not a problem yet, and probably all of us would follow similar guidelines instinctively. Still, I think it's valuable to develop some ethical standards that can be expected of member advocates. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 21:13, 11 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I completely concur with the guidelines suggested by Mr Snow. I also beg to propose the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>In order to avoid the appearance of bias, a user should decline to act as a mediator if that user has recently acted as an advocate for or against one of the parties in the mediation.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Organization, rules, other proposals</span></h2>
<p>I'm not sure how many of our "association" are actively following this discussion, but I think Sam is right that we need to move along with it. The following is a proposal; I have tried to break down the details into separate points. Feel free to respond to or vote on each point separately, rather than the entire proposal.</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the appearance of official status, and rename the page "Member Advocates". (I don't see what purpose being an Office serves above and beyond simply being a resource. I also think the possessive plural form is unnecessary for a general name.)</li>
<li>Adopt all of the ethical guidelines suggested in the section above, and post them on the page.</li>
<li>Post information for users who want the services of an advocate, specifically:
<ol>
<li>Instruct them to contact directly any advocate whose services they want.</li>
<li>They may ask for the assistance of an advocate at any stage of a dispute, not just arbitration.</li>
<li>State that the nature and scope of assistance depends on consultation between the advocate and user.</li>
<li>Point out that the advocate does not have to agree to represent them.</li>
<li>Point out that due to the open nature of Wikipedia, we cannot guarantee that advocate communications with user-clients will have any degree of confidentiality.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Remove the link to "Request Assistance" as unnecessary, since users will contact advocates directly.</li>
<li>Postpone any discussion of having a coordinator. (I see nothing to coordinate right now. The only thing I would expect is if the arbitration committee wanted to have advocates assigned to participate in certain cases.)</li>
</ol>
<p>I also have one more possible ethical guideline to offer, but I'm not sure if it would be desirable. "When acting as advocates on Wikipedia, rather than in a personal capacity, advocates should disclose this fact." Thoughts and criticisms are welcome. I will leave my proposals open for a week to gather responses, then determine what action to take. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 07:17, 14 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<ol>
<li>I like the sound of "office of" and don't see the objections to be particularly strirring. If our official status is in some way unnaceptable, I'd like there to be some community involvement in making that decision.</li>
<li>Agreed.</li>
<li>Agreed, but I see no reason why they <b>must</b> contact a member directly rather than a general request.</li>
<li>Disagree, I for one would prefer to place a general request, and I see no reason why such an option should be removed. If people choose to contact a member directly so be it, but removing this may ensure the better known advocates recieve the brunt of requests, leaving others with less to do. I would prefer to have the opportunity to have it both ways. If a person prefers not to have a particular member, or a member prefers not to advocate a particular person (something I forsee as being fairly common, particularly given time available said member), I think that will all be sorted out shortly.</li>
<li>I can see any number of reasons for a co-ordinator, but sadly alex, who I would have liked to see as the co-ordinator, appears to have left the en-wiki. I agree to postpone said discussion until either the time of his return, or the necessity of said co-ordination.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your final ethical guideline offered doesn't strike me as either necessary nor objectionable, so I abstain from vote regarding it. I would like to express thanks for your dilegence and foresight in having brought these proposals to our attentions, and furthermore request all other members to be equally thoughtful in their suggestions and responses. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 07:38, 14 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>"Office" does not indiciate, in my opinion, the nature of the body. Perhaps one could name the body the "Association of Members' Advocates," or, borrowing from the Scottish term, the "Faculty of Advocates."</li>
<li>I agree.</li>
<li>I agree, with the reservation expressed above by Sam Spade.</li>
<li>I disagree, again for the reasons proposed by Sam Spade. If a user does not have a particular advocate in mind, then he or she should be able to put in a general request, which can then be considered by the advocates.</li>
<li>I do not feel that any discussion should be postponed while one waits for a user to return to the project, for such a return could take a long time, or, sadly, could never happen. What remains is to determine when a coordinator becomes necessary. I think that, as soon as the Arbitration Committee adopt their final policy, we elect a coordinator. In the interim, I think that a coordinator would be helpful for organizational purposes.</li>

<p>Please consider training and as a matter of course requiring advocates to properly gather evidence and present it in a usable manner, by which I mean a link to the matter spoken of, in the page we have devoted to a matter.

<p>I think that we should have some sort of agreement between the Advocates and Arbitrators (informal or formal) outlining what is to be expected of the two parties. I think that the following might be good starting points:</p>
<ol>
<li>The advocates should competently present evidence and arguments;</li>
<li>The advocates should fairly represent their clients;</li>
<li>The arbitrators should recognize the right of parties to have an advocate, and should inform each party of such a right at the beginning of an arbitration;</li>
<li>The arbitrators should keep advocates informed of any decisions made.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, I would request that the arbitrators designate an area that can be used <i>solely</i> for Advocate's arguments - either a special section of the talk page or of the main page, or an "Advocate-Arbitrator" discussion page, or some other page.

<p>I am going to add the ethical guidelines proposed earlier by Michael Snow in the section entitled "Ethical issues" to the office's page, since there do not seem to be any objections to the same so far. Also, I request suggestions for the name of this body (perhaps an informal poll is coming up soon). So far, we seem to have:</p>

<li>Members' Advocates</li>
<li>Association of Members' Advocates</li>

<dd>Thank you for the thoughtful responses so far. Sam's point about leaving the ability to make a general request is an especially good point. I failed to consider that people might come here needing help, yet really have no idea how to go about selecting a particular advocate. So I concur with the reservations expressed about my own proposal. Incidentally, that now seems to me like the primary special function a coordinator would have, directing general requests to a suitable and willing advocate. On the informal poll, I like the sound of being a faculty, but I think it might confuse non-Scots into looking to us for general instruction. In any case, either Member or Members' must remain as a modifier, to make it clear what kind of Advocates we are. Beyond that, it doesn't matter much to me. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 04:14, 16 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with Emsworth's opinions of the numbered points above. I am in favor of 'Association of Members' Advocates' or 'Association of Member Advocates'. It's not very Wikipedian to turn a page into a virtual location (a very <a href="../../../h/2/g/H2g2.html" title="H2g2">hootooian</a> thing to do), but the title should refer to the body and not the the advocates.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Issues I have with the AMA</span></h2>
<p>I've had three people ask about my resignation from the AMA so I suppose I should try to explain.</p>
<p>The ridiculous additions by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Cave_Troll_bf0e.html" title="User:The Cave Troll">The Cave Troll</a> were one part of the problem, but highlighted more problems - the lack of direction of the AMA, and the opportunity for trolling the AMA. I don't have time to deal with trolls right now, and if the AMA is going to attract them, I think I am best off out of it.</p>
<p>The confusion of goals, highlighted by <a href="../../../c/i/m/User%7ECimon_avaro_23aa.html" title="User:Cimon avaro">Cimon</a> above, which presumably are what led to his resignation, are problematic. I thought this was just going to be a group of people who were willing to help those in mediation/arbitration to understand those processes, but other members seem to have wildly different ideas. Alex claims we are here to criticise the Arbitration Committee and Sam Spade thinks it is some position of authority with which he can threaten other users. I disagree with both of these.</p>
<p>Another problem is the obsession with legalese on this talk page, which I find highly off-putting. In my mind, the aim was to help those already confused by the over-legalistic procedures of mediation and arbitration, but seeing this talk page is going to make those users run a mile.</p>
<p>I also didn't expect this to turn out so official-looking. Are we just helping people with the m/a process or are we putting ourselves up to be held accountable for not "winning cases" that we are helping with? I worry that the amount of formality here will lead users to thinking that the advocate is in some way responsible for their case, and they will therefore start complaining if arbitration does not turn out the way they wanted it to. I don't want to be held accountable for the outcomes of mediation or arbitration, and the current set up suggests that I would be.</p>
<p>There are also signs that advocacy is being forced on users. It needs to be something people ask for, not just one person deciding that they are going to advocate, which is the impression I get from pages such as <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_Clients_f3d7.html" title="User:Sam Spade/Clients">User:Sam Spade/Clients</a>.</p>
<p>The whole thing seems overly rules-based, which does not match what I was expecting the AMA to be. If it's just a matter of helping other users, then surely hard rules like "Advocates shall only communicate with consulting advocates" are completely unnecessary? I guess I just have different thoughts about what the AMA would actually be than others here.</p>
<p>I realise I should have brought up these issues earlier but I'd been thinking for a while about what I should do and Cimon's resignation, Cave troll's bizarre additions to the page and Perl's opposition of me all on the same day led me to think it would better if I just resign for now. If anyone wants my unofficial, informal help on any matter related to mediation or arbitration, I am happy to give that, but not in any formalised or legalistic manner as the AMA seems to expect.</p>

I'm sorry you feel that I use this as "some position of authority with which he can threaten other users", and if that is a concensus, I should be the one resigning, not you.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Newly Proposed Rule(s)</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>If there are advocates representing both or multiple sides of a dispute those advocates shall only communicate with consulting advocates as appointed by the AMA so as to create a <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_wall.html" title="Chinese wall">Chinese wall</a> between the differing sides of the dispute. When advocates communicate with each other on differing sides of a dispute they do so in an adversarial manner much as in other forms of advocacy as are found in the legal profession, for example. They may do so if their clients consent to communication without the intervention of a mediator or if mediation has failed during or leading up to arbitration (in an attempt to resolve the matter before the arbitration reference becomes final).
<ul>
<li>Support. You wouldn't colaberate with the opposing lawyer in a debate, and that's basically what the last two steps of dispute resolution are. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetasquares_f66f.html" title="User:Metasquares">Metasquares</a> 14:17, 1 Mar 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>According to <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Cave_Troll_bf0e.html" title="User:The Cave Troll">user:The Cave Troll</a>, The advocate position stands in opposition to the tyranny of sysops. The advocates' job is to prevent runaway abuse of sysop authority. Likely advocate powers might include:</dd>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Unilateral Unban (to mirror sysop unilateral temporary ban)</li>
<li>Page Unprotect (to be a subset of sysop page prot/unprot)</li>
<li>Audit Functions (these aren't anywhere that I can see them except the clunky page histories.</li>

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"tyranny of the sysops"? Who added this? It seems very dubious to me. I thought this association was to help people with arbitration and mediation, not to start unprotecting pages and unbanning users?

If an advocate has any "power" it is in their ability to listen and to be succinct and reasonable when advocating for others. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">— Alex756 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Alex756 talk]</a></dd>

<dd>I wasn't aware we able to allocate ourselves powers and privileges? While were at it, how about if we give ourselves a salary? Seriously tho, I was never a part of any vote of removal for Alex, and as far as I'm concerned any change of his position not made by himself was out of order. Furthermore, to my knowledge, the only one who can allocate powers and such would be Jimbo, or possibly a beurocrat. If they were giving out such powers, I should think there would be a stricter standard for who could be a member, and what rules they should follow? The very idea of allocating powers to ourselves seems quite heartily humorous, and I find it hard to believe anyone took it seriously enough to give it more than a laugh, much less to resign their position. Alex, change your status back and give us a hand here, will ya? It would seem we need your vote, or at minimum your level head. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 19:03, 2 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The change in Alex's position was due to his Wikivacation, which turned out to be temporary. In part, I wanted to avoid the potential problem of users wasting their time trying to recruit an advocate who isn't available. He has been invited to restore himself to full membership. Right now, membership is voluntary, so there is no removal or admission process. I've encouraged those who have resigned to reconsider as well. As for the discussion above, obviously the idea of an independent and unofficial body like this having "powers" is ridiculous, as is the idea of opposing the "tyranny of sysops", especially when quite a few members are sysops.</p>
<p>As for the rule above worth seriously considering, I oppose it. If there are advocates on opposing sides, they need to be able to communicate and work with each other, even though their clients are adversarial. The proposal seems to misunderstand the concept of a Chinese wall, which is an internal mechanism when a single law firm or similar entity represents competing clients. The AMA is not a law firm, so there's no loyalty to the other advocate or the firm that should compete with loyalty to the client.</p>
<p>Instead, we could consider a guideline that an advocate only represent multiple sides in a dispute if all of the advocate's clients are informed of this and agree to it. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 20:01, 2 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While it is true that AMA is not a law firm AMA is also not subject to the court enforced rules of confidentiality that lawyers are subject to, so by using the concept of a chinese wall (which comes from the securities field originally, lawyers adapted the idea later) we make sure that disputants are aware that advocates don't really talk to each other about the work they are doing if they are on opposite sides (though if they are not there might be ocassions when one advocate commuicates privately with another advocate to get their opinion or input for the sake of helping a disputant, this could also help develop the sense of collegiality between advocates). The important thing is to make it clear that advocates don't all sit around in a chat room somewhere discussing cases with each other and disclosing confidential information in ways that could harm the others involved. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">— Alex756 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Alex756 talk]</a></dd>

<p>I actually think its good for us to discuss things amongst ourselves, esp. if we represent opposing clients. Maybe we can find a soloution where they cannot. Disclosing private info is a whole other subject. So far, I don't think much of anybody has given me private info, since the vast majority of my wiki related communications have been on the wiki, and thus are open to all to see (if they can find the page where such utterances ocured&#160;;) <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 22:31, 2 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Opening: Association of Members' Advocates, Coordinator</li>
<li>Qualifications required: No particular experience necessary, but you should probably join the AMA if you want to be the coordinator</li>
<li>Job description: Connect users who request general advocate assistance with individual advocates who can represent them, co-ordinates policy discussion and maintains meta page</li>
<li>Salary: Ha!</li>
<li>Other perks in lieu of salary (such as power, authority, position of importance): Fancy title</li>

When requests come in, you would then need to find a suitable advocate who is willing to work with that client, and put the two in contact with each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone who would like to serve as coordinator may express interest below, and the AMA will make a selection. If nobody expresses interest, we may need to draft somebody. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 06:18, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Is it possible to nominate someone? That is the process that happens in most deliberative assemblies; this would be an example of democracy in action (as opposed to autocracy in action). Also does there need to be a discussion about the role of coordinator and what it should consist of or did the members of the AMA vote on this on the IRC channel or somewhere else that I am not aware of? <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">— Alex756 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Alex756 talk]</a> 07:36, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nominations would be fine as well. What I originally posted, and I see it's been tinkered with already, was only my notion of what the coordinator's role would be.

<dd>Maybe we should have a separate page for members' statements and only list members on the meta page, as Mihchael Snow points out the list on the main page is really just to let people know who is a member. But I do think that we should have some forum so that we know amongst ourselves what brings us to this association. I think this adds something to the collegial feeling of this place, it should not be seen as a form of advertising or something that requires vetting by other members. If someone makes a comment that is inaacurate, perhaps someone can comment on the comment, that would seem an appropriate way for members to communicate with each other (and an example to others, after all if we cannot resolve disputes between our members how are we going to help others?), <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">your humble and obedient servant....</a></dd>

<p>Would it help if we moved all the statements to the Requests for Assistance page, and just list members with no statements on this page?

<dd>Disagree as well. One can't demonstrate someone has been an effective or ineffective advocate, since the job did not exist before, and it is likely it will go on this way since mediation/arbitration are private processes. It is essentially to the client to have an opinion on that matter.</dd>
<dd>We do not need to have other advocates agree or disagree on another advocate. The only validity of his presence is whether he may be thought useful to someone, or not useful. Again, that is the client opinion which counts. Diversity of propositions is what matters. - Anthere</dd>

<p>My dear colleagues, we have an open association open to anyone who finds their way to these pages. How can we develop a reputation for advocates? That is up to each of us in our work. Should we deny membership to someone because we disagree with them? I think not. Can we have a procedure for removal or the sanction of members for conduct unbecoming someone charged with the representation of another's interests? Most certainly. What should those standards be? Certainly not failure or success in the outcome as the outcome is dependent upon the cause. If there are failures in the relationship between the advocate and the disputant (I do not like the term that the arbitration committee has adopted, litigant, it is not litigation) there may be times when such a breakdown will warrant some sanction between our association and the member in question, or it may also be undertaken as part of the dispute resolution process that Wikipedians have available to each other. Can members be rated by the work they do, i.e. after working with a disputant? Certainly the disputant could complete a survey and express their opinion about the advocate, such surveys mihgt be made available to someone interested in working with an advocate. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">— Alex756 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Alex756 talk]</a> 02:05, 12 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I like that survey idea, and I agree with Alex generally. In any case their is clearly not a concensus in favor of my proposal, so I withdraw it.

<dd>Since the AMA is still a small body, and not all advocates seem very active in our discussions, it seems counterproductive to require nominations to be seconded. I am curious about how Alex sees his potential role - on one hand, so far he prefers to remain a "member emeritus" rather than return to normal full membership, but on the other hand, he seems willing to accept a nomination as coordinator. Does he perhaps think that as coordinator, he would organize and advise the advocates in their efforts, but not normally function as an advocate himself? There's nothing necessarily wrong with this approach; I ask primarily because the role of coordinator is still somewhat undefined, and how the candidates view that role will probably affect what it develops into. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 21:41, 16 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am preparing a statement I will try and post it in a day or two (hope that is ok with everyone) above under my name. Regarding my status I thought that Member Emeritus was a honorific title, usually if a professor emeritus returns to teach again they do not strip him/her of that title. Really, I am not big on titles and I am not quite sure who gave me that nomer (I think before that I was a former member because it appeared that I had left Wikipedia at the time and I was acting as de facto interim coordinator). Any title is fine (within reasonable limits), even no title is fine. I leave that issue up to the others involved in this association (be they members or others involved who are not members). <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">— Alex756 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Alex756 talk]</a> 16:09, 17 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Generally the term "emeritus" applies to situations in which the person has retired from full activity. Many emeritus professors do teach under that title, but usually with a more limited (and less demanding) schedule. So that's why it gave me the impression you weren't functioning in the normal role of advocate. If you don't care about the title, you could simply reinstate yourself on the regular list. But since this is a voluntary association, I'm not going to dictate to anyone how they should define their participation. I look forward to your statement. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 18:59, 17 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Members statements2</span></h2>
<p>I took the liberty of relocating all of the advocate statements to the Requests for Assistance page, and restoring the original statement Alex made when he started the AMA. I'm hoping that location will be less problematic, and make it more clear that the statements are personal and not official. I did not restore statements that were voluntarily deleted by the advocates themselves, although those advocates may restore their statements if they wish. I proposed this idea earlier, and nobody objected, so I hope this meets with everyone's approval. If not, I would be happy to discuss it. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 22:54, 17 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I never noticed you making that proposal, but assuming you did I don't object to you taking such action. On the other hand, I think its a particularly bad idea&#160;;). For one thing that is definitely the wrong place for members statements, and for another the content of members statements is clearly what needs attention, not the location of them. It seems obvious to me that they are far better suited to the main page than under requests for assistance. Additionally I think that all members statements need to be removed (due to the presence, theoretical or otherwise, of false statements) and if any statements should be there at all they should be placed by someone other than the member (i.e. clients, satisfied and no). I also reccomend to Mr. Snow that since he seems so very inclined towards making meta-descisions here, he might like to nominate himself for AMA coordinater? <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 23:07, 17 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My proposal is in the section above on Members statements, but it may have gotten missed in the surrounding discussion. I hoped Requests for Assistance would be a better place, on the theory that the statements should primarily work to help people choose an advocate when they're looking for assistance, and that page is where we want them to go. If we decide they should be gone entirely (and people can maintain statements on their own user pages instead), that's a possible alternative. What do other people think?</dd>

<ul>
<li>All dates in these guidelines are by UTC.</li>
<li>The electorate shall consist of all members of the Association of Members' Advocates, except the ballot counter and anyone banned from participation in the election.</li>
<li>Nominations may be made at any time prior to the election, even immediately after an election
<ul>
<li>A nomination must be accepted by the nominee so as to prevent someone from nominating everyone else for the purpose of becoming ballot counter by default</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Elections by open ballot ending on March 31 and November 30 to select impartial ballot counter
<ul>
<li>Nominees may not be elected ballot counters</li>
<li>If every member is nominated except one, that person may not be nominated and becomes ballot counter by default.</li>
<li>Whoever is elected ballot counter may refuse the position if they will be unable to fulfill their duties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>From April 1 to April 7 and from December 1 to December 7, electors shall e-mail their votes to the ballot counter. The ballot counter shall post the results as soon after the election as possible.
<ul>
<li>Only nominees may be voted for.</li>
<li>An elector may change their vote if they contact the ballot counter before the end of the election and make it clear who they are voting for instead.</li>
<li>If an elector does not clearly state their vote to the ballot counter by the end of the election, an abstention shall be counted in the election results.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If there is any evidence that the ballot counter has lied about the votes, anyone has voted for more than one nominee, anyone has voted for the same nominee more than once, anyone has voted for someone else, or the ballot counter does not reveal the results, the AMA shall discuss whether to have another election in a manner to be proscribed when the time comes. If the consensus is to do so, the election shall be held again after one week and all those who have committed fraud banned from participation in AMA elections for 1 year.</li>
<li>If, for any reason, the election does not take place, another election shall be held after 1 week.</li>
<li>A Coordinator's term begins immediately after they are pronounced winner of the election.</li>
<li>A Coordinator may be removed from office by the consensus of the AMA's member or by resignation.
<ul>
<li>After the Coordinator announces their resignation, 48 hours must pass. After that period, the Coordinator will have 48 hours to confirm their resignation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the event of a vacancy of the office of Coordinator, an election shall be held 3 days after the office is vacated.<br /></li>

<dd>Excellent. Jwrosenzweig is actually precisely the person I would have recommended we ask, so it's great to have him volunteer. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 17:41, 30 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>at this rate it doesn't look like theres going to be much of an election. Are we getting any new contenders, or are ed and alex ready to square off, or what? <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> <a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Spade_3418.html" title="User talk:Sam Spade"><b>Spade</b></a> 00:38, 29 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I took the liberty of copying the above proposal over at the elections page. The only problem with that proposal is I think Ed Poor nominated himself (correct me if I am wrong), thus he would not be allowed to be a candidate under these rules. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">— ©</a> <a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlex756_8b95.html" title="User talk:Alex756">Alex756</a> 22:57, 29 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. That was originally written in as a measure to prevent the inconvenient situation of lacking a ballot counter, but a later idea made it obsolete. - <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalmypal_e54a.html" title="User:Calmypal">Woodrow</a> 02:10, 30 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes. I'm considering acting on it, but I don't know much about the case. Give me a few days. - <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalmypal_e54a.html" title="User:Calmypal">Woodrow</a> 02:10, 30 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>
