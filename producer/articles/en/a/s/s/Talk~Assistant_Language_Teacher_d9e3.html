<p>I've heard the rumor that Interac is owned and run by the Mormon church, and it may very well be true, but such claims need to be properly sourced. According to <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>, "Posts to bulletin boards, Usenet, and wikis, or messages left on blogs, should not be used as sources. This is in part because we have no way of knowing who has written or posted them, and in part because there is no editorial oversight or third-party fact-checking." Until reliable sources are supplied, the material should not be added to the article. — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 02:29, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The same anonymous user added some links that show that Interac is owned or affiliated with a company called Selnate, but none of those links show that Selnate or Interac is owned by the LDS church. This information has thus been removed once again. -- <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 01:37, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Again, we have links showing that Selnate owns Interac and that Selnate recruits through Brigham Young University. None of the links provided shows that Interac or Selnate are owned by the LDS church (and a link to an Amazon book page doesn't cut it). Do you have a quote from this book that says that Interac is owned by the Mormons? If so, then there's no problem. As it is, though, you're making leaps of logic that aren't borne out by the sources you're providing. Per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, this isn't acceptable in the encyclopedia. — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 08:31, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Of course it is hard to prove black on white that Interac is owned by LDS. Interac/Selnate avoids to state that <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=lds+selnate&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=lds+selnate&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">obvious connection</a> because it would obviously be bad PR for them. It might even get them in trouble with their main client. The Japanese government. A religious group not only feeding but almost controling the stream of English teachers for Japanese Schools? This is food for newspapers and substantially dangerous for Interac. Also, which teacher wants to work for the mormons?</p>
<p>However, it is proven that Interac is owned by Selnate who runs Maxceed and Selti. <a href="http://www.selnate.co.jp/" class="external text" title="http://www.selnate.co.jp/" rel="nofollow">Selnate.co.jp clearly states it</a>. And it is obvious that <a href="http://www.selnate.com/about.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.selnate.com/about.htm" rel="nofollow">American Selnate</a> with its headquarters in Mormon capital Provo Utah - incident? No <a href="http://www.yellowpages.com/sp/moreinfo/index.jsp?id=70135664&amp;q=Language%20Schools" class="external text" title="http://www.yellowpages.com/sp/moreinfo/index.jsp?id=70135664&amp;q=Language%20Schools" rel="nofollow">Selnate's offices are at the BYU University</a> - and the mormon University BYU work together.</p>
<p>It is a proven fact that the mormon church engages in the very same business in China. As for the comment about LOTs of rumours. This is clearly an Interac manager trying to protect his company.</p>

<dd>Cast accusations against me all you want. Wikipedia's policies are there for a reason, and if you want to take issue with them, this is not the appropriate place to do so.

<dl>
<dd>That establishes that one of the co-founders of Interact is a Mormon, not that Interac is owned by the LDS church. Someone's religious and business life can be separate; you need to find something that explicitly states that this is not the case with Interac. — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 11:15, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Brian, this is getting kind of ridiculous. A co-founding manager IS an owner. And mormonism is not just some private religious belief. It's a lifestyle. If you've ever been to Utah you know what I mean. Keep in mind that 10 percent of every obedient Mormon's income is given to his church unhesitatingly, because he is confident that he is giving to God. And Roice is not just some member, according to his profile <a href="http://www.mission.net/northern-far-east/alumnilist.php?uID=156202" class="external text" title="http://www.mission.net/northern-far-east/alumnilist.php?uID=156202" rel="nofollow">Roice is an "Elder"</a> which is not just an older member or something. <a href="http://lds.about.com/library/glossary/bldefelder.htm" class="external text" title="http://lds.about.com/library/glossary/bldefelder.htm" rel="nofollow">Elder is a Mormon euphemism that actually means missionary</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Elder. Definition: The proper title given to holders of the Melchizedek Priesthood. The title is used for members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, the First Quorum of the Seventy and for full time missionaries. Pronunciation: [L-dur] • (noun) Also Known As: Missionary. Examples: To serve a mission, a man must become an Elder and receive the Melchizedek Priesthood.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Which underlines one more time what has been stated in an earlier version of the article. Interac was founded by two Elders (=Mormon missionaries) as an covered mission of the LDS church. As it is forbidden to actively recruit church members, Interac started as a phony English for free institution teaching LDS vocabulary as regular English. All sponsored by the LDS church. In the mean time Interac is a mainly a money maker for LDS Japan. However, a great number of LDS teachers come from BYU, which, as you know are 95% mormons.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You've established that Interac is owned by a Mormon with the title of Elder and that it recruits through BYU. If you want to add that information, go ahead. The rest of your conclusions, while defensible, are your own interpretations, and thus are not appropriate for the encyclopedia (per <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>). — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 09:14, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The titles are quite important. Elder means missionary. But I've got more for you. Once you start reading the Japanese stuff it gets really good. The current President and other co-founder of Interac is called Yasuo Niiyama. He is another Elder ranked Mormon that goes by the title of <a href="http://www.mission.net/japan/sendai/presidents.php?prID=4501" class="external text" title="http://www.mission.net/japan/sendai/presidents.php?prID=4501" rel="nofollow">"President"</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's also good circumstantial evidence. You should write a book about this.&#160;:) But it's still drawing a conclusion, which Wikipedia is not allowed to do. I think we're justified to say that "Interac's founders have ties to the LDS church", but nothing much stronger than that until you find a source that alleges direct ownership of Interact <i>by</i> the LDS church. It's the only way we won't run afoul of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> policy. — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 22:49, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's surprising how hard it can be to get something black on white that is so obvious if you have a little insider knowledge. Now, how would you prove once and for all that Selnate/Interac is owned by the LDS? You need their business registry documents. Yet the business registry documents will not name LDS, they will name Niiyama and Roice (two mormon missionaries). What else do you need? Financial proof. To prove that money goes from Interac to LDS you need to have access to their books or tax declarations. Well, noone can deliver that evidence unless he has access to the accounting. And even then. They will definitely declare their contribution to LDS as a "donation to a religious institution". Which for tax matters is much smarter than just transfering money through ownership. Or how do you think sects and religious groups finance themselves? Maybe I should write that book... Or maybe not. Maybe I should just write a letter to the tax office and the BOE. Or get a journalist on the story.

<p>I work as the manager of a major private ALT providing company in Japan, and a lot of this stuff seems to have been written by ALTs or former ALTs going on common rumor. For example, 250,000 yen a month being an actual minimum wage, etc. I cleaned a bit of it up already.</p>
<p>Also, there is a lot of language seemingly written for the purpose of ALTs instead of the readership at large. Let's make this article more encyclopedic.</p>
<p>I have intimate knowledge on all aspects of this business that a lay ALT typically gets misunderstood, and would be happy to offer any information needed in this article and supply sources to back them up.

<dd>I do not work for Interac. I work for their largest competitor in Kanto. I feel that the article does not do justice to Interac's various harms against ALTs and its dishonesty but I also know that it is impossible to prove what is obvious with actual sources. My previous comment was related to certain laws claimed ("minimum monthly salary") and the structure of the company-school board relationship. I ammended both of these as well as a few other minor parts of the article beofre making the comment. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoove_K_10a2.html" title="User:Smoove K">Smoove K</a> 05:09, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As much as I think Interac needs to come out for what it is and it is important for people to know the controversies involving the industry, I think the article should be written with only the actual job in mind. I would support a seperate article concerning seperate issues with a short relevent section and link to that article placed in this one. Thoughts? Also, recent edits with potentially provable facts being made without sources should not continue. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoove_K_10a2.html" title="User:Smoove K">Smoove K</a> 22:41, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
