<h2><span class="mw-headline">Member statements are useless</span></h2>
<p>Is there any reason to have the member statements page? Is there a single statement that provides anything of value to a client? This is part of my strategy of making people advocate more and deal with meta-bullshit less. The statements page is worthless, and should go. Again, I know, I know, wait till after the <s>stupid procedural dumbass</s> election <s>garbage</s>, so I'm not going to make the change, but if you don't want that change made the second whoever the new "coordinator" is is elected, this is the place to discus reasons and alternatives. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 22:35, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The thing people are reading for on the main page is how to get help. Most everthing else needs to go. I also suggest that the first paragraph BEGS people to wikilawyer. If we're devoted to protecting "due process," we might as well kill ourselves now, because "due process" here is "due what helps the encyclopedia."</p>

<p>Calling something they're trying to do "stupid procedural dumbass election garbage" is not the way to do it. If you're just trying to cause trouble and get people to react badly so that you can use that against them later (RFA for example) then you're doing great. I for one will not react to you so you cna jsut give up, but I've also decided not to waste too much time listening to you either, so it's OK.Gator (talk) 22:54, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">ELECTION STARTING</span></h2>
<p>I've word from Theresa, and we're officially ready to go.</p>
<p>Here is how it will work:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The election begins on Friday, 3 February 2006 at 0000 hours UTC.</b> It will <b>last for one week</b>; or, until Friday, 10 February 2006, at 0000 hours UTC.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Votes will be e-mailed to Theresa knott at <b>Theresaknott@gmail.com</b>. The phrase <b>AMA Coordinator Election Ballot</b> must be in the title. Within the e-mail, <b>you must specify your username</b> and list the candidate(s) you choose. Failure to do so will have your ballot rejected.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You may pick <b>either candidate or both</b>. As voting functions by approval method, you simply put down the names of any candidates which you find acceptable. Write-in votes are allowed; however, in the unlikely event a write-in candidate should prove victorious, they would have to first accept the office. Candidates who have already rejected nomination (Neigel von Teighen), accepted but subsequently withdrew (WGFinley), or been found ineligible (Hipocrite) will be automatically discounted, and the next-highest vote-winner elected, should they win.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A list of those members with suffrage is available on the 2006 Coordinator Election AMA page, as well as on the procedure page. <b>The criteria for suffrage is membership as of 21:46 on 6 January 2006.</b> Members who do not reach that criteria may not cast a ballot. Those who were members at that time but have since removed their names from the member list are likewise discounted.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>All members who possess suffrage — they are seventy in number — will be informed of the election within the next day on their talk pages. Anyone who would like to volunteer to assist me in passing on the word is welcome to pick part of the list and do so; but all members must be informed by the start of voting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck to the candidates and to the organization! Further questions to <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">User:Theresa knott</a>.</p>

<dd>Nor was banning write-in candidates discussed anywhere. I no longer care (this either gets fixed or replaced, I think), but you've certainly done a lot of things to stop people from voting for me. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 23:54, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Write-in candidates weren't banned — in fact, they were specifically allowed. Candidates who have already been determined <b>by community consensus</b> to be ineligible are excluded. If so many people were going to vote for you, then there would have been no consensus for excluding you from the race. I remind you that I asked for <b>a single member</b> to back your candidacy in order that it might be allowed, and <b>not a single member was willing to do so.</b> I do not consider it my fault that your heavy-handedness and arrogance have excluded you from this race — that, and the spirit of the rules by which this organization is run. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 05:55, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just reviewed the list of outstanding requests for advocacy. What should I do if I think, based on a review of the history, that the editor is a sock-puppet for an ArbCom banned user? I have not been in touch with the editor in question, so that I am not expected to represent or advocate for the editor. Am I free to request admin or ArbCom assistance in dealing with this banned user, or does the fact that I became aware of the case through a request for advocacy mean that I should leave the issue alone? <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_McClenon_acae.html" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a> 22:04, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unfortunately this is the sort of question that we intended to have a staff change in order to address; we've no clear policy on a situation like this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would argue that it would be consistent with AMA policy to ignore anything incriminating placed on the AMA requests for assistance page. Users there, however misguided, are seeking representation, and we are thus bound under a moral equivalent of attorney-client privilege as soon as their request appears (even if it is public — the ArbCom would probably whine about wikilawyering if this was brought up in a case). I don't know if there's consensus on this or what; simply my opinion. This does not preclude you from investigating further and taking action on the basis of something on a page in the mainspace, however. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 02:24, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dispute resolution is <i>not</i> a judicial process where we try to "get off" users who are having a massively net negative effect on the project. I see the role of the AMA as to help all good-faith (or even potentially good-faith where this is not clear) users negotiate their way through the process, so we get to retain good editors that might be lost otherwise, and can work out issues with editors who might otherwise have been banned before it gets that far. That does <i>not</i> mean that we're under some quasi-legal restriction to ignore that someone has already had their due process and been banned accordingly.</dd>

<dd>To answer your other question, I did quite a bit of advocacy (and influenced quite a few cases) before I ran for the Arbitration Committee - it's how I made enough of a name for myself to get elected in the first place. And for the record, I have absolutely no interest in clerking (I hated those tasks as an arbitrator, which was a large part of the reason why I resigned, why would I want to do them now?). <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 04:14, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The particular incident that resulted in this question is overtaken by events. The editor who was requesting an advocate has been blocked as a sockpuppet of the previously banned user. There is still a general question about what to do about "bad" requesters. My conclusion is that an advocate should research the history at least briefly before agreeing to represent someone. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_McClenon_acae.html" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a> 20:58, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What do we do now? It appears that the vote turnout was too small. The election announcement stated that 70 advocates had suffrage, but only 18 voted. I see two possible ways out. First, the franchise could be expanded by changing the date of active membership. (Disclosure: I am not disinterested.) Second, someone, such as Theresa, could cast a tie-breaking vote. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_McClenon_acae.html" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a> 19:58, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I object to both ideas, and suggest a dual co-ordination. We need to get things done, not get mired in democracy for its own sake.

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree with the idea of Co-Coordinators. The reason we are here is because the Coordinator did not have an active enough role in shaping the organization (although no disrespect to Alex is intended).

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The extension of suffrage is, I think, a fox that won't run. We have procedures for a reason, and they ought to be followed. Extending the election further could be possible, but if people haven't voted yet I <i>highly</i> doubt they will, save from electioneering. A tie-breaking vote also won't work; no one has the authority to cast such a ballot. With perhaps one exception — our past Coordinator.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I do not know if he cast a ballot — he was indeed eligible — but I would suggest that, if he did not, we request that Alex break the tie. He is the only one with something approaching the authority necessary to make that legitimate.</dd>

<dd>Otherwise, perhaps all those who voted for both candidates (this was approval, remember) could be asked to go back and choose.

Cats should be given more liberty than dogs, because they demand and can use it better. Humans domesticated wolves into dogs. Humans did not domesticate cats. Cats wandered in to tents in North Africa and domesticated themselves because it was a good place to live. Dogs are loyal, and are good wolves.

<p>I wonder if perhaps another idea might be hit upon to close the election issue, since the election did not close it on its own. This is not a proposal; rather, it is simply food for thought, and I would like to hear reactions.</p>
<p>I conjecture:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Governing Committee, made up of five, seven, or nine governing members (on a voluntary basis) to be co-chaired by Ambi and KeithTyler;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This Committee will be responsible for reforms, with a focus on developing advocacy guidelines, clearing away requests backlogs and developing a system for future Coordinators and their installation;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This Committee will dissolve itself at the point at which a full-time Coordinator will be elected or otherwise chosen.</li>

<dd>While I respect the attempt to come to a middle ground, this strikes me as unnecessarily bureaucratic.

<p>Seeing broad agreement, I will blank the memberlist except for people who have been active recently shortly.

If you take them off we should at least leave a mesage on their user page. better yet. We should make it so that all members have an email or something so we can easilly send everyone a message (mass email... or quick message on their user page.)!! Not only would that re-affirm their existance but it would also make for faster communication between users and it may even encourage some new case to be formed. Unless of course their's some other solution for quick and effective communication and affirming our affiliation with AMA. ... (a scouts pledges?) (Or a chain of contact... so and so contacts 5 users. and so and so contacts 5 more... etc?) dunno..

<dd>I'm with Hipocrite on this one. If we have a great list of people who've never done anything but whack their name on a list and don't even watch this page at all, we're little more than a social club. If we're actually going to link people up with advocates, we need the list to be of people who are actually prepared to do the work. If we blank it now, anyone who is still interested could be perfectly welcome to add their name back, and thus ensuring that we get rid of people who lost interest a year ago. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 03:49, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Proposal</b>: I didn't even know we had a requests page. I was waiting for someone to contact me. Maybe instead of just sitting around we should have an assignments desk! A crew of let's say 5 that quickly categorize, chooses and filters the cases (of course anyone could help out!)(or better yet the user complaining should do that!). Then a supervisors crew (1 supervisor for every 5-10 members) that assign cases to our specialize AMA members. supervisor must be knowledgeable of about the qualities and faults of their crew. Every AMA member must have at least one category that they specialize in and are willing to take a case. The assignments desk will have handed down to the supervisors crew what it feels is appropriate. What the expected delay should be? How much time should be spent, etc...? etc. etc.... Then give it to the specialized user... (Of course ensuring that it is fairly distributed and that the AMA member is not over worked). If the AMA member (specialize unit) refuses without a valid reason several (I dunno? 4 or 5) or simply doesn't respond to the supervisors request then, as Donald Trump would say... "you're fired!" He must then redo the AMA application process if he wishes to remain a member. --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> 00:50, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Is silence agreement? I think Keith could clarify what is going on here, he is really the only one that could object to your proposal Wally, but he has not come forward and made any indicationof his position. This is just another example of the apathy in this group that frustrated me so much when I was Coordinator. This just proves to me that the whole idea of having an election and trying to get something going here was a bad idea. Everyone wants to express their opinion but when it comes to getting anything done (I had lots of proposals to have conferences, put together educational materials, create exams for advocates for quality control, etc.) but when it came to anything more than talk, well, I couldn't get anyone to help me. Ha! Good luck guys; maybe I should also be removed as a member because it seems to me that membership in the AMA means practically nothing to most of the members.

I agree with the latter. I disagree with the former, but I think that every member of the AMA has a different idea of what membership means. (For instance, it may be a way of protesting against the Cabal, or of trying to become a member of the Cabal. It may be a way of ensuring that process, which is important, is followed, or it may be a way of ensuring that the Right Thing is done even if process is bypassed.) <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_McClenon_acae.html" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a> 16:03, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This would've happened a year ago but for your resistance; now, at least, it's done and we can move on.

<dd>I must respond to Wally's personal attack on me. I will use the third person, because I do not think I should respond to him directly. I did not want to be dictator for life. I know that there was an attempt to have a previous election and I suggested that just having elections was not going to resolve the issues that the AMA had. I think this election has proven me right. The fact of the matter is that the election is was a tie. There was a suggestion by two people that because of this, I should have the deciding vote. There really was no discussion about this, certainly the people who had voted except for Ambi, Wally and Sam Spade said nothing. I cannot see this as a consensus. If Ambi and Keith cannot work together to resolve this state of uncertainty why should I? I do not think attacking me personally is going to resolve it either. There is obviously a systemic problem with this organization. BTW I never "disappeared". Certainly I did not make a lot of edits, but I logged onto WP every week and I also got emails from people. No one suggested that I had "disappeared" until now. I have been operating out of the same physical and email address for more than seven years; how could anyone suggest that I have disappeared! All this means is that no one bothered to contact me! Just remember, as they say, he who casts the first stone should be guiltless. That does not seem to be the situation here. I have asked for discussions and activites over and over again and people have just ignored me. That is not being a dictator, even a benevolent one which seems to be the fate of Wikipedia land. The bottom line is that most advocates do not care about the AMA, not to help increase the value of the advocacy work that is being done, nor to participate in the organization. Maybe there are too many Americans involved. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">Alex756</a> 02:54, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

There were no proclamations of problems or any formation of any projects or initiatives. Not, that is, before the election issue was raised in Jan 2005. On the <a href="../../../a/m/a/Wikipedia%7EAMA_Coordinator_28a8.html" title="Wikipedia:AMA Coordinator">Coordinator's Desk</a>, it says <i>On this page the coordinator will post concerns.</i>, but none were ever posted. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<dd>You were offered as a deciding factor in order to offer a settlement. I did not think it was an optimal way for disposing of the situation; however, there is the issue of the amount of time this transitory process has occurred, to which I am not blind. It was already apparent that neither side was willing to concede, so out of a number of third options only that met without resistance.</dd>

<dd>As for your "availability," I have found it spotty at best, and many messages I have sent you have met without response over a period of several months. I would be committing a sin of omission if I did not wonder whether it were intentional or not; further, I think of our core group, little apathy can be found. Sam cares, I care, Keith cares, Gator cares. Even some of our newest members, Hipocrite and Robert McClenon, have been some of the most active. However, since the meetings held at the <i>first</i> election suggestion, <b>more than a year ago,</b> you've done nothing with the organization and had in many ways left it to simply stew. You did not continue trying to hold meetings once the election proposal got stuck in the mud, and took no part in contacting members or spurring discussion, as the talk page here suggests. Complaining that someone left you out of the loop is disingenuous — as the Coordinator, it was precisely your job to monitor, organize, and <i>know.</i> Call it a personal attack if you like, but I'm quite frankly tired of having the efforts to have some transfer of authority and reconstruction of this organization, in which I and others have done so much work already and prepare to do so much more, savaged by people who themselves could hardly care less. Your abrogation of your duties is no excuse to attack the election that replaced you with, I can only hope, someone who gives a damn. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 03:44, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is funny that you bring this up now Wally after waffling in this whole election fiasco. First you suggest that I caste the tie breaking vote, then you suggest that there is no "settlement" and suggest that a committee be formed. You never left a message on my talk page stating that I was not responding to you. You never sent me an email. I actively monitor that email account as I am on several confidential internal Wikimedia email lists (as I assist the board and am part of the Wikimedia Legal Department). You cannot blame me for the apathy of the other members. I held three meetings and asked other members to become involved. No one came forward to assist me. You are now just complaining because you can't face up to the fact that the membership of this association IS apathetic. It is not my fault and I do not think it is my job to force people to volunteer just because I thought up this project. If you want to leave this association then do. I have decided to remove my name from the membership list because I think it is dangerous to be involved in an association that has members that attack someone who only had good hopes for what we were doing here, I would rather not be associated with this group. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">Alex756</a> 04:39, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do not blame you for member apathy; you are quite right that it is not your fault. I blame you for Coordinator apathy, and for doing nothing more <i>than</i> holding meetings in lieu of just holding the damn election a year ago like we all wanted. I offered proposals to bring some reform to this organization, as did others. You refused to hear any of them and instead baubled on about meetings, until we all just got fed up. Hence the problem of member apathy: there was no way we could get anything changed, or even done. You were the Coordinator; you did not coordinate. Hence my criticism.</dd>
