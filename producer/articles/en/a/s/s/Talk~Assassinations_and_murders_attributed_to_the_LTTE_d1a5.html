<p>Most political and other assassinations are very difficult to pin on the culprits unless an impartial court case settles the issue like in <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajiv_Gandhi_05c7.html" title="Rajiv Gandhi">Rajiv Gandhi</a> murder case. Even then the there are reasonable questions as to whether innocent Sri Lankan Tamils were scapegoats to apolitical process as the real culprits are outside the jurisdiction of Indian law at present. The author of the Tamilnation.org article is self admittedly a pro-LTTE writer. He took a list of 47 people that a researcher from Peradeniya University published and whittled it down to 40 thus admitting at least 40 were the handiwork of the LTTE. He went to argue that at least Sam Thambimuttu in the list is more notorious than prominent. I have used the 40 from the list as the base line for this article and have added other notorious and prominent Tamils assassinated by the LTTE from neutral sources. <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERaveenS_7d61.html" title="User:RaveenS">RaveenS</a></p>

<p>1. The word "assassination" is confined to the killing of rulers. In the modern context, it might at most be used for the killing of a <i>government</i> minister or even a <i>government</i> MP. All other killings are simply "murders." I therefore wonder if the title of the page is accurate when many of those listed as assassinated had no connection to the government.</p>

<dd>Assassination is the murder of a political figure or other important individual. An added distinction between assassination and other forms of killing is that an assassin usually has an ideological or political motivation, though many assassins (especially those who are not part of an organised movement) also show elements of insanity. Other motivations may be money (as in the case of a contract killing), revenge, or as a military operation.<a href="../../../d/u/t/User%7EDutugemunu_3722.html" title="User:Dutugemunu">Dutugemunu</a> 06:47, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>2. Sam Thambimuththu, is a civilian who represented the EPRLF in parliament as an MP after the EPRLF gave up arms. He is listed as an "assassinated" "militant." This is not only inaccurate in terms of both terms but also gives the impression that he was a government man toting a gun. He never was a government man and never did carry a gun. He stood in opposition to the government for Tamil rights and for ordered government. Erbear 16:34, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article as it was waiting to get into an edit war today or tomorrow hence I proactively merged 2 articles without any attributions. I created them both to balance Wikipedia but now I think we should simply have one article without any attribution.

<dd>What, neutral title? you just added 3 dead ltte people from <b>Assasinations of LTTE members attributed to Sri Lankan government forces</b> page and some other peoples who kicked out by iwaski and snowolfd4 from <b>Assasinations attributed to Sri Lankan government forces</b> article for various reasons and renamed <b>Assassinations and murders attributed to the LTTE</b> as <b>Assassinations and murders during the Sri Lankan civil war</b>. I'm strongly denies this page move. My opinion is, these pages should remain as the separate pages. --<a href="../../../l/a/h/User%7ELahiru_k_90e0.html" title="User:Lahiru k"><font color="blue"><b>♪♫ ĽąĦĩŘǔ ♫♪</b></font></a> <a href="../../../l/a/h/User_talk%7ELahiru_k_232b.html" title="User talk:Lahiru k"><font color="blue"><sup>Walkie-talkie</sup></font></a> 17:26, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That was my intention, just to have one list and have articles about the victims if they are notable and deal with who assasinated them in those articles because everywhere credible questions can be raised. The base of the LTTE killing article is Tamilnation.com I can argue that it is not a RS source hence like Tamilnet, it cannot be used to create an article. Most of the list in the LTTE comes from Tamilnation.com. Someone in the future can remove them all because it is coming from a website not a reputable source. I hope you understand.

<dd>Hello, I think a centralized article titled Assassinations of the Sri Lankan civil war (or something similar) would be a good idea. I think the assassinations should be attributed to whomever carried them out, but not necessarily in the titles. Although there is an argument to be made for having the two articles separately (especially if they are exceedingly long--but I don't think that applies here), merging them under one title that avoids any POV would make the articles more NPOV and also (in my opinion) more informative by concentrating related information in one place. If the merge is re-performed, I would also suggest standardizing the lists for clarity using a table format like the kind below:</dd>

<dd>I like the rename idea except the Perpetrated by column. Most of the dead people in this list come from a non <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> source but those who are <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> are already have their own articles and others are awaiting to be created. We should leave the Perpertrated by out and leave it to the linked article about that notable persoopn to deal with it. For example take <a href="../../../k/e/t/Kethesh_Loganathan_b6db.html" title="Kethesh Loganathan">Kethesh Loganathan</a> every body belives he was killed by the LTTE except some members oif his own family and some others. LTTE denies killing him but the article about him deals with this controversy. Take <a href="../../../t/a/r/Taraki.html" title="Taraki">Taraki</a>, everyone belives he was killed by the government agents but even there some questions have been raised as to who killed him. The article deals with it effectively. I dont think a major article on assasinatiosn during the Sri Lankan civil war needs to prove who did what because that will be unstable to subject to numerous revisions. That too aarticle whose bedrock of information a biased source that is Tamilnation.com, how can it be even stay long enough without been deleated. Hence my proposal to have aneutral article about the whole issue and link it to notable people&#160;?14:21, 15 February 2007 (UTC)<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERaveenS_7d61.html" title="User:RaveenS">RaveenS</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/v/User_talk%7ERaveenS_7451.html" title="User talk:RaveenS">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RaveenS_f18a.html" title="Special:Contributions/RaveenS">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>Just my two cents..I think if we are to create an article (it would look more like a list!!)of people killed in the civil war, there are more than 60,000 people to be listed, i dont think this is possible&#160;:O), so it should be named as something like <i><b>"Notable people killed during the Sri Lankan Civil War"</b></i> and if its going to contain a table it should definitely have the <b>Perpetrated by column</b>. I dont believe wikipedia can contain an article that would not change forever, eventually someone is going to dispute something or the other if not <i>who killed who</i>, someone can dispute whether the person was killed in the first place. So lets be bold and forget about future conflicts and create the article. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetmonger_08eb.html" title="User:Netmonger"><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:green">ŇëŧΜǒńğëŗ</span></b></a><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:lightgreen"><sup><a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetmonger_89b5.html" title="User talk:Netmonger">Talk</a></sup></span> 14:54, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Also what about people like Kadirgamar, no one has been convicted yet and LTTe denies it. In the case of Journalist Mylavaganam, an EPDP cadre was arrested but he fled the country what do we do there&#160;? <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERaveenS_7d61.html" title="User:RaveenS">RaveenS</a> 16:40, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So we can change the <b>Perpetrated by</b> column as <b>Accused or carried out by</b>. If we can add an asterisk (*) sign to indicate the confirmed crimes, it will be more easy to the readers to identify the criminals and it should be goes with the base article (if such exist) or if not, with a separate ref link.

<dd>Just an idea: if there is significant controversy regarding who is responsible for the assassination, we could write <i>disputed</i> in the "Perpetrated by" column and add a note at the bottom (or <i>unknown</i> if the identity of the assassin(s) is unknown). I think changing the title of that column to "Carried out by" is a good idea--<i>perpetrated by</i> has a more negative (and thus POV) connotation than <i>carried out by</i>. I am, however, somewhat ambivalent about adding "notable" to the title. Although it does add some clarity (the downside is making the title longer), an <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassination.html" title="Assassination">assassination</a> usually implies that the victim is an important public figure.

<p><small>(Resetting indents)</small> What a good discussion, guys! When I read Raveen's note I thought "Uh oh!", but after clicking on his link that pointed here I'm really relieved and impressed how well you got right to the heart of the matter and found a good solution! Here's my 2 cents about the remaining questions:</p>
<p><i>"Notable" in title:</i> I agree that it's not strictly necessary. There is some value, though because it may discourage people who did not participate in this discussion from adding non-notable murders.</p>
<p><i>"carried out by" column:</i> I like Lahiru's idea of graphically distinguishing confirmed from unconfirmed entries. Since Wikipedia normally should only contain confirmed information, I would propose to make the default confirmed, and set the unconfirmed cases apart. E.g. by putting them in parentheses like this: "(suspected: LTTE)". Just my 2 cents. — <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastianHelm_63db.html" title="User:SebastianHelm">Sebastian</a> 18:49, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Guys per Netmonger, I think the word <b>notable</b> should be there. And If we are gonna consider about the length of the title and kick out the word <b>notable</b>, it may cause for an edit wars in future. So I think we should not take such a risk. Hope some of you doesn't know, that even we have argue to remove the <b>Carried out by</b> from the heading of <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorist_attacks_attributed_to_the_LTTE_7d95.html" title="Terrorist attacks attributed to the LTTE">Terrorist attacks attributed to the LTTE</a> article. <a href="../../../s/s/h/Image%7ESShocked.gif_c59c.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/8/85/SShocked.gif/18px-SShocked.gif" alt="" width="18" height="19" longdesc="../../../s/s/h/Image%7ESShocked.gif_c59c.html" /></a></dd>
<dd>As per my knowledge, more than 68,000 died from this bloodiest conflict and even I have a list of 10,688 fallen soldiers between 15/10/81 - 30/06/99 of Sri Lanka Army, and those 7 letters will help us to filter the most notable people from the total 68,000.</dd>
<dd>So my proposed title will be........... <b>Notable assassinations during the Sri Lankan civil war</b> or the <b>Notable assassinations of the Sri Lankan civil war</b>. --<a href="../../../l/a/h/User%7ELahiru_k_90e0.html" title="User:Lahiru k"><font color="blue"><b>♪♫ ĽąĦĩŘǔ ♫♪</b></font></a> <a href="../../../l/a/h/User_talk%7ELahiru_k_232b.html" title="User talk:Lahiru k"><font color="blue"><sup>Walkie-talkie</sup></font></a> 19:00, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I am not particularly opposed to "notable" in the title (in fact, I wouldn't mind either way). My comment was intended to point out that "assassination" is a qualitatively different act from "murder" or "killing" in that assassination requires that the victim be a public figure (and so, soldiers would not qualify). However, if it is likely to prevent (or at least soften) future edit wars, then by all means include it. As you note, it's just 7 letters. As for "during the" vs. "of the", I would go with the second as "during the" refers to the time period 1983-present, whereas "of the" refers specifically to the conflict.

<dd>If no reliable sources attribute assassinations to the government, then no such "assassinations" should/will be included in the article. The pagemove does not in any way "hide" the fact that the LTTE carried out these assassinations. Any reader who sees the "Pepetrated by" column populated with "LTTE" over and over and over again will get the idea. I see one significant difference between the two titles: lists of things that are "attributed to" someone or something are inherently problematic, as "attributed to" implies a lack of verifiability. We shouldn't replace it with "carried out by" as this makes the article POV (some of the attributions are in dispute). Basically, what I'm trying to say is this: the pagemove does not involve any real change in content, but it does avoid the possible POV related to this title. As I have previously noted, I fully support the new title. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 21:06, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I thought that we are supposed to be making readable length articles in Wikipedia. Do we really want to combine two pages to make a mega list of assasinations, keeping in mind that Sri Lanka has had literally hundreds of assasinations of political /notable figures. How is any one going to read such a long list. Even if we consider notable people , i can see there are plenty of people who have not been listed in both lists. its better to keep the main articles separate. <a href="../../../d/u/t/User%7EDutugemunu_3722.html" title="User:Dutugemunu">Dutugemunu</a> 13:00, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The new article does not hide the fact that the LTTE committed all of the assassinations; in fact, this is prominently displayed by the "Perpetrated by" column. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 17:20, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The fact that you are opposed to keeping this article as "attributed to" because you say it "implies a lack of verifiability" and agree to the new article which lists everything as "perpetrated by" because that doesn't "hide the fact that the LTTE carried out these assassinations", but at the same time you oppose renaming this article "carried out by" because "some of the attributions are in dispute" shows me an inherent lack of understanding of the conflict. The LTTE does not accept any responsibility for any of their "terrorist" attacks. Only the military ones. What makes you say the LTTE killed Premadasa, Ghandhi or Kadiragama? Do you even know whether they accepted responsibility for them? The reason they are carried out by / attributed to (whichever we decide to call it) the LTTE is because they bear all the hallmarks of the LTTE and no other organization is likely to have carried them out. And how can the title be POV for saying (well cited) the truth? I'm not getting that. Plus the fact that raveen opposes using the Tamilnation and Sangam citations on this article, but has no problem with using them on the other one. That is called duplicity. Doesn't really matter anyway cos those are POV and non RS websites and I have better citations for this article. And the fact the other article contains entries not even remotely connected to the civil war says to me this we need to keep this one. --<a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowolfd4_dd28.html" title="User:Snowolfd4"><font color="#9696A0" face="Tahoma"><b>snowolf</b></font><font color="#0A0096" face="tahoma"><b>D4</b></font></a><sup>( <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnowolfd4_35b8.html" title="User talk:Snowolfd4"><font color="#339966" face="Constantia"><b>talk</b></font></a> / <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Snowolfd4_5371.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Snowolfd4"><font color="#CC0099" face="Constantia"><b>@</b></font></a> )</sup> 18:48, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>You are misunderstanding my point. I really don't care whether the column is titled "Perpetrated by", "Carried out by", or "Attributed to". Each one of them <i>can</i> be disputed as problematic, so none is much better than the others. However, I am opposed to problematic claims of attribution and/or perpetration <i>in the article title</i>. That is the difference. What it should show you is the difference between noting a controversial phrase in the title and noting it somewhere in the text, not "an inherent lack of understanding of the conflict". I admit that I am not an expert on the conflict, but I was well aware that the LTTE often does not claim responsibility for its attacks (and also that it underreports its losses and overreports GOSL losses, and also that the GOSL at times overreports LTTE losses, and also that they accuse each other of massacres of civilians, and so on). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 20:42, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Snowford and iwazaki are both quick to say that the articles that are pro LTTE are not reliable source but then they hide behind their own little SATP and AsianTribune. I do not seem to get how something like tamilnet fails WP:RS and then SATP and AsianTribune passes WP:RS without a problem. Mabe Raveen should also take that to meditation and see if we are all willing to come to a final decision on which is truly RS and which is not. <a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWatchdogb_a098.html" title="User:Watchdogb">Watchdogb</a> 20:20, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Watchdogb I do not want to be inconsiderate to your sentiments but we need to stick to the matter on hand. That is the community consensus of <b>LTTE assasinations versus Notable assasinations</b> titles. Tamilnation came into the picture, because I removed it from this article and Snowolfd4 objected and I explianed why. If we take it to mediation (we should await further discussion before doing that) it should be only on merging these two articles not about Tamilnation, Tamilnet or Asiantribune. Just my opinion.

(I say "functionally" because it historically preceded the other article, so it hasn't been created with that intention. However, I feel that the decision to keep a POV version in addition to an NPOV version amounts functionally to the same as creating a POV fork.) That is certainly not a reason to keep the latter.

All the EROS, ENDLF and their assiasinations and counter assasinations etc. Anyhow you have to categorize these assasinations and categorizing it by the perpetrator seems a meaningful way to do it in my view-<a href="../../../d/u/t/User%7EDutugemunu_3722.html" title="User:Dutugemunu">Dutugemunu</a> 00:39, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since this is not an official mediation, and since the three opposing editors have not applied for <a href="../../../s/l/r/WP%7ESLR_2364.html" title="WP:SLR">WP:SLR</a> membership, I have no mandate or obligation to represent them. Nevertheless, I want to regard their needs. The fact that we see some unconvincing arguments could indicate that there are other, unexpressed, needs which the "... LTTE" article satisfies. If that is the case, then there could be more at stake than just a harmless redirect. If that is the case, then I recommend bringing it up on <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>. — <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastianHelm_63db.html" title="User:SebastianHelm">Sebastian</a> 19:04, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><s>::AFD is a drastic step but I am not averse to it. I would like to follow Wikipedia conflict resolution process as Black Falcon suggested, if we fail to reach consensus here we should request for comment then go to official mediation. Infact an AFD will resolve this problem within 10 days after putting it up for AFD because we already have a neutral article. But if we put if for AFD and delete it then the 3 opposing editors will see it as a defeat for them. I am proposing to take it easy and talk it out.This article discussion and the process it takes to resolve itself should be template that all Sri Lanka specific editors can use to resolve their conflicts in the future. Of course SLR is already there if they want a short cut. This can also be a teaching tool that we Sri Lankan specific editors who have been noticed by the wider Wikipedia community of late for heated discussions and other activities, can learn from. That is, how to resolve conflicts without trying to metaphorically kill each other.

<dd><b>oppose to redirect</b>: Even though 99.999% of the murders were carried out by the LTTE, notable something article amazingly uses the word <b>most</b>, not <b>almost all</b> to describe those assassinations!!..Also, I don't see any valid reason not to have the LTTE's name in the title..Anything which does not mention its name make no sense to me..Assassinations attributed to the LTTE is a well written article and so far i have not seen substantial POV pushing there, certainly not compare to highly POV forks such as state terrorism in Sri Lanka..I would appreciate it, if the people, who are insisting in making everything NPOV ,take actions to erase those clear POV forks first..Thanks<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki"><font color="blue"><b>Iwazaki</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/w/a/User_talk%7EIwazaki_7b86.html" title="User talk:Iwazaki"><font color="red">会話。討論</font></a></sup> 00:57, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Come now, is that really a reason to oppose the title itself? That single word, "mostly" can be replaced through editing. But, I do not think that wording ("mostly") should be removed. The article currently lists 50 assassinations, of which 15 (30%) are unattributed ("Unknown"), 32 are attributed to the LTTE (of which 6 are disputed), and 3 are attributed to others (2 disputed). From my knowledge of the conflict, I would say that 95%+ of assassinations (not murders, not killings) are carried out by the LTTE. However, that knowledge is not important as every assassination must be <i><a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">attributed</a></i> to the LTTE. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 01:17, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Title is one of many reasons, but it certainly stands out from the rest..What ever the lexicon used here, it is a fact that LTTE is responsible to <b>all most all the killings</b> in the article,hence a strong title should be their to indicate that..Due to extreme propaganda by the LTTE and its boot lickers , most of the western world don't know the truth and as wikipedian its our duty to inform readers about the cruelty of those terrorists..People who search net using key-words such as <b>LTTE</b> ,<b>murders</b>, <b>assassinations</b> ,should be able to read whats written in wikipedia. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=assassinations+and+murders+by+LTTE&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=assassinations+and+murders+by+LTTE&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Google Search for "assassinations and murders by LTTE" gets wikipedia article on the top</a>..The notable one follows it but do not say these are mainly by the LTTE, it merely says these murders were carried out by the GOSL(surprise government comes first),then Paramilitary groups and <b>last</b> the LTTE&#160;!!

<li>A "strong title should be there to indicate that" ... Why? NPOV requires <i>neutral</i> titles, not "strong" titles. I'm not sure whom you mean by the LTTE's "boot lickers", but it is <b>NOT</b> "our duty to inform readers about the cruelty of those terrorists". Our "duty" is to present information from reliable sources in a neutral manner. Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#SOAP" title="WP:NOT">not the place for political advocacy</a> for or against anything, regardless of how rephrehensible we perceive the actions involved to be. The last part of your response confuses me: you write that the "Notable assassinations ..." article says the assassinations were carried out by GOSL, paramilitary, and <i>then</i> LTTE. Where do you see that? The version I'm reading states this:</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Since the onset of the Sri Lankan Civil War in 1983, militant and paramilitary groups have assassinated many public figures on suspicion of being sympahtizers or informants, in retaliation for killings and attacks, to eliminate competition from rival groups, or to stifle dissent.[1]</i> <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 02:34, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>You write that you see nothing wrong with "Assassinations and murders attributed to the LTTE", but the fact is that many entries in that article are unattributed. If the title were the more neutral "Notable assassinations ...", we could simply write "unknown" or "citation missing" until such time as a source is provided. For this article, that is not the case, because the title clearly specifies that it's about assassinations that are "attributed to the LTTE" and not just assassinations that took place. I hope you will consider this. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 01:17, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, if there is a reliable source that states that "most", "almost all", or "99.999%" of assassinations in Sri Lanka are attributed to the LTTE, it should be noted in the article (I will look for one). A source that gives a breakdown by various Tamil and/or non-Tamil groups would be even better. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 01:32, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Do you know who killed him? Unless you're well versed on the situation in Sri Lanka I'm not sure how useful it will be to continue this discussion.</dd>
<dd>And can you by any chance provide me a <b>neutral</b> citation that says with 100% certainly the assassination of Rajiv Ghandhi was "perpetrated" by the LTTE?

<dd>Sorry, but I don't. We, as editors, should not try to establish or determine the truth. Rather, we should present what <i>others</i> have said. If the BBC writes that the LTTE assassinated Ghandi, then we note that Ghandi's assassination was carried out by the LTTE and cite the BBC. Is this a fact that we know beyond <i>any</i> doubt? No. Does it matter? No. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth.</a> -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 00:18, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the redirect is to "Notable assassinations of the Sri Lankan Civil War" then I agree to redirect. Simply because these people have died because of the Srilankan Civil war. This is the perfect sort of wiki name that we try achieve. If you think deeply these people actually die or were assassinated because of the civil war. Besides whats the point of this "we need to have ltte in this"? It's not like anyone is trying to hide that the ltte is behind these assassinations anyway. If Iwazaki means we need this title to get a hit on google then he is wrong. We clearly have Assassination, LTTE and Srilanka on this page and google will very easily pick it up specially if there is a specific name. Finally it is not proper to accuse people and attack them here Iwazaki.

<p>Arguments and counter arguments are not going to take us anywhere, because there is no judge to give a verdict in this case. It's a case with only a jury and no judge&#160;:-) and the jury is us. As I said, if the opposing parties could point out just the things that you want to see changed in the new article we can reach some consensus, I don't know whether this is helpful, Buddha taught Mettha(Loving kindness), Karuna(compassion), Mudhitha(Appreciative joy) and Upekkha(Equanimity) and I don't think there is anything to loose by looking at issues at wikipedia in these angles, in brief if something hurts me, it would hurt another person the same way, so please try to keep a cool head.
