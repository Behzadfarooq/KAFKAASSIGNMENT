<p>Graded exams are amateur qualifications in music. They are (in most cases) offered from Grades 1-8 and have three standards of pass: a straight pass, a pass with merit and a pass with distinction. There is no requirement to have any previous grades before taking a new one. However, to encourage broad musical knowledge, the ABRSM require Grade 5 Theory, Practical Musicianship or Jazz to be passed before one can take Grades 6-8 Practical exams. There are 3 exam 'sessions' in a year, in and around March, June and November. Passes in grades 6 to 8 in either theory or practical exams may be used as part of the <a href="../../../u/c/a/UCAS_0da7.html#UCAS_tariff" title="UCAS">UCAS tariff</a> in obtaining a <a href="../../../u/n/i/University.html" title="University">university</a> place. The four types of graded exams are as follows:</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Board_of_the_Royal_Schools_of_Music_97c5.html" title="Edit section: Practical Exams">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Practical Exams</span></h3>
<p>These are by far the most commonly taken exams. Available for over 35 instruments, these exams consist of 4 different sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Set Pieces</b>. The student is required to play three pieces (four, known by heart, for singers doing Grades 6-8) prepared beforehand. These pieces are selected from the current syllabus for the instrument and grade, usually one piece from each of given groups. For most instruments, two of these pieces are played accompanied, with the third played solo. Each piece is marked out of 30. The passing mark is 20. (For Grades 6-8 singing, the pieces are out of 24/24/21/21 for each piece, the pass mark being 16/16/14/14 respectively.)</li>
<li><b>Scales</b>. Various <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musical_scale.html" title="Musical scale">scales</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/p/Arpeggio.html" title="Arpeggio">arpeggios</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broken_chord.html" title="Broken chord">broken chords</a>, according to the grade of difficulty, are examined. Scales are marked out of 21. The passing mark is 14.</li>
<li><b>Sight Reading</b>. The student is presented with an unseen piece, has 30 seconds to prepare, and then must play to the best of his or her ability. Sight reading is marked out of 21. The passing mark is 14.</li>
<li><b>Aural Awareness</b>. Various exercises are played by the examiner and the student is required to demonstrate skills in listening to music, for example clapping the rhythm or singing the melody. Aural is marked out of 18. The passing mark is 12.</li>
</ul>
<p>The exams are marked out of 150: 100 or more is a pass; 120 or more is a pass with merit; 130 or more is a pass with distinction.</p>
<p><a name="Theory_Exams" id="Theory_Exams"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Board_of_the_Royal_Schools_of_Music_97c5.html" title="Edit section: Theory Exams">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Theory Exams</span></h3>
<p>These are written papers on the topic of musical theory. They are marked out of 100: 66 or more is a pass; 80 or more is a merit; 90 or more is a distinction. A Grade 5 theory pass is necessary in order to advance further than grade 5 on any Associated Board musical instrument graded examinations.</p>
<p><a name="Practical_Musicianship" id="Practical_Musicianship"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Board_of_the_Royal_Schools_of_Music_97c5.html" title="Edit section: Practical Musicianship">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Practical Musicianship</span></h3>
<p>These exams are designed to test an understanding of rhythm, melody, key and notation together with the ability to sing and play from memory, and improvise and to recognise changes to and answer questions about a score.</p>
<p><a name="Jazz_Exams" id="Jazz_Exams"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Board_of_the_Royal_Schools_of_Music_97c5.html" title="Edit section: Jazz Exams">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Jazz Exams</span></h3>
<p>These are the newest types of exams, with jazz piano first being offered in 1999. At present, they are only available for <a href="../../../f/l/u/Flute.html" title="Flute">flute</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano.html" title="Piano">piano</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clarinet.html" title="Clarinet">clarinet</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/x/Saxophone.html" title="Saxophone">saxophone</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/u/Trumpet.html" title="Trumpet">trumpet</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trombone.html" title="Trombone">trombone</a>. They are also only available from Grades 1-5. They are marked in the same way as practical exams. However many of the pieces include large improvisational sections, where the instrumentalist is required to fill in the empty bars with their own melody to fit the standard chord progression listed above.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Board_of_the_Royal_Schools_of_Music_97c5.html" title="Edit section: Diplomas">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Diplomas</span></h2>
<p>The ABRSM offer diplomas in three disciplines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Music Performance</li>
<li>Music Direction</li>
<li>Instrumental/Vocal Teaching</li>
</ul>
<p>For each discipline there are three levels of award:</p>
<ul>
<li>DipABRSM (Diploma of The Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music)</li>
<li>LRSM (Licentiate of the Royal Schools of Music)</li>
<li>FRSM (Fellowship of the Royal Schools of Music)</li>
</ul>
<p>These are professional qualifications, and entitle the owner to append the letters after his or her name.</p>
<p>The content of the DipABRSM, LRSM and FRSM (Instrumental performance ONLY) are divided as follows: Section 1, Recital; and Section 2, Viva Voce and Quick Study. Candidates perform various pieces from a selected list and may select works other than those listed but should not exceed one third of the entire recital programme. Recital time for DipABRSM is 35 minutes,for LRSM is 40 minutes while for FRSM the time range is around 50 minutes.</p>
<p>Before the Viva Voce, the candidate must submit a written programme notes on the day of the exam (for FRSM, the written submission should be submitted <i>with</i> the application form, in the form of an essay with in-depth analysis and requires sophisticated knowledge of the history, context of the composer as well as the era in which the works were composed) which should include background information as well as sufficient information and analysis of the works that are performed. The examiner(s) would engage in a conversation with the candidate concerning the notes submitted as well as other related questions that would allow the candidate to demonstrate his or her knowledge as a professional musician.</p>
<p>The Quick Study would be a short piece with an equivalent difficulty of an ABRSM Grade 6 piece (for DipABRSM), an ABRSM Grade 7 piece (for LRSM) and an ABRSM Grade 8 piece (for FRSM).</p>

<p>The ABRSM's publishing department was first set-up in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1921.html" title="1921">1921</a>. It was used to provide suitable music for examinations, performance editions of popular works and provide new instructional compositions. One of the original editors was <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Donald_Tovey_ad1a.html" title="Sir Donald Tovey">Sir Donald Tovey</a> who wrote informative notes on the music which are still highly-regarded today. The department grew, until 1985, when ABRSM (Publishing) Ltd. was established as a separate company.</p>
<p>They continued to produce copies of popular works, along with commentaries from distinguished <a href="../../../e/d/i/Editing.html" title="Editing">editors</a>. They publish contemporary music in their 'Spectrum' series of books. They also publish a variety of publications for beginners and younger instrumentalists.</p>
