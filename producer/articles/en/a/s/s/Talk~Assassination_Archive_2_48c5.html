<h2><span class="mw-headline">Important note!</span></h2>
<p>This article incorrectly refers to Nizarene Ismaili Shia as being a sect of the past. The historical "Assassins" were not all wiped out when the Old Man of the Mountain's citadel was destroyed - that portion of the sect that had already spread into India survives today. Their leader is the Aga Khan, a direct lineal descendant of the prophet Mohammed. They are generally a peaceful people, and do not call attention to themselves; their doctrine requires them to be good neighbors unless they are opressed, which nobody is stupid enough to do any more. For more information on the religion see <a href="http://www.iis.ac.uk/ismailis/ismailis_l2.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.iis.ac.uk/ismailis/ismailis_l2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.iis.ac.uk/ismailis/ismailis_l2.htm</a> or simply contact the Aga Khan through one of his many businesses, foundations, universities, etc.</p>
<p>I've editted the article to include the info below, however, I'm adding it here as well in case it is removed from the main page:</p>
<p>The information presented as ‘fact’ with reference to Ismailia on the Wikipedia site is both controversial and inaccurate. These substantial concerns; based primarily on the lack of credible sources, deal with the slanderous descriptions of the Nizari sub-sect of the Ismailia as a people that habitually used drugs and involved themselves in targeted killing(s). The importance of credible citation in the academia need not be extolled here, however as the aforementioned warning indicates, the neutrality of the information herein has been challenged, precisely because of the lack of any sourcing, leading to the conclusion that this is simply conjecture. The Ismailia sect has been documented throughout history in a capacity of the quietist denomination within the foray of Islam. Their contributions have been well documented.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Initial Discussion re: current revision</span></h2>
<p>I think, if I might be so bold, that the article is informative but just too concentrated on the anti-assassination side (myself being a pro-assassination liberal, ironically enough). Would anyone mind terribly if I took a crack at evening it out? I mess it up, y'all can revert no problem, and if it works, it works. However, I am kind of jumping in here, so if you all would prefer not that's cool too. Just an offer.&#160;:) <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 21:27, 6 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Hi, <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a>. I see you haven't started yet. I was going to second <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a>'s objection of the WP:FA candidates page, but decided it might be more productive to spend my 0.02 here. Some points which I thought needed work:
<ul>
<li>Writing. There are parenthetical insertions with no closing parenthesis. There are multiple run-on sentences of more than forty words; consider breaking them up and re-organising them. There are sentences with dashed insertions where the material on either side of the insertion does not join up; either rewrite the closing of the sentence, or break it up into multiple sentences. Paragraphing and section heading is disorganised and confusing - there are major sections with respectively just one, two or three sentences. The three section headings discussing motives could be combined in one. Nine paragraphs consist of a single sentence, and in many cases it is unclear why they have been given a whole paragraph.</li>
<li>Comprehensiveness. We need much more on history prior to the 1960s (e.g. <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Caesar_5dfd.html" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>, <a href="../../../o/d/o/Odoacer.html" title="Odoacer">Odoacer</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hashshashin.html" title="Hashshashin">hashashin</a> and the <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusades.html" title="Crusades">Crusades</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medici.html" title="Medici">Medicis</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borgia.html" title="Borgia">Borgias</a> etc), and a discussion of political <i>effects</i> (e.g. <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria_362b.html" title="Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria">Archduke Ferdinand</a>). Perhaps also practical matters (e.g. <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodyguard.html" title="Bodyguard">bodyguards</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armoured_car.html" title="Armoured car">presidential limos</a>).</li>
<li>Accuracy. I am no expert on the area, but a lot of it strikes me as opinionative stuff of doubtful reliability, e.g. "...paid killers have always been felt necessary...". I am also skeptical of the refutation of the common etymology of the name; if you exclude items derived from this page, it fails the Google test, whereas a few years ago I read a book on the hashashin where the first two or three chapters could be considered supportive of the conventional etymology. I don't think that paragraph should be included unless supportive evidence can be found.</li>
<li>POV. 100% of assassinations actually mentioned are actual or alleged acts of the US, and much of the last three paragraphs are just generally anti-US stuff that is not even related to assassination. I would at least completely remove the stuff that is not about assassination. -- <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecuriger_6d53.html" title="User:Securiger">Securiger</a> 15:43, 8 Mar 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Okay, just to be really brief, I eliminated much of the discussion from later in the article as I saw little relation between that and the topic of assassination (what US troops in Afghanistan do hardly qualifies as relating to the subject, in my opinion) and tried to streamline it to provide a more smooth and coherent evaluation of the subject and relevant questions, with opposing views of each (not to mention historical evaluation). It almost feels like I've forgotten something, but I'm rather too tired to examine it now.&#160;:P Let me know what you all think of the changes, and if they constitute an improvement over the last.</p>
<p>Also, btw, can I get some clarification on the etymology? I'm a little hazy on that one, and think I may have mistaken it, so I'd appreciate a specific double-check on that.</p>

<p>No problem. Added the final section, "techniques". The links probably need more than a few fixes, and I haven't gone over it for grammar mistakes, but it's 95% complete. If you and others like what they see, I might be ambitious enough to put it up as an FA.&#160;:P <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 03:41, 23 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>Also, as a note for Hans' Zarkov, I reverted on your note about execution because when a government performs an execution, it is not for reasons political but rather those of jurisprudence (murderers, for example, would never be confused for persons assassinated). Even those committing treason could be said simply to be executed, since while their rebellion is political, the punishment is not considered so, unless it's trumped up. If a government should authorize the killing of a foreign dignitary, or whatever, it clearly is assassination. The reason, therefore, I removed it is because I felt the distinction was already clear in the minds of even the most idle reasons and including the disclaimer would, indeed, cause more confusion than leaving it out.</p>
<p>Hit me back here or at my talk page to discuss more. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 03:51, 23 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<hr />
<p>no offense but this speculation on prehistorical assassination is kind of, you know, complete and utter guessing with no evidence to back you up.</p>
<p>Well, no offense...whoever you are, but I make it quite clear, I feel, that it is just that - speculation. That, and I think it's broad and plausible enough to be useful, if not certain - I've been able to find very little on prehistoric assassination and so resorted to conjecture. Do you have any specific objections to anything in there, or have anything to support/contradict me? If so, that would be very useful and productive to the article, and would be much appreciated. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 03:12, 24 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article, at present, reads a bit too much like propaganda.</p>
<p>Wiki, being in the US, has considerable latitude on free speech...</p>
<p>So when in doubt, be bold...</p>
<p>Let's explore in this article:</p>
<p>1. How are assassins selected? 2. How are they trained? 3. How do they, er, do their job? 4. How successful is it, anyway (in terms of target dying)? 5. How many are actually caught?</p>
<p>Leave the "is this a good idea?" for the reader. Inform, don't preach.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That being said, we seem to be focusing on the US and Israel too much. The UK also does it (via SAS, particularly in Northern Ireland), for example.</dd>

<p>--<a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPenta_b06b.html" title="User:Penta">Penta</a> 03:54, 28 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>For my information when I go back to edit, how/why/where does it sound like "propoganda", specifically? I just want to make sure I know, because this is what I saw as my level best to lay out both sides of each part of the discussion. The morality of assassins was pretty central to the whole discussion, I thought, so it at least deserved treatment - assuming it's possible <b>to</b> treat it, how do you think it could be done better?</p>
<p>Also, if you read the techniques and counter-techniques sections, I thought it rang out fairly well how they conduct the work. As for training and selection, that's out of my scope of expertise, unfortunately, so I could not speak to that. As for numbers 4 and 5, I think that information (ESPECIALLY number 4) would be kind of hard to work out, since it depends how you define an attempt on someone's life (just talking, plotting, setting up for the act, actually taking a shot?), and of all the assassinations and attempts in history (that we know of) I doubt there's a hard count.</p>
<p>However, any place where you think it could be made better, <i>especially</i> in NPOV, please let me know, I'd like very much to pinpoint that so I know where I tripped up. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 07:08, 28 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>OK, some quick thoughts. I'm kinda distracted, mind.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1. We leave out *why* Assassination is practiced in the modern age. There are many reasons, not just bloody-mindedness or doing it for the hell of it. <i>Why</i> modern states would assassinate people (whether it be the ticking bomb scenario (as in Gaza and the West Bank), the deterrence factor (Again, see the aforementioned regions; Hamas now has much of its comms and control capability in tatters because of Israeli direct action operations), or simply "We can't capture him, but can't leave him operational either") is as important as <i>Should they or shouldn't they?</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. OK, so limit the period we try to count the attempts in. Try....since World War II.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3. NPOV...Hm. It just seems to focus on the US and Israel too much in its examples. Call it a gut feeling.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">More Examples, Color</span></h2>
<p>Hey... wonderful article. I must say, it kept me reading. However, while examples have been drawn predominantly from Western countries (especially with the pictures), it might be good to add other stories. There is the famous story of <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shivaji.html" title="Shivaji">Shivaji</a>, a <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> king of Western India... disarmed during 'peace' talks in an enemy Mughal general's camp, he used concealed <i>tiger-claws</i> to slash his captor's general's stomach apart. Then, there's the murder of <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahatma_Gandhi_e9af.html" title="Mahatma Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a>, wherein the assassin, a man named Godse, did namaskar (placing palms flat together, a traditional Indian greeting) to conceal a pistol in his hands, thus allowing him to get close to the leader (surrounded by hordes of people) and shoot him.</p>
<p>So, you might want to improve on an already excellent page by diversifying examples. I don't want to put them in myself without consultation because the format is not conducive to people randomly inserting examples. I will write the text, however. But, aside from that, great show. --LordSuryaofShropshire 00:51, Apr 12, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Regarding the intro sentence</span></h2>
<p>The intro sentence as it stands now is <i>In its most common use, assassin has come to mean someone who kills (assassinates) people selectively, usually for ideological or political reasons.</i> I think this should make some mention of the fact that an assassin kills <i>important</i> people, but my edit was reverted. If I kill my neighbor because simply because he is of some certain political affiliation, does that make me an assassin? I'm going to stick the word "important" back in there unless someone can give me an explanation why it shouldn't be. -<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyCapp_92c0.html" title="User:AndyCapp">AndyCapp</a> 04:31, 26 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>After making those changes, <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadanedwa_b002.html" title="User:Badanedwa">Badanedwa</a> also listed this article on <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_removal_candidates_42f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article removal candidates">Wikipedia:Featured article removal candidates</a>. I do not know how that page is supposed to work; it has only existed since 25th of March this year, and has no talk page. However the introductory paragraph gives as an example reason that "the page has since been changed". Of course this was done, but by Badanedwa! Claimed reasons were "extensive redundancies; copyvio; no pov changes; original scheme good, kept; typos; grammar; wiki links; cogency". With more than 300 changes in one edit, it's difficult to tell which is meant to be which! Glancing through them, a few seem quite reasonable, some definitely not (e.g. "In the final analysis, it has proven inevitable that assassinations will succeed if the murderer is willing to go the lengths necessary.", correctly spelled words changed to incorrect ones, etc.), but in most cases I cannot understand why an apparently arbitrary change was made. I certainly have no problem with adding links - as Wikipedia grows, most articles will continue to have links added from time to time, and this is almost always an improvement - but links were also removed. Why? At least, the changes other than adding links need to be broken up a bit so other editors can understand the reasoning. (And in particular, which is the alleged copy vio section, and why?). Finally, I agree with Wally about "pov judgments re: islam"; not objecting to adding the link to the Ismailis, but the tone of the paragraph has altered to make it sound more like an ordinary Islamic view. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecuriger_6d53.html" title="User:Securiger">Securiger</a> 03:42, 27 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I reverted for exactly the reasons <b>I</b> specified on my summary, sir (And <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecuriger_6d53.html" title="User:Securiger">Securiger</a> did an excellent job of addressing them). I'm not at all claiming ownership of this article, because it's not mine (and if you click on the difference between the current revision and my last major one, you'll notice there's been a high number of changes indeed - front page articles get that). <b>However</b>, from the beginning a very dedicated group of people have been working on this article (myself, Securiger, Raul654, etc.) and have put in not a few hours ensuring it reaches the place it is now (this is not even mentioning users like <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyCapp_92c0.html" title="User:AndyCapp">AndyCapp</a> who, even though their question was but one of style, brought it here for discussion so that the people who built the article to what it is can have a say. Do I mind you making changes? Of course not. The writing may be good, but it's not perfect. Do I mind you making an <b>extensive</b> change, not just stylistically but also to the basic structure and/or information inherent in the article, and then shortly after listing it for removal from FA? Yes, I do. If you don't feel it's FA material, please list it and say so, because that's the post of the removal can. page - however, don't change it and then say the fixed version is hopeless. It toes the line between chasing your tail and trolling. What you did was technically fine, but practically such a sweeping edit was done in a very rude and uncivil way, especially given the level of other Wikipedians who passed through this article and found nothing major of the sort incorrect.</dd>

<p>(&lt;-- jump back to left to avoid falling off the edge). You <i>might</i> be able to argue in court that such a small fragment is fair use, but I dunno, I'm not a lawyer. It's simpler, and fairer in spirit, to change it. Basically someone back in early February copied a chunk of <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Heritage_Dictionary_17e6.html" title="American Heritage Dictionary">American Heritage Dictionary</a> verbatim, someone else largely removed it but missed two sentences, which were subsequently edited only slightly.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">UK assassinations</span></h2>
<p>"The United Kingdom, through its Special Air Service and Force Research Unit have also conducted assassinations of Irish Republican Army members and sympathizers both in Northern Ireland and elsewhere in the world."</p>
<p>UK assassinations of IRA members (and *sympathisers*)? This is thrown in like it's common knowledge but I'd like to see some more information on this please.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I checked up on this one in <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0304363790/ref=sr_1_1__i1_xgl14" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0304363790/ref=sr_1_1__i1_xgl14" rel="nofollow">Secret Soldiers: Special Forces in the War Against Terrorism</a></i> (a scholarly work of 620 pages and thousands of detailed references) as well as various press reports of the investigations. The frequently made allegation has been subject to both criminal investigation and various forms of inquiries - officially, privately, and by the Press. Of all this, the closest thing to substantiation is the proven fact that the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Force_Research_Unit_167a.html" title="Force Research Unit">Force Research Unit</a> (a military intelligence unit largely unrelated to the SAS, but with some former members in its ranks) leaked information about IRA suspects to a "loyalist" (anti-IRA) paramilitary informer, Brian Nelson. Nelson was the intelligence officer of the <a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster_Defence_Association_4bde.html" title="Ulster Defence Association">Ulster Defence Association</a>, and undoubtedly provided the authorities with valuable intelligence information on terrorist activities. But he also provided UDA with information supplied by his handlers, and this information was used in the assassination, by the UDA, of several IRA members and even of persons who were merely suspected of being IRA sympathisers. Nelson received a ten year prison sentence, and has since died from cancer. Whether Nelson's handlers were actively colluding, or simply spectacularly incompetent, remains a matter of controversy; the latest official report has recommended that Brigadier Gordon Kerr (commander of FRU at the time) be prosecuted. It should also be noted that at the time Nelson was infiltrated into the UDA, it was still a legal organisation whose terrorist activities were unproven; its banning as a terrorist organisation in 1991 was partly as a result of Nelson's information.</dd>
<dd>So I think we can say that the UDA conducted assassinations of Irish Republican Army members and sympathizers in Northern Ireland, and that the FRU probably colluded in this. However claims that the SAS were involved, that the FRU performed assassinations directly, or that such operations were carried out outside Northern Ireland, are at best unsubstantiated allegations from hostile sources, and in many cases nonsense (e.g. SAS troopers intercepting armed IRA men <i>en route</i> to a terrorist attack, kill them in ensuing gun fight; IRA sympathisers describe it as an "assassination"). <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecuriger_6d53.html" title="User:Securiger">Securiger</a> 02:00, 10 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I think the main incident for SAS action was Gibraltar. Although oreiginal reports did claim that the three IRA terrorists shot dead in 1988 had been armed, and had just planted a bomb, and that the SAS were therefore acting to prevent terrorism and believed their lives were in danger, eyewitness reports contradicted this and within days the Home Secretary (Geoffrey Howe) admitted that the three had not planted a bomb and had not been armed. More than that, intelligence supplied to the SAS indicating that the IRA had developed a remote detonator (the later defence used for the killings) turned out to be bogus.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Semtex and a timer were later found in a car connected to the three, parked in Spain. They almost certainly were going to blow something up, and the morality and legality of the killing is debatable, but it seems like a clear case of assassination. And Gibraltar is far from being the only time the SAS assassinated someone they suspected of being in the IRA - just the only time it was well-publicised (because there were eye-witness, and probably because the SAS men on the ground - though not their political masters - thought they were preventing an immediately imminent atrocity). Of course, if these actions were more well-known, the SAS wouldn't be doing the job it was created to do.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Your description above contains a number of widespread myths. For example your claim "intelligence ... indicating that the IRA had developed a remote detonator ... turned out to be bogus" is completely wrong. This particular IRA team turned out not to have such a detonator, but in fact the IRA had been using them for years, and had used one in a car bombing in Belgium just a few weeks before the Gibraltar operation. Likewise "... eyewitness reports contradicted this" refers to the impression given by a certain documentary maker, and by the families of the deceased, that many eyewitnesses saw the terrorists trying to surrender. In fact of <b>79</b> eyewitnesses, only three made statements that tended to support such a view. (Needless to say, these three were focussed on exclusively by those with an axe to grind, or seeking to stir controversy.) Two of these three were at a considerable distance from the events, and looking down at a steeply inclined angle. One thought one of the shooters jumped over a railing; the person who jumped the railing was actually a policeman arriving a few seconds later, which calls into doubt whether this witness actually saw the shooting at all.</dd>

This is the report of the European Court case, and about the strongest condemnation by anyone who doesn't actually have an axe to grind. It is often cited as concluding that the three terrorists were unlawfully killed. In fact it does nothing of the sort; it finds that the soldiers acted lawfully and there was no conspiracy to kill the terrorists, but did find that the Gibraltar authorities showed "... a lack of appropriate care in the control and organisation of the arrest operation". That's all; the Court rejected all other claims. The Court's final decision on the issue of assassination is this: "The Court therefore rejects as unsubstantiated the applicants' allegations that the killing of the three suspects were premeditated or the product of a tacit agreement amongst those involved in the operation". Given that, regardless of whether one considers excessive force to have been used, it cannot possibly be counted as assassination. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecuriger_6d53.html" title="User:Securiger">Securiger</a> 05:45, 11 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some members of the intelligence services broke the law and supplied information too and aided loyalists in targeting Republicans. But that is a long way from the HMG authorising SAS conducted assassinations. Members of a ASU killed when carrying out an attack or conduction a reconnaissance may be unlawfully killed (for example if they attempt to surrender and are then shot) but they are not assassinated. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 13:20, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>As with the UK mention against the IRA, I have some problems with including the School of the Americas. Shouldn't the usage of the word "allege" tell us that this is unsubstantiated rumour? Unless we get an officer from the SOTA telling us that they have a course in Assassination 101, I would ask that we remove that reference.

<dd>Normally I'd agree, but not only is there fair circumstantial evidence (testimonials and whatnot) floating around about the SotA, at the very least it's a rumor a lot of people have heard, and we can neither confirm nor deny it truthfully; however, since it is something people hear, it's addressed, with the word "allege".</dd>

<dd>Well, it still doesn't belong here, until we see official or credible evidence of Assasination from the SotA. Much of the "evidence" out there is published by parties with specific political agendae and axes to grind against the school. Unfortunately, the school itself will never confirm or deny such policy. We might as well start putting "the CIA allegedly shot Kennedy" and "Jews allegedly masterminded 9/11". Once Wikipedia starts including rumours, it is a short hop to consipracy/polemic goofyland. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavejenk1ns_646b.html" title="User:Davejenk1ns">Davejenk1ns</a> 12:49, 9 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree. When a rumor is widely-known and has a dedicated group of adherents, and their allegations can neither be confirmed nor denied, we have a duty to at least note that a rumor does exist (and, to my mind, not necessarily such a silly one... no one I've queried has been able to give me a reasonable purpose for what SotA <i>does</i> do for their size and funding). But you have a very good point; it's not at all provable beyond a reasonable doubt. I still object to removing it all, but perhaps we could flesh it out a little more as a compromise?</dd>

<dd>Hrmmm, an op-ed piece from the Guardian doesn't hold much water for me, but... well, I am not trying to defend the SotA, but let's get back to the focus of this article: assasination. To say the SotA "teaches" assisnation is misplaced. It most likely teaches counter-insurgency, interrogation, commando tactics, and other unpleasantries of modern warfare, but the acutal skills of "assasination" can be found anywhere-- aim the gun, pull the trigger. (Remember <a href="../../../f/u/l/Full_Metal_Jacket_35d6.html" title="Full Metal Jacket">Full Metal Jacket</a>?). These skills are just that: skills. Assasination connotes (as stated in the article) killing in the name of a certain motivation (political, sexual, mental obsession). There must be a definable difference between assasination and simple combat killing.</dd>
<dd>Certainly, many graduates of the SotA are baddies, but <b>Correlation is not causality</b>. I would posit that pet officers of the nutjob running many of these banana republics end up being the ones to get chosen to go to Georgia (obviously an honor for a military man), but their disposition toward unseemly acts (inlcuding assasination) doesn't have much to do with the school. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavejenk1ns_646b.html" title="User:Davejenk1ns">Davejenk1ns</a> 11:30, 11 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not neccesarily. Though I wouldn't characterize the Family as "fascist" you could be an "anti-goverment fascist" assuming you mean the <i>current</i> goverment.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">a list of assassinations would be useful</span></h2>
<p>There are so many lists in Wikipedia, it seems a list of assassinations is in order--especially because the entry stakes a claim on a definition (even if this definition is emergent, or still-to-emerge). I think there are also factual issues to be checked. (What topic could possibly call more for fact-checking than this one???) This is important work. I have a dream that, in the future, people of the world can come here to find out what has happened...simple as that. Not to drag this out, but I stopped reading the article (I will go back and do my best to make as numerous and specific criticisms as I can) at the mention of John Lennon. I believe it was in a high school class that I was shown a documentary about Mark David Chapman, and it was obvious that this was not a "crazed fan" but an emissary, intended or not, of the fundamentalist church whose dogma he believed. I will do more research and fix the line, but it seems this article is FAR from finished. As long as I'm here, the entry for Robert Kennedy claims he was killed by Sirhan Sirhan's point-blank shot. This is somewhat disgraceful. Even-handedness is necessary. There are so many unaddressed details about this assassination, that there should be an article just on IT. At the very least, we must acknowledge that all witnesses and evidence placed Sirhan no closer than 3 feet to Kennedy.</p>

<p>Who is to judge who is the "arsonist" with a "firefigther", or who is the terrorist and the freedom fighter? I do not think that assassination is a loaded term and if you look a the previous section in this article I have asked for a source which says that it is. See <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_assassinated_people.html#israel_and_Palestinian_Authority_Territories" title="List of assassinated people">List of assassinated people#israel and Palestinian Authority Territories</a> Your idea would suggest that we need two list one for "List of assassinated people" and another for "List of targeted killed people" Who is to judge who goes in which list? For example was Rehavam Zeevi "targeted killed" if not then what about Sheikh Ahmed Yassin?</p>
<p>In American domestic politics there is a need for them to use a different term if the American executive is to assassinate a forigner, but that does not make the word itself a "load term". Many English spleaking countries now have a "ministry of defence" which were previously called "ministry of war" but that does not make war a "loaded term".</p>
<p>As I pointed out on the <a href="../../../t/a/r/Talk%7ETargeted_killing_5c1c.html" title="Talk:Targeted killing">Talk:Targeted killing</a>, assasination covers both peace time and war time "targeted killings" and on both sides of the fence for example:</p>

<p>Rigoberto Alpizar (who I had never heard of before) was not assassinated or "targeted killed" any more than <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Charles_de_Menezes_a252.html" title="Jean Charles de Menezes">Jean Charles de Menezes</a> was they were either murdered or lawfully killed.</p>
<p>In the definition "anticipated acts of terrorism are prevented by killing a person deemed to be related to those acts." Who defines who is a terrorist? If I were paranoid I might decide someone was trying to kill me and be terrified at the thought. If I were to kill that person would that be a targeted killing?</p>
<p>Few it any would say that an IRA Active Service Unit member killed when on active service were "assassinated" or "targeted killed", any more than they would do so for any member of military unit engaged in warfare eg Mairead Farrell (leader of the Gibraltar three) who was killed in 1988 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/7/newsid_2516000/2516155.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/7/newsid_2516000/2516155.stm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. They are more likely to say "who?", "don't know", "lawfully killed" or "murdered" (as she was unarmed) depending on interest and political affiliation. If she was subject to "targeted killing" then when <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Stone_%28loyalist_paramilitary%29_f970.html" title="Michael Stone (loyalist paramilitary)">Michael Stone</a> was bundled into a black taxi boot after his grenade attack at the funeral of the three, was that an attempted "targeted killing" as it stopped an <i>act of terrorism by attempting to kill a person deemed to be related to those acts</i><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/war/troubles/gallery/loyalist/gall18.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/war/troubles/gallery/loyalist/gall18.shtml" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>? The two British Army soldiers dragged from their car and killed by an IRA mob a week later at the funeral of one of those killed by Stone <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/nireland/stories/timeline880320.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/nireland/stories/timeline880320.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> could by the definition you gave be called targeted killed. Because the people at the funeral were <i>anticipating an act of terrorism and prevented it by killing two persons deemed to be related to the anticipated act</i>. Seems to me that the definition can be used to justify an awful lot of killings which are not assassinations, so why is it that most of the times that the US administration uses the term it is used for assassinations? --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 10:41, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It was <u>your</u> idea that these terms are interchangeable, and now you are asking why one is not used instead of another? See their respective definitions: they have different meanings. Also, the word <i>assassination</i> has negative emotional/ideological/political overtones. Intentionally or not, your proposed merge would lead to losing that difference and imposing POV.

<p>No, it does not. I find using examples helps to clarify meanings, so please explain why the above are or are not "targeted killings" as to my mind they fit the definition you have given "anticipated acts of terrorism are prevented by killing a person deemed to be related to those acts", which to me makes the definition almost useless.</p>
<p>Also you have not answered the question: who defines who is a terrorist? For example when the IRA tried to take out the British Cabinet in 1991 during the first Gulf war, as the IRA believe that the British had a "shoot to kill" policy against them in Northen Ireland was that attack a "targeted killing" attempt?

<dd>In case I didn't make this clear earlier: we need a separate article because "targeted killing" is a stated policy. It is because of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy we need an alternative to emotionally/ideologically charged terms like "assassination".</dd>
<dd>Who defines: <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">my or your opinion don't matter</a>. It would be wrong to redirect or merge TK into "assassination" because the opinions of authoritative sources differ, and the article's intro honestly says "controversial" and includes links arguing various cases.

<ul>
<li>Just because a person or organisation uses an euphemism for something does not mean that the euphemism is a valid distiction from a common English word.

<p>This article is very unencylopedic in scope and style. It needs a lot of work. A lot of things need sourcing, like: * <i>One remarkable recent example involved a political figure who made the mistake of keeping to a regular route and schedule.</i> - Who, When? How recently?</p>
<ul>
<li><i>indeed, the death in battle of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, while not an assassination, led directly to the Catholic defeat at Lützen as the infuriated Swedes rallied behind their fallen leader</i> .. Says who? I've never heard the battle described that way, and I've read accounts of it in several history books. They all describe the battle as having been won <i>despite</i> the loss of the King, not thanks to it. And the Wikipedia article on the battle corroberates that with: <i>A panic began among the Protestant ranks, made worse as rumours spread of the king's death.</i>.</li>
<li>The overall style is rambling and imprecise. Full of "weasel-words" and sweeping generalizations. It reads like a high-school report, not an encyclopedic entry.</li>
<li>No sources, and the impression I get is that most of the article is based on the authors' personal opinions, i.e. original research.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another example: <i>As the Middle Ages came about from the fall of the Roman Empire, the moral and ethical dimensions of what was before a simple political tool began to take shape.</i></p>
<p>First off, it's factually wrong. The Middle ages started centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire. Secondly, it's intent is wrong: There were no ethical dimensions to assassination prior to the Middle Ages? I find that hard to believe. Who says the 'ethical dimensions' began to take shape then, other than the author?</p>
<p><i>Although in that period intentional regicide was an extremely rare occurrence</i></p>
<p>Says who? I don't believe regicide was 'extremely rare' in the Dark Ages at all.</p>
<p><i>the situation changed dramatically with the Renaissance when the ideas of tyrannomachy (i.e. killing of a King when his rule becomes tyrannical) re-emerged and gained recognition.</i></p>
<p>How can it re-emerge if it didn't go away?</p>
<p><i>There were notable detractors, however; Abd-ul-Mejid of the Ottoman Empire refused to put to death plotters against his life during his reign.</i></p>
<p>Anachronism, Abd-ul-Mejid didn't live anytime near the renaissance, you can't skip four centuries like that.</p>
<p><i>As the world moved into the present day and the stakes in political clashes of will continued to grow to a global scale, the number of assassinations concurrently multiplied.</i></p>
<p>Weaselly and interpretive. Multiplied according to who? Any figures on that?</p>
<p>I could continue through the entire article. But I've made my point. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluePlatypus_82c6.html" title="User:BluePlatypus">BluePlatypus</a> 21:56, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't see why there should be any question of the etymology. Arabic: حشاشين, translates as 'consumers of hashish', hashish (حش) being the arabic word for grass and referring quite specifically in this since to marijuana. According to the Encyclopedia of Islam: "Derived from the Arabic <i>hashshashin</i>, 'consumers of hashish', through Medieval Latin <i>assassini</i>. The name was adapted by crusaders for members of the Nizārī branch of the Ismā'īlīs at a period when the sect was characterized by extreme militancy." A basic understanding of how words are formed in Arabic would rid someone of the confusion of the origin of the word. -<a href="../../../y/u/n/User%7EYung_Wei_b5ff.html" title="User:Yung Wei">Yung Wei <sup>綪永徽</sup></a> 15:12, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I came to this page after reading Time magazines bio on TEDDY Roosevelt. It mentions an assasination attemp on him. He was shot while campainging (as a private citizen) for the presidency and his Bull Moose 3rd Party. He had a steel eyeglass case and thick speech in his breast pocket which slowed, but did not stop the bullet. Although he was not president at the time, seems like he should be on your list of notable assisination attempts. Along with any other serious presidential candidates who've been shot at. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.24.227.102 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.24.227.102_943e.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.24.227.102">contribs</a>) 23:48, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>I dont think its a strong POV thing. #3 looks to be a grammar issue. you could say the "third in command" rather than #3 man.</dd>
<dd>The second item looks to be just phrasing. Rather than "the US was blamed" it could be rephrased "the US was suspected by some"... Since a footnote citation is given as to the surce of the claim, it doesn't look to be a major POV (if any at all) thing here.</dd>

<p>There is no mention in the article of the murder of Martin Luther King. Though not elected to public office, his case is one of even greater political involvement than John Lennon - and so would be a "harder case" to classify.</p>
<p>Che Guevara would be another "hard case" to classify, I think.</p>
<p>The Dahlgren Affair was not an unambiguous attempt at targeted killing of only specific individuals. It was a planned attack on an entire city in time of war, apparently including the killing of the leaders of the rebellion. Should all killings during war of leaders of opposing forces (military leaders as well as political) be counted as assassinations?</p>

<dd>Good question. War and political leaders are a legitimate target in a conflict, provided an official state of war as recognized under international rules of war exists. The hit on Yamamoto during WWII is part of the game as was cruise missle strikes against Saddam's palaces. Che's case is more difficult. He was leading an armed band in Bolivia, directly engaged in armed guerrilla operations, but he was also operating outside the rules of the Geneva Convention in many ways, such as lack of clear, consistent combatant identification. Some would argue that he thus was not entitled to any Geneva protections, in the same way that the Sept 11 bombers (or any other suicide bombers) are not entitled to Geneva Protections since they ignore its rules to gain tactical advantage. Running for Geneva Cover after capture, after cynically ignoring or violating it before when it was convenient, smacks to many of hypocrisy, and of handing murderous terrorists another way to game the system. Arguments to the contrary could of course be made. It is weird that Martin Luther King is not even mentioned on this article, whereas marginal (in this context) entertainment industry figures like Marvin Gaye and Jodie Foster are.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fidel Castro body double</span></h2>
<p>The article states that "The late Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, Cuban ruler Fidel Castro and Saddam Hussein all used body doubles". An editor has pointed out this Fox news source <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,41210,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,41210,00.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> which says the same thing. Now I'm 95% certain that in the case of Castro, this is not true and is at best an urban myth. Castro frequently appeared in public with minimal security in comparison to most leaders, was famous in Cuba for wandering out on his own, boasted that he didn't even wear a bullet proof vest on a visit to New York - and proved it - etc etc. I heard an unlikely story that older brother Ramon acted as a body double - which came from anti-Casto activists and had very little credibility. Regardless of what Fox news or a US army guy says it runs contrary to well documented evidence, neither of the above should be considered a credible source on Cuba by the way.--<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 15:14, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's fine that you feel that way, but if an expert on the subject claims it it's worth putting in there. I also made sure it just says that 'he believes', and that there is no conclusive proof. If someone wants to draw the conclusion that he's biased for whatever reason that's fine. But it's not a requirement that we state that is the ONLY source that says this, we can't verify there are no other sources, but we can verify that is a valid source. Now I personally have no love for Fox News, but it is a major media outlet, and Reeder is a qualified person to quote, it's not like we're quoting O'Reilly or something. <a href="../../../l/i/l/User%7ELilDice_d087.html" title="User:LilDice">LilDice</a> 15:25, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>After Castro survived numerous assassination attempts made by the US alone, you'd have to prove that he <i>did not</i> have doubles running around as decoys. It's an incredibly simple security measure and obviously one that can be ready made to fool foreign intelligence services looking to knock a leader off. Despite the ban on directly killing heads of state, the US has a neat little habit of diverting munitions to military targets of opportunity that just happen to be holding heads of state.

<dd>One cannot easily prove a negative. One can only point out that there is acres of material showing Castro wandering around Havana and elsewhere with minimal security - the numerous occasions he has slipped out into the night whilst on foreign visits - even in the States. The numerous serious biographies that have never mentioned a body double. One can also point out the credibility of the source. Either a US intelligence guy on Cuba is honest, accurate and correct on the subject of Fidel Castro, or two million Cubans who live in Havana and have often witnessed the very real Fidel Castro wandering the streets are correct. It matters little, but I trust the residents of Havana - my own eyes - and a knowledge of the subject – over some "US army guy".
