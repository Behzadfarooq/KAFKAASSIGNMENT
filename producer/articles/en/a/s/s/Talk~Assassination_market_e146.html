	    <p>The final sentence of the article, "If the concept is taken up as civil disobedience as suggested by Jim Bell then this could easily lead to the end of all open and above ground government anywhere on earth," seems a bit too apocalyptic for a serious encyclopedia.</p>

<p><br />
this is kind of intense, but given the sophistication of Al Qaeda etc., I am quite sure we are not telling them anything here they don't already know...</p>
<p>Interestingly, much of the material describing this stuff is no longer on the open web...</p>
<dl>
<dd>This isn't true really. Large proportions of the very early cypherpunks archives are on the web. <a href="http://cypherpunks.venona.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://cypherpunks.venona.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> This topic was discussed there heavily 1993 onwards. The ideas are all covered at a broad level in Cyphernomicon and Bell's Assassination politics articles.</dd>

<hr />
<p>The "Jim Bell" link to zolatimes redirects to another location which yields 404 "File not found".</p>
<p>The final sentence of the third paragrpah is incomplete. It ends "it is substantially more difficult to assign criminal liability for the action(s)." Substantially more difficult than what?</p>

<p>Tim May had already discussed the idea of cryptographic protocols enabling the existence of abhorrent markets (such as assassination markets) before Jim Bell's "Assassination Politics" post (which was intially to the cypherpunks mailing list, iirc.</p>
<p>I personally recall seeing such discussion in the extropians mailing list ~1993-1994 and on cypherpunks in 1994.</p>
<p>Tim May is easily discovered on Usenet, so finding his email address is simple. I recommend contacting him for his version of events.</p>
<p>This discussion is peurile imo because Jim Bell is misrepresented and unable to defend himself.Jim was the first to bring out the great libertory and freeing effects that assassination politics would bring to the world. Quite the opposite tack to the neo-nazi Tim Mays ' abhorrent' markets. Jims conception was less of a market and more of a mass movement of civil disobedience and he is quite explicit about that toward the end of his ten page essay. Jim was investigated, charged and is serving hard time today whereas no one knows where the neo-nazi Tim May is and no one cares. Jim Bell was arrested and charged while at the same time the pentagon was stealing the concept and renaming it ' Policy analysis markets.' Shades of the infamous theft of PROMIS software from the INSLAW company.From my reading of the cypherpunks list it peaked with the genius, Jim Bells contributions circa 1996-7 and then declined rapidly under the flaming racist meglomania of the neo-nazi Tim May. Stuff about Jim is stored at Cryptome inc trial testimony and he should be released in 2010, a prophet without honor in his own land and in his own time, Jim Bell is a latter day Martin Luther King and assassination politics is the death warrant for all governments.</p>

<p>The article says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>the assassination of major figures such as Saddam Hussein would have an immediate impact--very profitable for anyone anticipating it.</dd>
</dl>
<p>With the capture and imprisonment of Saddam Hussein, this remark appears to be obsolete.</p>

<p>I changed Hussein to King Fahd of Saudi Arabia - that seems to solve the problem raised above, and also probably constitutes a better example than Hussein, because even before his capture Iraq's participation in world oil markets was highly restricted, whereas Saudi Arabia is a massive force in oil, and so the assassination of King Fahd would likely have even greater effect.</p>

<p>There are two concepts of <i>assassination markets</i> that are used in this entry, and they are quite different. They are horribly mixed up in this article.</p>
<p>The first is that of a <a href="../../../f/u/t/Futures_exchange.html" title="Futures exchange">futures exchange</a> where you can (anonymously or not) speculate on the assassination of a certain individual on a certain date. This is similar to the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Policy_Analysis_Market_8f2c.html" title="Policy Analysis Market">Policy Analysis Market</a> that were suggested and that are highly discredited by now.</p>
<p>The second is that of assassins, who themselves (or their peers) profit financially from the assassinations they carry out through bets in financial markets. This is not an 'assassination market'. It is just <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insider_trading.html" title="Insider trading">insider trading</a> in well-established markets.</p>
<p>My suggestion is to just merge this into <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prediction_market.html" title="Prediction market">Prediction market</a> - and keep it there as a footnote - <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocendoDiscimus_4b33.html" title="User:DocendoDiscimus">DocendoDiscimus</a> 18:54, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Against! I dont agree with you. This article should be kept as a separate part. It concerns the theory about assasination markets as proposed by Jim Bell (or whatever his name is) both as a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a> and as he (Tim) thought about it. Also, and this is equally important as the first argument, it considers what impact cryptography mixed with capitalism/crypto-anarchism (<a href="../../../o/n/i/Onion_routing.html" title="Onion routing">onion routing</a> esp.) has on society. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 193.11.232.248 (<a href="../../../1/9/3/User_talk%7E193.11.232.248.html" title="User talk:193.11.232.248">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_193.11.232.248_1d59.html" title="Special:Contributions/193.11.232.248">contribs</a>) 21 July 2006.</small></dd>

<p>The article seems to imply that Al Qaeda traders made a trillion dollars on shorting airline stocks after the 11 September attacks. As the NYSE total market cap is about $19.7 trillion I find it very hard to believe that any group could make 5% of this on one series of trades. I'm going to tone down this claim unless someone can come up with a reputable cite. <a href="../../../l/i/s/User%7ELisiate_1b7e.html" title="User:Lisiate">Lisiate</a> 01:40, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I read at the time that there was Al Qaeda was suspected of manking about $200 million ”going a bear” on airline stocks; this money was probably more about raising fianances than an alternative justification for the act. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott197827_7beb.html" title="User:Scott197827">Scott197827</a> 22:48, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I don't see how it could be read to even remotely imply that al-Qaeda made a trillion-dollar profit on 9/11...rather, it's simply referring to the severe decline that occurred on the stock markets that day (which may indeed have decreased the NYSE's total market cap by a trillion dollars) <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 15:30, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
