<dd>Except for Reuters, AP has no real English-language competition; the other services you name dominate in other languages.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">History of AP, <i>Brass Check</i></span></h2>
<p>To a Minister of Truth: I suggest <i>Brass Check</i> is a good book for the state of the AP at the turn of the century - there's more to it than Teletypes, after all. And if AP again has a monopoly on wire-servicing (in the animal-husbandry sense) the US public [just how is the UPI comment to be interpreted?], how that has played out in the past ought to be of interest. Especially since the AP is the sole collator of "election" "results" tomorrow.<a href="http://www.exit-poll.net/faq.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.exit-poll.net/faq.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://english.people.com.cn/200411/02/eng20041102_162442.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://english.people.com.cn/200411/02/eng20041102_162442.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> And if you protest <i>Brass Check</i> is not about the AP, I'll point out the older Library of Congress catalogue entries list "Associated Press" as one of its categories. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwantus_5aca.html" title="User:Kwantus">Kwantus</a> 00:52, 2004 Nov 2 (UTC) (PS: count y'self lucky I merely mentioned the book, and didn't start rewriting the article.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are many, many books about the history of U.S. journalism that contain information about AP which might be of interest to this article, but "Brass Check" isn't one of them. It is wildly out of date (especially if you think it has relevance to the current situation; when it was written, AP was a struggling underdog). But of course you are welcome to start rewriting the article - that's the way Wikipedia works! - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidWBrooks_491e.html" title="User:DavidWBrooks">DavidWBrooks</a> 01:39, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So put some of THOSE books in, fer cryin out loud. (wait. what? How can what is for years an indebted monopoly spreading completely inverted or entirely fabricated news with impunity qualify as "struggling underdog"?) Incidentally, check history (unless WP has discarded it for lack of space) -- I am <i>not</i> welcome, even when what I write is well-supported. As a for instance: <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nurse_Nayirah_755c.html" title="Nurse Nayirah">Nurse Nayirah</a>. (I do not contest that this is because of a certain immoderateness in my writing: after the outrage I've watched go on just the past four years - thanks in part to a US press that, in what counts, lies and covers up as baldly as Sinclair described 85 years ago - I cannot be moderate. If there were moderates taking my place I'd be happy; but so many waste themselves on <b>absolute</b> bread-and-circus garbage like <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Idol_ef58.html" title="American Idol">American Idle</a></i>.)

<p>If we're going to list every retracted story that AP, or any other wire service, has run over the years, we're going to have to double the size of wikipedia!

Discussion about the merits, or lack thereof, of the wire service are certainly valuable additions to the article, but not in the form of a rant. - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidWBrooks_491e.html" title="User:DavidWBrooks">DavidWBrooks</a> 16:57, 5 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Explanation of AP fees</span></h2>
<p><i>This was originally posted on the Reference Desk with the title "Is news public domain?"</i></p>
<p>It seems from the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a> article that facts are in the public domain, but reporting of them may not be. A news agency might do a lot of work to collect some news and expect just compensation. So how is it that news stories can be "picked up" by competing agencies, e.g., the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a> picking up a story in a local newspaper? Isn't that local news story under copyright? Is there a fee involved or some sort of professional agreement? Thanks. <a href="../../../m/j/k/User%7EMjklin_c7bc.html" title="User:Mjklin">Mjklin</a> 15:10, 2004 Nov 16 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As you can see from the article on the AP, it's owned by its contributing newspapers. A local newspaper allows its stories to be used by the AP because it has the opportunity to use AP wire stories itself. So, the answer is that the news story is certainly under copyright, and the only fees/professional arrangements involved are the money and agreements necessary to maintain the AP.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 15:16, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ok, but the AP seems to be a special arrangement. Does "picking up" happen in any other situation, say, between <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsweek.html" title="Newsweek">Newsweek</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_Housekeeping_3724.html" title="Good Housekeeping">Good Housekeeping</a>? What about if <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsweek.html" title="Newsweek">Newsweek</a> picked up a story from a British paper?</p>
<dl>
<dd>In cases other than AP - and in some cases involving AP - there is simply a price schedule for using articles established in advance. You can publish AP articles on your own personal website if you pay the fees. Or, a bunch of newspapers will be owned by the same company which will share articles among its different papers. American papers in particular are often part of large chains, where two newspapers in cities on the opposite sides of the country may have identical news stories on the same day for all or nearly all their non-local news.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In short, it all stays under copyright but the rights are presold or prelicensed because news breaks too quickly to ask for explicit permission. Selling news stories is a source of income for some newspapers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is no special reason why newsmagazines can't do this too, but magazines don't usually buy stories from wire services (sometimes, but not usually). The fees are proportionate to mean circulation, so Newsweek would have to pay a lot if it used wire articles, and people wouldn't read it much for last week's AP wire feeds. So this sort of thing doesn't much happen. Now, magazines do sometimes exchange stories, but then it's usually negociated specifically for that article and money changes hands. There are sometimes standard fee schedules for reprinting and translating stories, but that means publication in a different market or at a later date. <a href="../../../d/i/d/User%7EDiderot_346d.html" title="User:Diderot">Diderot</a> 16:01, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Just yesterday, The <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati_Enquirer_6350.html" title="Cincinnati Enquirer">Cincinnati Enquirer</a> carried an AP story from <a href="../../../a/k/r/Akron%2C_Ohio_8a85.html" title="Akron, Ohio">Akron, Ohio</a> about a big series on home-schooling the Akron Beacon Journal is doing this week. The AP routinely moves stories that tell everyone else what is being reported on. One reason is to let editors know there's something they might want to get reprint rights on.<br />
Now as for a story being picked up by the AP, one of the conditions of membership, is that the AP is entitled to exclusive rights to distribute breaking local news. So if a plane crashes in Seattle, the AP could pick up everything the Post-Intelligencer and the Times wrote and every AP subscriber would be free to use it. This does not apply to where a paper's bureaus elsewhere break a story, investigative reports, columns, reviews, and the like. (Thought syndication deals often exist for this material, just not through the AP.)<br />
Facts <i>are</i> in the public domain. And for an older Associated Press story you needn't worry so much about infringement because the story has gone stale. However, the AP and others have won court cases--I don't have the citations at hand--where radio and television stations who weren't subscribers simply rephrased AP stories and put them on the air; these precedents are from the 1920s and 1930s. The courts have reasoned that if everyone were allowed to piggyback on the AP's labor then nobody would go into the business of newsgathering and there would be no news since everyone decided to be a freerider rather than a subscriber. The Toledo Blade newspaper got a settlement from a tv station a couple years ago that was basically reading the morning paper on the air.<br />
Again, I don't have the citations, but a long time ago--in the 19th century, I believe--the courts ruled you couldn't copyright information such as stock quotes, commodities prices, prices quoted on merchandise, etc., notwithstanding the disclaimers you see today on Bloomberg and CNBC.<br />
As for the workings of the AP, it is a non-profit memership co-operative. Every general interest daily newspaper in America (there are around 1,500) is a member plus some college and weekly papers. Their fees are determined on circulation, so USA Today (circulation 2 million) pays a lot more than The Battle Creek Enquirer (circulation 9,000). (This is how rates for features such as comics and columns are determined, a small paper might only pay a couple dollars a week for them.) Broadcasters, internet sites, and others can subscribe to the AP, but the service is run primarily for the benefit of the newspapers. Back in the 1920's the AP resisted letting radio subscribe until it realized the cash cow it could be and now the income from broadcasters and the rest is icing on the cake. <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedanticallySpeaking_fbd8.html" title="User:PedanticallySpeaking">PedanticallySpeaking</a> 17:08, Nov 16, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Accusations of Bias</span></h2>
<p>I don't see a big reason to delete this section. Someone learning about the AP may be interested in others' perceived bias. A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22associated+press%22+bias&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22associated+press%22+bias&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">google search</a> for '"associated press" bias' reveals 210,000 websites. That is not insignificant, albeit not all will directly address <i>them</i> being biased. The section in question (rewritten a bit by me since last inclusion):</p>
<p>The AP has <a href="../../../c/r/i/Critics.html" title="Critics">critics</a> who believe its news judgement is biased. Some claim that frequent coverage of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_invasion_of_Iraq_768c.html" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">hostility in Iraq</a>, including hostage <a href="../../../b/e/h/Beheading.html" title="Beheading">beheadings</a> and perceived <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a>, panders to a western audience and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States's</a> point of view while ignoring <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civilian_casualties.html" title="Civilian casualties">civilian casualties</a> caused by the so-called <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coalition_of_the_Willing_c84a.html" title="Coalition of the Willing">Coalition of the Willing</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">keep bias section</span></h2>
<p>I perceive AP to be biased, which means that AP is not as neutral as it's made out to be. I'm sure others also think so. A bias section is thus necessary. Modify or expand the section about alleged bias, but don't delete it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I trimmed the bias section. Complaining because a US-based organization, whose clients and components are largely American, interviews Americans more than non-Americans seems a bit silly. You might as well say that Agence France Press is "biased" toward francophones. - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidWBrooks_491e.html" title="User:DavidWBrooks">DavidWBrooks</a> 14:40, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>A rudimentary understanding of bias is necessary.</p>
<p>It is not only a decision of which stories to cover. It is almost irrelevant which stories are covered if there is no inherent bias. If the stories themself are unbiased while the range of stories is limited to subject matter that is biased with respect to the inclusion of some subjects and the exclusion of others, the lack of bias within the stories will to a large extent mitigate that bias. The potential for abuse is there but likely a public outcry will occur if excluded issues are not covered. Exceptions continue such as the lack of reporting even to this day regarding ongoing riots in France. Also the issue of conditioning audience expectations is relevant to story selection.</p>
<p>However none of that deals with the inherent bias plainly visible in stories run by AP on a daily basis wherein the NEWS component has been replaced with OPINION ABOUT THE NEWS. It is more subtle to a degree than categorizing which stories get coverage and which do not get any attention.</p>
<p>Putting forward opinion AS THE NEWS is essentially biased and this sort of commentary heretofore (over 10 - 20 years ago) were always LABELED as NEW ANALYSIS or other euphemisms for opinion. Shortly, I will present a sample of news bias by AP from a small sample of two or three days of articles. Further one can easily demonstrate bias and a conditioning or developmental type of bias by usng certain words to replace the actual identity or subject of a article. (i.e. "youths" rather than "muslim rioters")</p>
<p>AP bias in the presentation of its "news articles" is certainly a serious issue and democracy, and freedom-threatening issue. As stated above, of English-language, USA-centric news sources, there is little competition for AP in the press. PhilipGBarnett11/21/05:10:53HST</p>
<dl>
<dd>Make sure that by "bias" you don't mean "failing to accent the part of the story that I think is most important" - i.e., "not slanted in the way I favor." Most of the time, that's what people mean by the term. - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidWBrooks_491e.html" title="User:DavidWBrooks">DavidWBrooks</a> 12:53, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The phrase above "Make sure," is arrogant. It interestingly assumes some sort of authority where none exists. It is interesting to note the post is from a newspaper reporter.</p>
<p>This supposed admonition is false on its definition of bias, its support of inherent bias is telling and it is not logical.</p>
<p>How is that?</p>
<p>Is it correct to say that one may not observe bias if one favors a particular opinion in a news report which has not been labeled as opinion?</p>
<p>Further, to state that by one's experience, people report they have observed bias in AP reporting, and then those reports are automatically assumed as unfounded as a result simply because of their disagreement with the opinion or viewpoint in the AP news, is incomplete unless you go further to show the details of the instance since the observers very well may have found an example of bias in the AP report they disagreed with.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It is because if the somehow biased observer reports an opinion from an AP news report as being objectionable to them, then they are in fact reporting inclusion of opinion in the news reports, which, on its face, would in fact be a correct observation of bias.</p>
<p>So when doing real analysis of a subject, in this case AP news content, one cannot simply make pronouncements about what bias "usually is" in their opinion and stand ready to delete any objection to an opinion that has been reported as the news, in the news, as unwarranted and unfounded when the observer of the AP news bias also happened to disagree with the unlabeled opinion without looking to see whether in fact there was an AP author's opinion originally expressed as part of that news.</p>
<p>An ideally objective viewpoint would exclude opinion. It contains facts. It may contain the opinion of others who are materially part of the story and when it does, to maintain an unbiased content, ideally it should include the opposing or alternative viewpoint(s) if there is any controversy.</p>
<p>If an AP author has an opinion about the topic he is writing about and segregated that opinion as an analysis or a introduction such as 'In my view...' there is no problem distinguishing the opinion of the AP author from the news that reporter is reporting.</p>
<p>It is just too simplistic and moronic to suggest that opinionated observers are disqualified from recognizing opinions of AP authors.</p>
<p>What is missing here is the very basic premise that bias stems from reporting opinion as news.</p>
<p>It is not of concern to an analysis of this phenomena, (the discovery of opinion within a news report), what the particular opinion is that is contained in the otherwise unbiased report of news, nor that of the observer.</p>
<p>First of all it is not the direction of bias that should matter. The idea that one needs to make sure one is not opinionated before observing bias is illogical when it is shown through discussion and example that the opinion was in fact given as AP news in a specific case.</p>
<p>The whole point here is "Is there bias in the reporting of AP news and its authors?"</p>
<p>Not the direction of the bias. Now certainly it is ever the more interesting to find if the opinion of a large and diverse group of AP authors are united in an opinion on a topic or an event that is in the news and they go about conspiring to fix the news with opinion-laced components that are all biased in the same direction. However, that is a detail and distinction within the topic overall, albeit one that ought to be determined with vigor.</p>
<p>Opinion should be labeled as such and not disguised as news.</p>
<p>If I am asked that I take one side in the opinion as the author of an observation of bias or inclusion of opinion in the AP news reports, as news, that ought to be irrelevant to my being able to prove whether or not there is opinion in that news article.</p>
<p>I disagree with the supposition that most observed bias in the media is simply a matter of disagreeing with a point of view put forward by the AP. It is the very fact that a slant of a particular point of view is being included as part of an article from a supposedly neutral reporting authority that demonstrate the bias. This authority is granted or expected based on the author's direct observation as assumed by the reader and the accurate recording of the facts and quotations, not the author's personal opinion, unless that opinion is conspicuously labeled as such.</p>
<p>The supposition that only an unbiased observer can find bias in a news report when the bias observed simply does not "accent to their opinion" or does not agree with their slant on the subject lacks logic as well. It presupposes that if I observe bias in a news report and I happen to disagree with the opinion favored in the biased report, that I am somehow disqualified from pointing out that the bias actually existed in the report to be begin with.</p>
<p>The idea presupposes that if I agree with the bias and I not so disqualified. This is at best a sloppy contention. At worst it is a direct interference with the goal of objective observation.</p>
<p>This sort of neo-bureaucratic edit does nothing to further advance discussion on the topic of whether the news published by the AP and its reporters does include opinion and whether that opinion possibly contains a purposeful slant one way or the other. Certainly a thoughtful topic contributor should be willing to put forward more effort than this to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Is disclosure of whether an AP author favors or or opposes a particular position or deliberately places one side of the story more or less prominently relevant to discussion of bias in AP news?</p>
<p>Yes it is.</p>
<p>The whole point here is opinion is not news.</p>
<p>That AP author's opinion is carried through content and emphasis and word choice.</p>
<p>Both a biased observer and an ideally objective observer must be able to demonstrate that bias exists in the AP reports in question and or uncover the fact that the AP author is a representative of a particular viewpoint whether by the author's undisclosed membership in a group with an inherently specific viewpoint or other undisclosed predisposition toward the topic or event.

<dd>IN CASE ANYONE IS STILL UNCLEAR ON MEDIA BIAS [Warren Bell]</dd>
<dd>This is the headline from a Wired News story that was pushed onto my Google mail page: "Bush 'Flat Wrong' On Kyoto" <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,69800,00.html?tw=rss.TOP" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,69800,00.html?tw=rss.TOP" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></dd>

<dd>Hmm. Well, it's a hard news story reporting that President Bush has been conclusively proven wrong in his policy on the environment and global warming, then, isn't it? Actually, naive reader, it's not. Here's the first sentence: "Former President Clinton told a global audience of diplomats, environmentalists and others Friday that the Bush administration is "flat wrong" in claiming that reducing greenhouse-gas emissions to fight global warming would damage the U.S. economy."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, how hard would it have been to make that headline: "Clinton: Bush is 'Wrong' on Kyoto"? I mean, it actually took some amount of effort to make the headline that misleading. Posted at 08:24 PM ##</dd>

<dd>Um, I see no "bias via headline word choice". The headline is quite clear as it stands. The blogger appears not to understand the meaning of quotation marks as used in newspaper headlines. <a href="../../../1/2/1/User%7E121a0012.html" title="User:121a0012">121a0012</a> 06:53, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here's another example. Please note the author of the blog post lets the WP piece stand on its own. The main supposition indicated in the WP article is Clinton as a centrist. However very recent votes indicate muc the opposite on the same criteria urged by the WP reporter.</p>

<dd>Agenda Journalism on the Front Pagge of the Washington Post</dd>
<dd>by Hugh Hewitt</dd>
<dd>December 12, 2005 05:58 AM PST</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Washington Post goes full Orwell today with its love letter to Hillary Clinton that begins:</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>At a time when politicians in both parties have eagerly sought public forums to debate the war in Iraq, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) has kept in the shadows.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Clinton has stayed steadfastly on a centrist path, criticizing President Bush but refusing to embrace the early troop withdrawal options that are gaining rapid favor in her party. This careful balance is drawing increasing scorn from liberal activists, frustrated that one of the party's leading lights has shown little appetite to challenge Bush's policy more directly and embrace a plan to set a timetable for bringing U.S. forces home.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Hillary Clinton is not a "centrist" on the war. As recently as November 15, she voted with Senator Levin to demand a timetable for withdrawal, an idea that is rejected by every serious proponent of victory in Iraq as the worst sort of defeatism.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Clinton intends just this sort of positioning for her 2008 presidential run, so it will be necessary to compile a detailed record of her Defeatocrat sentiments. Send me links to your posts on her record on the war, and I'll list them here. I welcome specific suggestions on what facts and quotes the Washington Post overlooked in its piece today.

<p>Here's an in depth analysis from Noel Sheppard via <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/articles.php?article_id=5067" class="external free" title="http://www.americanthinker.com/articles.php?article_id=5067" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanthinker.com/articles.php?article_id=5067</a></p>
<p>This is a great example of "how to" analyze the subject of bias in a real case. If some disagrees that there is any editorial bias in the sunject NYT report, he would best to state that case in at least as great a detail as Mr. Sheppard. Not likely!</p>
<p>[paste begins here] All the news the New York Times won't print December 12th, 2005</p>
<p>“Everything is always Bush’s fault.” That slogan would be far more appropriate for the front page box of the New York Times than the existing slogan, “All the news that’s fit to print.” When a pet cause like the Kyoto Treaty, addressing a pet scare like alleged man-made climate change is involved, inconvenient facts have a tendency to get lost, however fit for print they may be.</p>
<p>A front page New York Times story on Saturday concerning the global warming talks in Montreal placed all the blame for America’s refusal to move forward with the highly controversial Kyoto Protocol on the Bush administration. In doing so, the Times neglected to inform its readers about the history of this accord, or that the Senate in 1997 expressed its unanimous opposition to it. In addition, the Times completely ignored any of the obvious economic consequences to America if it entered into a global warming treaty that did not include China.</p>
<p>Yet, that didn’t deter the Times from identifying a culprit:</p>
<dl>
<dd>“In a sign of its growing isolation on climate issues, the Bush administration had come under sharp criticism for walking out of informal discussions on finding new ways to reduce emissions under the United Nations’ 1992 treaty on climate change.”</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>“Environmentalists here called [the chief American negotiator’s] actions the capstone of two weeks of American efforts to prevent any fresh initiatives from being discussed. ‘This shows just how willing the U.S. administration is to walk away from a healthy planet and its responsibilities to its own people,’ said Jennifer Morgan, director of the climate change project at the World Wildlife Fund.”</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Times conveniently neglected to address the history of this treaty. In particular, that the Senate voted in July 1997 95-0 expressing its unanimous, bipartisan opposition to then president Bill Clinton signing the Protocol. In fact, even Senator John Kerry (D-Massachusetts) voted against its signing, stating at the time of his vote:</p>
<dl>
<dd>“It’s just common sense that if you are really going to do something to effect global climate change and you are going to do it in a fair-minded way, we need to have an agreement that does not leave enormous components of the world’s contributors and future contributors of this problem out of the solution.”</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Times also failed to share any contrary viewpoints concerning the impact of the Protocol being fully implemented. S. Fred Singer, professor emeritus of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia and the author of “Hot Talk Cold Science: Global Warming’s Unfinished Debate,” had this to say in an October 2004 USA Today op-ed:</p>
<dl>
<dd>“Neither Bush nor the Senate has pointed out, however, that Kyoto is not only costly and unfair to the U.S., but it is also ineffective in averting a feared global warming. Scientists all agree that at best it would reduce the calculated temperature rise in 2050 by an insignificant one-tenth of a degree.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>“Russia has been more outspoken. The Russian Academy of Sciences, in a May 2004 report, questioned the reality of substantial future warming, concluding that Kyoto lacks any scientific base.”</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Times also failed to inform the reader of the economic consequences of America moving forward with this Protocol without the inclusion of all the major economic powers, specifically China. This is what Singer had to say on the subject:</p>
<dl>
<dd>“A treaty obligating developed nations but not China, India, Brazil and Mexico would produce huge U.S. job losses as industries moved overseas.”</dd>
</dl>
<p>Even former Clinton administration economists now question the financial wisdom of this accord. Jonathan Weisman, while still writing for the USA Today, wrote about this very issue in June 2001:</p>
<dl>
<dd>“Economists from the Clinton White House now concede that complying with Kyoto’s mandatory reductions in greenhouse gases would be difficult — and more expensive to American consumers than they thought when they were in charge.”</dd>
</dl>
<p>Weisman continued:</p>
<dl>
<dd>o “Clinton administration economists say that, in retrospect, their low cost estimates were unrealistic. They assumed that:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>o China and India would accept binding emission limits and would fully participate in the emissions-trading system, even though they never signed the treaty.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>o European opposition to emissions trading could be overcome.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>o Most industries and consumers would quickly adopt new, energy-efficient technologies, such as advanced air conditioning systems and gas-electric ‘hybrid’ cars, without financial incentives.”</dd>
</dl>
<p>Weisman then raised a fabulous point that has largely been lost in this debate:</p>
<dl>
<dd>“Since 1997, however, it has become clear that consumers love their gas-guzzling sport-utility vehicles and aren’t embracing energy-efficient technologies; China has no intention of participating in the treaty; and Europe still wants to limit emissions trading as a partial solution to global warming.”</dd>
</dl>
<p>To put this into proper perspective, until this year, when gas prices exploded through $2 per gallon, Americans have shown little appetite for energy conservation. As such, if the citizenry appears in opposition to behaviors that would reduce carbon emissions, why should American businesses be compelled to?</p>
<p>In addition, with the growing behemoth that is the Chinese economy – with its exponentially increasing appetite for all commodities including steel, concrete, soy beans, chicken, wood, and, yes, energy – any treaty that does not involve China would further expand its competitive edge over the rest of the world, including the United States. Clinton administration economists appear to agree:</p>
<dl>
<dd>“Leaving China out of a trading scheme would double the Clinton cost estimate, says Joseph Aldy, who helped develop the estimates for Clinton. ‘We always thought the (emissions) targets were very ambitious,’ he says. ‘But the thing that made us really uneasy about our analysis … was that if our assumptions didn’t come true, you could come out with costs that were much, much higher.’”</dd>
</dl>
<p>Since 2001, energy prices have been exploding without America’s commitment to these ambitious targets. Beyond this, a huge source of contention from the left and the mainstream media has been the outsourcing of jobs to other countries. If America had fully committed to emissions targets in this Protocol, there is no telling how many more American jobs would have been moved overseas, and what the price of gasoline, natural gas, heating oil, and electricity would be today.</p>
<p>As a result, it is extraordinarily duplicitous for mainstream media outlets to complain about rising energy costs and outsourcing while advocating America’s involvement in a global warming treaty that exacerbates both.</p>

<p>How useful is it to provide doubtful opinion.</p>
<p>What needs to be determined and provided is a definition of "fair use" - if an item under copyright can be obtained under fair use, then it is irrelevant whether others have made their use under fair use or fees paid, or illegally. In this question, simply because an AP photo appears on Wikipedia does not make it fair game for fair use applications. It is the application or proposed usage which is the determining factor as well as the ownership status of the image. Personal, non-commercial use may be fine, for example. Rather than use hypotheticals it is better to state the context. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 67.58.152.179 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.58.152.179_6796.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.58.152.179">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>Why does the current events section consist of only Guantanimo Bay? How does this inform about the AP? It could show that the AP is willing to press for documents and such, but that is not how it is presented. I don't want to make bias accusations, but it could come off that way as currently presented. It would seem having a current events section in wikipedia at all would be less reflecting an encyclopedia and more reflecting a newswire.</p>
