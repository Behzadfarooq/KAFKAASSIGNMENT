Hank Reinhardt</div>

<p>The ARMA concept grew from an original conception as a loose organization that would allow various Medieval and Renaissance sword practitioners and students of European arms &amp; armor to train and practice together (and was previously known as HACA - The Historical Armed Combat Association).</p>
<p>The HACA was originally conceived around <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> by Hank Reinhardt, then <a href="../../../p/r/e/President.html" title="President">President</a> of <a href="http://www.museumreplicas.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.museumreplicas.com/" rel="nofollow">Museum Replicas Limited</a>, and a few associates. His idea was to provide an <a href="../../../u/m/b/Umbrella_organization.html" title="Umbrella organization">umbrella organization</a> for individuals seeking some sort of group affiliation to share their common interest in Western <a href="../../../s/w/o/Sword.html" title="Sword">swords</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_medieval_weapons.html" title="List of medieval weapons">historical weaponry</a>. Reinhardt was not concerned with how people organized or what individuals called themselves whenever they got together—his concern was the rules they <a href="../../../s/p/a/Sparring.html" title="Sparring">sparred</a> under and the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical.html" title="Historical">historical</a> and <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physiological.html" title="Physiological">physiological</a> basis for these rules. He also desired a way to provide <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martial_art.html" title="Martial art">martial instruction</a> in historical European weaponry. To this end, Reinhardt advertised his newly formed group around a few of his long-time friends and associates. For a small fee, interested persons could obtain a membership that involved obtaining sparring <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guideline.html" title="Guideline">guidelines</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_network.html" title="Social network">networking</a>, and information on future events for <a href="../../../c/e/r/Certification.html" title="Certification">certifying</a> weapon proficiencies. Due to various complications, time constraints, and other reasons, Reinhardt was unable to follow through on his original plans.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>, after almost a decade of similar pursuits and seeing that the HACA was essentially <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defunct.html" title="Defunct">defunct</a>, long-time sword enthusiast and practitioner John Clements (now ARMA Director) obtained from Reinhardt permission to take over the HACA effort and try to make something out of the concept. Clements had begun a <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mentoring.html" title="Mentoring">mentoring</a> process through correspondence with Reinhardt starting in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> and had been growing increasingly distressed at the perceived emphasis on <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role-play.html" title="Role-play">role-play</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stunt.html" title="Stunt">stunt</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sport.html" title="Sport">sport</a>, and <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasy.html" title="Fantasy">fantasy</a> in contemporary efforts to practice Medieval and Renaissance fighting arts.</p>
<p>Desiring to bring greater legitimacy and credibility and a serious martial approach to historical Western fighting arts, in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> Clements reformed the HACA and developed its first small Study Group. Under the new Affirmations &amp; Study Approach, the HACA was thus reinvented as a <a href="../../../c/l/u/Club.html" title="Club">club</a> for historical Western martial arts research and practice. By establishing a virtual headquarters online in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> as one of the first historical fencing websites, the HACA was then able provide a gathering point for similar students and scholars of the sword worldwide. The emphasis grew to focus on the study of the historical <a href="../../../f/e/c/Fechtbuch.html" title="Fechtbuch">source literature</a> of Renaissance Martial Arts, much of which was presented on the website along with example <a href="../../../t/r/a/Training.html" title="Training">training</a> methods. After this, the HACA grew quickly. Some scholars feel that the HACA’s contribution to the Medieval and Renaissance martials arts was significant and its influence notable. Many of its innovations have also become standard for enthusiasts and practitioners. Throughout the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, the HACA was one of the leading organisations in the revival of Medieval and Renaissance fighting skills.</p>

<p>As the HACA grew and developed, its leadership came to the conclusion that the subject was richer and more involved than they had previously believed, and in conjunction with perceived changes in the emerging <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_fencing.html" title="Historical fencing">historical fencing</a> <a href="../../../c/o/m/Community.html" title="Community">community</a> itself (in part through the influence<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> the HACA and its efforts), the HACA’s leadership decided that a change was in order. It has crusaded for serious treatment of historical arms and armor and recognition of the <a href="../../../f/e/c/Fechtbuch.html" title="Fechtbuch">historical manuals</a> as legitimate sources of study, apparently with some success<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, the decision was made for the HACA to expand and evolve into what was believed would be a more effective educational organization for the study and practice of Medieval and Renaissance fencing. An efficient<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> study curriculum for practice had also been developed at this time using the source literature.</p>
<p>As one of the changes, the organization was renamed "the ARMA." <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> also saw the introduction of a national training program (a series of <a href="../../../s/e/m/Seminar.html" title="Seminar">seminars</a> and <a href="../../../w/o/r/Workshop.html" title="Workshop">workshops</a>), ranking and certifications in the curricula, and the implementation of the basic <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodology.html" title="Methodology">methodology</a> used by the ARMA today.</p>
<p>The ARMA’s conceptualization was also influenced by the work of Dr. Sydney Anglo, as presented in his work, <i>The Martial Arts of Renaissance Europe</i> (<a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_University_757c.html" title="Yale University">Yale University</a> Press <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>). As an official advisor of the ARMA, Dr. Anglo was instrumental in retooling its understanding of historical fencing. Along with other advances in this subject, Dr. Anglo's research, which itself has been influenced from the HACA’s efforts, has, some have argued, changed the face of the emerging field of historical fencing studies and had a profound impact on the subject.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The word arma (pronounced ‘<i>ARM-uh</i>’) in <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> as well as <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_language.html" title="Italian language">Italian</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>, and <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese_language.html" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a> means, appropriately enough, “weapon”. For <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knights.html" title="Knights">knights</a> in <a href="../../../1/3/t/13th_century.html" title="13th century">13th century</a> <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, it also referred to “the <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valor.html" title="Valor">valor</a> of a fighter”, while in <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a> it means to be armed. <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The word “Renaissance” was intentionally chosen for the title for two reasons. First, because almost all of the surviving fighting manuals of interest to ARMA members were written during the <a href="../../../1/4/t/14th_century.html" title="14th century">14th</a> to <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_century.html" title="16th century">16th centuries</a>—the time period of the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Renaissance_e2ac.html" title="European Renaissance">European Renaissance</a>, an era of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intellectual.html" title="Intellectual">intellectual</a> and <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural.html" title="Cultural">cultural</a> renewal and revival. It was also deemed appropriate in light of the fact that from the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> to the present there has occurred a “rebirth” of the study of historical fencing—a modern renaissance of ancient European martial arts.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_for_Renaissance_Martial_Arts_94b0.html" title="Edit section: Study Approach and Training Methodology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Study Approach and Training Methodology</span></h3>
<p>"The ARMA Study Approach consists of: researching period fighting manuals, literature and <a href="../../../i/c/o/Iconography.html" title="Iconography">iconography</a> combined with comparative analysis from hands-on experience using accurate replica arms and armor."<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> Interpretations of combat techniques are not accepted as valid until they have been tested under as realistic conditions as possible, or in other words, in practice at speed and power against a resisting opponent. The ARMA confines itself to historical sources and weapons, and tries to avoid techniques that are not historical or are drawn from other <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martial_art.html" title="Martial art">martial systems</a> (such as Asian fighting arts).<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The ARMA Training Methodology consists of using 4 primary tools to provide what is feels is a "well-rounded [and] comprehensive understanding. <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> Wooden <a href="../../../w/a/s/Waster.html" title="Waster">wasters</a> are used for basic drilling and technique work, up to and including <a href="../../../s/p/a/Sparring.html" title="Sparring">free-play</a>. Padded contact-weapons, along with helmets and appropriate padding, are used for more intense free-play, including sparring at full speed and power. <i><a href="../../../f/e/d/Federschwert.html" title="Federschwert">Federschwerter</a></i> (“feather swords”), historical sparring swords, also fill this purpose. Blunted replica swords are used by more advanced students for drilling and light free-play, to accustom them to the different handling of steel weapons. Sharp replica swords are used only for test-cutting, to teach students proper edge control and cutting technique (blunt weapons are also used for this). Test-cutting experience and frequent intense free-play are heavily emphasized.</p>

<p>The ARMA curriculum is based on the theory that the martial arts of Renaissance Europe were not fragmented or subdivided—that, on the contrary, they formed a unified discipline that was largely unchanged for a period of centuries. With this in mind, ARMA scholars view all of the source texts as describing what are largely the same principles and concepts. Where many organizations emphasize the differences between each master’s writings, the ARMA focuses more holistically on the similarities, using the differences in description to illuminate subtleties in the techniques. Thus, instead of focusing on any individual master, the ARMA’s curriculum emphasizes <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martial_art.html" title="Martial art">martial theory</a> and fundamental <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principles.html" title="Principles">principles</a>, drawing on many masters for its understanding of any given technique. The ideal is that in order to understand how one portion differs from another; you must first understand the whole and how things are alike.</p>
<p>The foundational weapon of the ARMA training program is the <a href="../../../l/o/n/Longsword.html" title="Longsword">longsword</a>. This is due both to its nature as arguably the most popular and most versatile weapon of the time period, and because there is more source material available for the longsword than for any other weapon. All ARMA scholars begin training with the longsword, and with it learn universal principles of fighting that they then apply to other weapons as they continue their studies. The body of training techniques and methods used by the ARMA is referred to as <i>Armatura</i> (a term borrowed from <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Rome_6564.html" title="Ancient Rome">Roman</a> <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military.html" title="Military">military</a> writers so influential in the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>), and includes distance and timing drills, footwork and cutting drills, striking and counter-strike exercises, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grappling.html" title="Grappling">grappling</a> elements, and <a href="../../../f/l/o/Floryshe.html" title="Floryshe">Floryshe</a> drills.</p>
<p>The ARMA curriculum encompasses a variety of weapons and weapon combinations, armored and unarmored, including <a href="../../../l/o/n/Longsword.html" title="Longsword">longsword</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greatsword.html" title="Greatsword">greatsword</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/d/Side-sword.html" title="Side-sword">single sword</a> (cut &amp; thrust), sword &amp; <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckler.html" title="Buckler">buckler</a>, sword &amp; <a href="../../../d/a/g/Dagger.html" title="Dagger">dagger</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grosses_messer.html" title="Grosses messer">messer</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rapier.html" title="Rapier">rapier</a>, rapier &amp; dagger, single dagger, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polearm.html" title="Polearm">polearm</a>, and <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarterstaff.html" title="Quarterstaff">short staff</a>. <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kampfringen.html" title="Kampfringen">Kampfringen</a>, a historical system of unarmed combat, is also taught, both as it relates to fighting with weapons and as a separate discipline.</p>

<p>Upon joining the ARMA, new members receive learning material. Lone members are Associates and three or four members who work together locally may apply to form official Study Groups. Non-members are allowed limited practice with members and Study Groups without prejudice, but are encouraged to join the organization.</p>
<p>In addition, regional Study Days, member Workshop events, and National Training Program <a href="../../../s/e/m/Seminars.html" title="Seminars">Seminars</a> are frequently held, and members in a given area will probably have the opportunity to attend at least one annually. Larger international gatherings are held less frequently. In both cases, senior students and expert instructors are invited to present classes, <a href="../../../l/e/c/Lectures.html" title="Lectures">lectures</a>, and National Training Program seminars to attendees. ARMA members are given priority in these events, and non-members may be prohibited from participating in certain Workshops. However, one and two day "open workshops" are offered in which non-member may attend.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

NTP 3.0: Introduction to Rapier</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The ARMA <b>National Training Program</b> (NTP) is designed as a series of ongoing cumulative courses for members around the world wishing to begin serious study under the ARMA system of historical fencing training. The program content is a composite approach derived from the teachings of a variety of historical masters, and specifically deigned for students and practitioners over extended distances who are without the benefit of competent instruction or practice partners. All of the knowledge required for rank advancement within the ARMA is covered in the NTP.</p>
<p>The National Training Program currently focuses on three main areas: Medieval Longsword, Renaissance Single-Sword (cut &amp; thrust), and Rapier. Other weapons and skills follow from these. The goal of each focused course is to advance the student’s comprehension of the real nature of long-bladed combat and actual weapon handling. These are intense focused workshops in the ARMA Study Approach for serious practitioners, both the novice and the experienced, that closely cover much more material than larger group Seminars. The NTP is under constant appraisal and revision; curricula for other weapons, such as the short staff, are still being devised.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_for_Renaissance_Martial_Arts_94b0.html" title="Edit section: Uniform and Rankings">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Uniform and Rankings</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="../../../u/n/i/Uniform.html" title="Uniform">uniform</a> worn by members of the ARMA consists of a red <a href="../../../t/-/s/T-shirt.html" title="T-shirt">T-shirt</a> and black <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweatpants.html" title="Sweatpants">sweatpants</a>. To this some members add high red <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socks.html" title="Socks">socks</a> to gather their sweatpants at the knee, to allow more freedom of movement and as a better approximation of historical fighting clothing. Non-members who practice with ARMA study groups are encouraged to wear a white T-shirt and black sweatpants. ARMA members of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provost_%28martial_arts%29.html" title="Provost (martial arts)">Provost</a> rank (see below) wear instead a black T-shirt with red pants. (Senior students may also assume this uniform when offering instruction at official seminars.) There is also a recognized but optional ARMA formal “dress uniform,” which consists of period-style clothing in the same color scheme. Red and black, being the predominant colors used in the manuals ARMA members study, are considered by the ARMA to be symbolic of scholarship in historical fencing; this color scheme is used in most official materials.</p>
<p>ARMA ranking is somewhat informal, and is based on the four-tiered system employed by the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Company_of_Masters_7776.html" title="Company of Masters">London Company of Masters</a>. All ARMA members are considered to possess the rank of Scholar. Scholars who achieve sufficient command of the <i>Armatura</i> and basic principles of the ARMA program, and a matching knowledge of the fighting manuals and historical masters, are advanced to the rank of general Free Scholar. Free Scholars who demonstrate considerable expertise in all areas of the ARMA training program and an advanced knowledge of the source material are considered for Senior Free Scholar rank. Testing for either rank involves an extensive oral examination and the physical demonstration of technique, as determined by the instructors conducting the test. Qualifying for Senior Free Scholar rank also requires a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prize_Playing_81f7.html" title="Prize Playing">Prize Playing</a>. General Free Scholar testing may be administered by any Senior Free Scholar. Senior Free Scholar certification requires the oversight of two or more Senior Free Scholars or the Director; by custom, as many Senior Free Scholars as can be gathered are present to oversee such a test.</p>

A SFS Prize Playing</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Unlike rankings in most martial arts organizations, Free Scholar rankings must be renewed; if a scholar has not advanced to a higher rank within four years of playing his prize, he must be retested in order to retain his current status. Free Scholar rankings are earned in a specific weapon, and a candidate must achieve a rank with the longsword before testing for any other weapon. At the present time, there are eight Senior Free Scholars in the longsword, and no rank has been awarded in any other weapon (though such rank likely will be once the curricula for other weapons is fully established).</p>
<p>Above Senior Free Scholar are the ranks of Provost, Senior Provost, and Master. At present there are no requirements for or current holders of these ranks. The ARMA considers it highly inappropriate at this juncture to consider naming any ARMA practitioner a “Master” of these extinct arts, as the ARMA believes that the restoration of Medieval and Renaissance martial arts is still in its infancy and no modern practitioner has contributed to the art enough to claim the title of "Master". The ARMA likewise criticizes any Medieval or Renaissance martial arts instructor using the title of “Master” for this reason.</p>
<p>Outside of this system, there is a purely <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic.html" title="Academic">academic</a> <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinction.html" title="Distinction">distinction</a> called <a href="../../../r/e/s/Researcher.html" title="Researcher">Senior Researcher</a> that is granted to ARMA scholars who contribute significantly to the general body of knowledge on historical fencing. The ARMA also has over a dozen Expert <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consultants.html" title="Consultants">Consultants</a> from different fields who have offered their knowledge and expertise to its efforts.</p>

<p>While the ARMA is not about <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stage_combat.html" title="Stage combat">stage combat</a>, ARMA InTheatre was, and in a historically valid and martially sound manner. Though its focus has never been on <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choreography.html" title="Choreography">choreographed</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theatrical.html" title="Theatrical">theatrical</a> fighting or <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stunt.html" title="Stunt">stunt combat</a>, the ARMA has long perceived a need for a martially sound and historically accurate program of fight choreography instruction and certification. The ARMA Professional Stage Combat Certification Program was designed to fill this need.</p>
<p>ARMA InTheatre was a series of workshop classes as an alternative to more familiar and less realistic efforts. Designed and headed by a noted expert on stage combat, Keith Duklin, ARMA InTheatre was a complete system of weapon forms, allowing students to train from basic to advanced levels.</p>
<p>This program was disbanded shortly after its creation.</p>
