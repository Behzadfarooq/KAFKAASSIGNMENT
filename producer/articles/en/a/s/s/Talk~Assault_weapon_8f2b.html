<p>Everyone please be clear on the actual legal definitions of assault weapons before editing. Problems I have seen recently include:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Automatic weapons</i> - The federal AWB specifically defined assault weapons as semi-automatic and, regardless, new manufacture of full-auto for civilians was regulated in 1934 banned in 1986, both before the assault weapons laws.</li>
<li><i>Armor piercing ammunition</i> - The federal AWB certainly didn't cover AP ammunition (such as 5.7mm <a href="../../../s/s/1/SS190_f809.html" title="SS190">SS190</a> round or 5.56mm SS109 round) and neither does any state ban I am aware of; this is usually covered by seperate laws.</li>

<p>NPOV concerns have been ongoing with partisans on both sides inserting their opinions.</p>

<p><a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> suggested tighter integration with the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assault_weapons_ban.html" title="Assault weapons ban">assault weapons ban</a> article.</p>
<hr />
<p>I've made a number of revisions throughout this article in the pursuit of neutrality and objectivity. At this point, I have the following concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>The reference to "inaccurate media reporting and political propaganda" has the appearance of bias, but for reasons I've previously explained, I believe this statement to be entirely true. Still though, it would be nice to get rid of even the appearance of bias.</li>
<li>The position of gun control advocates seems nonsensical to me, even though I tried to revise this in the best spirit of fairness, even using language derived from their own position papers.</li>
<li>The removal of this article from the Firearms category is curious. While the term (as commonly used and defined) is an invention of the American political system and gun control advocates, it has come to mean something to the American public. If I walk into a gun shop and ask to see their <i>assault weapons</i>, I'll get some dirty looks and maybe a lecture, but eventually they'll get around to showing me the AR-15's and semi-auto AK-47's. One could argue that including this article in the Firearms category is entirely appropriate. Since the party that did the removal is a substantial contributor to Wikipedia, I am loathe to undo this change.</li>

<p>It does appear that the American military has adopted the use of this term to describe any number of light weapons that can be used by an individual soldier. I believe the article should be expanded to accomodate both the statutory and military definitions. For military references, use the following link: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;c2coff=1&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=assault+weapon&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=.mil&amp;safe=images|Google" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;c2coff=1&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=assault+weapon&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=.mil&amp;safe=images|Google" rel="nofollow">Mil Search</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregmg_5209.html" title="User:Gregmg">Gregmg</a> 18:56, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Here are just a few of the military uses of 'assault weapon'. I'm hard pressed to find anything in common between these uses. My guess is that once the term became a part of the American vernacular in the early 90's, various parties in the military and defense contractors decided to incorporate it into weapon names.</p>
<p>SHOULDER-LAUNCHED MULTIPURPOSE ASSAULT WEAPON (SMAW)- A lightweight, man-portable rocket launcher designed for use against fortified positions and light armor. The dual-mode warhead provides point detonation for hard targets and delayed detonation for soft targets.</p>
<p>AIRBORNE ASSAULT WEAPON - An unarmored, mobile, full-tracked gun providing a mobile antitank capability for airborne troops. Can be airdropped.</p>
<p>STRYKER ASSAULT WEAPON - A vehicle mounted 105mm cannon used against tanks, hard targets, as well as dismounted infantry.</p>

<hr />
<p>I don't think we can use any of those definitions in this article. They range from a small rocket to what used to be called "assault guns" in previous generations of armor and do not come close to approaching any sort of consensus. I'm fixing the partisan edit that some anonymous user made to suggest the military uses the term for rifles as well as cutting down the summary which has grown a little long-winded.</p>

<p>I think you did a good job researching the military use but I just don't see that it would be useful to people wanting to actually find out what an assault weapon is. At most the article needs one sentence that says something to the effect of there being no established military definition and the term is used to refer to anything from man-portable rocket launchers to armored vehicles. --<a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskaggs_ab90.html" title="User:Askaggs">Askaggs</a> 18:51, July 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I reinstated the supporters and detractors section because I don't think that it is overly generalized and I do think that placing this term in the proper context is important. Without knowing the 'for' and 'against' positions, the reader is left without the background info that's needed. As I've mentioned above, I do have concerns about how the detractor's position is characterized. I can speak with some authority that the supporters position covers all of the key points. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregmg_5209.html" title="User:Gregmg">Gregmg</a> 02:38, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I'll go through that section and list my objections. Many aren't about generalization, but those that are are majorly so; many are also based on how I read the section, and I may be reading it totally wrong. I'm reading this from the anti-AWB side of things, in case it matters.</p>
<p>"Gun rights advocates" and (farther down) "Gun control advocates"</p>
<p>Your stance on assault weapons legislation does not necessarily have any relationship with your stance on gun rights/control in general.</p>
<p>"hold that the attributes used to create statutory definitions are largely cosmetic."</p>
<p>The attributes aren't cosmetic, but they may have been chosen for the definitions for cosmetic reasons.</p>
<p>"As such, there really isn't any difference between an assault weapon and any other firearm."</p>
<p>Sure, there is, just not one that all will agree is dangerous and/or worth banning.</p>
<p>"They also suggest that these weapons are generally suitable for target shooting, collecting, and when necessary, civil and self defense."</p>
<p>Not all do and an "assault weapon" isn't necessarily a weapon by definition. I also have another harder to explain objection...I guess it feels to me like it's trivializing the position of anti-AW legislation people. Fun target shooting versus defending the public safety with defense tacked on to the former for some NPOV...</p>
<p>"They further contend that these types of weapons are not frequently used in crime."</p>
<p>That contention is a fact, at least according to the USDoJ, and putting it down here makes it sound to me like an unproven point.</p>
<p>"They believe that the right of Americans to possess such weapons is guaranteed by the Second Amendment."</p>
<p>I don't believe so, and I know I'm not alone, although I don't know how common that view is.</p>
<p>"Gun control advocates such as the Brady Campaign and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence are critical of the private ownership of assault weapons and support legislative attempts to ban them."</p>
<p>I read this as implying a direct relationship between being pro-gun control, being critical of private ownership of assault weapons, and supporting legislative attempts to ban them.</p>
<p>"They hold that assault weapons are designed to maximize lethal effects through a rapid rate of fire and by being spray-fired from the hip. They further contend that because of their design, a shooter can maintain control of the weapon even while firing many rounds in rapid succession. As such, these weapons pose a serious threat to public safety and should be banned."</p>
<p>What about AWB supporters who feel the law is (only) useful as a step toward banning all firearms? (And I'm not just theorizing about their existance.) 68.32.176.48</p>
<p>First let me say "thank you" for engaging in this discussion. Especially providing such a detailed point-by-point list of your concerns. The common thread among the items you've listed seems to be with viewpoints not addressed by the polarized pro and con viewpoints presented in the article? That may be an oversimplification, but is that fair to say? I'd like the opportunity to give your concerns some thought and take a stab at revising the article accordingly. My opposition to removing the whole section stems from my view that 'assault weapons' are largely a political invention, and not a technical one. To remove the supporter and detractor positions is to remove this term from the political context from which it was created. I think the reader who is unfamiliar with this term needs the extra background information. Of course, you're welcome to revise the article as you see fit. I would only ask that you leave this section included in some fashion. Thanks! <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregmg_5209.html" title="User:Gregmg">Gregmg</a> 30 June 2005 03:14 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've attempted to address some of your concerns. I'll give some more thought to this and try to do more. I like the current wording concerning uses of these weapons... kind of runs the gamut from the trivial to the important. How these weapons are frequently used is a point often raised by those, like myself, who oppose banning them. Many who favor banning them scoff at the notion they could be used like any other gun; for activities or uses like target shooting or self defense. Further, to just reference civil defense and self defense might leave the impression with the reader that these weapons really are more dangerous than 'normal' firearms. I will try to expand this section further to address your other concerns, but I think it's important to note that it's not necessary to provide equal footing to minority viewpoints; see <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> for more information. Please don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to downplay your concerns. But I'm not sure that it's necessary to thoroughly flesh out the views of those who support gun control, but oppose AW bans, or the views of those who are pro-gun, but support AW bans. I remain concerned with how the detractor's position is represented. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregmg_5209.html" title="User:Gregmg">Gregmg</a> 2 July 2005 21:26 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
That section looks pretty good to me now; thanks and good work.&#160;:)</p>
<p>"That may be an oversimplification, but is that fair to say?"</p>
<p>Basically, I'd say the way the viewpoints were presented bothered me because it wasn't quite accurate, even if the views are by far the ones most encountered. 68.32.176.48</p>

<p>This article don't describe assault weapons in any more detail then the federal assault weapons ban. The big draw back would be the potential confusion coming from being redirected to a page about a law when you excepted a page about a kind of weapon.</p>
<p>This should redirect to the "Assault Rifle" article. There is no such thing as a so-called "assault weapon" save as defined by the US assault weapons ban; the term is political and not practical. A link from the "Assault Rifle" article to the "Assault Weapons Ban" article would suffice, and would serve to eliminate redundancy; this article merely restates the definition of a so-called "assault weapon" given in the assault weapons ban.</p>
<ul>
<li>The problem is, assault rifles and assault weapons are two separate concepts. A redirect would only lead to more confusion. A redirect to the ban page sounds more reasonable, but this page doesn't seem to be doing any harm.</li>

<p>I disagree. I think this article needs to remain in place. Primarily because the term has come to mean something. If I walk into a gun store and ask to see their assault weapons, I may not get a warm reception but they will likely take me to the AR-15 and AK-47S rifles, Tec-9 pistols, etc., regardless of what statutory definitions may exist for that jurisdiction. I wish this term didn't exist and I do consider it completely pejorative, but unfortunately, it has become part of the American vernacular. As described in the first paragraph of the article, it may be defined in law or it may be used generically to describe weapons with a particular appearance. For these reasons, I believe this article needs to remain in place. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregmg_5209.html" title="User:Gregmg">Gregmg</a> 8 July 2005 11:24 (UTC)</p>
<p>I seem to recall that "assault weapon" became a term because of the ban and the moral panic surrounding it. However I'm not sure how to verify such a thing. If there's a way to show that "assault weapon" didn't really have an existance as a term except in the context of the ban, then I'd support the redirect. The discussion below suggest that this term is only used in the US, where the "assault weapons" ban took place. Maybe <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assault_weapons_ban.html" title="Assault weapons ban">Assault weapons ban</a> should redirect here instead, and this article could tell the whole story. To clarify, if "assault weapon" is only meaningful in the context of certain US laws, I don't think we need a seperate articles for the law(s) and the "assault weapons" involved. Definitely we should not redirect to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assault_rifle.html" title="Assault rifle">Assault rifle</a>. Things like <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assault_rifle.html" title="Assault rifle">Assault rifle</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_rifle.html" title="Battle rifle">Battle rifle</a>, and <a href="../../../s/u/b/Submachine_gun.html" title="Submachine gun">Submachine gun</a> are technical terms used by the military, whereas (in my experience) "Assault weapon" is a political, not technical, term. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> 9 July 2005 01:08 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've read but I haven't been able to confirm that the term was first used by gun enthusiasts in the early '80s. There were apparently some publications with titles like "Assault Weapons of the World", or something like that. It also appeared in advertisements in gun publications. It was used to describe semi-automatics with a military appearance that were growing in popularity thanks to movies like "Rambo" (82) and "Terminator" (84). It was comandeered by gun control activitists around 1986 when it was first referenced by Josh Sugerman. They saw the opportunity to take advantage of confusion between semi-auto and full auto guns to ban a good number of semi-autos. Regardless of who first used it, I still believe this article should remain as is because right now, in the US, it does mean something. Even in states and jurisdictions where there are no restrictions on these guns, this term is still occasionally used. So it has a meaning beyond any relevant assault weapon bans. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregmg_5209.html" title="User:Gregmg">Gregmg</a> 9 July 2005 16:27 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's possible. I'd never heard the term used other than by the anti-gun crowd. In my experience, every "gun enthusiast" I know of thinks this term is meaningless and would never use it. But this could certainly be particular to my own locale. Looks like you're not alone in the talk page here in thinking this needs it's own article. I suppose that means it's worth keeping. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> 05:11, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>A key problem with the development of this page into a proper encyclopedia article is the efforts of certain contributors to maintain the page in a manner that excludes anything not specifically addressed in the American National Firearms Act.</p>
<p>This does not suit Wikipedia as it is not as inclusive as possible over the wide range of definitions of the term "assault weapon." It is not POV to include such issues, but it is to remove them because they do not suit the article from your POV. There is a world outside the United States and in creating a global Wikipedia we must include a broad range of viewpoints that will not always fall within the highly specific criterion used by the deletionists on this page. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexwcovington_2ca2.html" title="User:Alexwcovington">Alexwcovington</a> (<a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexwcovington_ddca.html" title="User talk:Alexwcovington">talk</a>) 18:06, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Alex, I'm not exactly sure what you mean by including other viewpoints. There must be a line drawn somewhere, otherwise the term loses all meaning. Maybe you would agree with dropping any attempt from a technical definition in this article and leaving that to the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assault_weapons_ban.html" title="Assault weapons ban">assault weapons ban</a> and other articles covering specific laws. That would leave this article as purely politics and redirects, although I am of the opinion that is the sole rationale for using this term anyway. As for the American-centric viewpoint of the article, I would not dispute that, although I am unaware of the term being used outside of the USA. If anyone has any knowledge of foreign use I would be interested to hear it. - <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskaggs_ab90.html" title="User:Askaggs">Andrew Skaggs</a></p>

I think it's important to keep a definition for Assault Weapon in Wikipedia, in spite of the fact that its a highly political, highly contentious, and very US centric term. To simply redirect users to 'Assault Rifle' might create confusion between the two terms; one being political and vague, and the other being technical and precise. As contributors to Wikipedia, I think it is incumbent upon us to provide the most honest, objective, and technically precise definition for this term. - <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregmg_5209.html" title="User:Gregmg">Greg G.</a></p>

(attributes to groups like Brady). Is this really true? It seems like an obviously silly belief, perhaps intended to discredit the pro-gun-control crowd. Also fixed slight NPOV problem in that section. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> 8 July 2005 16:25 (UTC)</p>
<p>As I've previously mentioned on this page, I am concerned about the wording of the detractor's position. I am largely responsible for the current wording; before making any edits I consulted their position papers and borrowed language without copying text outright. The detractor's position seems absolutely silly to me, but it is entirely consistent with their stated positions. I would encourage you to consult their websites as well as any other published sources and modify this as you see fit. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregmg_5209.html" title="User:Gregmg">Gregmg</a> 8 July 2005 17:07 (UTC)</p>
<p>From bradycampaign.org: "...semi-automatic assault weapons are designed to maximize lethal effects through a rapid rate of fire. Assault weapons are designed to be spray-fired from the hip, and because of their design, a shooter can maintain control of the weapon even while firing many rounds in rapid succession." I have no desire to misrepresent the detractor's position. Please make whatever changes you feel are needed. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregmg_5209.html" title="User:Gregmg">Gregmg</a> 8 July 2005 17:21 (UTC)</p>

<p>I revised the wording in the characteristics section that <a href="../../../y/a/f/User%7EYaf_9ae4.html" title="User:Yaf">Yaf</a> changed yesterday. The previous wording was <i>"Large" or "High" capacity</i> that became <i>"Large" or "High" or "<b>Normal</b>" capacity"</i> which didn't present a clear idea about what characteristic was in question. However, it could be that the use of Large and High in this context in the various state and local laws is pejorative or at the very least, reflects the POV on the part of the legislators. Putting "large" and "high" in quotes seems the right approach, but I suspect Yaf wanted to take this a step further and reflect the notion that the magazine capacity in question really is just "normal". In any case, I'm not exactly sure what's best, but I thought "larger" was a better word. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregmg_5209.html" title="User:Gregmg">Gregmg</a> 00:31, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Magazines holding more than 10 rounds were the original-manufacturer <i>normal capacity</i> magazines. It was only when a POV <i>re-naming</i> occured with gun control advocates and like-minded legislators changing the labeling to call these same existing magazines "High" or "Large" capacity magazines that they came to be labeled as such in the media.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Larger" is too close to the POV of gun control advocates who call them "Large" by my viewpoint. "Large" or "High" are both strongly pejorative adjective terms for expressing magazine capacity among gun rights advocates, who well remember these same magazines as being just the normal magazines that were available for decades. The issue became expecially touchy when newer magazines holding fewer rounds than the normal capacity during the Assault Weapon Ban decade from 1994 through 2004 turned out not to be reliable in many existing guns; not only were the reliable and normal capacity magazines unavailable at reasonable prices during the AWB years, the very reliability of guns on which many depended for self-defense were often made much less safe for use as self-defense weapons when used with the lessened-capacity magazines favored by gun control advocates. (Guns designed for <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_column_magazine.html" title="Double column magazine">double column magazines</a> were especially made less reliable when the normal capacity of 15, 16, or 17 rounds was suddenly reduced to a maximum of 10 often unreliable rounds. As for the number of rounds being well established at more than 10 rounds, and this being the norm, the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Browning_Hi-Power_ecdc.html" title="Browning Hi-Power">Browning Hi-Power</a> is a prime example. It came out in 1935, and was one of many of normally well-regarded guns that suddenly became unreliable with magazines holding only 10 rounds, or less. I have tried another edit; if this still doesn't quite seem to be the right choice of words, then lets continue to work this issue to arrive at something that is truly NPOV. <a href="../../../y/a/f/User%7EYaf_9ae4.html" title="User:Yaf">Yaf</a> 01:08, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Moments before you (Yaf) wrote the above text, I dropped any descriptive term from the item in question. Let's discuss further if you have concerns about the modified wording. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregmg_5209.html" title="User:Gregmg">Gregmg</a> 01:24, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree that these terms are used as pejoratives, but these terms are being used by the people who are writing the legislation to ban guns and to not include them would be incomplete. Maybe we could append the following sentence: "These magazines are often referred to as "large" or "high" capacity even if the firearm's original magazines were of that size." --<a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskaggs_ab90.html" title="User:Askaggs">Askaggs</a> 01:45, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that these terms are used by anti-gun legislators while writing new legislation. However, an encyclopedia should in general not support the continued use of pejorative terms without at least identifying them as such, to maintain a NPOV. Perhaps a phrasing of, ""These magazines are often referred to as "large" or "high" capacity even if the firearm's original magazines were of that size; these "large" or "high" capacity terms are considered pejorative by those favoring gun rights, who instead prefer to use the term "normal" capacity, as capacities of more than 10 rounds were the norm for many decades." This NPOV phrasing is awkward; for that reason, I favor just leaving what is already there. <a href="../../../y/a/f/User%7EYaf_9ae4.html" title="User:Yaf">Yaf</a> 02:58, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I still think it is worthy of mention. In my opinion the article's introduction makes it clear that the primary use of the term is political and readers will view everything in it through that lens. I would suggest strengthening the language in the introduction rather than pointing out rebuttals for every sentence. --<a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskaggs_ab90.html" title="User:Askaggs">Askaggs</a> 03:05, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm really concerned about the Supporters and Detractors section. It was a bit unbalanced before Yaf's addition, and now it's really biased. Not wrong, mind you, just overweighted in a pro-gun direction. Also, as I said before, putting "large" and "high" in quotes is a fairly effective way to indicate that the use of the words in this context is suspect. I have a slight preference for returning High and Large back to the characteristics section, and I have a strong inclination to reword the Supporters and Detractors section to more tightly integrate Yaf's edits and bring back some balance. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregmg_5209.html" title="User:Gregmg">Gregmg</a> 04:07, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I returned large/high to the article. As for NPOV in supporters/detractors, that section is always going to be a problem. It's a challenge to keep it short and list unique assault weapons arguments while not rehashing the entire gun control debate. I agree it's tilted too far pro-gun now. --<a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskaggs_ab90.html" title="User:Askaggs">Askaggs</a> 04:55, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It just seemed a bit strong to me to end the Supporters/Detractors with, "They further contend that because of their design, a shooter can maintain control of the weapon even while firing many rounds in rapid succession, and thus, these weapons pose a serious threat to public safety and should be banned." This seems to imply that the sum total of opinion of the <i>entire</i> article is to <b>ban</b> assault weapons; at least that is the impression that the reader leaves with. Hardly NPOV. The rapid rate of fire earlier, though, is also indicative of a poor understanding of gun effectiveness, too. It was already a weak "Detractors" argument, before adding the counter argument of Kenneth W. Royce. Can't we find a better Detractor's argument, instead? <a href="../../../y/a/f/User%7EYaf_9ae4.html" title="User:Yaf">Yaf</a> 05:01, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The whole point of the Supporters and Detractors section is to provide both sides of the argument in a short, concise way. Per Wikipedia guidelines and policies, NPOV <b>does not apply</b> to such a section. It does, however, need to be balanced. Both positions need to be close to the same length. I looked long and hard to find something better for the anti-AW stance, but that was the best I could find. Since the majority of contributors to this article seem pro-gun, it would be best to give the anti position the <i>last word</i>, by placing their position second. In a few days, if no one beats me to it, I'll restructure the Supporters and Detractors section. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregmg_5209.html" title="User:Gregmg">Gregmg</a> 15:53, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's my understanding that the <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violent_Crime_Control_and_Law_Enforcement_Act_e2d1.html" title="Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act">Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act</a> did not differentiate between rifle grenades and attached grenade launchers. Attaching an M203 to a rifle would count as an "evil feature" regardless of it's seperate status as a registered destructive device. I'm therefore reverting the article unless anyone has documentation to prove otherwise. --<a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskaggs_ab90.html" title="User:Askaggs">Askaggs</a> 05:54, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have never seen any laws that declare flare launchers to be part of assault weapons. While gun nuts may know that is the only realistic attachment due to the destructive device taxes, all the laws written by gun-grabbers refer to them as grenade launchers. Since this article is about a manufactured political term I will continue to revert this until a legal citation is produced. --<a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskaggs_ab90.html" title="User:Askaggs">Askaggs</a> 04:09, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've seen the rifle grenade issue pop up a couple of times. The federal law seemed to apply to all types of grenade launchers, both self-propelled and older rifle fired, so I think it is best to leave the article more generic. Was there a state ban that specified rifle grenades that is causing the confusion, or is this general confusion over grenade launcher terminology? --<a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskaggs_ab90.html" title="User:Askaggs">Askaggs</a> 15:26, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Aren't grenade launchers not attached to rifles regulated as destructive devices? <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremy_Nimmo_b295.html" title="User:Jeremy Nimmo">Jeremy Nimmo</a> 05:31, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There seems to be some issues with grenade launchers. I believe the ones that assault weapon bans try to cover are the type that mount under the barrel of military style riles and not the rocket powered type. I think bans may try to include the type that mounts to the end of a rifle (vie barrel lugs/theading?) and are fired off with a blank (old WWII style) but im not sure about that. I believe legality of grenade launchers, like the famous M-79 (which works like the underbarrel type), depend from state to state, but they are not under any fedral ban. The launchers themselves are not considered a destructive device, but its explosive ammo is, and the ammo is therefore regulated under the NFA. I think this area needs more research before it can be placed into the article. [OC - unregistered user. 6/22/06]</p>
<p>The mention of grenade launchers as a feature in the U.S. assault weapons ban is extremely unclear. I've never seen any explanation by the authors of the legislation about what they intended. One could make a good case that they were talking about muzzle-launched rifle grenades. One example is the 22mm NATO standard outside diameter for flash-hiders, which then double as rifle grenade launchers. One could also make a good case that the original authors of the legislation had no idea what they were talking about, and simply looked through a book like 'Gun Digest' making a list of models and features they felt fitted their idea of a dangerous 'assault weapon'.</p>
<p>Grenade launchers like the 40x46mmSR M79 and M203 and others that use self-propelling grenade ammunition, are classified as regulated Destructive Devices by the 1968 amendments to the NFA. There is an exception for 37mm flare launchers and actual grenade launchers converted to 37mm flare caliber. The 37mm caliber is unrifled, and thus cannot be used to fire spin-armed explosive grenades, hence the exemption.</p>
<p>I would remove the clarification of the term 'grenade launcher' pending some citation over the original intent of this feature provision and its subsequent statutory definition by BATFE. 209.221.23.134 02:13, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>A smooth bore 37mm can still fire a flare,gernade,solid shot,etc. Grenades not spinning can still be effective. <a href="../../../d/u/d/User%7EDudtz_4295.html" title="User:Dudtz">Dudtz</a> 10/15/06 5:37 PM EST</p>

I ask again, how is this overbroad? What is POV about this? Here is the line as it originally read--"Some of the features that are mentioned were <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safety.html" title="Safety">safety</a> and <a href="../../../e/r/g/Ergonomic.html" title="Ergonomic">ergonomic</a> features. It is also worth noting that this did not make the firearm any less capable of shooting and killing a person." Why is this contentious? Cheers. L0b0t 19:26, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I must have missed the first time you brought this up for discussion. You have my apology for that.</dd>
<dd>Who is asserting that the features are cosmetic, safety, or ergonomic in nature? Is this your opinion or does this represent a conclusive analysis from an outside source? Remember, no original research is allowed on Wikipedia and we should refrain from interjecting our own opinion into an article. If you've found a pro-gun source making these assertions, we should move this comment into the pro-gun / anti-ban statement down further on the page and provide a proper citation.

<dd>No apologies necessary, I was not the one who put the original line in. I just tried to punch it up a bit. The features listed seemed rather self-evidently cosmetic to me. If that falls under the rubrik of OR, then by all means lets take it out. I'll dig around for a source and see what pops up. Cheers. L0b0t 22:09, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
