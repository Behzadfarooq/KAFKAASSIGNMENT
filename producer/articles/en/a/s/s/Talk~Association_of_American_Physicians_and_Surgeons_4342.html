<p>Conservapedia, a small wiki-based enterprise which seems to be a combination of an academic exercise for homeschooled middle-schoolers to learn-by-doing and a dream of becoming an online encyclopedia with a conservative point of view, has associations with Andrew Schlafly, counsel for the AAPS. An edit by user Aschlafly in Conservapedia charges:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia's entry for the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a conservative group, consists mostly of a highly biased rant by a British journalist against the group. The only cited credential for the journalist is that he works for a television "programme-production company," and there is no citation for any of the factual claims in his intemperate and misleading remarks about the group. There is no reason to think a British television programmer would have the slightest clue about what this American medical group does, and the biased tone of his comments renders them completely unsuitable for an online encyclopedia.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not sure how much water I want to carry for Conservapedia, but I do see problems in the current article. It does seem to me that the particular paragraph he complains about is way too long, and the journalist is quoted at excessive length. I have to wonder whether the positions he says the AAPS has taken couldn't be better( and more fairly) illustrated by quotations from the AAPS itself.</p>
<p>I also think the article would benefit from distinguishing more clearly from a) simple facts (how old it is, etc); b) reasonable objective political facts (Schlafly, above, characterizes the group as "conservative;" the New York Times as "ultra-right-wing" (see below); c) criticism.</p>
<p>Overall the article does look out of balance to me. I'd <i>prefer</i> that others fix it, as I don't want to be Conservapedia's pet Wikipedia-fixer... I suspect that Aschlafly is too close to the subject to have the right delicate touch to fix it himself. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:06, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>P. S. The New York Times characterization is:</p>
<p>"New Power in A.M.A.&#160;: Milford Owen Rouse," <i>The New York Times,</i> June 30, 1966, p. 19: "Dr. Rouse belongs to the ultra-right-wing Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, made up of A.M.A. members but without any link to the A.M.A. It is a political-economic rather than a medical group, and some of its leaders are members of the John Birch Society."</p>

<p>I second that the entry could benefit from an expansion and other improvements. I shortened the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Deer_9182.html" title="Brian Deer">Brian Deer</a> quote down to leave the characterization and moved it to the Journal section. The statement from Conservapedia that there is <i>no reason to think a British television programmer would have the slightest clue about what this American medical group does</i> doesn't hold up - that this (according to the entry on his name) award-winning investigative journalist specializing on medical issues is British doesn't give him less credibility.<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerjen_2d02.html" title="User:Terjen">Terjen</a> 17:05, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>I note that Conservapedia has cleaned up their own statement based on our discussion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Until a complaint was lodged, Wikipedia's entry for the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a conservative group, gave undue weight to a rant against the group by a British journalist who was a former press officer for the leftist Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. The only cited credential for the journalist is that he works for a television "programme-production company," and there is no citation for any of the factual claims in his intemperate and misleading description of the group, which were prompted by an independent criticism in England of the journalist's own work. While the trimming of this rant is a step in the right direction, why is such an unsupported, unpublished diatribe allowed to remain on Wikipedia at all? It is against Wikipedia policy (e.g., NPOV), and allowing it illustrates bias. This entry also features another liberal journalist's swipe at AAPS from ... 40 years ago! This bias is no oversight, as a Wikipedia administrator defended leaving this entry as is.<a href="http://www.conservapedia.com/Examples_of_Bias_in_Wikipedia" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.conservapedia.com/Examples_of_Bias_in_Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quote from the investigative reporter was added about two months ago. Since then there was only <i>one</i> insignificant edit (<i>stub sorting</i>) until I added more content less than a week ago. My guess is that the status of the article is due to lack of traffic. The Conservapedia editor could have bothered to look up <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Deer_9182.html" title="Brian Deer">Brian Deer</a>, and perhaps even taken a moment to turn the name into a link for others benefit, but that may have ruined the story. I understand if editors are reluctant trimming down the entry further as it doesn't have much content. I added the 40 year old "swipe" by mistake while searching the Time database of back issues, believing it was from 2005, and that was an oversight. Editors should find more recent sources that provide insight into the organization from a variety of angles.<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerjen_2d02.html" title="User:Terjen">Terjen</a> 04:17, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is a new entry in <a href="http://www.conservapedia.com/Association_of_American_Physicians_and_Surgeons" class="external text" title="http://www.conservapedia.com/Association_of_American_Physicians_and_Surgeons" rel="nofollow">Conservpedia on the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons</a>. It doesn't cite any sources though, in violation of their own <a href="http://www.conservapedia.com/The_Conservapedia_Commandments" class="external text" title="http://www.conservapedia.com/The_Conservapedia_Commandments" rel="nofollow">rule</a>: "Always cite and give credit to your sources, even if in the public domain." The entry is authored by Conservapedia's own Andrew Schlafly, which is the attorney for Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, so it likely contains original research as well as possibly opinion, in breach of their sixth rule.<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerjen_2d02.html" title="User:Terjen">Terjen</a> 16:13, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is not appropriate material for an encyclopedia. The quote is not encyclopedic. The journalist concerned is not an expert on medical jounals, has no medical or scientific qualifications and the remark was not made as part of any particular study. It is also defamatory.</dd>

<p>Since you're willing to cite policy, maybe you could explain how Deer's site doesn't meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. The guideline states, "When... a well-known professional journalist has produced self-published material, these may be acceptable as sources, so long as his or her work has been previously published by credible, third-party publications." Deer is a well-known professional journalist. His work has been previously published by credible, third-party publications. Therefore, his opinion meets criteria for inclusion. If you want to discuss how it should be phrased, that's fine, but claiming a non-existent policy basis for deleting it isn't going to fly. Quackwatch has been the subject of quite a bit of back-and-forth, but it is also generally considered an acceptable source within certain parameters. If your concern is that Deer's comment on "objective medical scientists" avoiding JPandS is somehow defamatory to these unnamed people, we can remove that sentence, but the criticism as a whole is relevant. If you disagree, I'd suggest opening a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">request for comment</a>. <b><a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMastCell_6795.html" title="User talk:MastCell">Talk</a></sup> 15:13, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You seem to be laboring under a series of misunderstandings about Wikipedia. First of all, repeating your same argument endlessly is not going to move us forward.

You've provided nothing in response, just a nearly word-for-word repetition of your original misplaced objection. Secondly, disputes are resolved by consensus - so repetition of the same arguments without addressing my points and going after people who join the discussion are both counterproductive. <b><a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMastCell_6795.html" title="User talk:MastCell">Talk</a></sup> 21:54, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
