<p>I archived the previous dicussion page on Monday, October 2nd at ~2:10 PM EST. The page was <i>really</i> long and made editing and discussion relatively difficult.

<dd>Since the previous discussions have been archived I add the following so other readers will have some context of these discussions and some of the editing. Frequent article editor 69.180.43.255 is a young man from Atlanta who is faily new to Western Martial Arts (WMA) and who was was expelled from ARMA after only one week due to his bad behavior. Since being expelled from ARMA the young man has gone from one Internet fourm to another stalking and flaming ARMA, ARMA Director John Clements, and other ARMA members. All of the rumors, gossip, and lies which this young man likes to spread around actually originated several years before he even heard of WMA or ARMA. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERanp_c007.html" title="User:Ranp">Ranp</a> October 2, 2006 5:30 pm.

<dd>Sorry Mr. Pleasant, but you are out of line. Unless you can provide proof that backs up your assertions about the identity and the character of the poster, you are just spreading gossip to discredit criticism. Since gossip is exactly what you are complaining about, I would recommend that you provide better evidence for what you are saying or risk being called a hypocrite. -- <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_204.180.221.45_e441.html" title="Special:Contributions/204.180.221.45">204.180.221.45</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/4/User_talk%7E204.180.221.45.html" title="User talk:204.180.221.45">talk</a>) .</small>

<dd>"Excellent" is a value judgment and not provably factual. I personally witnessed J. Clements injure himself and one of his students after talking about the necessity for safety and control.

<dd>John Clements' minor cut on his leg is again used to suggest that he and ARMA are unsafe. Yet, the statement truthfully says that it was a minor cut! What swordsmen has handles sharp swords for 25 years, as had John Clements, and not experienced a minor cut? How does this compare to the head instructor of the Chicago Swordplay Guild beaking his neck? How does this compare to a member of the Chicago Swordplay Guild almost losing an eye during dagger training because he was not wearing eye protection? How does this compare to an instructor of the Stoccata School of Defence sticking another instructor in the head with a sharp rapier? -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERanp_c007.html" title="User:Ranp">Ranp</a> October 2, 2006 5:30 pm.

<dd>Mr. Clements has been repeatedly involved in injuring his students. In most of the other cases, the injuries happened in a student-to-student injury or a student-to-teacher injury. When a teacher repeatedly injures students, that is a cause for concern and worth noting. It certainly doesn't speak well of the teacher. -- <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_204.180.221.45_e441.html" title="Special:Contributions/204.180.221.45">204.180.221.45</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/4/User_talk%7E204.180.221.45.html" title="User talk:204.180.221.45">talk</a>) .</small>

<p>Today, I edited a section of the criticism portion of the article to comply with Wikipedia regulations on biographies of living persons. Most importantly, "All unsourced and poorly sourced negative material about living persons should be removed from articles and talk pages immediately."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wp:cite#Tagging_unsourced_material" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wp:cite#Tagging_unsourced_material" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Also, <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> <b>requires</b> verifiability, using "high quality references". Under no circumstance should any information about Mr. Clements (or any other individual) be inserted into the article without <i>simultaneous</i> citation. Given the controversial nature of this topic, I and others are freed of the 3RR rule per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:BLP#Remove_unsourced_or_poorly_sourced_controversial_material" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:BLP#Remove_unsourced_or_poorly_sourced_controversial_material" rel="nofollow">WP:BLP</a> in order to remove uncited "controversial material". -- <a href="../../../x/i/l/User%7EXiliquiern_de49.html" title="User:Xiliquiern">Xiliquiern</a> 02:42, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This morning user 68.219.3.61 reverted the changes made to the article back to the "old" one, totally neglecting my request for discussion or even provision of a reason. (S)he also reinserted the uncited text on Mr. Clements that was removed per Wikipedia guidelines.

<p>Today I removed the section about the Edge-on-Flat <b>temporarily</b>. There was no citation of criticism (its good to show who thinks this, and not simply state that someone does) in the section, and only citation of ARMA beliefs. There is also some discussion of the intent of this section, as seen below in the Update: Oct 18 section. When this is discussed and consensus is met, the section will be reinserted with proper criticism. This is being done to prevent the spread of misinformation of misintent. The text removed is below for archiving purposes. -- <a href="../../../x/i/l/User%7EXiliquiern_de49.html" title="User:Xiliquiern">Xiliquiern</a> 18:59, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ARMA stance that all parries of cuts with cutting blades should occur edge-to-flat has come under particular criticism.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> However, it appears that this criticism is the result of a misunderstanding. ARMA's interpretation with most swords advocates parrying a cut either by displacing the cut by striking with one's edge into the flat of the incoming blade or by displacing the cut by receiving the edge of the incoming blade upon the flat of one's own blade. In direct contradiction with the criticism, ARMA and its associates find edge-on-edge parrying historical with thrusting weapons such as "true" rapiers or when thrusting with cutting blades. <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Similarly, ARMA also acknowledges that edge-on-edge parries were a part of later sword traditions, such as the saber, backsword, and smallsword, though these do not fall into the primary area of study for ARMA. <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> ARMA claims this position on edge-to-flat matches the techniques described by the historical masters.<a href="http://www.thearma.org/essays/edgemyth.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thearma.org/essays/edgemyth.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> ARMA-affiliated sword expert Hank Reinhardt argues that archaeological evidence supporting edge-on-edge parries (concerning longswords and arming swords, primarily) is virtually nonexistent, and other historical manuscripts on swordplay instruction specifically warn against parrying edge-on-edge. <a href="http://www.thearma.org/essays/parry.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thearma.org/essays/parry.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This morning, the entire criticism section was reverted to the "old" version by an anonymous editor with no edit summary or discussion on the talk page. I have sent them a message via user talk and invited them to discuss any grievances here on the talk page and explained why I changed the article back to the most recent version. --<a href="../../../x/i/l/User%7EXiliquiern_de49.html" title="User:Xiliquiern">Xiliquiern</a> 18:15, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a rough table of contents of the section under discussion, broken down sentence by sentence to preserve as much of the content as possible. I hope this will help people looking to edit this section view the concepts in simplistic and holistic manner rather than scattered about and complicated by additional wording on the main page. It is apparent as I type this that a regrouping of many parts may be beneficial and that the section as a whole is <i>very</i> messy right now.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Suggested New Structure: Oct 14</span></h3>
<p>Here is my suggestion for a new structure of the criticism section. You may compare it to the one above. I have tried to retain as much relevant information as possible, but have removed several redundant items, or items that were contradictory without necessarily providing a point-counterpoint dialogue. Similarly, the list of discussions about edge-on-edge blocking has been removed - perhaps it should be it's own article someday, but I don't think a collection of links fit in context here.</p>
<p><b>--This information has been removed by the author to reduce the page size.

<p>There are a few clarifying questions I would like to ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have any of the individuals who claim a living lineage shown verifiable proof of such? If not, what proof <i>do</i> they give?</li>
<li>The statement that ARMA "regularly" publishes articles attacking other schools may be a bit biased. One of the pages cited is undated, but old, according to ARMA affiliates, and the other is dated in 2000. Can a more recent succession of articles be provided? If not, I would say the word "regularly" is unfit and should be changed to reflect the apparrent <i>irregular</i> publication of these articles, or the criticism removed altogether as unverifiable.</li>
<li>Is there a compiled list of injuries of ARMA members to be compared to a similar list of other martial arts organizations? If not, it may be difficult to verify the claim that ARMA members are injured more often than members of other martial arts organizations.</li>
<li>One of the "criticisms" of Clements work includes this quote:
<blockquote>
<p>"Despite these two weaknesses, I think the book is a valuable addition to any swordsman's library. The living history student should be braced for undiluted venom, but would also be well served to ignore the barbs and look at the technique itself, which is well presented and reasonably complete. This book is the first in what I hope will be more exhaustive studies of the medieval fechtbuchs. Presented in clear, concise English with easy-to-digest diagrams, anyone wanting to become a more skilled swordsman will benefit by studying this book."</p>
</blockquote>
That certainly doesn't seem like criticism to me, and I wonder if this general praise should also be noted in the article?</li>
<li>How much of the "edge-on-edge" and "rapiers can/can't cut" debate comes from a misunderstanding (or ignorance?) of the ARMA terms used: "cut-and-thrust sword" and "true rapier"? Everyone seems to understand that some rapiers could cut relatively well, and others couldn't, the different appears to be primarily in nomenclature. With no standard typology (the situation of rapier blade development appears to be so mired as to prevent such a system), ARMA appears to have developed its own rough form, incorporating "cut-and-thrust sword" and "true rapier" to distinguish between the two forms of swords (those that both cut and thrust, and those that only thrust with affect) that others collectively call "rapiers". Is this difference in nomenclature the cause for so much misunderstanding, debate, and criticism?</li>
<li>Most importantly, how much rebuttle should be included? If the criticism is simply a list of criticism without any explanation, I think that it would certainly be POV, as it would be out of context. Similarly, I think if everything is simply blown off as a misconception, I also think that the section would be POV.

<dd>Popping in; I'm keeping busy. I wish I had time to work on this article (I improved it so much, and then people went reverting all the improvements. Sigh). Anyway, your proposed structure looks much better than what we have, and you've been making some good points. Make sure you keep in mind <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, <b>particularly</b> the part on "biased or malicious content".</dd>
<dd>I think most of your objections look very valid, and need to be addressed or the article changed accordingly. Concerning rapiers, I quote what I said in the Archive:
<dl>
<dd><i>I also find the criticism of ARMA's "position on rapiers" to be erroneous. From the ARMA website itself: "The various historical terms for rapier referred to a slender cut-and-thrust sword capable of limited slashing and slicing blows and equally suited to military or civilian use." Also: "As with any long bladed weapon, rapiers could always be used to strike a blow with the 'edge.'" It seems some straw men are being promulgated here.</i></dd>
<dd>And:</dd>
<dd><i>Having just looked over the ARMA article on Rapiers, John Clements makes a distinction between types of rapiers. What he defines as "true rapier" (in your quote) is the later rapier with a minimal blade that was, largely, an ineffective cutting weapon. Earlier rapiers, and rapiers designed with wider blades, were cutting weapons. I do not remember what Clements called these, but it was a term different than "true rapier". Clearly, this quote on the ARMA website is intended to be taken in context of the terminology it employs. As such, any argument against ARMA sparring rules involving "the rapier" in general would indeed appear to be straw man arguments here. Really, that ARMA would be criticized for its sparring conventions, particularly when they make sense given their assumed context, and particulraly within the ARMA method, hardly merits inclusion in Wikipedia. Furthermore, ARMA hardly emphasizes the rapier in training.</i></dd>
<dd>Also relevant but unrelated:</dd>
<dd><i>Generally, links to book reviews are inappropriate within a Wikipedia article in general, but particularly when the article in question isn't about a book.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I agree with you about the necessity of citations. I think we should remove anything that is controversial that lacks citation, personally. And I really think we should try to avoid citing message boards.</dd>
<dd>Thanks for working on this. Sorry I don't have time. Really, I wish they hadn't reverted in this spat so many of the things I worked on; many of your objections were my own… <a href="../../../j/a/d/User%7EJade_Knight_0f74.html" title="User:Jade Knight">The Jade Knight</a> 04:57, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>See also, and stick with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> as much as is possible. However, I think that anything that is uncontroversial can be left without a citation. <a href="../../../j/a/d/User%7EJade_Knight_0f74.html" title="User:Jade Knight">The Jade Knight</a> 05:23, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">First Text Draft: Oct 14</span></h3>
<p>I have moved ahead and incorporated the article text, with slight modification and addition of <a href="../../../f/a/c/Fact.html" title="Fact">fact</a> tags, into the outline format . This is provided directly below. Again, feel free to compare this with the above rough draft.</p>
<p><b>--This information has been removed by the author to reduce the page size.

<p>Again, I have a question.</p>
<ul>
<li>What does this:
<blockquote>
<p>ARMA has also published material arguing against what it perceives as unrealistic and inefficient techniques employed by other organizations, holding their work to its own internal standards.<a href="http://www.thearma.org/essays/LegWounds.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thearma.org/essays/LegWounds.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a><a href="http://www.thearma.org/essays/Intent.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thearma.org/essays/Intent.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>exactly criticize? What it sounds like to me is that ARMA finds other organizations at fault when they do not follow historical evidence - which seems kind of hard to criticize to me. Should this statement perhaps be made more towards the point that ARMA criticizes other organizations that do not follow guidelines based as strongly in historical text as ARMA believes its own guidelines to be?</p>
<p>Please feel free to provide any note or comment on the above. This is a touchy subject, and I want to try to get as much done "right" the first time as possible, to prevent much later reverts. As noted above, unless significant displeasure is shown, this is the text that will be inserted on October 18th. -- <a href="../../../x/i/l/User%7EXiliquiern_de49.html" title="User:Xiliquiern">Xiliquiern</a> 16:46, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you have it exactly right; the policy makes it clear that it applies to biographical information in non-biography articles. I also think your edits look very good. Thanks for putting so much effort into this. I'm still of the opinion that the criticisms (or what remain of them) should be put into the article itself, but oh well. <a href="../../../j/a/d/User%7EJade_Knight_0f74.html" title="User:Jade Knight">The Jade Knight</a> 00:12, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that option is very much still on the table, and I certainly wouldn't be opposed to it at all. In fact, now that you mention, I share that occurance as a sort of long term goal. What happened before, however, was that we had a large amount of uncited, partially unverifiable, redundant, and contradictory information both in the section for criticism and throughout the article. Needless to say, it was a huge mess. I felt that the easiest way to control the criticism was (like a fire) to contain it - now that control is being established, I think that we may look towards the more literary aspect. Once citations and/or deletions have been made and the criticism itself is solid and encyclopaedic, I would view incorporation into the article as a sort of final step. --<a href="../../../x/i/l/User%7EXiliquiern_de49.html" title="User:Xiliquiern">Xiliquiern</a> 02:18, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would also recommend criticism of his book be placed in the "ARMA member published literature" section, along with references to the two books; issues with the citation method used in Clements' books are not <i>necessarily</i> issues with ARMA, and probably don't belong in a section meant to include criticism of ARMA. <a href="../../../j/a/d/User%7EJade_Knight_0f74.html" title="User:Jade Knight">The Jade Knight</a> 00:47, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here is my latest offering. Spelling has been improved, and a note of the books being added to the literature section has been made. Also, one of the criticisms was removed because the citations did not really offer any criticism at all, neither did the statement of criticism. Instead, I moved the citations to support the first sentence as examples.</p>

<li>The ARMA stance that all parries of cuts with cutting blades should occur edge-to-flat has come under particular criticism.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> However, it appears that this criticism is the result of a misunderstanding.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>ARMA's interpretation with most swords advocates parrying a cut either by displacing the cut by striking with one's edge into the flat of the incoming blade or by displacing the cut by receiving the edge of the incoming blade upon the flat of one's own blade.</li>
<li>In direct contradiction with the criticism, ARMA and its associates find edge-on-edge parrying historical with thrusting weapons such as "true" rapiers or when thrusting with cutting blades. <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></li>
<li>Similarly, ARMA also acknowledges that edge-on-edge parries were a part of later sword traditions, such as the saber, backsword, and smallsword, though these do not fall into the primary area of study for ARMA. <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></li>
<li>ARMA claims this position on edge-to-flat matches the techniques described by the historical masters.<a href="http://www.thearma.org/essays/edgemyth.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thearma.org/essays/edgemyth.htm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></li>
<li>ARMA-affiliated sword expert Hank Reinhardt argues that archaeological evidence supporting edge-on-edge parries is virtually nonexistent, and other historical manuscripts on swordplay instruction specifically warn against parrying edge-on-edge <a href="http://www.thearma.org/essays/parry.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thearma.org/essays/parry.htm" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>ARMA's position for rapier sparring is that "For rapier fencing it is strongly suggested that the full body target be used (including the hand and foot). All thrusts to the torso, head, and neck should be counted as lethal. For true rapiers, slashes, slices, and draw-cuts should not be considered incapacitating or lethal." <a href="http://www.thearma.org/book/2nd.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thearma.org/book/2nd.htm" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>ARMA uses the term "true rapier" to designate a later rapier with a minimal blade that was, largely, an ineffective cutting weapon from other earlier rapiers that had effective cutting blades.</li>
<li>ARMA scholars do use cuts in rapier sparring, though only with weapons historically able to cut effectively.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<ul>
<li>However, some instructors from other organizations are critical of ARMA for not considering rapier cuts incapacitating or lethal in its sparring rules <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> and claim that this introduces unrealistic artifacts to sparring that leads to more grappling than might actually be reflected in a realistic encounter.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></li>

<p>I still intend for this to go into the article on October the 18th unless significant unresolved debate arises by then. -- <a href="../../../x/i/l/User%7EXiliquiern_de49.html" title="User:Xiliquiern">Xiliquiern</a> 04:21, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Article Update: Oct 18</span></h3>
<p>I have proceeded, as planned, to incorporate this revised text in place of the previous criticism section. During a final read-through I made a couple of minor copy-edit changes, most dealing with the addition of a single word or moving a line for clarity. I will provide an outline like the others here as a "First Published Draft". This incorporation took place shortly after 24:00 UCT (Coordinated Universal Time) October 18th. It is apparent that the criticism section is still very much in need of work, as there are many places noted as needing citation, and the whole section could do with a prose overhaul. And now, a question.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there a standard length of time that something goes uncited (assuming it is tagged with a request) before it can simply be removed from a page as "uncitable"?</li>
</ul>
<p>I would ask anyone to review and edit the new section, but I do ask that it not be reverted to the old version, or that new (old?) criticism is replaced without citations. Significant time was spent providing a more logical and rational section, and I would welcome comments here so that a discussion of any suggested changes could occur before another edit war starts up. A good deal of time was given for general "agreement" or "disagreement" to be expressed here on the talk page, though I understand some people may have simply missed it. I would ask that you please express discontent here without editing the main page. I gave you the courtesy of expressing yourself without immediately revising the article, and would ask the same respect in return, at least in regards to the criticism section. --<a href="../../../x/i/l/User%7EXiliquiern_de49.html" title="User:Xiliquiern">Xiliquiern</a> 00:07, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The edge-on-edge issue is not the result of "misunderstanding" between ARMA and other groups &amp; organizations. It is the direct result of very different interpretations of historical manuals and documents and extreamely different applications of the interpretations. In other word, it is more than just ARMA saying edge-on-edge is bad and not histoical and other groups saying it is ok and histocial. It also has to do with the application of techniques, especially in how cuts are performed. The best way this can describe this is: Edge-on-edge is not just something ARMA does not do, rather it is something that just does not happen. Likewise, edge-on-edge is not just something other group do, rather it is something that just happens a lot. I hope that makes sense.<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERanp_c007.html" title="User:Ranp">Ranp</a> 16:13, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This was a concern when I rewrote that section and I'm glad that you may be able to address it. Multiple editors provided a variety of unsourced statements criticizing and rebuttal-ling, so it was hard for me to know what's what. The way I meant 'misunderstanding' is that (supposedly) other organizations criticize ARMA for not thinking edge-on-edge parries existed with any weapon ever at any time. An example would be a classical fencing organization oriented entirely on rapier play thinking the ARMA method (for longsword/arming sword) was meant to apply to their rapier fencing as well. (This assumption was based on two statements included in the article listed below.) I understand that many different organizations have different interpretations of the fechtbucher, and that ARMA (and all the works I have ever read on swordsmanship) do not promote edge-to edge blocks with longsword (and like bladed weapons) at all. The inclusion of rapiers and other swords, as in these statements, confuses the issue somewhat:

<dd>I didn't add either of those statements (I believe I did edit them lightly in the recent revision of the section), so I don't know what truth is held in them. <b>Does ARMA believe (based on historic fact, etc) that edge-on-edge blocking was used with under these conditions?</b> I really don't know, hence the fact templates. If you could answer this, I would more than happily rephrase the section to include something more to the note that:
<ul>
<li>"The heated and lengthy debate on the use of edges in blocking has involved ARMA, as well as a number of other fencing organizations. ARMA, along with [other edge-to-flat organizations], currently does not find edge-to-edge blocking historical and instead finds edge-to-flat a proper manner of defense. ARMA claims this position on edge-to-flat matches the techniques described by the historical masters.(citation) ARMA-affiliated sword expert Hank Reinhardt argues that archaeological evidence supporting edge-on-edge parries (concerning longswords and arming swords, primarily) is virtually nonexistent, and other historical manuscripts on swordplay instruction specifically warn against parrying edge-on-edge.(citation) [Names of other organizations], however, refute this fact and purport that edge-to-edge is the historically correct geometry for blocking a blade."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Is this a more suitable explanation of the position of ARMA in the debate? Would it be worth the detail to provide ARMA views on rapier/falchion/backsword/broadsword/smallsword blocking if said position differs from their edge-to-flat for longsword? This may be a section that you would be particularly qualified to rewrite yourself, if you have time. If not, I'd be happy to work with you to get it right. I really don't know the whole situation of the debate, only the ARMA angle on longswords and similarly bladed swords, and am in the dark on what other organizations believe and any 'exceptions' that ARMA has for the general e-o-f rule. --<a href="../../../x/i/l/User%7EXiliquiern_de49.html" title="User:Xiliquiern">Xiliquiern</a> 16:44, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since there is currently no citation of criticism of this portion of the article, I think it is fit to be temporarily removed. Again, the only citation in this portion is ARMA articles, and there is no citation of criticism from outside organizations. I would like to get the intent of the section correct, and gather more facts before providing misinformation or relying the wrong information about the same topic.--<a href="../../../x/i/l/User%7EXiliquiern_de49.html" title="User:Xiliquiern">Xiliquiern</a> 18:54, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Might be good to paste deleted text here, or in a subheader here on the talk page. Not that I disagree with your deletions. <a href="../../../j/a/d/User%7EJade_Knight_0f74.html" title="User:Jade Knight">The Jade Knight</a> 00:42, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah it was copied into the Content and Criticism section above (I post any changes I make there "for the record") either moments before or moments after I made the deletion. Thanks for the heads-up though! --<a href="../../../x/i/l/User%7EXiliquiern_de49.html" title="User:Xiliquiern">Xiliquiern</a> 01:36, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You were correct to remove the section on the edge-on-edge issue. The edge-on-edge issue is not a criticism of ARMA, rather it is criticism by ARMA of other groups and organizations.<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERanp_c007.html" title="User:Ranp">Ranp</a> 19:17, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
