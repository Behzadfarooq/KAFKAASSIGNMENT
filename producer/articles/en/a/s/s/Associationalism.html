<p>Associationalism is a European political theory, stemming from 19th and early 20th century social and political theorists from the continent. In France, such political thinkers as de Tocqueville, Proudhon, Durkeheim, and Duguit. In England, such pluralists as Cole, Figgis, Laski, Barker, and Maitland. The theory provides an alternative to the previously popular doctrines of state-centered and over-collectivist ideals which had all but dominated twentieth-century politics: Western social democracy and Eastern bloc Marxist-Leninism (Kaspersen 1).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Associationalism.html" title="Edit section: Alexis de Tocqueville's Associationalism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Alexis de Tocqueville's Associationalism</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexis_de_Tocqueville_19aa.html" title="Alexis de Tocqueville">Alexis de Tocqueville</a>'s idea of associationalism “...stressed volunteerism, community spirit and independent associational life as protections against the domination of society by the state, and indeed as a counterbalance which helped to keep the state accountable and effective” (Lewis 3). In Tocqueville’s vision then, economic freedom fosters greed, which engenders political apathy, which results in excessive individualism and passive reliance on the state. This political apathy will in turn result in the almost inevitable growth of government if left unchecked by associationalism. Thus, Tocqueville predicted that “It is easy to see the time coming in which men will be less and less able to produce, by each alone, the commonest bare necessities of life. The tasks of government must therefore perpetually increase, and its efforts to cope with them must spread its net ever wider. The more government takes the place of associations, the more will individuals lose the idea of forming associations and need the government to come to their help. That is a vicious cycle of cause and effect” (de Tocqueville 43).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Associationalism.html" title="Edit section: Expanded Definition">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Expanded Definition</span></h3>
<p>Associational democracy is, in essence, both a political structure and system of relations with the goal of easing pluralist social negotiation and priorities (Kaspersen 12). It became an important aspect of public policy, serving as a much needed balance to the previous traditions of political apathy known as laissez-faire. Laissez-faire, which essentially equated to the liberal individualism favored and advocated by the upper class, was not conducive to the desires of upward mobility expressed by much of the middle class. Associationalism, as opposed to liberal individualism, embodies a commitment to social cooperation as well as public well-being (Martell 16).</p>
<p>"Association....grew out of a sense of difference; for the middle class, it meant crossing class lines to bring together people of diverse identities and conditions" (McGerr 67). During the late 19th and early 20th century the new middle class required “...sanctioned private accumulation underwritten by a state which maintained legal order and stability" (Lewis 3). As a result, the state needed to become powerful enough to maintain order, but not so strong as to become oppressive; neither laissez-faire nor statist. Finding this balance between transgressing autonomy and dangerous accumulation of power could prove difficult, and associationalism appeared to be a possible solution (Kaspersen 17).</p>
<p>Associationalism brought together several political ideologies which, until its conception, were frequently at odds: pluralism, socialism, and cooperative mutualism. It provides for a pluralist rather than a statist or constraining collectivist socialism, yet it also provides for a mutualist and cooperative pluralism. This, as opposed to pluralism which reacts so far to statist communitarianism that it slides into an unrestricted competitive asociality (Martell 17).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Associationalism.html" title="Edit section: Setting the Stage">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Setting the Stage</span></h3>
<p>Urban politics in late 19th century America proved an ideal situation for the emergence of associationalism, ripe with several qualifications discussed by early associationalists. In addition, voter turnout was relatively high, though usually confined to party lines. Despite this fact, the two large national parties at the time (Democrats and Republicans) lacked significant ideological differences on specific issues. Respected members of communities across the country began to propose associationalism as a solution to America's social political problems. to Several protestant ministers such as Lyman Abbot, Washington Gladden, Josiah Strong, and Walter Raushenbusch began to call for a “Social Gospel.” “The next great principle,” Rauschenbush proclaimed in 1896, “is association” (McGerr 66). The American people agreed, electing William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt, a left statist associationalist who would become president shortly thereafter, in 1900.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Associationalism.html" title="Edit section: Protective Legislation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Protective Legislation</span></h3>
<p>“Associationalism is fundamentally about collective governance – about the legal constitution of groups and bodies politic and the rules and bylaws that regulate the interrelationships of members” (Novak 2). During the early 20th century Congress passed a great deal of “protective legislation,” which was, in essence, legislated associationalism. Though there were several benefits to this legislation, there were also many setbacks as well. Labor received improved work conditions resulting in fewer work-related injuries. Wages were increased while hours were decreased. In addition, probably the most important protective legislation pertained the legal establishment and organization of large labor unions.</p>
<p>On the other side of the coin, employer costs went up resulting in outsourcing and decreased cash flow into such areas as research and development, slowing technological progress. Fewer hours and the fact that labor was more organized (allowing for an increase in strikes and protests) resulted in less production. Finally, such strong government influence over labor could lead to an abuse of power, favoring certain unions. Through these legislated regulations it was made clear that associationalism tends to benefit labor (the "People”) directly at the cost of both corporate management and technological progress.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Associationalism.html" title="Edit section: Theodore Roosevelt">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Theodore Roosevelt</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Roosevelt_3623.html" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> (President 1901-1908) was the first true champion of American associationalism as evidenced by his intervention into the United Mine Workers strike of 1902. For the first time representatives from government, labor, and management met collectively and were able to resolve the conflict. When management was uncooperative, Roosevelt threatened to employ the military on behalf of labor to arrive at a resolution.</p>
<p>Instead, a five member commission was established to communicate with the company management. Also, wages were increased by ten percent and the length of the work day was cut from ten hours to nine, keeping union membership sound. By demonstrating a new role for the state in such conflicts (aside from the previously held military positions) associationalism took root in American society and politics, and there wasn't another major coal strike in the country until the 1920s.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Associationalism.html" title="Edit section: Woodrow Wilson">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Woodrow Wilson</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodrow_Wilson_eb76.html" title="Woodrow Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> (President 1913-1920), a regulatory liberal, employed associationalism during World War I to control and regulate capital, ensuring a steady flow of war supplies while minimizing the risk of breaks in manufacturing vital to the war effort. The establishment of such government agencies as the National War Labor Board were instrumental in preventing strikes and ensuring collective bargaining. In addition, Wilson appointed the country's first Secretary of Labor that was pro labor (<a href="../../../w/i/l/William_B._Wilson_2cef.html" title="William B. Wilson">William B. Wilson</a>). As a result, America's wartime production was extremely successful. There were nearly no strikes, many companies saw enormous profits, and the Allies won the war. Once again, associationalism proved to be a viable solution to America's labor issues.</p>
