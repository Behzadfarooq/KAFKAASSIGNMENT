<p>Well, mainly for being NPOV / non factual (er, until someone comes up with a credible source). She was involved in a murder case, saying it's part of an assault on thre Black Liberation movement seems pretty far-fetched. It's probably be possible to reinsert something on COINTELPRO somewhere in the article, though. Or saying that "some say this was part of a general assault ..." but some sources on that would be useful. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlammifer_bbb8.html" title="User:Flammifer">Flammifer</a> 05:40, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

I don't know for sure, but since such a raid did occur it's possible that this is valid.

<dd><i>After their capture, my father was part of the team assigned to guard the severely wounded Chesimard in the hospital. As the troopers stood outside of her room, she incessantly chanted, "If I had some poison gas, I'd throw it on your white ass."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Both were tried and sentenced to life in prison. During the trial, both defendants were highly disruptive and violent. Eventually the judge had them placed in a separate sound-proof booth that suppressed their chants and allowed them to hear and see the courtroom through a plastic window. During the proceedings, the two defendants laid on the ground of the booth and had sex in the midst of the courtroom. Chesimard became pregnant and had a daughter before being transferred to the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women, where on November 2, 1979, she was sprung from the prison by four visitors that took a guard and a driver hostage. Despite an intense manhunt, she remained on the lamb in the US until 1986, when she made her way to Cuba and was granted political asylum. Today she walks free as a professor, counter-cultural heroine and published author, reviewed by the NY Times: "A deftly written book... a spellbinding tale." Incidentally, her stature has also been augmented by virtue of being the aunt of the late rapper, Tupac Shakur.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>That may be worth integrating, but some better sources would be useful.</p>

<dd>

<dd>The above narrative makes it sound as though Shakur and her co-defendant copulated in front of the judge, jury, lawyers, clerks and so on.

<p>Geez are we a little biased on this page. The woman is a murderer and deserves the death sentence. You stated she could not have fired the weapon (why not?)</p>

<p>There's a few things I cleaned up here. First, the article is "Assata Shakur" but the text of the article kept refering to her by her former name "Joanne Chesimard". This is confusing. I changed "Chesimard" references to "Shakur", except, of course, for references to the Congressional resolution in which the name "Chesimard" was used and which factored into the Congressional Black Caucus issue.</p>
<p>"However, this argument doesn't seem to hold water as the state's case proved that Chesimard was the initial shooter." I removed this sentence because it's point was already made two paragraphs previous and also because it is POV.</p>
<p>"However, they and their supporters have had a difficult time explaining exactly how a police officer was shot twice in the head with his own gun" I removed this sentence because it is POV.</p>
<p>"As far as organizations strongly supporting her return, the list is endless." I removed this sentence because it fails to provide useful information. Does someone have a list of organizations supporting her extradition that could replace this sentence?</p>
<p>This article clearly needs more editing, particularly to clean up the smattering of one-sentence paragraphs towards the end. It also could use more references, rather than simply saying "supporters/detractors say..."</p>

<p><br />
"However, the scientific evidence presented at trial dispelled this attempt." Removed because, again, this contention was already made and, furthermore, it treats this conclusion as if it were widely accepted. There are very many people who accept, in good faith, both sides of the story. Wikipedia cannot treat one side as correct. That's what NPOV is all about.</p>
<p>"However, they and their supporters have had a difficult time explaining exactly how a police officer was shot twice in the head with his own gun" Once more, this is POV and I have removed it. If this could be framed in a NPOV fashion, I would be happy to leave it be. However, statements such as "supporters have had a difficult time explaining" clearly takes a side in the controversy and cannot be allowed on Wikipedia. To 152.163.101.5, please make your case here in the discussion board, instead of simply making anonymous changes.</p>

<p><s>In case not everything makes sense here, this article has been thoroughly vandalized by The Old Buck. The individual in question has visited the bio pages of multiple individuals who changed their names (generally to African-root names) and changed them back en masse. He's also been inserting POV and occasionally purely propagandistic (or vulgar) material to these articles. I'm searching his contributions at present, and I've found none (yet) that were made in earnest. Either we can revert to a stage previous his edits, or we can work to fix it manually--I'm not sure how many changes have been made since, so I'm not going to touch it until I can take a better look.</s> <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 00:14, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know anything about Assata Shakur so this was an interesting article for me. I have a few comments/suggestions.</p>
<p>1) The article says she is the "non-biological godmother" of Tupac Shakur. But aren't godparents usually non-kin?</p>
<p>2) This is a biographical article, but it is dominated by the turnpike shootout. Is there more notable stuff to say about Assata Shakur besides that? The article says she was a Black Panther and in the Black Liberation Army -- is there anything more to say about her activist life? How about her life in Cuba? If there isn't much to say about that it almost seems like this article should be called "Trials of Assata Shakur" or something more like that...</p>
<p>3) The trial stuff doesn't include enough about the prosecution's POV. I have no idea, reading this, how they decided to convict her of the assault/attempted murder of Trooper Harper. What did the judge say? How did the prosecution counter the doctors' testimony? This information needs to be included. Also, the way the trial section is currently set up is confusing. The information about the conviction precedes the various types of testimony -- it would be better if the conviction were mentioned after the testimony.</p>
<p>4)The section "escape and political asylum in Cuba" contains a lot of stuff which doesn't really belong under that heading, like the stuff about the documentary, Mos Def, and the various stuff which has been named and un-named for her. Maybe the section should be renamed.<a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatsam_ef10.html" title="User:Katsam">Katsam</a> 02:35, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your comments. I added the non-biological part because many sources erroniously refer to her as his biological aunt as well.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I found some interviews with her that I could use to expand upon her life in Cuba and was planning on reading her autobiography to expand upon her life before the shootout. I've been hoping to find some book reviews instead though because if it hasn't been reported by a secondary source we might be in dangerous territory original research-wise.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In answer to your question, I think that the best insight I've found into why she was convicted (without relying on the theory that the jury was racist) is the way the acomplice laws were written at the time. They didn't necessarily have to think that she shot the Trooper in the head to convict her, just that her presence at the scene aided and abetted the crimes. The sources I've found say that the prosecution didn't introduce any testimony to counter the medical witnesses (although amdmittedly these are pro-Shakur sources; it's possible that the prosecution thought they had asked adequate cross-examination questions). However, I can't do more than speculate; the trial transcript is not publicly available and the district attorney and Trooper Harper haven't written books or articles post-trial that I am aware of. I think the conviction should be mentioned first because its more notable than the individual pieces of evidence, but I'd be willing to change the order.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I absolutely agree with your #4 comment; I just haven't thought of an appropriate section title yet. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 04:03, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's OK if you read her autobiography and include that information: that doesn't qualify as original research. <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> means you can't write things in Wikipedia unless they've already been written somewhere else. You can't, for instance, call Trooper Harper up on the phone and write in Wikipedia about your interview with him. But writing things which were in a person's published autobiography are fine.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you want to say that she wasn't his aunt, I would suggest saying that outright. Something like "Though many sources have erroneously claimed that Shakur was the aunt of hip-hop artist Tupac Shakur, this is not the case. Instead, she was his godmother." You can link to the "godparent" page if you're afraid people think "godparent" is a blood link.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It surprises me that the trial transcript would be under lock and key: I thought that stuff was public domain? Well, anyway, there ought to be some mention of the point of view of folks who thought she did it -- and there must be some people who think so if there's a $1 million dollar bounty out for her. It may be that those people think so for racist/political reasons, and it may be that she was convicted on the grounds that being present = being an accomplice -- but in that case why even bother having a trial? They knew she was there. Anyway, the article will seem non-neutral until it has some semblance of the prosecutorial POV.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, this sentence is a little messed up:</dd>
<dd>"On 25 March 1977—back in Middlesex County, New Jersey—Shakur was convicted as an accomplice the murders of New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster and Zayd Shakur, possession of weapons, as well as assault and attempted murder of Trooper Harper." -- <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatsam_ef10.html" title="User:Katsam">Katsam</a> 10:44, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>I moved it to a "Legacy" section; it seems a bit odd to be doing this for a livng person but this is where the info would go in most articles. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 04:06, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's a fine line between using weasel words and having to quote the various blogs and the internet that erroniously refer to her as his aunt/cousin/etc. I prefer simply stating that theres no relations. Godparent is already linked.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>They didn't even have stenographers at every trial back in the 70s. Such a transcript might not exist; it almost certainly isn't online. I don't live or go to school anywhere near New Jersey. I think that anything that requires you to file a <a href="../../../f/o/i/FOIA_3838.html" title="FOIA">FOIA</a> request, <i>is</i> original research.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Is your problem with that sentence that "back in Middlesex County" clause? If so I could move that too a separate sentence. I just thought that was less aescetically pleasing. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 22:56, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
If the basis of her conviction is that she was merely present at the scene, why is there multiple paragraphs that attempt to show that she wasn't the shooter? The attempt seems to be to imply that she was innocent of the charges. Is this relevant?</p>
<dl>
<dd>There aren't multiple paragraphs that attempt to show anything.

<p>I am placing the article on hold for 1 week pending clean-up of the following issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>organization: Article needs a reorganization. The main focus of the article seems to be the NJ State Trooper shooting; information on this is broken up and scattered.</li>
<li>Referencing: The section titled "New Jersey Turnpike shootout" is entirely unreferenced.</li>
<li>NPOV: The article takes the tone that Ms. Shakur was innocent of wrongdoing, and wrongly accused of the murders she was convicted of. While I would also disagree if the article slanted in the opposite direction; the article presents too much evidence against her conviction while giving NONE of the evidence in support of her conviction. This needs to be corrected.</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1 week, I will return and pass or fail based on these fixes. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 04:15, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I added the references.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't see how you would prefer the NJ State Trooper shooting info organized. I think it makes much more sense to address the evidence introduced in the trial in its own section. I'd be open to a more specific suggestion on the sectioning.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Could you give some examples of where the <i>tone</i> is a problem?
