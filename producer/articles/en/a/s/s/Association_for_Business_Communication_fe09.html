<p>The ABC is an international organization, divided into eight regional divisions, each with their own separate academic conferences. The regions are Europe; Asia and Pacific Rim; Caribbean and Central America and five North American regions (Canada, Southwest US, Eastern US, Southeast US and Midwest US). The ABC’s headquarters is in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>. Each year the entire membership meets in the International Convention in the October or November. Every Spring, two regional conferences are held, one of the European region and one of the North American regions. The Asia and Pacific Rim region holds a conference every two years. At the International Convention and at the regional conferences, members come together to share research in business communication, participate in workshops, network.</p>
<p>A Board of Directors and an Executive Committee of five members leads the ABC. The Board of Directors is directly elected with a Vice President elected from each region and 12 directors at large, with staggered terms. Executive Committee consists of an unelected permanent position of Executive Director and four elected members. The members of the Executive Committee serve for four years in rotating capacity, beginning as Second Vice President in the first year, then First Vice President the next, President the next and Past President the last year on the committee. The organization as a whole elects the Second Vice President position from among candidates on the Board of Directors. This structure allows for continuity while at the same time.</p>
<p>The current Executive Director of the ABC is Dr. <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_J._Myers_030b.html" title="Robert J. Myers">Robert J.

<p>The JBC was founded in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>. At the time (and for several decades) it remained the only journal devoted solely to business communication theory. In its own words on the ABC website “publishes manuscripts that contribute to knowledge and theory of business communication as a distinct, multifaceted field approached through the administrative disciplines, the liberal arts, and the social sciences.”</p>
<p>The JBC summarizes its research focus as devoted to articles that “contribute to knowledge and theory of business communication as a distinct, multifaceted field approached through the administrative disciplines, the liberal arts, and the social sciences. Accordingly, JBC seeks manuscripts that address all areas of business communication including but not limited to business composition/technical writing, information systems, international business communication, management communication, and organizational and corporate communication. In addition, JBC welcomes submissions concerning the role of written, verbal, nonverbal and electronic communication in the creation, maintenance, and performance of profit and not for profit business.”</p>
<p>The current editor of the JBC is Dr. Margaret Baker Graham of <a href="../../../i/o/w/Iowa_State_University_eee7.html" title="Iowa State University">Iowa State University</a>.</p>

<p>In its own words on the ABC website, the BCQ is “devoted to the teaching of business communication, which is a broad, interdisciplinary field.” The BCQ summarizes the focus of its articles as</p>
<p>“-discussions of issues and methods for teaching business communication in a variety of settings: two–year college, technical institute, four-year college, university, corporate or agency training program, and the like</p>
<p>-case studies of specific classroom techniques</p>

<p>The ABC has Ad Hoc Committees for interests that have not yet warranted a Standing Committee, but may in the future become so. Many of the Standing Committees began as Ad Hoc Committees. In 2006 has four Ad Hoc Committees:</p>
<p>1. Marketing of ABC 2. Non-Tenure Track Faculty 3. Professional Ethics 4. Retired Members</p>
<p>Additionally, ABC members pursue a number of professional objectives through voluntary interest groups. Interest group may be convened by the First Vice President or by members’ current interest groups. In 2006, the ABC had the following five Interest Groups:</p>
<p>1. <a href="../../../m/b/a/MBA_9d6c.html" title="MBA">MBA</a> Consortium 2. Business Practices 3. Consultants' Interest Group 4. Intercultural Communication 5. <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rhetoric.html" title="Rhetoric">Rhetoric</a> Special Interest Group</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_for_Business_Communication_fe09.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The ABC was founded in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>, beginning with a modest membership of 72 members, all but one from the United States (the only exception being from Canada). The organization, based at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Illinois_8473.html" title="University of Illinois">University of Illinois</a> was then named the “Association of College Teachers of Business Writers.” The next year, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>, that name changed to the “American Business Writing Association.”</p>
<p>By the 1960’s, the field had grown considerably and became heavily interested in areas well beyond business writing (such as oral presentations, negotiations, and nonverbal communication among others). In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>, the Board of Directors voted to change the name of the organization to the “American Business Communication Association” to reflect this change.</p>
<p>By the late 1970’s, as the membership of the organization grew to include more member from outside the Americas and as the focus of research expanded heavily into the fields of intercultural communication and cross-cultural business communication practice, the term “American” became increasingly inaccurate of both the membership and focus of the organization. In 1985, the Board of Directors voted to change the name to its current “Association for Business Communication.”</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>, the ABC moved its headquarters from <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois.html" title="Illinois">Illinois</a> first to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_North_Texas_430f.html" title="University of North Texas">University of North Texas</a> (from 1990-1994) and then to its current location at <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baruch_College_af22.html" title="Baruch College">Baruch College</a> <a href="../../../c/u/n/CUNY_2761.html" title="CUNY">CUNY</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> (from 1994 to the present).</p>
