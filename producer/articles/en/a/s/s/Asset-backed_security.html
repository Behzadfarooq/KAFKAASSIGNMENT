<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Asset-backed_security.html" title="Edit section: Definition">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Definition</span></h2>
<p>On January 18th, 2005 The SEC approved a final ruling on the definition of Asset-Backed Securities. <sup id="_ref-secruling_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-secruling" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>"Definition of ABS. The term “asset-backed security” is currently defined in Form S-3 to mean a security that is primarily serviced by the cash flows of a discrete pool of receivables or other financial assets, either fixed or revolving, that by their terms convert into cash within a finite time period plus any rights or other assets designed to assure the servicing or timely distribution of proceeds to the security holders. The SEC staff has historically interpreted the phrase “convert into cash by their terms” to exclude from the definition most assets that require positive action to be realized upon – such as non-performing assets and physical property. It has also interpreted the “discrete pool” requirement in such a way as to disqualify most securities issued in transactions where the composition of the pool is not set on the date of issuance or can change over time. The new rules modify these existing interpretations in certain respects while codifying them in others.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Lease-Backed Securities. The new rule expands the definition of “asset-backed security” to include lease-backed securities as long as the residual value of the leased property is less than 50% of the original securitized pool balance (or less than 65% in the case of motor vehicle leases). However, such securities may be shelf-registered on Form S-3 only if the residual value of the leased property represents less than 20% of the original securitized pool balance (or less than 65% in the case of motor vehicle leases).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Delinquent and Non-performing Assets. The new rules provide that a security may be considered to be an “asset-backed security” even if the underlying asset pool has total delinquencies of up to 50% at the time of the proposed offering as long as the original asset pool does not include any “non-performing” assets. However, consistent with current practice, shelf registration on Form S-3 will be available only if delinquent assets constitute 20% or less of the original asset pool. An asset is considered to be non-performing if it satisfies the charge-off policies of the sponsor (or applicable bank regulatory agencies) or if it would be considered a charged-off asset under the terms of the applicable transaction documents.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Exceptions to the “Discrete Pool” Requirement. The new rules generally codify the SEC staff’s position that a security must be backed by a discrete pool of assets in order to be considered an ABS. However, the new rules establish the following exceptions to address market practices.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(1) Any security issued in a master trust structure would meet the definition of “asset-backed security” without limitation.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(2) “asset-backed securities” will also include securities with a prefunding period of up to one year during which up to 50% of the offering proceeds (or, in the case of master trusts, up to 50% of the aggregate principal balance of the total asset pool whose cash flows support the ABS) may be used for subsequent purchases of pool assets.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(3) The new rules also include within the definition of “asset-backed security” securities with revolving periods during which new financial assets may be acquired. In the case of revolving assets such as credit cards, dealer floorplan and home equity lines of credit, there is no limit to the length of the revolving period or the amount of new assets that can be purchased during that time. For securities backed by receivables or other financial assets that do not arise under revolving accounts, such as automobile loans and mortgage loans, an unlimited revolving period will be permitted for up to three years. However, the new assets added to the pool during the revolving period must be of the same general character as the original pool assets.</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Asset-backed_security.html" title="Edit section: Overview">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Overview</span></h2>
<p>A significant advantage of asset-backed securities is that they bring together a pool of financial assets that otherwise could not easily be traded in their existing form. By pooling together a large portfolio of these illiquid assets they can be converted into instruments that may be offered and sold freely in the capital markets. Their bankruptcy remoteness allows the investor to take on credit risk of the asset without taking on specific corporate credit risk of the originator. The tranching of these securities into instruments with different risk/return profiles facilitates marketing of the bonds to investors with different risk appetites and investing time horizons.</p>
<p>Asset-backed securities enable the originators of the loans to enjoy most of the benefits of lending money without bearing the risks involved. ABSs offer several advantages to the originators of the asset pools: First, selling those financial assets to the pools reduces their risk-weighted assets and thereby frees up their capital, enabling them to originate still more loans. Second, it lowers their risks. In a worse-case scenario where the pool of assets performs very badly, the owner of ABS would pay the price of bankruptcy rather than the originator. And, the originators earn fees from originating the loans, as well as from continuing to serve the assets throughout their life.</p>
<p>"The financial institutions that originate the loans sell a pool of cashflow-producing assets to a specially created third party that is called a special-purpose vehicle (SPV). The SPV is designed to insulate investors from the credit risk of the originating financial institution. The SPV then sells the pooled loans to a trust, which issues interest bearing securities that can achieve a credit rating separate from the financial institution that originates the loan. The typically higher credit rating is given because the securities that are used to fund the securitization rely solely on the cash flow created by the assets, not on the payment promise of the issuer. The monthly payments from the underlying assets—loans or receivables—typically consist of principal and interest, with principal being scheduled or unscheduled. The cash flows produced by the underlying assets can be allocated to investors in different ways. Cash flows can be directly passed through to investors after administrative fees are subtracted, thus creating a “pass-through” security; alternatively, cash flows can be carved up according to specified rules and market demand, thus creating “structured” securities." <sup id="_ref-dwight_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dwight" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Asset-backed_security.html" title="Edit section: Common Types of Asset-Backed Securities">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Common Types of Asset-Backed Securities</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Home Equity Loans</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Securities collateralized by home equity loans (HELs) are currently the largest asset class within the ABS market. investors typically refer to HELs as any nonagency loans that do not fit into either the jumbo or alt-A loan categories. While early HELs were mostly second lien subprime mortgages, first-lien loans now make up the majority of issuance. Subprime mortgage borrowers have a less than perfect credit history and are required to pay interest rates higher than what would be available to a typical agency borrower. In addition to first and second-lien loans, other HEL loans can consist of high loan to value (LTV) loans, re-performing loans, scratch and ent loans, or open-ended home equity lines of credit (HELOC), which homeowners use as a method to consolidate debt. <sup id="_ref-Dwight_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dwight" title="">[3]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Auto Loans</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The second largest subsector in the ABS market is auto loans. Auto finance companies issue securities backed by underlying pools of auto-related loans. Auto ABS are classified into three categories: prime, nonprime, and subprime. Prime auto ABS are collaterlized by loans made to borrowers with strong credit histories. Nonprime auto ABS consist of loans made to lesser credit quality consumers, which may have higher cumulative losses. Finally subprime borrowers will typically have lower incomes, tainted credited histories, or both. Owner trusts are the most common structure used when issuing auto loans and allow investors to receive interest and principal on sequential basis. Deals can also be structured to pay on a pro-rata or combination of the two. <sup id="_ref-Dwight_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dwight" title="">[3]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Credit Card Receivables</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Securities backed by credit card receivables have been benchmark for the ABS market since they were first introduced in 1987. Credit card holders may borrow funds on a revolving basis up to an assigned credit limit. The borrowers then pay principal and interest as desired, along with the required minimum monthly payments. Because principal repayment is not scheduled, credit card debt does not have an actual maturity date and is considered a nonamortizing loan.<sup id="_ref-Dwight_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dwight" title="">[3]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>ABS backed by credit card receivables are issued out of trusts that have evolved over time from discrete trusts to various types of master trusts of which the most common is the de-linked master trust. Discrete trusts consist of a fixed or static pool of receivables that are tranched into senior/subordinated bonds. A master trust has the advantage of offering multiple deals out of the same trust as the number of receivables grows, each of which is entitled to a pro-rata share of all of the receivables. The delinked structures allow the issuer to separate the senior and subordinate series within a trust and issue them at different points in time. The latter two structures allow investors to benefit from a larger pool of loans made over time rather than one static pool.<sup id="_ref-Dwight_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dwight" title="">[3]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Student Loans</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>ABS collateralized by student loans comprise a respectable segment of the market and are a benchmark subsector for most floating rate indices. Federal Family Education Loan Programs or FFELP loans are the most common form of loans and almost entirely guaranteed by the U.S. Government. As a result, performance has historically been very good.<sup id="_ref-Dwight_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dwight" title="">[3]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Stranded Cost Utilities</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Rate reduction bonds (RRBs) came about as the result of a 1992 National Energy Policy, which was designed to increase competition in the electricity market. To avoid any disruptions while moving from a non-competitive to a competitive market place regulators have allowed utilities to recover certain “Transition Costs” over a period of time. These costs are considered nonbypassable and are added to all customer bills. Since consumers usually pay utility bills before any other, chargeoffs have historically been low. RRBs offerings are typically large enough to create reasonable liquidity in the aftermarket, and average life extension is limited by a “true up” mechanism.<sup id="_ref-Dwight_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dwight" title="">[3]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Other</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>There are many other cash-flow-producing assets, including manufactured housing loans, equipment leases and loans,</dd>
<dd>aircraft leases, trade receivables, dealer floor plan loans, and royalties. <sup id="_ref-Dwight_6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dwight" title="">[3]</a></sup></dd>

<p>"In the United States, the process for issuing asset-backed securities in the primary market is similar to that of issuing other securities, such as corporate bonds, and is governed by the Securities Act of 1933, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Publicly issued asset-backed securities have to satisfy standard SEC registration and disclosure requirements, and have to file periodic financial statements." <sup id="_ref-sofabs_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sofabs" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p><br />
"The Process of trading asset-backed securities in the secondary market is similar to that of trading corporate bonds, and also to some extent, mortgage-backed securities. Most of the trading is done in over-the-counter markets, with telephone quotes on a security basis. There appear to be no publicly available measures of trading volume, or of number of dealers trading in these securities." <sup id="_ref-sofabs_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sofabs" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p><br />
"A survey by the Bond Market Association shows that at the end of 2004, in the United States and Europe there were 74 electronic trading platforms for trading fixed-income securities and derivatives, with 5 platforms for asset-backed securities in the United States, and 8 in Europe." <sup id="_ref-sofabs_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sofabs" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>"Discussions with market participants show that compared to Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, many asset-backed securities are not liquid, and their prices are not transparent. This is partly because asset-backed securities are not as standardized as Treasury securities, or even mortgage-backed securities, and investors have to evaluate the different structures, maturity profiles, credit enhancements, and other features of an asset-backed security before trading it."<sup id="_ref-sofabs_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sofabs" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The "price" of an asset-backed security is usually quoted as a spread to a corresponding swap rate. For example, the price of a credit card-backed, AAA rated security with a two-year maturity by a benchmark issuer might be quoted at 5 basis points (or less) to the two-year swap rate." <sup id="_ref-sofabs_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sofabs" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
