<p><b>Have you read the <a href="../../../a/m/a/Wikipedia%7EAMA_FAQs_e346.html" title="Wikipedia:AMA FAQs">AMA FAQ</a>?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Answer: Yes</li>
</ul>
<p><b>How would you describe the nature of this dispute? (policy violation, content dispute, personal attack, other)</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Answer: Policy violation, personal attacks, incivility</li>
</ul>
<p><b>What methods of <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">Dispute Resolution</a> have you tried so far? If you can, please provide wikilinks so that the Advocate looking over this case can see what you have done.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Answer: Well, so far I've tried talking to <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmir_Arven_887c.html" title="User:Emir Arven">Emir Arven</a>, and I've written a report on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>, but so far nothing has come of it; in fact, my report on the admin's noticeboard (which has been on the noticeboard for days now) has not seen a single response from an administrator, even though there clearly is a heated situation.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>What do you expect to get from <a href="../../../a/m/a/WP%7EAMA_ced1.html" title="WP:AMA">Advocacy</a>?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Answer: Hopefully <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmir_Arven_887c.html" title="User:Emir Arven">Emir Arven</a> will change his behaviour, stop using personal attacks against me, and stop harassing me. I also hope that all of the attack pages and individual personal attacks will be deleted from Wikipedia.</li>

<p><a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmir_Arven_887c.html" title="User:Emir Arven">Emir Arven</a> just will not stop his personal attacks, incivility and false accusations against me. After lengthy discussions with him, he still does not seem to understand that what he is doing is wrong. <a href="../../../e/m/i/User_talk%7EEmir_Arven_dfe8.html" title="User talk:Emir Arven">His talk page</a> (and <a href="../../../e/m/i/User_talk%7EEmir_Arven_Archives_4_2696.html" title="User talk:Emir Arven/Archives 4">one of it's archives</a>) is basically an attack page against me - almost everything on it is a personal attack against me, incivility towards me, lies about me, false accusations against me, and just generally insulting towards me. The other pages above (<a href="../../../s/u/s/Category%7ESuspected_Wikipedia_sockpuppets_of_Ivan_Kricancic_7dc6.html" title="Category:Suspected Wikipedia sockpuppets of Ivan Kricancic">Category:Suspected Wikipedia sockpuppets of Ivan Kricancic</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFormer_Anon_6157.html" title="User:Former Anon">User:Former Anon</a>, <a href="../../../1/2/4/User%7E124.177.92.88.html" title="User:124.177.92.88">User:124.177.92.88</a>, <a href="../../../1/2/4/User%7E124.185.36.177.html" title="User:124.185.36.177">User:124.185.36.177</a>, and <a href="../../../5/8/2E/User%7E58.165.126.167.html" title="User:58.165.126.167">User:58.165.126.167</a>) were created by <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoikhoi</a> for no apparent reason. There is absolutely no proof/evidence/hints of any kind that those users were me, there was no investigation, and there was no checkuser; yet those pages were created, seemingly to provoke, insult and attack me, without any justification. I tried getting them deleted as attack pages, but some guy reverted my edits without even looking into the situation. <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmir_Arven_887c.html" title="User:Emir Arven">Emir Arven</a> has proven to be well outside the range of civility - he has been blocked seven times for rampant incivility, personal attacks, and heavy edit warring, but he still is under the impression that his actions and his falsifications are acceptable, which they are not. It can be seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEmir_Arven&amp;diff=107423176&amp;oldid=107353588" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEmir_Arven&amp;diff=107423176&amp;oldid=107353588" rel="nofollow">here</a> that I have tried to reason with him, but he has dismissed it, and even removed it from his talk page. Furthermore, you can see from his edits that he is a racist bigot, because he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Breakup_of_Yugoslavia&amp;diff=113552390&amp;oldid=113297697" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Breakup_of_Yugoslavia&amp;diff=113552390&amp;oldid=113297697" rel="nofollow">removes sourced information</a> purely because it was written by a <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serb.html" title="Serb">Serb</a>, and he harbors great prejudice against <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbs.html" title="Serbs">Serbs</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croats.html" title="Croats">Croats</a>. You can also see that he seem to hate <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">Indian people</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Emir_Arven/Archives_4#Unblock" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Emir_Arven/Archives_4#Unblock" rel="nofollow">this</a>, where he tries to get unblocked by claiming "two Indian administrators conspired against me".</p>
<p>Now I must say, <a href="../../../s/u/s/Category%7ESuspected_Wikipedia_sockpuppets_of_Ivan_Kricancic_7dc6.html" title="Category:Suspected Wikipedia sockpuppets of Ivan Kricancic">creating sockpuppet pages</a> with <b>absolutely no proof or evidence</b> is in very bad taste. These pages must be deleted until your unfounded accusations that came out of nowhere prove true - which won't happen because <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmir_Arven_887c.html" title="User:Emir Arven">you</a> are a perennial liar. This whole thing started because of a provocation by Emir, and now Emir just will not stop with the attacks, lies and falsifications. I am <i>yet again</i> asking that a good admin step in, and remove all the personal attacks/falsifications/provocations directed against me by <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmir_Arven_887c.html" title="User:Emir Arven">User:Emir Arven</a>. He cannot hide under the guise of doing good for Wikipedia with personal attacks like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bosniak&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107274996" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bosniak&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107274996" rel="nofollow">this</a> - which translated means</p>

<p><i>I want to warn you, that user Ivan Kricancic, look at his user page,in his mad fanaticism goes from one picture related to Bosnia to another, and suggests their deletion. Often he does that unsigned: 58.165.115.192. I know it is hard to deal with assholes, but the moron is sick and in this manner he had deleted a lot of articles about Srebrenica also.</i></p>
<p>This is insulting and provocative beyond belief - yet this, and many more attacks like it, have not been removed, and he has not yet been warned or punished for posting the above message numerous times.</p>
<p>Also, notice his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Emir_Arven" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Emir_Arven" rel="nofollow">block log</a>.</p>

<p><b>Seven</b> blocks for heavy edit warring, many personal attacks, and rampant incivility.</p>

I was blocked once for vandalizing a real life friend of mine's user page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Robz0r&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44023899" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Robz0r&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44023899" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (which was wrong, but in retaliation to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Ivan_Kricancic&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44011388" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Ivan_Kricancic&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44011388" rel="nofollow">this</a>). And my other block was as a result of me making personal attacks against <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmir_Arven_887c.html" title="User:Emir Arven">Emir Arven</a> after he provoked, harassed and attacked me. Now make a judgment over which editor is more trustworthy. I will ask again, please delete/remove his personal attacks/provocations/insults, warn the user not to do it, and possibly block him - in my opinion (judging by the numerous blocks, edit wars, slander, personal attacks, insults, provocations, and racism from this user) an indefinite block would suffice, but one of you admins may be more tolerant than I am, so a one or two month block would do if an indef is not made. I cannot see how anyone would believe a block is not justified, but if there is to be no blocking of <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmir_Arven_887c.html" title="User:Emir Arven">Emir Arven</a>, I would at least settle for the attack pages and other personal attacks to be removed. I would also like for him to change his behaviour. Please read this, and do something about this vandalistic troll.

<p>I am new to AMA, but in general I think there is some reluctance to take on this by members of AMA, the admins and the community because there seems to be a lot of mutual mean-spirited talk and activity going back and forth between the parties. Now, while one block log is certainly more impressive (not in a good sense), that doesn't mean that the other party is guilt-free. From the section on Dispute Resolution, I am assuming that you haven't gone through all the steps in the process. I understand that you are probably very frustrated with this and that frustration is prompting jumping to more drastic measures (requesting permanent bans, etc...), but there are some other things that you could probably try first.</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, being insulted or attacked does not mean that you should return the favor. Trying to be subtle about it doesn't really help either. Mean-spirited is mean-spirited. You may consider just taking a step back since this has been going on for a long time.</li>
<li>It may be adviseable for you to let others address the edits by Emir for a while. If what you are asserting is the case, then allowing the community to step in and help address it is a good step toward resolution. Otherwise, it looks like just a personal war between the two of you and not many people want to step into the middle of an already ongoing war.</li>
<li>Remember, in general you should be addressing content, not the contributor. I understand that it's hard given the case, but you should do your best to not stoop down to verbal brawling.</li>
<li>If sources are disputed, try other sources if you can. You could even just take a chance and present sources that conform to whatever requirements the other side has defined (eg. international observational sources not directly involved I believe was one such).</li>
<li>Try an olive branch. Just a thought, but you never know.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep this updated as things progress. Good luck and stay on track. -<a href="../../../c/q/u/User%7ECquan_4312.html" title="User:Cquan">Cquan</a> 01:42, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
