<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_of_Pakistan_76e6.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>In September, 1944, after the historic Jinnah-Gandhi talks in Bombay the Quaid-e-Azam in a special interviw granted to Malik Tajuddin told him that he was convinced that the emergence of an independent sovereign Muslim state was inevitable and that the time had come for Malik Tajuddin to take in hand preparatory work for the formation of Pakistan's national news agency. APP was conceived at this meeting between <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quaid-e-Azam_a06e.html" title="Quaid-e-Azam">Quaid-e-Azam</a> (the founder of Pakistan) and Malik Tajuddin in September 1944.</p>
<p>The agency started in 1948 in <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karachi.html" title="Karachi">Karachi</a>, shortly after Pakistan's independence as a Reuter-owned Associated Press of Pakistan on 1st January 1949 with Malik Tajuddin as its Chief Executive exercising national control but accountable to Reuters London on financial matters as a first step towards the evolution of Pakistan's national news agency.</p>
<p>The emergence of a Reuter-Press Trust of India partnership for coverage of world news with special Indian emphasis on the news coverage from the region between Cairo and Singapore was an early indication of India's political ambition for a sphere of influence. This partnership was bound to prove detrimental to Pakistan's national interests and it was felt that the Reuter-owned APP was its best an interim solution and that the question of its transfer to complete national control could not brook delay.</p>
<p>It was against this background that the question of promoting a private limited company similar to the Press Trust of India was taken in hand with which the Government of Pakistan was associated through Radio Pakistan as a precautionary safeguard against the possible inability of the newly established newspapers to come forward to finance it. But as foreseen by Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan nearly three years earlier the scheme failed to materialize and the company was formally wound up during the second fortnight of December, 1949. Chaudhri Muhammed Ali, then Secretary-General to the Government of Pakistan inspired the creation of an independent trust, the Eastern News Trust (Waqf). The Trust included some newspaper’s editors as members while government participation was ensured by the appointment of a Joint Secretary of the Ministry of Information to the Trust with Malik Tajuddin as its Managing Trustee.</p>

<p>Following Pakistan's independence, the new-born country's press was economically weak, and was thus unable to financially support the agency. APP asked the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_of_Pakistan_b365.html" title="Government of Pakistan">Government of Pakistan</a> for financial support, which was granted in the form of loans and subsidies. Government support enabled APP to subscribe to the services of the world's news agencies and to open offices in major cities of the country.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_of_Pakistan_76e6.html" title="Edit section: Government takeover">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Government takeover</span></h3>
<p>The financial situation of APP continued to deteriorate until it was on the verge of collapse. This was the direct result of the withholding of payment of arrears from the Government of Pakistan due from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in an effort to create a financial crisis for the national news agency. It owed about <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistani_rupee.html" title="Pakistani rupee">Rs.</a> 8 laks to the government's Post and Telegraph Department and another Rs. 12 laks in unpaid subscription fees to foreign news agencies. The <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_of_Pakistan_b365.html" title="Government of Pakistan">Government of Pakistan</a> intervened and took over the agency on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_15.html" title="July 15">15 July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a> following the instruction of certain vested interests within the Government of Pakistan.</p>
<p>The take over took place with several changes: Malik Tajuddin was removed and A K Qureshi, a senior government officer with some journalistic experience, was hired as Administrator of APP. The head office of the agency was shifted to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamabad.html" title="Islamabad">Islamabad</a>, the new capital of Pakistan. While the financial position of the agency further deteriorated, but its coverage became more biased as the government started to use it as an official mouthpiece. A K Qureshi was a member of the ill-fated National Press Trust delegation traveling to London by <a href="../../../p/i/a/PIA_Flight_705_43b9.html" title="PIA Flight 705">PIA Flight 705</a> that crashed at Cairo on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_20.html" title="May 20">May 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>. He is buried in a mass grave at Cairo alongside his fellow passengers: victims of Pakistan's first jet aircraft disaster.</p>

<p>Besides its head office in <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamabad.html" title="Islamabad">Islamabad</a>, APP maintains three bureaux (<a href="../../../k/a/r/Karachi.html" title="Karachi">Karachi</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/h/Lahore.html" title="Lahore">Lahore</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/w/Rawalpindi.html" title="Rawalpindi">Rawalpindi</a>) and nine news centres (<a href="../../../s/u/k/Sukkur.html" title="Sukkur">Sukkur</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multan.html" title="Multan">Multan</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quetta.html" title="Quetta">Quetta</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/i/Faisalabad.html" title="Faisalabad">Faisalabad</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larkana.html" title="Larkana">Larkana</a>, <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hyderabad_%28Pakistan%29_dc3e.html" title="Hyderabad (Pakistan)">Hyderabad</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bahawalpur.html" title="Bahawalpur">Bahawalpur</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/s/Peshawar.html" title="Peshawar">Peshawar</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/z/Muzaffarabad.html" title="Muzaffarabad">Muzaffarabad</a>).</p>
<p>The editorial function of any news agency is same as that of a newspaper i.e. it is divided between reporting teams and the news desk. In smaller centres, the editorial staff consists of a reporter and a sub-editor. In the larger bureaux of Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad, the reporting team is composed of about twelve reporters, responsible for specific beats such as economy, sports, crime, national and provincial assemblies or major government departments. These news desks are responsible for copy-writing and for coordinating activities of the reporting team. They also handle press releases of government information and private companies.</p>
<p>The whole news operation is monitored by a Central News Desk (CND) located at the head office. News stories from all bureaux are sent to Islamabad for editing and from there the combined service is distributed nationally. The CND is connected with at least four international satellite circuits for receiving foreign news via a computer network:</p>

<p>Despite APP being considered Pakistan's “premier” news agency, for decadeseht agency ran on old, obsolete and unreliable equipment. News copy was being carried on a 50-<a href="../../../b/a/u/Baud.html" title="Baud">baud</a> duplex circuit between Islamabad, Karachi and Lahore.</p>
<p>Mr. M. Aftab, APPs General-Manager in 1991, undertook to improve the agency's technical resources. The resulting upgrade saw a transformation of data output speed from 50 words per minute (WMP) to 1200 WPM, most of which is now directly fed into the computers of the subscribers simultaneously throughout Pakistan and overseas.</p>

<p>Being the national news agency of Pakistan, APP collects and disseminate domestic and international news to 84 (1992) newspapers of Pakistan besides Radio, television and government offices and some foreign media. APP’s subscription rates are higher than other agencies in Pakistan because of its monopoly of world news agencies. For this reason every newspaper in Pakistan cannot subscribe to its services. Notable subscribers to APP's services include: <i><a href="../../../d/a/w/Dawn_%28newspaper%29.html" title="Dawn (newspaper)">Dawn</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan_Times_409e.html" title="Pakistan Times">Pakistan Times</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../f/r/o/Frontier_Post_af39.html" title="Frontier Post">Frontier Post</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Nation_%28newspaper%29_9e88.html" title="The Nation (newspaper)">The Nation</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_News_International_1d3a.html" title="The News International">The News International</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_Recorder_a24e.html" title="Business Recorder">Business Recorder</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../n/a/w/Nawa-i-Waqt_e912.html" title="Nawa-i-Waqt">Nawa-i-Waqt</a></i>.</p>

<p>The number of APP's employees is estimated at between 350 and 400, of whom over 100 are journalists and photographers. The remainder are administrative staff, including computer engineers, technicians, <a href="../../../p/e/o/Peon.html" title="Peon">peons</a>, traffic attendants, data entry operators and finance staff.</p>
<p>In addition there are a small number of "stringers" (part time correspondents) at various district headquarters in Pakistan and aboard.</p>
<p>After decades gap the system of journalists posting aboard was revived during the first tenure of Mr. M. Aftab. He secured approval of the Ministry to post four senior journalists as special correspondents in <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_D.C._708d.html" title="Washington D.C.">Washington D.C.</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beijing.html" title="Beijing">Beijing</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Delhi_b3e7.html" title="New Delhi">New Delhi</a>.</p>

<p>APP is a government organisation, responsible to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. The agency is headed by a Director-General, appointed by the Ministry. Fazal Ur Rehman is the current Managing Director of APP, who is not a journalist but a Press Information Department.</p>
<p>Since the government takeover, APP has continued with an undefined status – neither an official government body nor an independent news outfit, APP has drawn criticism as a mouthpiece for the government of the day. In 1998, however, a <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_%28proposed_law%29.html" title="Bill (proposed law)">Bill</a> was proposed to convert APP into a corporation. A committee of media pundits is reportedly engaged in drafting APP corporation <a href="../../../b/y/l/Bylaw.html" title="Bylaw">bylaw</a> for final approval of the government.</p>
<p>Due to this unclear status, there is no long-term financing in place for APP, with allocations being made on an annual basis by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. APP’s annual expenditure is now placed at Rs. 140 million. APP generates 60% of its revenue from the government, and the remainder is raised through subscription from electronic media including television and radio and newspapers as well as foreign news agencies, business and non-media subscribers.</p>

<p>The APP News Service is mainly divided into three main areas: official, political and district news.</p>

<p>APP gives a more detailed coverage to the activities and statements of government dignitaries. Newspapers and the government-controlled radio and television rely to the greater extent on APP for government news. According to renowned journalist <a href="../../../z/a/m/Zamir_Niazi_4878.html" title="Zamir Niazi">Zamir Niazi</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Most of the time and energy of APP since the days of <a href="../../../a/y/u/Ayub_Khan_86f6.html" title="Ayub Khan">Ayub Khan</a> is being consumed in creeding long speeches of the president and other ministries, the rest are allocated to the government press notes and other lesser government functionaries.</i>"</dd>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_of_Pakistan_76e6.html" title="Edit section: Political news">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Political news</span></h4>
<p>Being the government agency, APP has extensively concentrated on government news thus neglecting cultural, political, economic and other sectors of national life. Even more damaging to the credibility of APP has been the repeated use of agency to carry out disinformation and smear campaigns against opposition leaders and parties.</p>
<p>According to Niazi:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>How APP has functioned and what is its credibility among its client and public at large is another sorry chapter in the story of our press... the agency has served its masters one after the other with equal zeal and perfect consistency. Thus it gained the notoriety of being a center of news management, fabrication and distortions.</i>"</dd>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_of_Pakistan_76e6.html" title="Edit section: District news">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">District news</span></h4>
<p>APP's district news service is not highly regarded, as it's resources are so thinly-placed across the country that most of the information from this department comes from government information officers.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_of_Pakistan_76e6.html" title="Edit section: Foreign news">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Foreign news</span></h3>
<p>APP has become the main source of international news for the Pakistani media. The agency subscribes to <a href="../../../r/e/u/Reuters.html" title="Reuters">Reuters</a>, AFP, and the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a> of America (AP). <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Press_International_25ef.html" title="United Press International">United Press International</a> was also linked with APP, but the agreement was allowed to lapse.</p>
<p>APP has co-operation agreements with some 35 news agencies, mainly in <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_world.html" title="Third world">third world</a> countries. Under these agreements, news is exchanged on a <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barter.html" title="Barter">barter</a> basis. Prominent among these are the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Republic_News_Agency_f447.html" title="Islamic Republic News Agency">Islamic Republic News Agency</a> (<a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a>), the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Press_Trust_of_India_34af.html" title="Press Trust of India">Press Trust of India</a>, and MENA (Egypt).</p>

<p>The commercial service of APP provides currency and commodity rates from Reuters, financial and economic services, banks and large business houses. APP planned to expand this service, but suffered a set back in the mid-1980s when Reuters bypassed APP and began to sell its financial services directly to business houses and newspapers in Pakistan.</p>

<p>APP has its own photographic section equipped with photo receivers and photo transmitters in Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad and <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quetta.html" title="Quetta">Quetta</a> respectively. Islamabad is the head office to receive photographs from within Pakistan and aboard, and transmits them to the agency's bureaux and stations which distribute them to local newspapers.</p>

<p>The agency’s <a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu_language.html" title="Urdu language">Urdu language</a> service started in the 1980s to cater for the needs of growing fleet of Urdu language dailies in Pakistan. The idea behind the setting up of the service was to avoid errors and ensure accuracy. As a practice, Urdu speech was often translated into <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> by the APP and then back into Urdu by newspaper editor – greatly increasing the chances of translation, emphasis or context errors.
