<p>"The view that the shuttle Challenger exploded because the maker of O-ring putty was pressured by the EPA into ceasing production of its more temperature-resistant, asbestos-laden putty, prompting replacement with an inferior putty, which had continual problems of a sort which could have caused the O-ring leak and subsequent explosion."</p>
<p>There is no evidence that the EPA pressured the manufacturer to stop making the putty. In fact, NASA replaced it with putty from another company that also contained asbestos. And the problems with the putty started when the origanal putty was still in use. The Challenger disaster was caused because safty problems were ignored, not because of any environmental concerns.</p>
<p>"Myth: Environmental ban led to weaker sealant A favorite of the Internet, this myth states that a major factor in the disaster was that NASA had been ordered by regulatory agencies to abandon a working pressure sealant because it contained too much asbestos, and use a weaker replacement. But the replacement of the seal was unrelated to the disaster — and occurred prior to any environmental ban.</p>
<p>Even the original putty had persistent sealing problems, and after it was replaced by another putty that also contained asbestos, the higher level of breaches was connected not to the putty itself, but to a new test procedure being used. “We discovered that it was this leak check which was a likely cause of the dangerous bubbles in the putty that I had heard about," wrote physicist Richard Feynman, a member of the Challenger investigation board.</p>
<p>And the bubble effect was unconnected with the actual seal violation that would ultimately doom Challenger and its crew. The cause was an inadequate low-temperature performance of the O-ring seal itself, which had not been replaced."</p>

<p>I believe there this article needs to be cleaned up a bit, perhaps clarifying whether or not asbestos is mearly a general term for minerals with similar properties (cleavage patterns and the like), or if the different minerals under the term asbestos have similar chemical make up. I am by no means an expert on geology or industrial materials, but I would prefer to see a little more information about the make up of asbestos materials. Perhaps also a bit about the manufacturing process as well. Just my $0.02.

<dd>There may be some confusion here. Asbestos isn't, strictly speaking, "manufactured." As I wrote above, it's extracted from sources in igneous rock.</dd>
<dd>Of course, the fact that there <i>is confusion at all</i> proves that you're right; the article needs some general clean-up:
<ul>
<li>The chemical formulae for the various forms of asbestos should be included (as, for e.g., in the <a href="../../../s/e/p/Sepiolite.html" title="Sepiolite">sepiolite</a> article). (In answer to your question, the different asbestos materials are chemically similar. They are magnesium silicates, naturally occurring in a fibrous form.)</li>
<li>Most web articles on asbestos describe some important regions of the world where it's been mined. That would be a welcome addition here.</li>
<li>I believe the section(s) on litigation could use more robust references and more balance.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Perhaps I'll work on some of those issues outlined above, when I have a chance.--<a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERattBoy_5f67.html" title="User:RattBoy">RattBoy</a> 01:01, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Under "Uses" Amphibole Group the following statement is made: "The use of all types of asbestos in the amphibole group was banned in the mid 1980s. " This may be true somewhere in the world but not in the USA. The US EPA implemented the "Ban and Phase Out Rule" in 1989, but it was sustantially overturned in 1991. New uses are still banned and some specific uses are also still banned.</p>
<p>The litigation section seems to have been written by a tort reform advocate. I'm not disputing the facts, but since there is no ban on most asbestos products in the US it is only the fear of liability that prevents many products from being manufactured containing asbestos. This positive result of asbestos liability should be weighed against the negative aspects.</p>
<p>Finally the sentence under uses serpentine, "Up until recently, chrysotile had been used almost exclusively in the manufacture of packing and friction material such as gaskets, brake and clutch linings." is simply incorrect for the US. Chrysotile is by far the most widely used type of asbestos potentially appearing in any building material that isn't metal, ceramic, glass, plastic, or wood.</p>
<p>I intend to work on some edits to reflect the above concerns. If the person who made the amphibole ban statement would please be more specific about the location of that ban, it would be very helpful.--Ukemike,17:42, 7 October 2005</p>
<dl>
<dd>Your edits look like quite an improvement to me. However, I still think the section is very POV. Perhaps balancing the writing with the view of some on the opposite side would be appropriate.--<a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERattBoy_5f67.html" title="User:RattBoy">RattBoy</a> 23:53, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>RattBoy: you edited out information that was accurate and correct and replaced it with incomplete POV information that minimizes the extent of the asbestos litigation issue. For example, Gerber, who makes baby food, does not manufacture or sell products with asbestos, but has been an asbestos defendant, as the cited study indicates. Can you explain why you made the edit? --FRCP11 00:57, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I removed and reworded some text which was obviously POV. I removed phrases like "the problem has grown," which is clearly POV. And I attempted to remove some of the shrill POV bias. I did miss the Gerber reference, but the cited study is unclear about the "peripheral defendants" such as Gerber. All I could find is "The connection of older peripheral defendants to asbestos is clear (e.g., use of asbestos as an insulating material by boiler manufacturers). However, the connection of some of the newer peripheral defendants to asbestos is not obvious (e.g., Campbell’s Soup, Gerber (baby food), and Sears Roebuck.)" The study doesn't detail the nature of the liability of these three companies, so I'm not convinced that the example of peripheral defendants belongs in an encyclopedic article.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>While we're on the topic of POV, I question the neutrality of sentences like "A RAND study found that less than half the money spent on asbestos litigation went to injured parties; the majority went to attorneys." Sounds very damning of the Terrible Trial Lawyers, doesn't it? However, the linked <a href="http://www.rand.org/news/press.05/05.10.html" class="external text" title="http://www.rand.org/news/press.05/05.10.html" rel="nofollow">news release</a> says "Claimants have received about 42 cents of every dollar...31 cents has gone to defense costs, and 27 cents has gone to plaintiffs' attorneys and other related costs." Given the use of expert witnesses (most of whom are <b>not</b> attorneys) in litigation, I believe that the sentence, as written in the article, is POV, unsupported by the citation, and almost certainly incorrect.--<a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERattBoy_5f67.html" title="User:RattBoy">RattBoy</a> 12:08, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Is there anyone claiming that the litigation problem hasn't grown? If so, then "the problem has grown" is POV, and both sides' arguments should be included.

<dd>I don't think anyone is disputing that the amount of litigation has grown. The POV in the text is "the litigation <i>problem</i> has grown." There are two perspectives to consider here: one is that the problem is the <i>litigation</i>; the other is that the problem is <i>asbestos</i>. "The problem has grown" implies the former, and therefore, in my opinion, it's clearly tort-reform POV.--<a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERattBoy_5f67.html" title="User:RattBoy">RattBoy</a> 09:57, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the Whittington v. U.S. Steel case in Madison County, the plaintiff probably got his mesothelioma while he was manufacturing brake linings for dozens of years; however, his suit was against another employer, U.S. Steel, who was sued because there was asbestos-containing insulation at the plant. The jury wasn't allowed to be told of Whittington's other asbestos exposure, so U.S. Steel, who didn't manufacture asbestos, and probably didn't cause Whittington's cancer, was hit for $250 million before settling.<a href="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/special/asbestos.nsf/0/8530196F5890FE7A86256F130062F63C?OpenDocument" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/special/asbestos.nsf/0/8530196F5890FE7A86256F130062F63C?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.lawyersweeklyusa.com/2topten2003.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lawyersweeklyusa.com/2topten2003.cfm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> We've gone from asbestos manufacturer to manufacturer of asbestos-containing products to, well, everybody who ever had an asbestos-containing product in its facilities. It's inaccurate to limit it to just those who manufactured asbestos-containing products, so I've changed the sentence to peripheral defendants, since that is unambiguously sourced. The "most US industries have had asbestos defendants" is an accurate statistic from the RAND report; I can put in the precise numbers if you still find that problematic, but wanted to avoid too much detail in an encyclopedia entry.</dd>

<dd>I put together a few more changes, in order to impart some more balance to the article (which is still, in IMHO, heavily biased against litigation):
<ul>
<li>"Bankrupt" is a loaded word. It implies that the companies were driven out of business. In fact, they chose to file Chapter 11 to avoid paying creditors.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.ewg.org/reports/asbestos/facts/fact1.php" class="external text" title="http://www.ewg.org/reports/asbestos/facts/fact1.php" rel="nofollow">Environmental Working Group</a> contends that asbestos-related deaths have increased (at least in the period ending in 2001). I noted that fact.</li>
<li>The sentence, "Many attorneys, including Peter Angelos, have become rich because they established lucrative relationships with unions that steered potential asbestos plaintiffs to their law firms." is very one-sided. For some reason, in our system of Free Enterprise, apparently it's okay for anyone to seek to improve their standard of living--except attorneys and members of labor unions. (The reference doesn't back up the phrase "many attorneys," but I'll let that go for now.) There was no comparison of the lawyers' wealth to the wealth of execs from asbestos corporations which had hidden the dangers of asbestos. I attempted <i>some</i> balance by noting that companies have saved $$millions by filing Chapter 11--and thus backing out on their commitment to their employees.--<a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERattBoy_5f67.html" title="User:RattBoy">RattBoy</a> 10:57, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks. This is helpful. I don't agree with all of your changes, however.
<ul>
<li>"Bankrupt" is a neutral term. It means "someone who has insufficient assets to cover their debts." One cannot file Chapter 11 if one has sufficient assets to cover their debts. It's considerably more neutral than implying there's something morally wrong with filing Chapter 11--indeed, the left protested that Republicans made it harder to file bankruptcy in legislation this year. I'm changing that back.</li>
<li>The problem with the Angelos statement is that it was so neutral as to not convey the underlying issue, rather than too POV. (And Mother Jones is hardly a right-wing corporatist source.) The objection to union's steering their employees to particular attorneys is that there are kickbacks involved, that the mass screenings are manufacturing plaintiffs who don't actually have claims, and the union employees are not getting the best deal they could've gotten if the union officials (and attorneys!) were acting ethically towards their fiduciaries. I've changed accordingly. <a href="http://www.pointoflaw.com/articles/26WMEL.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pointoflaw.com/articles/26WMEL.pdf" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>
<li>Your own cited link, EWG <b>estimates</b> that asbestos deaths will increase, but their own statistics show a 2000 peak, with a decline in 2001, and even that increase admittedly reflects a change in reporting. And even some plaintiffs' attorneys contend that deaths have already peaked, so it's not just "tort reform advocates". I've changed accordingly. <a href="http://www.mesothel.com/pages/deaths_pag.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mesothel.com/pages/deaths_pag.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></li>
<li>Your "ten percent on the dollar" is incomplete, because it implied all corporations, rather than those whose debts exceeded their assets and could not possibly pay every claim. I've made it more accurate, while retaining the discussion of the fact that companies forced into Chapter 11 may not have fully paid seriously injured plaintiffs, and clarified the criticism of the poorly structured bankruptcy proceedings of some of the earlier bankruptcies. -- FRCP11 13:24, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, let's look at some of these issues in greater depth:
<ul>
<li>I think one has to be careful in reading the stats. The EWG link shows a <i>slight</i> decline in deaths from mesothelioma and asbestosis between 2000 and 2001. That's hardly indicative of a Y2K peak and subsequent drop; further data collecting and reporting would be necessary to determine whether the death rate were in fact dropping.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The Worthington reference you provide does not consider asbestosis. Not only that, its reporting years, in increments of ten, do not lend support to the contention that deaths have peaked. According to <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/surveillance/ords/NationalStatistics/Highlights/Figure01-01(A01).html" class="external text" title="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/surveillance/ords/NationalStatistics/Highlights/Figure01-01(A01).html" rel="nofollow">NIOSH</a>, "Asbestosis deaths among US. residents age 15 and over have increased from fewer than 100 in 1968 to more than 1,250 annually in 1999, the most recent year for which data are available, <i>with no apparent leveling off to this trend</i>."</dd>
<dd>In any case, the text looks more balanced now.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The NIOSH cite is correct as far as it goes, however meso and lung cancer deaths, which are serveral times larger in total than asbestosis deaths are down (see SEER, for instance) and there is a reasonable likelihood that some of the NIOSH data, which are taken from NCHS multiple cause of death data abstracted from death certificate tapes, exhibit diagnosis effect linked back to the litigation. The 2002 WoRLD report put out by NIOSH suggests, also, a flattening of incidence. Figure 1.1 therein, by the way, seems to show that the biggest increase was not in the 'underlying cause' but in the 'contributing cause' reference. The medical articles I've read don't buy that there is an increase in bona fide asbestosis. All in all, I think the most likely case is that for the most part we have passed the peak in deaths and should see a slow, but steady decline for the next forty years or so. I think the EWG cite is not NPOV, and the NIOSH cite is at least incomplete.--<a href="../../../r/c/h/User%7ERcherrick_7c6d.html" title="User:Rcherrick">Bob Herrick</a> 23:04, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>As for the use of the term, "bankrupt:" while you're nearly correct that the term, "bankruptcy," has a specific legal meaning (it has several definitions, actually: Chapters 7, 9, 11, 12, and 13), there still is a connotation that the lay person will understand as meaning "out of business." The passive voice, "been bankrupted," connotes "action at a distance," rather than a business decision undertaken to address the conditions that the corporation faced. My terminology, "filed Chapter 11," is indisputably correct--more so than the ambiguous and emotional term, "bankrupt." While I agree that it is factually accurate that the corporations could be defined as insolvent when they applied for Chapter 11 reorganization, it is also undeniable that the filing was a business decision-a choice that was made to avoid paying creditors. You view my terminology as POV, but please tell me: what part of it is incorrect?</li>

In each case customers were relatively unaffected, employees suffered to the extent their pensions and savings were in equity, bondholders lost much but not all of their lendings, and the equity holders got wiped out, which is more or less what Chapt 11 expects to see.</dd>

<dd>It is a requirement of 524(g) that over 50% of the equity of a company filing under 524(g) be donated to a trust to pay claimants. In most cases the actual percentage donated is 100%. That means that the equity owners of the company are not exactly 'shielded,' since they can and do lose everything. What 524(g) actually does shield is some of the assets of the bankrupt firm for the benefit of future claimants, by requiring the presesence of a 'Futures Representative' who speaks on their behalf and negotiates to protect some of the assets in the trust to pay those that will assuredly be diagnosed with an asbestos-related disease--<a href="../../../r/c/h/User%7ERcherrick_7c6d.html" title="User:Rcherrick">Bob Herrick</a> 23:04, 12 March 2007 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>I just looked this article up for the first time and it reeks of POV. Much of what I'm reading is not scientifically sound and it's definitely in serious need of citations. Isn't there a template that requests citations be added to lousy articles? It is just not the case that nonfriable asbestos will become airborne with the smallest damage and will eventually spread significant contamination to every area throughout a structure, regardless of what "tenets of the Second Law of Thermodynamics" might dictate.

<p>I think "filed for bankruptcy" is better than "filed for reorganization under Chapter 11" simply on the principle that three words are better than six if there's no loss in accuracy and a gain in avoiding jargon. (All corporate bankruptcies are business decisions, so I don't quite understand the import of you pointing that out here on the talk page.) But these are style issues, and I don't substantively object to your proposed language, so I leave the final decision to you or another editor. I'm glad we could come to a consensus. -- FRCP11 02:41, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Section 524(g) of the US Code relates specifically to companies that file for protection under Chpt 11 as a result of asbestos liabilities. Patterned on the Manville bankruptcy decisions, 524(g) creates a channeling order forcing all future claimants to a trust formed under the section, provided the debtor meets certain requirements. This is unlike any other form of Chpt 11 filing of which I am aware, where only cognizable claims are extinguished. Consequently the simple word 'bankruptcy' may be an insufficient description of the process that some 70 companies have gone through (or are still in process of going through). --<a href="../../../r/c/h/User%7ERcherrick_7c6d.html" title="User:Rcherrick">Bob Herrick</a> 18:41, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are four points that need to be considered regarding the capacity of asbestos to cause cancer.</p>
<p>First, Chemistry. While chrisotile is a magnesium silicate, the asbestiform amphiboles are silicates of iron, with or without magnesium and calcium. The higher the iron content, more dangerous is the amphibole.</p>
<p>Second, Iron Oxidation in the Lungs. In a humid and closed environment, as it is the interior of the lungs, the mineral could eventually oxidise, with the iron of the asbestos transformed into iron hydroxides, that could "glue" to the internal walls of the lungs, causing inflamations that could originate cancer. This does not happens with chrisotile, as magnesium hydroxides are soluble.</p>
<p>Third, Inspiration of Hot Air. It is well know that the rate of oxidation of a mineral increases when the temperature of the environment increases. It is also well known that the incidence of asbestosis is very much greater in smokers than non-smokers. The link between these two observations should be studied.</p>
<p>Possibly, the best way to avoid asbestosis is to stop smoking.</p>
<p>Last, Fibers. Usually the human body have his ways to eliminate particles inspired into the lungs, the most common being the common coughs. Coughing is not particularly efficient with fibers.<small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 200.232.177.223 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_200.232.177.223_1658.html" title="Special:Contributions/200.232.177.223">contribs</a>) 14 November 2005.</small></p>

I changed 'pundit' (which gives him too much credit) to 'colu mnist and publisher'. Besides this, there is nothing that needs changing in this section. This article is not a political rag, nor is it an opportunity for pushing a POV, as it was previously. Asbestos is dangerous. The first medical report was in 1925, detailing its dangers. The inhalation of asbestos particles is dangerous. The only 'evidence' to the contrary is in the minds of junk scientists, who are more full of junk than science.jgwlaw 21:00, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Not all people who inhale abestos develop disease- even after long term exposure. Yes it is carcigenic, but the amount and length of exposure is important. Very few people have developed disease after a brief exposure. Only 5% of workers who were occupationally exposed to asbestos will develop the most serious form of mesothelioma.</p>

<p>The introduction section is estreamly long, and it's not layed out very well, and jumps around the topic a lot. I always believe that the intro should only be one or two paragraphs to give an overview of the material and then go into the separate sections. I think it would be a much better article if someone (I will volunteer in people think it's a good idea) moved a lot of the material in the intro into the appropriate areas of the article, and made the intro much shorter. --<a href="../../../n/e/k/User%7ENekura_6586.html" title="User:Nekura">Nekura</a> 16:46, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>First, let me don my asbestos underwear 8^) by saying that I have no connection whatsoever with asbestos mining or manufacturers, litigiation, legislation, etc. etc. I stumbled on the article whilst reading about firefighting, and noticed the little controversy here. In view of the claims of bias, I have just been reading the section "Critics of safety regulations" and comparing them to their original sources, and I have to say that the section as it currently stands is very definitely <b>not</b> an NPOV representation of the critical view. In fact, it strongly resembles a straw man attack (both by addressing only the claims most easily rebutted--mainly by bloggers!--and by exaggerating what was claimed) with some <i>ad hominem</i> thrown in for good measure (by suggesting that all critics are industry mouthpieces).</p>
<p>While Milloy did write an article in which he speculated (frequently using "may", "might have", etc) that the WTC might have taken up tp two hours longer to collapse if the original fireproofing plan had been adhered to (he never claims that any was removed, nor that the collapse would have been prevented), most of his criticism seems to be focussed on the allegedly unscientific basis for the EPA's exposure limits. Milloy claims that these limits are based on extrapolations from high exposure rates rather than analysis of actual low exposure rates, and consequently the associated risk-benefit analyses (comparing benefit to risk for replacing asbestos in various applications, and in benefit to risk in removal projects) are also unscientific and invalid.</p>
<p>Nor is he some lone loon or industry lackey in saying this; despite the denial in our article, this view has been debated in serious medical journals, see e.g. <a href="http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/164/4/491?ijkey=lgrirSU9fJjUQ" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/164/4/491?ijkey=lgrirSU9fJjUQ" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, while a detailed longitudinal study by the Canadian government (conducted by the Institut National de Santé Publique in Quebec) concluded that the EPA formulae exaggerated the risk of mesothelioma by a factor of 60 times and the risk of cancer by "a factor of at least 10" (<a href="http://scholar.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;q=http://hesa.etui-rehs.org/uk/dossiers/files/293-EpidemiologyAsbestosQuebec.pdf" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;q=http://hesa.etui-rehs.org/uk/dossiers/files/293-EpidemiologyAsbestosQuebec.pdf" rel="nofollow">PDF, 567 kB</a>).</p>
<p>An additional argument of critics which is covered in the medical literature but not mentioned here is that most of the "safe" alternative which are being used to replace asbestos are actually unknown factors; we actually have no idea if they have a lower, similar, or higher risk of similar sorts of lung injury, and it will take decades to find out. Given that the injurious nature of asbestos derives (in large part) from the fibrous nature of its particles and its low chemical reactivity, it actually seems quite likely that many effective replacements will behave in a similar way!</p>
<p>I do not claim that all these criticisms are correct, and am in no position to actually evaluate them, but it seems clear to me that our current "Critics" section is not even remotely an NPOV representation of these views. -- <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecuriger_6d53.html" title="User:Securiger">Securiger</a> 01:13, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Biased? would I be biased if I said getting shot in the head with an <a href="../../../m/8/2/M82_%28rifle%29.html" title="M82 (rifle)">M82</a> at point blank range was dangerous? It's not bias it's simple fact like the sun itself rising in the morning - this is one article where agreement should be possible, why does it seem that's not the case?

<li>The M82 is firstly a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> because what I was arguing about is not whether asbestos is dangerous, but whether this article fairly represents the arguments of critics of the safety regulations; it is also a <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_analogy.html" title="False analogy">false analogy</a> because being shot in the head is dramatically more lethal than asbestos dust;</li>
<li>Claiming that "It's not bias it's simple fact" is an <a href="../../../i/p/s/Ipsedixitism.html" title="Ipsedixitism">ipsedixitism</a>, one of the worst of logical fallacies (and highly POV);</li>
<li>"this is one article where agreement should be possible" is obviously not true (since there are, in fact, critics), and also another straw man (since, once again, I am neither agreeing nor disagreeing about the dangers of asbestos, but whether or not the views of the critics have been fairly represented);</li>
<li>The hazard of asbestos alternatives most certainly is relevant, because it is one of the major arguments put forward by critics. (It would not matter whether or not it was a valid argument, so long as we actually present it, and fairly; but as it happens it actually is an extremely good argument, because the choices, in cases where asbestos fireproofing already exists, are a) leave the asbestos there, and mitigate dust formation; b) tear out the asbestos (risking spreading the dust in the process) and leave nothing for fireproofing; or c) tear out the asbestos (spreading dust) and replace it with something else. Option b) is probably the <i>worst</i> opton because fire kills far more people than do asbestos related diseases. So deciding between the realistic alternatives a) and c), we need to know if the alternative material is actually significantly safer. If it isn't, or is only slightly safer, then the option which minimises human suffering is likely to be leaving the asbestos where it is.)</li>

<p>I'm going to keep coming back to add citations as I can find time and sources but your help is needed. Please.</p>
<p>I'm a little uncomfortable with the citation to the EWG that I added but as far as I can tell, that's the only place in the world that has come up with the "10,000 deaths annually in the US" figure. They get there with kind of fuzzy math, in my opinion, but I'm leaving the basic assertion in place for now because it has been repeatedly cited. For example.<a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2005_record&amp;page=S1138&amp;position=all" class="external autonumber" title="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2005_record&amp;page=S1138&amp;position=all" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></p>
<p>However, I'd really like someone who knows something more than I about the UK to assist with the alleged reference to the "Report of the Select Committee 1994" mentioned in the (probably POV) section dealing with how early "we" knew of the dangers of asbestos. Google that title and the only thing you find is this quote. Over and over. That seems quite suspicous to me. The United Kingdom Parliament website <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/index.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.parliament.uk/index.cfm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> identifies that both the House of Lords and the House of Commons have numerous "Select Committees" but my search of their archives failed to yield these supposed quotations. The only things I can find on the net are secondary sources that say the same thing, sometimes verbatim.

<dd>I agree with this comment. I do not recall reading any peer-reviewed article that claims a link between smoking and meso.

<dd>For example - Hammond, Selikoff and Seidman, "Asbestos Exposure, Cigarette Smoking and Death Rates" Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences V 330, 1979, pp 485 says, in part, "so it appears that cigarette smoking has little or no effect upon death rates from pleural mesothelioma." Their 1980 study in an amosite asbestos factory reached the same conclusion. Also see Yano, Tanaka, Funaki, et al, "Effect of Cigarette Smoking on Pleural Thickening in Asbestos Workers," British Journal of Industrial Medicine, Oct 1993, where the Promed abstract begins "It is well known that an interaction exists between smoking and exposure to asbetos in the occurrence of lung cancer, whereas occurrence of malignant mesothelioma has not been related to smoking." I will spare you the citation from the Croatian Journal of Medicine, which says the same thing. My files have several other articles that relate to lung cancer, asbestos, and smoking, all of which conclude that there is some synergy. I am aware of only one study, out dozens, in which such a synergy was not found, but have not read that article myself. --<a href="../../../r/c/h/User%7ERcherrick_7c6d.html" title="User:Rcherrick">Bob Herrick</a> 18:35, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Asbestos litigation is the longest, most expensive mass tort in U.S. history, involving more than 6,000 defendants and 600,000 claimants.[13]</dd>

<p>These numbers have been overtaken by events. The RAND study cited elsewhere counts 8,400 defendants. The Enpro 3Q 2006 Quarterly statement has them at 804,000 total claims.

<p>Also, the article might want to pick up on litigation outside the US. Australia, the UK, France, and the Netherlands, off the top of my head, have on-going litigation activities, some of which resemble mass torts in the US, e.g., the Cape case in the UK, and the actions against James Hardie in Australia, that could be included. --<a href="../../../r/c/h/User%7ERcherrick_7c6d.html" title="User:Rcherrick">Bob Herrick</a> 17:20, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
