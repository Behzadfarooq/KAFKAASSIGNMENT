<p>At the turn of the last century, <a href="../../../a/s/b/Asbestos.html" title="Asbestos">asbestos</a> was considered an ideal material for use in the construction industry. It was known to be an excellent fire retardant, to have high electrical resistivity, and was inexpensive and easy to use.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The problem with asbestos arises when the fibers become airborne and are inhaled. Because of the size of the fibers, the lungs cannot expel them.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> They are also sharp and penetrate tissues.</p>
<p>Health problems attributed to asbestos include<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li><i><a href="../../../a/s/b/Asbestosis.html" title="Asbestosis">Asbestosis</a></i> - A lung disease first found in naval shipyard workers, asbestosis is a scarring of the lung tissue from an acid produced by the body's attempt to dissolve the fibers. The scarring may eventually become so severe that the lungs can no longer function. The latency period ( meaning the time it takes for the disease to develop) is often 10-20 years.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesothelioma.html" title="Mesothelioma">Mesothelioma</a></i> - A cancer of the mesothelial lining of the lungs and the chest cavity, the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peritoneum.html" title="Peritoneum">peritoneum</a> (abdominal cavity) or the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Pericardium.html" title="Pericardium">pericardium</a> (a sac surrounding the heart). Unlike lung cancer, mesothelioma has no association with smoking.<sup id="_ref-Muscat_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Muscat" title="">[4]</a></sup> The only known cause is from exposure to asbestos or similar fibers. The latency period for mesothelioma may be 20-50 years. The prognosis for mesothelioma is grim, with most patients dying within 12 months of diagnosis.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">Cancer</a></i> - Cancer of the lung, gastrointestinal tract, kidney and larynx have been linked to asbestos. The latency period for cancer is often 15-30 years. <a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006%5C06%5C12%5Cstory_12-6-2006_pg6_25" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006%5C06%5C12%5Cstory_12-6-2006_pg6_25" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></li>

<p>Considerable international controversy exists regarding the perceived rights and wrongs associated with litigation on <a href="../../../w/o/r/Workers%27_compensation.html" title="Workers' compensation">compensation</a> claims related to asbestos exposure and alleged subsequent medical consequences. Some measure of the vast range of views expressed in legal and political circles can perhaps be exemplified by the two quotes below, the first <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup> from Prof. <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lester_Brickman_4a1d.html" title="Lester Brickman">Lester Brickman</a>, an American legal <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethicist.html" title="Ethicist">ethicist</a> writing in the Pepperdine Law Review, and second, the Honourable <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Wills_26be.html" title="Michael Wills">Michael Wills</a> <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[6]</a></sup>, British <a href="../../../m/e/m/Member_of_Parliament_22d1.html" title="Member of Parliament">Member of Parliament</a>, speaking in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a> on July 13th. 2006:</p>
<p>"A review of the scholarly literature indicates a substantial degree of indifference to the causes of this civil justice system failure. Many of the published articles on asbestos litigation focus on transactional costs and ways in which the flow of money from defendants to plaintiffs and their lawyers can be expeditiously and efficiently prioritized and routed. The failure to acknowledge, let along analyze, the overriding reality of specious claiming and meritless claims demonstrates a disconnect between the scholarship and the reality of the <a href="../../../l/i/t/Litigation.html" title="Litigation">litigation</a> that is nearly as wide as the disconnect between rates of disease claiming and actual disease manifestation".</p>
<p>"Many of those who I see in my surgeries have worked in a number of workplaces and they could have been exposed to asbestos in each of them, but medical science is such that no one can identify which of them it is. As a result, there has been a long and complex history of legal discussion on how to apportion <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liability.html" title="Liability">liability</a>. The lawyers and the judiciary have wrestled, rightly and valiantly, with complex and difficult law, but it has created despair for the families whom we represent. Many of my <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constituent_%28politics%29.html" title="Constituent (politics)">constituents</a>’ families have been riven by the consequences of litigation in trying to get some compensation for a disease that has been contracted through no fault of theirs. That is cruel and unacceptable".</p>

<p>A nationwide ban on importing and using all forms of asbestos took effect on 31 December 2003. Reflecting the ban, the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (NOHSC) revised asbestos-related material to promote a consistent approach to controlling exposure to workplace asbestos and to introduce best-practice health and safety measures for asbestos management, control and removal. The ban does not cover asbestos materials or products already in use at the time the ban was implemented.<a href="http://www.nohsc.gov.au/NewsAndWhatsNew/MediaReleases/mr_AsbestosBan.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nohsc.gov.au/NewsAndWhatsNew/MediaReleases/mr_AsbestosBan.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></p>

<p>The <a href="../../../h/e/r/Her_Majesty%27s_Government_76b7.html" title="Her Majesty's Government">British Government</a>'s Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has promoted rigorous controls on <a href="../../../a/s/b/Asbestos.html" title="Asbestos">asbestos</a> handling, based on reports linking exposure to asbestos dust or fibres with thousands of annual deaths from mesothelioma and asbestos-related <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lung_cancer.html" title="Lung cancer">lung cancer</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>"At least 3500 people in Great Britain die each year from mesothelioma and asbestos related lung cancer as a result of past exposure to asbestos.

</ul>
<p>The HSE does not assume that any minimum threshold exists for exposure to asbestos below which a person is at zero risk of developing mesothelioma, since they consider that it cannot currently be quantified for practical purposes; they cite evidence from <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epidemiology.html" title="Epidemiology">epidemiological</a> studies of asbestos exposed groups to argue that even if any such threshold for mesothelioma does exist, it must be at a very low level. <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/causdis/asbfaq.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/causdis/asbfaq.pdf" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>.

<p>The <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Bar_Association_b11f.html" title="American Bar Association">American Bar Association</a> states that a growing number of claimants do not, and may never, suffer from asbestos illness. Because of the fear of a running statute of limitations, many people file claims who are not presently ill, but have had X-rays that show changes 'consistent with' asbestos disease. This 'now or never filing' is clogging the courts and delaying seriously ill claimants from having their cases heard. To alleviate this problem, the ABA recommends that (1) a clear standard of impairment be implemented, and (2) the statute of limitations not start ticking until a person actually becomes ill.<a href="http://www.abanet.org/poladv/priorities/asbestos.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abanet.org/poladv/priorities/asbestos.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a></p>
<p>In the United States, 10,000 people a year die from asbestos-caused diseases, including one out of every 125 American men who die over the age of 50. <a href="http://www.ewg.org/reports/asbestos/facts/fact1.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ewg.org/reports/asbestos/facts/fact1.php" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has no general ban on the use of asbestos. However, asbestos was one of the first hazardous air pollutants regulated under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act of 1970, and many applications have been forbidden by the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/asbestos" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answers.com/topic/asbestos" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></p>
<p>According to a September 2004 of the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, asbestos is still a hazard for 1.3 million US workers in the construction industry and for workers involved in the maintenance of buildings and equipment. <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=13500" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=13500" rel="nofollow">[19]</a></p>
<p>A Senate Subcommittee of the Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee heard testimony on July 31, 2001, regarding the health effects of asbestos.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/b/Asbestos_and_the_law.html" title="Edit section: Civil litigation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Civil litigation</span></h2>
<p>The first lawsuits against asbestos manufacturers were brought in 1929. <a href="http://www.1-stop-mesothelioma-asbestos.com/html/history.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.1-stop-mesothelioma-asbestos.com/html/history.html" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> Since then, many lawsuits have been filed. As a result of the litigation, manufacturers sold off subsidiaries, diversified, produced asbestos substitutes, and started asbestos removal businesses. <a href="http://www.lhc.org.uk/members/pubs/books/asbestos/asb09.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lhc.org.uk/members/pubs/books/asbestos/asb09.htm" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> In June 1982, a retired boiler-maker, James Cavett, won a record award of $2.3 million compensatory and $1.5 million in punitive damages. <a href="http://www.lhc.org.uk/members/pubs/books/asbestos/asb09.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lhc.org.uk/members/pubs/books/asbestos/asb09.htm" rel="nofollow">[23]</a></p>
<p>The Manville Corporation, formerly the Johns-Manville Corporation, filed for reorganization and protection under the United States Bankruptcy Code in August 1982. At the time, it was the largest company ever to file bankruptcy, and was one of the richest. Manville was then 181st on the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortune_500.html" title="Fortune 500">Fortune 500</a>, but was the defendant of 16,500 lawsuits related to the health effects of asbestos. <a href="http://www.lhc.org.uk/members/pubs/books/asbestos/asb09.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lhc.org.uk/members/pubs/books/asbestos/asb09.htm" rel="nofollow">[24]</a></p>
<p>Johns-Manville was described by <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Motley_38f5.html" title="Ron Motley">Ron Motley</a>, a South Carolina attorney, as "the greatest corporate mass murderer in history." Court documents show that the corporation had a long history of hiding evidence of the ill effects of asbestos from its workers and the public. One of many examples is a memo from Johns-Manville's medical director to corporate headquarters<a href="http://www.ewg.org/reports/asbestos/printerfriendly.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ewg.org/reports/asbestos/printerfriendly.php" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>:</p>

<p>Other important US asbestos lawsuits included Bell v. Dresser Industries Inc., Borel v. Fibreboard Corporation, and Waters v. W. R. Grace.

<p>Asbestos litigation is the longest, most expensive mass tort in U.S. history, involving more than 6,000 defendants and 600,000 claimants.<a href="http://www.abanet.org/poladv/priorities/asbestos.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abanet.org/poladv/priorities/asbestos.html" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> Current trends indicate that the rate at which people are diagnosed with the disease will likely increase though the next decade. Analysts have estimated that the total costs of asbestos litigation in the USA alone will eventually reach $200 billion. The amounts and method of allocating compensation have been the source of many court cases, and government attempts at resolution of existing and future cases.</p>
<p>The controversy over asbestos-related liability issues is reflected by recent press reports and the position taken by the American Bar Association.</p>

<p><a href="../../../g/u/a/Guardian_Unlimited_1c3a.html" title="Guardian Unlimited">Guardian Unlimited</a> reported a test-case ruling in 2005, that allowed thousands of workers to be compensated for <a href="../../../p/l/e/Pleural.html" title="Pleural">pleural</a> plaques. Diffuse or localised fibrosis of the pleura, or pleural plaques, is less serious than asbestosis or mesothelioma, but is also considered a disease closely linked to the inhalation of asbestos.<a href="http://europa.eu.int/comm/research/success/en/med/0281e.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://europa.eu.int/comm/research/success/en/med/0281e.html" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> However, insurers claimed the plaques are "simply a marker for asbestos exposure rather than an injury." Mr Justice Holland rejected the insurers' arguments, and counsel for workers hailed the decision as a "victory that puts people before profits." <a href="http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,1415567,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,1415567,00.html" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>. However this decision was reversed on appeal to the Court of Appeal and the issue is now due to be heard by the House of Lords in 2007.</p>
<p>Insurance companies allege that asbestos litigation has taken too heavy a toll on insurance and industry. A 2002 article in the British <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Telegraph_dc47.html" title="Daily Telegraph">Daily Telegraph</a>'s Associate quoted Equitas, the reinsurance vehicle which assumed Lloyd's of London's liabilities, which argued that asbestos claims were "greatest single threat to <a href="../../../l/l/o/Lloyd%27s_of_London_1632.html" title="Lloyd's of London">Lloyd's of London</a>'s existence." <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml;sessionid=TVKIZWVQ4IZGRQFIQMGCNAGAVCBQUJVC?xml=/money/2002/06/22/cnequt22.xml&amp;secureRefresh=true&amp;_requestid=50642" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml;sessionid=TVKIZWVQ4IZGRQFIQMGCNAGAVCBQUJVC?xml=/money/2002/06/22/cnequt22.xml&amp;secureRefresh=true&amp;_requestid=50642" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>.

<p>A recent turning point has recently come about involving the case of a young 45 year old mother from Southsea, Hampshire, who was exposed to asbestos from her grandfather’s work clothes and now suffers from mesothelioma. As a result, Michelle Campbell has received over £140,000 in compensation for her pain and suffering from the Ministry of Defence, highlighting that the legacy of asbestos will continue and is now capable of affecting a third generation of victims – the grandchildren of former dockyard workers and other men who worked with the deadly substance throughout their careers. <a href="http://www.thompsons.law.co.uk/ntext/asbestos-cancer-mesothelioma-younger-victims.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thompsons.law.co.uk/ntext/asbestos-cancer-mesothelioma-younger-victims.htm" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>.</p>

<p>In May 2006, the House of Lords ruled that compensation for asbestos injuries should be reduced where responsibility could not be attached to a single employer. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4768057.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4768057.stm" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> Critics, including trade unions, asbestos groups and Jim Wallace, former justice minister, have condemned the ruling. They said it overturned the traditional Scottish law to such cases, and was a breach of natural justice. As a result of this outcry, the ruling has been overturned by Section three of the Compensation Act 2006.</p>

Two large <a href="../../../c/l/a/Class_action.html" title="Class action">class action</a> settlements, designed to limit liability, came before the Court in 1997 and 1999.

<p>Congress is still considering legislation from 2005 entitled the "Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2005". The Act would establish a $140 billion trust fund to supplant litigation as a means to compensate victims of asbestos and limit liability. On April 26, 2005, Dr. Philip Landrigan, Professor of Occupational and Environmental Medicine and Chairman of the Department of Community and Preventive Medicine at Mount SInai School of Medicine, <a href="http://www.ewg.org/reports_content/lungcancer/pdf/asbestos_testimony.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.ewg.org/reports_content/lungcancer/pdf/asbestos_testimony.pdf" rel="nofollow">testified</a> before the US Senate Committee on the Judiciary against this proposed legislation. He testified that many of the bill's provisions are unsupported by medicine and would unfairly exclude a large number of people who have become ill or died from asbestos: "The approach to the diagnosis of disease caused by asbestos that is set forth in this bill is not consistent with the diagnostic criteria established by the American Thoracic Society. If the bill is to deliver on its promise of fairness, these criteria will need to be revised." Also opposing the bill are the American Public Health Association and the Asbestos Workers Union.<a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2005/05/senate-judiciary-committee-wants.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2005/05/senate-judiciary-committee-wants.php" rel="nofollow">[34]</a></p>

<p>Asbestos abatement (removal of asbestos) has become a thriving industry in the United States. Strict removal and disposal laws have been enacted to protect the public from airborne asbestos. The <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clean_Air_Act_e032.html" title="Clean Air Act">Clean Air Act</a> requires that asbestos be wetted during removal and strictly contained, and that workers wear safety gear and masks. Over the last ten years, the federal government has prosecuted dozens of violations of the Act and violations of <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act_1837.html" title="Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act">Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act</a> (RICO) related to the operations. Often these involve contractors who hire undocumented workers without proper training or protection to illegally remove asbestos. Contractors who ignore safety regulations in removing asbestos commit an environmental crime that exposes countless people to potentially fatal and excruciatingly painful lung diseases. <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F50C10FC35540C778EDDAB0994DC404482" class="external autonumber" title="http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F50C10FC35540C778EDDAB0994DC404482" rel="nofollow">[44]</a></p>
