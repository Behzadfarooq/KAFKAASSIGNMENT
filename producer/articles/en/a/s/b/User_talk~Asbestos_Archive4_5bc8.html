<dd>Sure, it wasn't a malicious edit, but it was nonsense nevertheless. I have no history with Nightlark, nor have I edited any of the articles s/he has. I suspect Nightlark came across my sub-page at <a href="../../../r/e/c/Special%7ERecent_changes_1343.html" title="Special:Recent changes">Recent changes</a>. Discussion doesnâ€™t appear to be an option either, given s/he has just blanked their talk page and my comments posted on it. However, this isn't an issue I am going to pursue with any great fervour.</dd>

<dd>Thank you for responding, and for providing the above options. For now, I may just monitor Nightlark.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> 10:44, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just in case you did not notice: for all practical purposes, Amorrow = 204.147.187.240, but I have now fixed my login so that it is sticky (I logged out just to make this page). My POV on Elizabeth Morgan was very personal and creating her biography and my own Amorrow user page have been therapy for my own divorce (10 years ago) from my pediatrician ex-wife. My daughter is now 11 years old and ready for some initial "Facts of Life". My comments on my user page might be half-baked and humourous, but they are not intended to be obscene.</p>

<p>Hi. Looking at your image it is, to my eyes anyway, rather unclear as there is middle section appears to just be a funnel and has no apparent way of holding the grounds! It is also quite a bit smaller. Separately though I hadn't realised there was a <a href="../../../m/o/k/Moka.html" title="Moka">Moka</a> article and, checking the dates, it appears it should be merged into <a href="../../../c/o/f/Coffee_percolator.html" title="Coffee percolator">Coffee percolator</a> as the earliest-created article and also as the encompassing term. Also, most of the text in Moka already exists in the main article. Will do this shortly. --<a href="../../../v/a/m/User%7EVampWillow_af3c.html" title="User:VampWillow">Vamp</a>:<a href="../../../v/a/m/User_talk%7EVampWillow_2eb2.html" title="User talk:VampWillow">Willow</a> 19:49, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Merge completed.

<dd>While I remember ... I've always thought that "Moka" was a tradename for the product but can't trace any origin. Any knowledge of the etymology? --<a href="../../../v/a/m/User%7EVampWillow_af3c.html" title="User:VampWillow">Vamp</a>:<a href="../../../v/a/m/User_talk%7EVampWillow_2eb2.html" title="User talk:VampWillow">Willow</a> 20:16, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I note your change (though point out you said <i>"Had I realized, I wouldn't have made another image, since your diagram is fine"</i>) but your replacement image is still over-complicated to describe the functioning plus, eg, both the up and down spouts are closed rather than open. Given that the pre-existing image was perfectly clear in respect of explaining how it worked and you yourself also thought this, I've left it on the article. --<a href="../../../v/a/m/User%7EVampWillow_af3c.html" title="User:VampWillow">Vamp</a>:<a href="../../../v/a/m/User_talk%7EVampWillow_2eb2.html" title="User talk:VampWillow">Willow</a> 20:42, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Asbestos I am glad someone finally locked the page about Mojahedin-e Khalq because regime was misusing it as its mouthpiece on an encyclopedia which people take seriously. I was hoping that you could read both the discussion board and the history section of the page and you will see that arguments that me and my friend made, and some other people too, were factual (by which I mean we quoted facts which can be researched on the internet), while the regime-affiliated people who changed the page, at one point even wrote "I HATE YOUR GROUP". That obviously shows that he (or they) have serious POV. In responce to facts we presented, they accused me and my friend of being terrorists (on the basis that I live in France!). I hope you can write me back a message, but I also would like to ask you to revert the page to the unbiased version, which at the minimum call the group by the name they call themselves, PMOI, (You know its on the header of their statements, whereas they never use the term MKO). I say this because I don't like to see facts and history re-written and also because I wanted to show my friends the usefulness of Wikipedia (at present they would automatically reject it as a biased site, not a factual one). One last point is that you will notice, I put a lot of effort in writing a lot on the page "Maryam Rajavi", with plenty of facts, but the regime guy has come there aswell and has changed that too. If you just take a look at his version you will see that it is completely biased and to be honest, full of lies. One can tell that he has animosity towards the Iranian opposition group and can sense he is regime-affiliated. --RezaKia 06:51, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Solipsist â€”</p>
<p>thanks for reverting whatever it was that happened to my user page. I had seen it, but as it was a junble of code with everything mixed up, I figured it to be a server problem, not an act of vandalism, so decided to leave it. I guess I should have thought to check the page history. What did the guy do â€” copy the contents of the page source into the wiki?</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks, â€” <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos"><font color="#808080">Talk</font></a> 11:03, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No worries. I'm not really sure what they did. There was a fair bit of HTML code and #includes - I didn't pay much attention. When I see an anon-IP edit a user page without explanation there is a good chance it is vandalism, but this may just have been a mistake. Either way you are probably better off without it. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 12:02, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have to admit I have a preference for maps that do not put equator in the center or north in the upper part, thatÂ´s partly why I am attratcted to challenges where I believe such a map is not necessary, as this map and the <a href="../../../o/c/e/Oceans.html" title="Oceans">oceans</a> diagram I also did.</p>
<p>You may feel confused for the position of the continents but I do not. I would argue thatÂ´s because you are so much used to the mercator projection that you cannot see how distorted it can be, and how unprecise about the shape of the continents it can be. You could argue thatÂ´s a common and standard thatÂ´s easier to comunicate as we are used to it. This arguments could go forever. I for one have absolutely no difficulty in recognizing the continents.</p>
<p>I believe that this projection is better for the given map because:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is a almost no distortion on the land masses. As almost all migrations were by land (or by small jumps in primitive boats) it give us a precise measure of how far they had to walk. It show planet earth really as a walking distance tiny island.</li>
<li>Africa is on top left, where our eyes are used to start reading, south america is in the bottom right, which is the farthest continent that our ancestors had to walk. This give us a nice idea of how far where the native africans from the native americans when they first met (of course I am ignoring all transoceanic theories)</li>
<li>the polar cape is in the center, so that you can see the extent of the ice age in itÂ´s real undistorted area.</li>
<li>all arrows are continuous, no need for one going out of the map in one side and magically appearing on the other.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hello Asbestos,</p>
<p>I saw some of your G8 pictures and I was wondering whether you got permission from the people on the pictures to release them under the open licences. For instance, the man on <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:EdinburghProtests2.jpg" class="external free" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:EdinburghProtests2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:EdinburghProtests2.jpg</a>. On Indymedia and amongst the activists themselves there has been some discussion to protect the privacy of demonstrators, especially since the British autorities can use this footage to press charges on the people in the pictures. I don't know about international copyright laws, but in the Netherlands publishing these pictures without permission wouldn't be allowed anyhow, because of the 'portret rights' of the subjects. <a href="../../../../nl/s/a/n/Gebruiker%7ESanderSpek_07bd.html" class="extiw" title="nl:Gebruiker:SanderSpek">nl:Gebruiker:SanderSpek</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Hmmm, that's an interesting question. I think that for the precise picture you point out the question is academic â€” he was in the police's hands, either he was charged or he wasn't. All I know is that he was later taken to one of the police vans.</dd>
<dd>As to whether the images can be displayed, either online or in press, I think they certainly can: reporters are free to publish images of events such as these, and they don't need the permission of the subjects (I would doubt that even in the Netherlands journalists need to ask permission of everyone they publish photos of). As to whether they can be released under an open licence, I'm confused as to why this would be an issue. If I have the copyrights to the image, and the image is freely publishable, then what would prevent me from allowing others to use it? The free licence is merely a way of signaling my permission for others to use the images.</dd>
<dd>As for the slightly greyer area of whether I might be harming anyone from showing these pictures, I'd be a little more worried about that, as I have no wish to cause problems for anyone. However, no one in the photos are doing anything remotely illegal, and the police had dozens of their own photographers taking photos and film of everyone there. I'm also not sure how changing the licence to a non-free licence would aid that.</dd>
<dd>This isn't meant to dismiss your concerns out-right. If there is serious discussion on Indymedia that suggests photos, such as my own, which show no illegal activity might harm people, then I'd be interested in hearing it. I don't believe that the legality of the licence is in question, however.</dd>

<dd>I looked for some more info and you are partly right. In the Netherlands, someone with portret rights (this means, the person is recognisable on the picture) can object to the publication of the work. A judge can then make a judgement weighting the arguments and interests of the subject and the photographer/publisher. So probably by Dutch law it's okay. It don't expect it to be really more restricting on Wikipedia Commons, whatever law applies there.</dd>
<dd>About the question whether the persons on the pictures are doing something illegal: several of the demonstrations (like the Carnival For Full Enjoyment (Edinburgh, I think where your pictures are taken) and the Boogie On The Bridge (Glasgow)) were illegal, so all the participators were doing something illegal. I was in the group who was panned in Canning Street during the Carnival, and when we were released we were told that participating in any other illegal demo/carnival during the G8 could result in an arrestation. However, I don't expect the police doing anything with footage of those ocasions now (although they might be used in later cases) and probably they have plenty of their own footage by now. At least, I got filmed dozens of times. <a href="../../../../nl/s/a/n/Gebruiker%7ESanderSpek_07bd.html" class="extiw" title="nl:Gebruiker:SanderSpek">nl:Gebruiker:SanderSpek</a></dd>

<dd>I brought up the crisis because I had thought your way of handling it was a little odd. However, until I was asked to elaborate by Kim, I merely mentioned that you had asked for a notice placed on your user page, which was the part I found oddest, and which someone else had already mentioned. I don't think it's worth withdrawing over this issue: I've withdrawn my mention of her, and I'm sure Blankfaze would also remove her name from his comment if you asked. I don't think her being in or out of any limelight would be different if you withdrew.</dd>

From my little experience with you, but by looking through your history here, I personally think that you're an extremely valuable wikipedia member and contributor.

<dd>Hi Sjakkalle â€” actually I had checked for copyvio (I always do if a newbie posts a complete article in one edit). While there were several sections that were copyvio (all that stuff about bulls) and quotes that were also elsewhere, it didn't look to me like the entire article was copyvio; rather it seemed pieced together from several sources and with a fair amount of POV ranting in the middle. I could have removed the copyvio sections, but I figured if it's going to VfD there wouldn't be much point.</dd>
<dd>I was actually confused about how it got speedied. I couldn't see anything in <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> that the article would fit under. I therefore went by the safer route and VfD'd. I guess Rama thought otherwise, though I don't know that "ridicoulous rant, not a chance of survival in VfD" is a criteria.</dd>

<dd>When I checked for copyvio I found the text at several different pages at the same website. If there is any copyvio, even a copyvio with comments attached to it, it's quite safe to tag it as a copyvio. Otherwise, I agree with you that it might not have been a speedy deletion, but if anyone tries bringing <i>that</i> to VFU arguing that it wasn't a speedy candidate, I will be voting "keep deleted" without hesitation.

<dd>I've played with him some. I was in a university group in CT, nominally under FICA and him, and he'd come up a couple times a year and we'd go down to DC a few times a year, and I got to play with him some in rodas elsewhere. I'd be happy to start up an article on him at some point, although it would have to be in a few days after I've turned in my dissertation... â€” <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos"><font color="#808080">Talk</font></a> <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_RFC_4482.html" title="User:Asbestos/RFC"><font color="#808080"><small>(RFC)</small></font></a> 08:56, 19 August 2005</dd>

<p>Do you know if there is Wiki-page that shows immediately when new articles are created and it is it open to non-Admins? It seems to me there must be or things wouldn't wind up on VfD within minutes. Sorry if this has an obvious answer--I only ask you because you welcomed me some months back. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 11:45, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yup, there are two ways, in fact. The first is to go to <a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewpages_26cd.html" title="Special:Newpages">Special:Newpages</a>, either through that link or by typing it out in your adress bar. I'm actually not entirely sure how one is supposed to know this â€” the only place I've seen the link posted is at <a href="../../../r/c/_/Wikipedia%7ERC_patrol_419c.html" title="Wikipedia:RC patrol">Wikipedia:RC patrol</a>, which isn't a page most people would go to often. The second, I expect more common way, is that many people montor the <a href="../../../r/e/c/Special%7ERecentchanges_05b8.html" title="Special:Recentchanges">Recent changes</a> page to keep an eye out for vandalism, and new pages show up with an <b>N</b> next to them. If the page has a title that catches someone's eye, or is made by an anon IP or a new user (shown by their talk-page red link), you can bet that it will have several editors check it out to see if it's ok. â€” <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos"><font color="#808080">Talk</font></a> <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_RFC_4482.html" title="User:Asbestos/RFC"><font color="#808080"><small>(RFC)</small></font></a> 17:38, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for info. I think this is relevant enough to have a link on the help page. I could add this reasonably but don't think I have the seniority; you might do this or at least solicit opinions. If there was a monitoring system for the Special:Newpages it would partly eliminate problems with VfD months later. I watched the page for an hour after you noted it to me and threw five articles on Speedy deletions easily. Considering the over-all volume, I can only imagine how many of the (almost now) 700 000 articles slipped thru unobserved and should have been stopped as soon as they were started. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 23:00, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You really ought to feel free to add things to whichever help page you think the link applies to. There is sometimes some implied seniority in that, if users know you they might be more likely to trust that your actions are in good faith, but any user who reverts a good-faith addition to a help page ought certainly to take it to the talk page and discuss it if nothing else.</dd>
<dd>In answer to your monitoring system thoughts, though, I think people who watch Recent Changes already do this â€” indeed, as you said, many articles get VfD's within minutes of their creation. It's always difficult to know what would have gotten through had you not been watching the page: for instance, when I have the time to vandal watch, I might catch and revert twenty or so vandalisms within ten minutes. That said, they would have probably been caught even if I hadn't been watching the RC.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, if you're interested in this, I know that some users get the RC to show up constantly in their RSS feed, and I bet you could do the same thing with NewPages. You'd have to ask at one of the help desks for detais, though.</dd>
<dd>Good luck!</dd>
