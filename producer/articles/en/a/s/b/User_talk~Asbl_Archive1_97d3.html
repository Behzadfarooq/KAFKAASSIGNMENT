<p><b>Welcome!</b></p>
<p><a href="../../../w/e/l/Wikipedia%7EWelcome%2C_newcomers_06aa.html" title="Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers">Welcome</a> to Wikipedia, Asbl/Archive1! My name is Ryan, aka <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAcetic_Acid_31d1.html" title="User:Acetic Acid">Acetic Acid</a>. I noticed that you were new and haven't received any messages yet. I just wanted to see how you were doing. Wikipedia can be a little intimidating at first, since it uses different formatting than other sites that use <a href="../../../h/t/m/HTML_4c4a.html" title="HTML">HTML</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cascading_Style_Sheets_981c.html" title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</a>. In the long run, though, you'll find that the WikiSyntax is a lot easier and faster than those other ways. Here are a few links to get you started:</p>

</ul>
<p>There are a lot of policies and guides to read, but I highly recommend reading over those first. If you have any questions, feel free to leave me a message on my <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAcetic_Acid_8f87.html" title="User talk:Acetic Acid">talk page</a>. Please be sure to <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">sign your name on Talk</a> using four tildes (~~~~) to produce your name and the current date, along with a link to your user page. This way, others know when you left a message and how to find you. It's easier than having to type out your name, right?&#160;:)</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy contributing to Wikipedia. We can use all the help we can get! Have a nice day. Sincerely, <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAcetic_Acid_31d1.html" title="User:Acetic Acid">Ryan</a> 04:31, August 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>You have not responded as to whether the claim is notable, which implies in part that you must cite a credible source. A web site content to repeat rumour-mongering from the blogosphere does not appear to be a credible source and therefore has not established that it has done anything more than publish loose speculation. The fact that he is unmarried does nothing to establish notability or credibility. <a href="../../../b/u/f/User%7EBuffyg_c61f.html" title="User:Buffyg">Buffyg</a> 14:05, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please don't throw around accusations of vandalism that aren't recognised by Wikipedia policy. If you want to make the edit, please argue the notability of the claim and the crebility of the source. <a href="../../../b/u/f/User%7EBuffyg_c61f.html" title="User:Buffyg">Buffyg</a> 16:06, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Replying to your post to my user page:</p>
<dl>
<dd>As I don't otherwise speculate that unmarried men approaching the age of 40 are queer, I don't see why that would be any more indicative here. By the standards you are proposing, any behaviour that may be taken as vaguely inconsistent with social norms that then becomes cause for gossip is notable. I think not. The fact that Mehlman argues that he need not answer a question when confronted with zero material evidence does not make this any more noteworthy. A chain of "what ifs" is no more compelling than an isolated one. You appear above all to confuse the fact that there is no obvious evidence of his heterosexuality (i.e. a wife and children), which therefore implies that he is gay. That is thoroughly illogical. Maybe it's true, maybe it's not — the point is that is no compelling evidence that he is and hence nothing notable. <a href="../../../b/u/f/User%7EBuffyg_c61f.html" title="User:Buffyg">Buffyg</a> 16:15, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Lacking any response on your part, I have stricken your attacks from <a href="../../../k/e/n/Talk%7EKen_Mehlman_59ff.html" title="Talk:Ken Mehlman">Talk:Ken Mehlman</a>. You remain free to retract the remarks by deleting them yourself and offering an apology. Barring this or some misguided escalation of the matter, I can only say that I regret that you have mistaken my insistence that you justify your edits in terms of wikipedia policy for my taking a conventionally partisan stand against you. I expect I've nothing further to say to you other than to wish you well. <a href="../../../b/u/f/User%7EBuffyg_c61f.html" title="User:Buffyg">Buffyg</a> 18:47, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd like to add that the content dispute is with the article itself. The dispute in the talk page is whether the discussion belongs in the talk page. As has been explain to the blanking offenders, the discussion was moved to that page, as it did not belong in a personal talk page. I did not see them transfering the discussion back to the original user talk page. This is why I considered their actions simple vandalism. --<a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbl_629a.html" title="User:Asbl">Asbl</a> 21:39, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I believe you were acting in good faith. The standard for when dealing with 3RR is to block all that violate it, regardless if they were on the "right" side or not. You might have been, but when you get to 3RR just stop and ask for help. I think on talk pages it would be even more flexible, but my quick count shows 11 reverts today, and that's too many.

<p>I know that folks get passionate about politics, it's one reason why the field is interesting. Even so, when we're editing at Wikipedia, we should keep our cool. Though other editors may have glaring personal defects or political biases we should stick to discussing the edits calmly. It's easier on everyone.

<dd>After examining the Mehlman Talk page, I guess you are referring to the discussion I had with <a href="../../../b/u/f/User%7EBuffyg_c61f.html" title="User:Buffyg">buffyg</a> three months ago. Although I was rough, I believe I stayed civil. He did not. I explained to him on several occasions why I thought my comments were legitimate, and we agreed to disagree on whether or not my comments constituted a "personal attack". I guess his feelings were hurt and he wants to rehash the conversation, something that I refuse. --<a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbl_629a.html" title="User:Asbl">Asbl</a> 01:59, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Apologies for calling you a jerk. But I wonder why, with your intensely felt opinion about Republican hypocrisy on gays, you feel qualified to determine the appropriateness of including the Mehlman rumor in the article. Don't you think you are ascribing too much importance to this rumor solely to point out your belief in GOP hypocrisy? For example, I'm sure there is a rumor-rumor out there concerning Terry McAuliffe or Howard Dean (totally hypothetically, drug use or wife abuse), that would confirm some right-winger's opinion that Democrats are hypocrites by saying one thing and doing another. But I don't think you'd go out of your way to make absolutely sure the rumor got included and stayed included. MattP206.195.19.47 20:54, 7 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for your apology.</dd>
<dd>Please note that I completely oppose adding rumors to Wikipedia. That said, Mehlman's refusal to answer a question is not a rumor it is a well documented fact <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Mehlman_references_2ba9.html" title="Ken Mehlman/references">see references here</a>. Mehlman can put to rest any questions by providing an "up or down" answer. His refusal to give an "up or down" answer is encyclopedic, even if the context of the refusal is POV.</dd>
<dd>As for your examples, we'll cross those bridges when we get there. I think our treatment of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Mikulski_23b7.html" title="Barbara Mikulski">Barbara Mikulski</a> was to your satisfaction, and if you find anything that fit your examples, we'll look at the circumstances and see how to best treat them. Every situation is unique, so I can't give meaningful answers to hypothetical cases. --<a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbl_629a.html" title="User:Asbl">Asbl</a> 21:04, 7 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You dignify my comments too much. I was making up (hopefully) ridiculous examples of possible rumors. Perhaps I should have said "so-and-so is an Alien" to be clear. In albeit minor defense of the GOP, I still think there's a little "actions speak louder than words" at work here. It wouldn't be politically wise to its most outspoken wing to trumpet such inclusion, but the other side of the coin is that Mehlman didn't say "hell, no!"

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Wendy Shalit2000.jpg</b>. I notice the image page currently doesn't specify who created the image, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is therefore unclear. If you have not created the image yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the image on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the image yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the image also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture then you can use {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}} to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the image qualifies as fair use, please read <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>.

<p>To have left the hebrew project. From time to time I visit there jsut to read the Miznon and Gilgamashe's talk page ,and see that nothing has changed. Today's arguments are about him erasing a huge 60KB article for no reason ,against the general consnsus (of course without notifying any one). I concur with your farewell notice ,yet I dont see any reason but personal changes for Gilgamash'es life ,to free his and his yey sayers grip on the hebrew project. This could take years. sad to see how a few people can infiltrate and destroy an open source project such as this. --<a href="../../../d/i/z/User%7EDiza_c901.html" title="User:Diza"><font color="DarkGreen">Procrastinating<b>@</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../d/i/z/User_talk%7EDiza_270b.html" title="User talk:Diza">talk2me</a></sup> 14:05, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Somehow, "they" were able to organize and mobalize their forces to bring back Wikipedians who have been gone for a long time just to support the status quo. I am still trying to figure out what happened behind the scenes for "mishehi she'ichpat la" to change her vote from opposing the status quo to supporting the status quo. If I could only figure out how they did that, it would represent how they maintain their firm grip on power there.</dd>
<dd>I have come to the conclusion that "they" purposely want to keep the community small, so that they can more easily manage the project to their liking. There is no way they could manage the English Wikipeida the way they run the Hebrew Wikipedia, as they would be overwhelmed with the rate of edits (by my count, about 20 per second). --<a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbl_629a.html" title="User:Asbl">Asbl</a> 16:57, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Are you suggesting her mind was forcably changed?</p>
<p>There is a classic .almost ancient computer game called <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civilization.html" title="Civilization">civilization</a> Where one can choose the method of goverement to use over the people. the best form is <a href="../../../d/e/s/Despotism.html" title="Despotism">despotism</a> ,but when your cities grow it becomes corrupted ,and you lose tax revenues and such. gradually with the growth of your empire is becomes impossible to sustain it without giving liberal rights and eventually freedom to your people(monarchy ,republic..democracy). I believe they are entranched in their own concept. the wikiepdia will not grow because of this ,and because of this failure to grow(and the tendecny to erase articles) they will not encounter the problem you'r describing. Again ,I trulyl believe that no outside force can save the hebrew project.</p>

I've left a note on the anon user's talk page, requesting that he discuss the paragraph in question on the talk page. Given that this sort of thing has happened to me before, I'm guessing he's going to ignore me and continue to revert. Just recently this happened to another article I watch, and it had to be sprotected against anon editors to stop an anon POV pusher. Sigh.

<dd>You are 100% correct. For some bizzare reason, I refuse to just give up, and keep on fighting to bring the Hebrew Wikipedia to its maximum potential, where as many people who want to contribute can contribute, and will feel that their contributions are judged on the content of the contribution, rather than the user name. As you have already discovered, this battle is doomed to failure. --<a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbl_629a.html" title="User:Asbl">Asbl</a> 15:12, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've been around for almost a year now and have seen history recylcing back on it self over and over again. I believe that <i>More</i> users were banned or driven away than they are currently active users. Furthermore ,the english version is obviously better in every concieveable way ,and so I get the best "revenge" by seeing articles I created(more than 15) <b>Completely</b> unchanged since my last edit(sometimes more than 6 months back..).</dd>
<dd>Otherwise ,It is such a headache fighting these selfproclaimed kings, having your tools of logic ,underlying belief in good faith ,openness to self criticims and evolution repeatly proven inefficient by you and previously by me. These futile attempts to converse issues has gotten me nothing but bad <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis_removal.html" title="Penis removal">bad feelings</a>.</dd>
<dd>Btw ,I (also?) work in Matam.
<dl>
<dd>I think <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis_removal.html" title="Penis removal">the bad feelings you mention</a> are more painful than editing on the Hebrew Wikipedia. If I were being punished, and told that my choices are <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis_removal.html" title="Penis removal">the bad feelings</a>, or editing on the Hebrew Wikipedia, I'll take editing on the Hebrew Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>There is no doubt that the Hebrew Wikipedia is broken, but I think there must be a way to fix it. As you correctly mention, there is nothing I can say to bring about a change, because David Shay and his minions do not listen to reason.

<p>I totally disagree with you. One of the most important ways to "check up" on a politician is too look at what they have been doing.

<dd>No, it doesn't. Works produced by civilian and military employees of the United States federal government in the scope of their employment are public domain by statute. This requirement is not extended to state goverments, and most states do not release their works into the public domain. In fact, one of the images you placed that tag on recently had a California government tag removed after it was determined that works by the state of california are not free content. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 20:51, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
