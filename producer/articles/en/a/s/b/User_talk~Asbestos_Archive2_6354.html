<p>Hi, just to tell that I personally do not care at all, but you might irritate people by using Google to justify removal of regionalisms; of course the Internet speaks American and Google reflects that.

<p>Hi. I noticed you marked Cuenta larga for speedy because it wasn't English. This isn't usual practice. Articles not written in English should be tagged {{notenglish}}, so that someone has a chance to translate it. Either way, this particular article was a copyvio. - <a href="../../../v/a/g/User%7EVague_Rant_9ae6.html" title="User:Vague Rant">Vague</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/g/User_talk%7EVague_Rant_b959.html" title="User talk:Vague Rant">Rant</a> 11:21, Nov 30, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Perhaps you should educate yourself in a better school than CT's Wesleyan and just about the worst Master's programs in Europe before you consider yourself capable of making logically coherent statements on Wiki pages. You know that I am referring to pages of Five Colleges of Ohio. Stick to the pages where nobody else cares, okay? But your logic is simply stupid. There is no nice to describe it. Thanks. --Ranamim</p>
<p>One more to which I expect you to reply...The personal attack is not really an attack. It an outragous response trying to understant the logic of someone who consistently complains about what to me seem like trivialities. Shouldn't that be a reason enough to lose credibility in someone? In addition, this guy Asbestos simply can not argue his case. If you are not outraged at someone's inability to argue a case with solid logic and yet being obstinate about making changes, how would you react?? ...and something esle, Asbestos, to make it easy for you to distinguish between facts and opinions. "Opinions" expressed by respectable guides like Barron's and Pope, are based on statistics. Statistics...in case you never knew...are facts! Selectivity is _not_ determined by what someone thinks. Let me repeat that for Asbestos because he won't get it from the first time. Selectivity is _not_ determined by what someone thinks. It is determined by various statistics: percent of people applying from out of state, average GPA of applicants, average SAT, etc. (I do not know the exact methodology, but what's important to take out is that it is based on numbers). Let me not repeat the last sentence again with risk of becoming annoying...but Asbestos has justified the need for that. So, it is not an opinion. Hence, its purpose is NOT to attract attention, but rather to state a fact. Hence it is NOT a POV.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<dd><i>Hi, Ranamim, so nice to have you back. I was worried we had scared you off.</i><br /></dd>
<dd><i>Your comment was a little strange, especially the nudge about the university. Edinburgh's AI department is well-known as being the best in Europe, but comparing different schools was never your forte, was it?</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>An aside: Don't worry my dear. Having lived in England, I am very familiar with Edinburgh. It is a great place for undergraduates and I've heard a lot of wonderful things about it but only on the undergrad level. However, when I myself considered going there for DPhil in Economics, I was told by students in the University itself that all M.Sc. programs are cash-cows for foreign students (apparently you are one yourself there) and the quality of students is really really poor, so that made it an easy decision for me not to go back to the UK. So, yes, comparing schools wasn't my forte, especially, when they accept me and I reject their offers due to low academic standards. Hahah "<i>You don't seem to have garnered much support for your side on any of the issues you fight on, though. This, however, appears to mean nothing to you.</i>"</p>
<p>Have you looked at their profiles? You think that some 50-year old programmer a few teenagers will be a bunch that I need to base my self-esteem on? Of course it means nothing to me. The last 4 users haven't even bothered to comment on their edits and the ones that do fail to asnwer on the discussion pages the discrepancy between keeping the text on your alma mater's page and deleting it on the Ohio Wesleyan's. If that's not illogical and inconsistent, then what is?</p>
<p>And listen...this issue is not even close to the conflict of interest on the Wesleyan page. Clearly you don't go around on every single college page and make edits...an by edits I mean deleting a word or two...and not contributiing anything substantive. Instead, you add or you keep the same edits that you delete on the OH Wesleyan's page on your own alma mater's page. So, it is pretty clear that you have other reasons to revert edits that I make and be inconsistent in your logic. Why? I know why...the other 10 users that you cite perhaps don't. Notice...nothing personal in this paragraph...just arguments...</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<dd>Here I must respectfully disagree. For example, <i>"You think that some 50-year old programmer a few teenagers will be a bunch that I need to base my self-esteem on?"</i> I would consider this a personal attack. You are discrediting the contributions of the people you mention. As for the "discrepancy" between the Wesleyan and Ohio Wesleyan pages, I've already stated once that I really don't care. I'm not involving myself in that dispute - let's reach a compromise/consensus here first, then make changes to other college articles as need be. <a href="../../../a/e/r/User%7EAerion_926e.html" title="User:Aerion">Aerion</a> 22:08, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for your welcome and advice, but i don't know, about <a href="../../../e/n/r/Enrico_Forti_9d40.html" title="Enrico Forti">Enrico Forti</a> i have write only text from bio of his website. The text that can appear personal, are the words of Enrico Forti during an interview at television, here you can read something about this program in italian: <a href="http://www.google.it/search?q=cache:wkavpgLK8WIJ:ilrestodelcarlino.quotidiano.net/chan/musica:5364474:/2004/12/06:+enrico+forti+giallo&amp;hl=it" class="external free" title="http://www.google.it/search?q=cache:wkavpgLK8WIJ:ilrestodelcarlino.quotidiano.net/chan/musica:5364474:/2004/12/06:+enrico+forti+giallo&amp;hl=it" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.it/search?q=cache:wkavpgLK8WIJ:ilrestodelcarlino.quotidiano.net/chan/musica:5364474:/2004/12/06:+enrico+forti+giallo&amp;hl=it</a> i think the story of him need this part because all the story is very dark, so is better for don't think "Enrico Forti guilty" or "other peoples guilty"... Just real information for have a correct visual. If you want i send to you the TV interview in a media file, but is in italian. If you think that something in the text need correction, i'm happy if you correct the text that you think is wrong. I want give my contribute to Wikipedia, because this is the first place where i see that everybody help everybody with common work and common respect, and when there is a problem, peoples speak about this and solve the problem.

<p>Hi.
