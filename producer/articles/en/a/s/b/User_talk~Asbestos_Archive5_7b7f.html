<p>Hi again--another possibly silly question for you. How do I find out if someone has an e-mail address posted? I got an e-mail from another user and I can't for the life of me figure out where you can look at other people's preferences. (No problem on the admin vote incidentally--congrats). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 09:07, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As far as I know, the only way that you can tell is by looking at the little "E-mail this user" link when you view a User Page (bottom left on the monobook skin). The link will let you send an email, though it won't give you the address for spam-prevention reasons. If the user doesn't have an email set, it either won't show the link or it will tell you so when you click on it (I can't remember which off-hand). Alternatively, people might show their email address on their user page (like I do), or you could always just ask them for their address in their Talk. — <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos"><font color="#808080">Talk</font></a> <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_RFC_4482.html" title="User:Asbestos/RFC"><font color="#808080"><small>(RFC)</small></font></a></dd>

<dd>Thanks. Odd, but this doesn't appear for me. If I look at other user pages or as an anon look at my own there is very definitely no "e-mail this usser" link anywhre.

<p>hi. what do you make of anonymous users who don't seem to be ignorant of how wikipedia works who go around making seemingly decent edits, garnering praise and whatnot? I ask cuz you and I have each had a run-in w/ one. they irk me but I gott say- I'v made an anon edit or two in my life. I don't imagine wikipedia establishment is in love w/ this phenomenon. lemme know if you hav any feelings on about this. thankz, <a href="../../../d/z/z/User%7EDzzl_f07e.html" title="User:Dzzl">Ish Micka Vonn aAmerikazakh</a> 17:31, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Ish Micka Vonn aAmerikazakh —</dd>
<dd>Having anon users is a big part of Wikipedia philosophy: <i>anyone</i> is supposed to be able to edit, as we don't want to make it <i>difficult</i> to edit this encyclopedia. Looking around, I've found a page on this, <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wikipedia%7EWelcome_anonymous_editing_56ed.html" title="Wikipedia:Welcome anonymous editing">Wikipedia:Welcome anonymous editing</a>. That said, having a user name makes it easy to communicate with a user, and automatically raises the level of trust in the eyes of other editors. A hard-to-verify edit, like the changing of a date in an article, is likely to regarded as probable <a href="../../../d/e/a/Wikipedia%7EDealing_with_vandalism_a5a4.html#How_to_spot_vandalism" title="Wikipedia:Dealing with vandalism">sneaky vandalism</a> if done by an anon user, yet more likely to be treated as good faith if the user is logged in.</dd>
<dd>If you're interested, many users put a note on the talk pages of valuable anon users suggesting that they create an account. I've got a template, for instance, at <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_Templates_34eb.html" title="User:Asbestos/Templates">User:Asbestos/Anon</a>, and I know there's a ready-made one around somewhere.</dd>
<dd>As a completely off-topic aside, there's been some discussion recently on signatures which don't correlate to the user's username. While there's no policy against it, it usually makes it easier if they do correlate (for instance, do I call you Ish Micka Vonn aAmerikazakh or Dzzl?). — <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos"><font color="#808080">Talk</font></a> <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_RFC_4482.html" title="User:Asbestos/RFC"><font color="#808080"><small>(RFC)</small></font></a> 23:10, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Clawson —</p>
<p>I'd like to just remind you that Wikipedia's <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">three-revert rule</a> doesn't only apply to those who are changing the article; it also applies to those changing it back <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Malcolm_X&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Malcolm_X&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I blocked User:70.23.104.48, as he had been explicitly warned against continuing the revert war. However, in future, please try to enlist the help of other editors to prevent yourself from violating 3RR when another user keeps changing an article. This isn't just pointless beaurocracy: it helps show a united voice and makes clear to the other editor that it's not just an argument between two people (though I realize his had been reverted by other editors earlier).</p>
<p>Don't worry too much about it now, but do keep it in mind in the future. — <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos"><font color="#808080">Talk</font></a> <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_RFC_4482.html" title="User:Asbestos/RFC"><font color="#808080"><small>(RFC)</small></font></a> 17:36, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The user in question was, essentially, vandalising the article. He had been asked multiple times to stop, and at least one other editor (Jpgordon) had attempted to engage the user in dialogue as well. We were both unsuccessful, and since the user kept adding irrelevant information, I figured the standard "3RR does not apply to vandalism" guideline would apply, so I kept reverting his irrelevant edits.—<b><a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClawson_a883.html" title="User:Clawson">chris.lawson</a></b>&#160;(<a href="../../../c/l/a/User_talk%7EClawson_988f.html" title="User talk:Clawson">talk</a>) 20:47, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I understood that that's what you felt, and that's why I said don't worry too much, but the vandalism clause is there for straightforward vandalism ("Wikipedia sUks and ur gAy"), and not for content disputes. The user may have been rude, and didn't know anything about discussing his edits instead of trying to force them through, but it was still a content dispute.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, though email I've encouraged him to get a username and start making proper use of the talk page. Hopefully he'll start to realize that his current tactic won't get him anyway, and start acting civilized. — <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos"><font color="#808080">Talk</font></a> <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_RFC_4482.html" title="User:Asbestos/RFC"><font color="#808080"><small>(RFC)</small></font></a> 22:15, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So am I to understand that repeatedly adding irrelevant/ungrammatical/otherwise inappropriate material to an article is <i>not</i> "straightforward vandalism?" If you look at the page history, you'll see that Josh and I have reverted the anon's edits previously, largely with edit summaries "please discuss on Talk". It was my understanding that continued insistence on the addition of controversial material (without discussion and consensus) <i>was</i> one of the definitions of vandalism.—<b><a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClawson_a883.html" title="User:Clawson">chris.lawson</a></b>&#160;(<a href="../../../c/l/a/User_talk%7EClawson_988f.html" title="User talk:Clawson">talk</a>) 23:20, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A further note, just as a heads-up: {{subst:subst:{2|702310448}}} (<a href="../../../7/0/2/User_talk%7E702310448.html" title="User talk:702310448">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_702310448_6ce3.html" title="Special:Contributions/702310448">contribs</a>) is the anon's registered username. Please note that he has betrayed his highly biased point of view on my Talk page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Clawson&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=23253866" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Clawson&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=23253866" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. As I pointed out on his Talk page, he is trying to support a non-neutral point of view with his own original research, which is two strikes against him, no matter how polite he is about it. If he's going to slur college professors, I don't think he's mature enough to edit here. Just my opinion, and admittedly a very harsh one, but I thought you should know what he wrote, and what I thought of it. Please continue to keep an eye on his edits (and mine; constructive criticisms are welcomed&#160;:)).

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thanks for your recent edit of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_works_in_irregular_time_signatures.html" title="List of works in irregular time signatures">List of works in irregular time signatures</a>. That guy has been driving me nuts, and he doesn't seem to read the comments or participate in any discussion.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'd be curious to know what attracted your attention to the article and why you chose to do what you did. I'm kinda' new to the wiki and haven't had a chance to read all the FAQs/guides yet.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<dd>Hi Dave,</dd>
<dd>Actually, I was just doing a little bit of RC Patrol (see <a href="../../../r/c/p/WP%7ERCP_b874.html" title="WP:RCP">WP:RCP</a>). If you click on the "<a href="../../../r/e/c/Special%7ERecentchanges_05b8.html" title="Special:Recentchanges">Recent Changes</a>" on the right (assuming you're using the monobook skin) you can see all the edits that people have made recently. An edit made by an anonymous user without an edit summary is quite possibly an act of vandalism. Clicking on "Diff" beside the edit, you can see exactly what it was the editor did. In that case, I saw he had just deleted a bunch of text, so assumed he was just a straight-forward vandal, so reverted it.</dd>
<dd>Hope that makes it clearer, feel free to ask about anything else!</dd>

<p>Hi Asbestos,</p>
<p>my name is Riccardo! Three days ago I edited the Wikipedia page on "child prodigy". I just added "Arthur Rimbaud" in the list of child prodigies in literature. Since he was probably the most famous child prodigy in literature history, I felt it was unfair not to mention him in the list. However, my article was deleted because "[..]articles on Wikipedia are expected to be encyclopedic in nature[..]". To be honest, I don't understand what was wrong with my addition!&#160;:-) Could you comment on that?</p>
<p>Thanks, cheers Riccardo (<a href="../../../1/4/0/User_talk%7E140.105.16.2.html" title="User talk:140.105.16.2">140.105.16.2</a>)</p>

<p>Hi - you sent me a note in the midst of my writing an article == about asking you questions, if I had any, or discuss stuff. I have an addictive LOVE of writing and I have a lot of history to write about, some of which I know first-hand. (1.) I have perused the Wiki outlines about styles, etc. and have tried to gear my writing to be encyclopedic but not dull (history shouldn't have to be) -- but probably still "ain't perfect" by Wiki standards. (2.) I have a problem not being able to understand alot of the jargon and communication techniques laid out in Wiki -- even in writing this. (3.) I saw mentioned that some articles are actually "protected" from editing, which surprises me, as Wiki is advertised as being info that ANYONE can edit...gee...shouldn't it really say, "anyone can edit SOME info..."? (4.) I have been an anonymous editor on some articles. I only registered because I thought it was required to contribute photos. Do I have to go back to old articles I wrote or edited and put my user name on them somehow? If so, HELP!! (5.) Also, I tried to follow the instructions on how to get pictures inserted because I have photos ready to go, but the directions are too much, and too frustrating for me to follow. They lead to too many questions without another person to initially walk me through it. I seem to be clueless...thank you! IS THAT BOLD ENOUGH?</p>
<p>Mshafb 00:10, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Asbestos: Thank you for your response. (1.) Regarding the input of photos, I notice you did not include the most puzzling part about choosing the license. Do I ignore that? Or do I have to do that on each one? How do I do that? What do I choose, if necessary, and where do I put that information? For the most part, the pictures are photos of people I know, either taken by me or by other non-professionals, and some of vintage years, as well as maybe artwork painted by my deceased parents who were professional artists, and whose copyrights for reproduction I am assuming to hold since I own the original art. Should I worry if they go public that they may be copied by other artists? (2.) In doing geneaology and historical work in other legitimate websites, I found that my name and inquiries were used as a title in a pornography site, OF COURSE WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. I am very angry and embarrassed about that. What can be done to make sure anything I include in this site will not be co-opted by porn sites? (3.) The particular site I wanted to add more info into was for "Ted Neeley." It is pitifully poor, only a sentence or so in the initial bio. It seems to remain protected, so I wonder about the timeline for that one? Or can't the original writer build it up with more quality info?</p>
<p>Thank you...</p>

<dd>Asbestos warned me to lay off the ad hominem attacks, so I decided to check out the progress of the mediation. Okay, I will concede that <i>some</i> of my comments were perhaps a little extreme, immature, and uncalled for. I apologize for that, if it will help the situation. But even though I have repeatedly urged him to do so, Mr. Barberio has still not given a reason for why he has not obtained and read Janet Abbate's book (currently the authoritative scholarly analysis of Internet history) before persisting with his rather unorthodox view of the history of the Internet. Professor Abbate's book is widely available at English-language libraries worldwide, and can be purchased from practically any online bookstore.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Please keep in mind that it is against Wikipedia policy to publish original research. I believe that Mr. Barberio's views fall within that definition because they are so far from the mainstream of published work on the history of the Internet. Specifically, I am referring to the books published by historian Janet Abbate, journalist M. Mitchell Waldrop, journalist Katie Hafner, sociologist Thierry Bardini, journalist Steven Segaller, etc. There are also the books published by the two creators of the Web, Robert Cailliau and Tim Berners-Lee.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia is not supposed to publish original research, but rather conform to the mainstream of verifiable published research unless and until the direction of mainstream research changes. If Mr. Barberio feels that his analysis is so valid, then by all means write it up and get it published in a peer-reviewed history journal (I suggest IEEE Annals of the History of Computing) and then as a book by a major academic publisher. Then it will be worthy of citation on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> 04:29, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Checking in to find out if the mediation is still totaly deadlocked. I checked to see if <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">User:Jnc</a> was still away and saw the message there, unfortunatly it seems Noel interperated the arbitration process as 'a lack of support from the community in dealing with a clueless, argumentative, biased, stubborn nitwit'. Should we interperate this as a withdrawl from the arbitration process? --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarberio_8f89.html" title="User:Barberio">Barberio</a> 18:27, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>My name is Oliver Metz. I am a student at Brent International School, Manila, an International school located in the Philippines. I am doing my last year of school (12th Grade) and I am writing a research paper (about 4000 words) on Wikipedia in ITGS (Information Technology in a Global Society). Of 10 randomly picked people you have been chosen as one. If you are willing and have the time to answer a few questions I would be grateful if you could fill out a short questionnaire of 6 questions.</p>
<p><b>Some Information about my essay:</b></p>
<p>My essay topic is about the freedom to collaborate and the usage of the Internet as a tool to do so. I will analyze topics such as Altruism versus Egoism as well as the Product Wikipedia itself.</p>
<p><b>My Thesis Statement:</b> The Internet is not only a medium for communication, information and marketing but also a place for altruism, collaboration and cooperation. Wikipedia is the product of a voluntary collaborative effort that defies commonly held beliefs about human nature.</p>
<p>If you have any further questions or requests you would like to pose before filling out the questionnaire I'd gladly answer them.</p>
<p>you can write to: taklung@gmx.net (I check this e-mail address regularly)</p>
<p><b>Questionnaire:</b></p>
<p>Please answer the following questions by either inserting the answers or sending them to me via e-mail. (*are not necessarily required).</p>
<p>Name*: Age*: Nationality*:</p>
<p>1. How long have you been contributing to Wikipedia?</p>
<p>2. Have you or are you planning to donate money to the Wikipedia cause?</p>
<p>3. When you first heard of Wikipedia and the concepts it is based on, what did you think about it and did you believe it could work? What do you think now?</p>
<p>4. Why do you think people contribute to Wikipedia? With it being voluntary what interests do/did you follow when contributing to Wikipedia?</p>
<p>5. Do you think that Wikipedia appeals to Altruism? If yes, do you think such a thing can exist in our society in which greed and consumption apparently drive the world?</p>
<p>6. What do you think makes Wikipedia most beneficial to society?</p>
<p>Further comments*:</p>
<p>With kind regards,</p>

<p>Regarding User:203.26.177.2 and his... well, vandalizm, as I don't know how to label it. I agree that user maybe shouldn't be blocked, but I just don't know what to do now. User has this <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Bosnians_9d97.html" title="List of Bosnians">List of Bosnians</a> project of his and he just adds the link to every page about Bosnians. Now, that's wrong, isn't it? I mean, we use Categories for that kind of stuff, right? So, what is to be done?

<dd>Hi there,</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am the mysterious and potentially troublesome user 203.26.177.2 - and not a "he", but a "she" (yes, there are some of us around&#160;:-))). Sorry for any problems I may have caused, I have been editing the List of Bosnians for a month or so, and have (naturally!) come across some interesting discussion re Ivo Andric and Josip Broz by inserting comments where relevant. And, yes, I have been adding links to the List of Bosnians as I wasn't aware of the categorisation rules and these just seemed like intuitive links to me (I'm a mad cross-referencer). I didn't know I was breaking some rules in the process, I am very, very new to this and don't really know what the rules and regulations are, so thanks for letting me know. Also, please feel free to leave me messages and I'll correct my conduct accordingly,&#160;:-). I didn't react to the first three 'vandalism' ones as I didn't think they had anything to do with me (it appears the above IP is also used by another person). Thanks! 01:58, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed you just blocked him for 3RR. I think this was appropriate, but I feel I should tell you that I just put up a user-conduct RfC for him. I wouldn't want him to be unable to respond due to a block. Thanks, <a href="../../../d/s/o/User%7EDsol_459f.html" title="User:Dsol">Dsol</a> 23:42, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Dsol,</dd>
<dd>If both you and <a href="../../../m/g/r/User%7EMgreenbe_c499.html" title="User:Mgreenbe">Mgreenbe</a> want me to unblock him, I can do so. However, the block is only for 24 hours, so I don't know whether it's necessary. A block often gives users a chance to reassess the situation and potentially come back calmer and less trigger-happy.</dd>
<dd>I hope the RFC goes smoothly, and I had previously suggested to the user that he could post his own RFC on the article if he truly believed the article was POV as it stood. — <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos"><font color="#808080">Talk</font></a> <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_RFC_4482.html" title="User:Asbestos/RFC"><font color="#808080"><small>(RFC)</small></font></a> 01:04, 17 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oops, as you can see below, I just suggested the same thing. I'll unblock him, which of course should not be seen as an endorsement of his behavior. Even at 24 hours, it seems unnecessarily brutal to submit an RfC when he can't even respond. (Even if the circumstances were accidental...) <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange">Brighterorange</a> 02:37, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hey. Would you mind if I unblocked User:69.253.195.228, whom you blocked today under 3RR? I totally agree with the block, and would have done it myself, but it rather unfortunately coincides with an <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_69.253.195.228_2137.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/69.253.195.228">RfC</a> just made about his behavior. It would make sense if he were able to respond to the RFC, which is not possible when blocked. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange">Brighterorange</a> 02:35, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for the note regarding the mediation of this... I think it would be best to carry on with the formal mediation, instead of through the Cabal; firstly due to the fact that this route has been first to respond, and secondly as I don't want to step on any toes (any further) by going down a route opposite to what Sanhedrin chose. <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowardBerry_fa68.html" title="User:HowardBerry">HowardBerry</a> 22:10, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey, no problem&#160;:) It's my fault, since I hadn't noticed yet the generally accepted practice of responding to talk page comments on the other person's page rather than your own - I guess the cheery "New Messages!" notification is more important than "threaded" continuity.

<p>The article has since been rewritten, mooting many of the specific points raised by Marshill.

<p>Hello, I'm just checking to make sure you're active. I'm checking with all the mediators listed as active to make sure they are truly active and ready to take a case. Reply at my talk page ASAP&#160;:) <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">Redwolf24</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedwolf24_1e7b.html" title="User talk:Redwolf24">talk</a>) 04:08, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I had been asking for updates for quite some time on the mailing list, and never got any. I can only assume the cases are all inactive, which is why I scraped the page. If anyone's case is still active, they can put it back and let me know. I was offended by your vote suggesting I'm only doing this to boost my wikiresumé. I've long been annoyed at how we didn't have an active mediation system, and the medcab was a great idea. I've been largely inactive for some time, and I had time to assign cases, but not mediate, as assigning is quite easy - point and shoot. In the formal cases I've taken, I've found I'm not the best mediator, which is why I only take a case after everyone else. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">Redwolf24</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedwolf24_1e7b.html" title="User talk:Redwolf24">talk</a>) 03:38, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
