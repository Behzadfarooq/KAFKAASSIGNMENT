<p>Thank you for your improvements to <a href="../../../y/i/t/Yitzhak_Rabin_assassination_conspiracy_theories_184b.html" title="Yitzhak Rabin assassination conspiracy theories">Yitzhak Rabin assassination conspiracy theories</a>. It is sort of a contested article, although at present far less than in the recent past. Your edits improved the quality of the entry.

<dd>I have tried to leave myself out of the controversy, and concentrate only on the grammer. Where possible, I even tried to reduce the controversy, by writting "crime scene" so that there would not be a need to argue whether it was the "assassination site" or the "murder site". Note that my edits were only a "first step" at improving the article. The article is very poorly written (from a grammer point of view, I have nothing to say about the content, as I am not familir with the conspiracy theories). --<a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbl_629a.html" title="User:Asbl">Asbl</a> 20:07, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with your changes and the previous poor quality. I have mostly safeguarded it against POV, but there was that too in the itemized list. We sort of neutralized it with a disclaimer at the beginning of the list. Your edits may reduce the amount of times I have to change it. The significant development was that the main POV pusher has found different interests after his very embarrassing appearance on a right-wing Israeli TV program. You are most welcome to continue!

<dd>Shouldn't the information about the main person advocating the conspiracy theories having an embarrasing appearance on the Israeli TV be included in the article?

<dd>He confessed to visiting the interviewer several times in New York after receiving payment from the FBI to make these visits. I don't know if this person himself is notable. He may be. He is mentioned without his name in some article, but his name is on all talk pages of Rabin murder associated pages, all over the globe. He sued Shimon Peres and was interviewed by the press. I guess that would make him notable. Regards, <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 20:32, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Don't make accusations of bad faith in edit summaries. Do so in talk pages, and even then, only when you have substantial evidence. <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">Assume good faith</a> at all times. ZeroFaults' dissenting comments have all been reasonable and constructive, even if you disagree with the content, and to label his reversions as bad faith is not only against WP policy, it also makes you look arrogant and bullying. COntinuing this sort of slander has gotten people banned, so I would advise you to not make a habit of making such strong accusations in edit summaries. It's underhanded and bordering on a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a>.

<dd>No, deleting a paragraph whose deletion is disputed is certainly acting in bad faith. ZeroFaults (and yourself) certainly know that the deletion is controversial, so deleting before getting an agreement is in bad faith.</dd>

<dd>Don't misunderstand me; I'm not threatening to get you banned. I don't want you to get banned. I want to resolve the Coulter dispute fairly. Although I thought my comment was neutral enough, I still apologize if I came off as attempting to intimidate you. I as just pointing out that that sort of activity has lead to banning in the past. Regarding Fault's (and my own0 faith, we're doing nothing different than what you're doing. We're all reverting here; no one is more wrong or right than another. And even if you think what we're doing is a bad decision, that doesn't mean it's in bad faith. I honestly encourage you to read <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and learn the difference between a bad edit and a bad faith edit.

<p>"A) Voting is not exactly political activism"</p>
<p>It's <b>ACTIVITY</b>, not activism. If you are going to revert reasonable edits, it would help us all if you would read them first.</p>
<p>"B) it is a controversy, as I would imagine she thinks she did nothing wrong"</p>
<p>Please try hard to keep your imagination out of the encyclopedia. We are reporting on facts here, not people's imaginings. It sure would be nice to have some rational idea of why voting doesn't belong under political activity. I'm trying to make a better article here, and you seem to want to make everything into a controversy.</p>
<p>It would also be nice to have some justification for "characteristic caustic wit" as extreme POV.</p>
<p>I believe you are absolutely wrong on both these things. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 21:12, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Voting is also not a political activity. It is a civic responsibility</li>
<li>Did she admit she did something wrong? If not we must presume that she is innocent (and that she thinks she is innocent).</li>
<li>Let me get this right: Are you trying to argue that "characteristic caustic wit" is not an opinion, but a fact?</li>

<p>I can see you have some talent for organizing written material, and you've used it well in the past.</p>
<p>But in the case of the Coulter biography, I think you mucked up the article. First of all you inserted a subheading. As a general rule of composition if there are any subheadings, there need to be at least two. If there's only one, it should be gotten rid of.</p>
<p>Second of all, IMHO there wasn't any real need for a subheading -- the Biography section flowed nicely from birth through legal career, with an insignificant but interesting item at the end -- the stuff about the Grateful Dead. There certainly isn't any need for a second or third subheading.</p>
<p>Third of all, now that the subheading is in there, the stuff about the Dead is in the middle of the biography, where it interrupts the flow through time.</p>
<p>IMHO you ought to put the bio back the way it was. If you don't, you ought to remove the Dead stuff. (If you put it at the end, it won't match the subhead, will it? If you leave it where it is, the section has a stone in its shoe.)</p>

<dd>I was afraid of that. Now we have a subheading for a one-sentence section. The way to make most writing better is to <i>eliminate</i> stuff, not to <i>add</i> it. And being a fan of a band isn't exactly a "Hobby." Try getting rid of the subheads and see if it doesn't look better. If you don't think that it does, look at it again. If you <i>still</i> don't think it does, start thinking that you <i>may</i> just be out of step with the rest of the world, which basically reserves subheads for breaking up large blocks of text. (PS - Have you ever looked at the Chicago Manual of Style? It's a REALLY good book on subjects like this.) <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 05:48, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

Morrow (<a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmorrow_1f6d.html" title="User:Amorrow">User:Amorrow</a>). The IP address isn't banned, but it can be temporarily blocked since it's used by a <i>person</i> who is banned.

<dd>I read your comments on the talk page, and disagreed with them. You seem to have a pattern of only removing unsourced information that is negative to Coulter and leaving positive unsourced information alone. If you think something needs to be better documented, please do a little google work and add the references to the article. --<a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbl_629a.html" title="User:Asbl">Asbl</a> 12:07, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First, removing poorly sourced negative information is perfectly in line with <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a>. I don't necessarily agree with such practices and believe that all unsourced information, positive or negative, should be removed but *if* anyone is engaging in such behavior then they're perfectly in line with a necessary policy. Second, while it would be ideal for anyone who sees some information lacking a source to "do a little google work and add the references" that simply is not practical. The burden to provide proof is on those who wish the information to be in the article and not on the passer-by who notices that the information is unsupported by evidence. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 14:58, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree with you. The policy <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_Good_Faith_ad0e.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume Good Faith">Wikipedia:Assume Good Faith</a> states "assume that others are trying to help Wikipedia rather than harm it, unless there is clear and present evidence to the contrary."

<p>Sorry to disagree with you yet again, but I believe information should not be removed, unless it is not possible to verify. Therefore, I believe the burden is on the person who would like to remove information to do some minimal google work and check verifiability. Otherwise, arbitrarily removing information that is not properly referenced violates the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_Good_Faith_ad0e.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume Good Faith">Assume Good Faith</a> policy. In the case of what I'm seeing with <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Coulter_3c97.html" title="Ann Coulter">Ann Coulter</a>, there are some editors who are on a crusade to remove information unfavorable to Coulter but maintain favorable information. --<a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbl_629a.html" title="User:Asbl">Asbl</a> 15:57, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I still insist that this is unworkable. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> clearly states that "any unsourced material may be challenged and removed." It further states that "editors adding new material to an article should cite a reputable source, or it may be removed by any editor" and "the obligation to provide a reputable source lies with the editors wishing to include the material, not on those seeking to remove it."</dd>
<dd>Further, removal of unsourced material is in no way an assumption of bad faith. When I remove information (which I tend to do only in biographies of living persons or in extreme cases - I much prefer to tag with {{fact}} or discuss it in Talk) I am making no assumptions about the editor(s) who added the information. I am merely removing unsourced information. It may be true and it may be false but the criteria for removal in that instance is that it is unsourced. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 16:10, 25 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I like your approach of adding the template {{fact}}, which assumes that the information is true, but states that you would like to see a reference. I wish more editors would use it, rather than arbitrarily removing information.</dd>
<dd>I still maintain that removing unsourced information is assuming that the unsourced information is incorrect (and hence, assumes that it was entered in bad faith). Whenever I see information that looks suspicious, I first try to check on google, and only if I cannot find anything to support it, do I remove the suspicious information (with an edit summary that I tried but could not verify). Of course, I do not spend too much time. If after the first 20 or so hits nothing relevant comes up, I will shift the burden to the person who wrote the information in question.</dd>

<p>Much better. That's a reasonable assumption based on the statements on that, ugh, blog. I'll let that float, for now.

<dd>I would agree with you that Badnarik's personal blog would not meet the reliable sources criteria for current events, but I would think that it would be a reasonably reliable source for the purpose of quoting Badnarik himself. --<a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbl_629a.html" title="User:Asbl">Asbl</a> 17:50, 25 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>WP:RS doesn't make any distinction between what is a reliable source for a current event and what is a reliable source for something that occured in the past. A personal blog is not reliable due to it not being subject to any sort of editorial review. Anyone can make a blog, simply because Badnarik is a politician doesn't make his blog any more reliable, if anything, it demands closer checking. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 17:59, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You lost me. Why is Badnarik's blog not reliable to as a source for his quotes? His freedom of speech allows him to say anything he wants without the need for "editorial review". He better be careful what he says, though, because it can then be requoted, as we are doing here on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbl_629a.html" title="User:Asbl">Asbl</a> 18:04, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Pardon me for this:</dd>
<dd>"Personal websites, blogs, and other self-published or vanity publications should not be used as secondary sources.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That is, they should not be used as sources of information about a person or topic other than the owner of the website, or author of the book. The reason personal websites are not used as secondary sources — and as primary sources only with great caution and not as a sole source if the subject is controversial — is that they are usually created by unknown individuals who have no one checking their work. They may be uninformed, misled, pushing an agenda, sloppy, relying on rumor and suspicion, or even insane; or they may be intelligent, careful people sharing their knowledge with the world. Only with independent verification by other sources not holding the same POV is it possible to determine the difference."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Using Badnarik's blog as a source on an article not directly about him fails to meet WP:RS review because he, as you said, can say anything he wants without "editorial review". <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 18:32, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Whatever happened to AGF? I still assume it for you, and would appreciate it if you do likewise for me. I am not a fan of Coulter, but I am a very enthusiastic 'fan' of WP and its rules and policies. As I explained in the Talk page, we are not allowed to perform <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, and to me, having watched that video segment, it seems that Coulter tries to respond, cannot get a word in edgewise, then jokingly asks 'can I leave?' etc. However, my impression is <i>my</i> impression, i.e. OR, and hence inadmissible. Similarly any other interpretation, unless it comes from a reliable and neutral source like a big media outlet. If you follow my edits you will notice that I have only one POV and one favorite - WP. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 19:17, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am terribly sorry. I confused you with another user who has numbers at the end of his/her username. Nonetheless, I still think your interpretation that Coulter was joking is off the wall. Coulter should be used to this style of debate, as it is very common on Fox News. She never came to the defense of the other guest (Michael Brown) who was treated the exact same way. --<a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbl_629a.html" title="User:Asbl">Asbl</a> 19:25, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your apology noted and accepted. I think you are right that as a pro she should have expected a rough ride on this type of show, but her point was that with the previous host she was afforded a chance to reply, whereas here with the sub she was being filibustered. Maybe I am 'off the wall' as you say, but the way I read her demeanor and body language is that she was overall at ease and just joking. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 19:57, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I saw how you want to change things at the Hebrew Wikipedia and I am interested in this too. I feel that the people running that place have totally lost sight of what <b>wiki</b>pedia is about. The situation there very much reminds me of "Animal Farm" just as it does to you and I've found another analogy which I find apt. If you watch <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>, you'll probably remember a character called <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Grimes_7a6b.html" title="Frank Grimes">Frank Grimes</a> affectionately nicknamed "Grimey" by <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homer_Simpson_8936.html" title="Homer Simpson">Homer Simpson</a>. In this episode you will see Frank talking to Lenny and Carl about their degrees in Nuclear Science, etc. and asking what sort of degree Homer has. They reply, "Oh, good old Homer, he didn't need a degree, he just showed up the day the plant opened!" I feel the case is very similar with David Shay and the rogue group who have taken control and feel they <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">own</a> wikipedia. Anyway, I think there's no need for me to go on as you know very well the sort of problems that site has and I hope you can join me in trying to fix it and bring this to the attention of people who can take care of it and bring it back to the values upon wikipedia was created. The big problem is that most of the people who can facilitate such a change do not speak Hebrew (Jimmy for example) however I feel there's a large enough group of respected administrators (and even a bureaucrat who works for the Wikimedia Foundation - Danny) that can take a look at the Hebrew Wikipedia and see it for all its faults. Hope you want to and can help.</p>

<p>By the way, I thought I should let it be known that I've been banned from that wikipedia. I didn't visit it for quite a few months until a few days ago when I opened up an entry for <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenna_Jameson_fd39.html" title="Jenna Jameson">Jenna Jameson</a> (I didn't remember exactly what their rules were regarding pornographic values) and I was banned with the reason being: חכם חנוכה. I of course don't know the guy and have no affiliation with him so this is absurd. What is even more absurd is they're breaking a very basic rule on all wiki projects which is the rule against censorship. They say entries about porn-related subjects have no place on wikipedia and when pointed to the English version they retort saying that the English version has a lot of junk (זבל - I suppose it's a harsher word than junk) entries basically confirming their elitist attitude. I don't care too much for porn (as can be seen by my contributions on the English version as I haven't edited any porn articles that I can recall but I feel very strongly that they do not have the right to ban all porn articles just because of their biased view, rejecting articles based on your opinion and not based on whether they fit the current guideline\criteria for being articles (notability, etc.) is completely NPOV and against the wikipedia spirit. Anyway I'm just rambling and ranting on and on about this subject because it really troubles me how bad the situation there is. Let me note that I do believe that most if not all of the administrators there (and the bureaucrat, it's weird that there's just one bureaucrat who I don't remember getting elected and couldn't find info about him being promoted on meta or on the Hebrew wikipedia) are intelligent people who create many valuable articles that are very well written. Also, two articles on the Hebrew wikipedia I think you should take a look at for their absurdity is <a href="../../../../he/%D7%93/%D7%95/%D7%93/%D7%93%D7%95%D7%93_%D7%A9%D7%99.html" class="extiw" title="he:דוד_שי">he:דוד שי</a> and <a href="../../../../he/%D7%95/%D7%A1/%D7%98/%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%94%D7%90%D7%9D_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%99%D7%98%D7%93.html" class="extiw" title="he:וסטהאם_יונייטד">he:וסטהאם יונייטד</a>. If you follow <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">football</a>, you'll know very well that using outdated methods created by the אקדמיה הלשונית is ridiculous in this case as there is hardly a living person that spells <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Ham_United_F.C._c452.html" title="West Ham United F.C.">West Ham United F.C.</a> that way (as a google search and opening up any newspaper in Israel will tell you). I don't think I need to explain why the David Shay article is out of place (although I'll give him credit for adding the "importance" template to the article). The only reason the article isn't deleted is because he's the bureaucrat and everybody wants to suck up to him and nobody wants to be remembered as the one who voted for deletion of the article about the bureaucrat. I'm also wondering whether you know if a bureaucrat is authorized by the Wikimedia Foundation to speak on its behalf in press interviews (דוד שי has represented the Hebrew Wikipedia in many interviews in the Israeli press, this is actually the only reason a google search on him returns any results, if you add -ויקיפדיה to the search terms he has under 1,000 results). Anyway as I said half a page earlier, I'm really just ranting and raving here as if its my own personal diary and I'm sure you agree with most of my claims. Please let me know if you're willing to help as how the state of the Hebrew Wikipedia has gotten to this is mind-boggling. <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonatanh_cbfb.html" title="User:Yonatanh">Yonatan</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yonatanh_afb0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yonatanh">contribs</a>/<a href="../../../y/o/n/User_talk%7EYonatanh_729d.html" title="User talk:Yonatanh">talk</a>) 10:53, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
