<p>Just to let you know that your photo <a href="../../../c/o/r/Image%7ECorncobs.jpg_3e52.html" title="Image:Corncobs.jpg">Image:Corncobs.jpg</a> is due to make an appearance as <a href="../../../p/i/c/Wikipedia%7EPicture_of_the_day_405e.html" title="Wikipedia:Picture of the day">Picture of the Day</a> on the 17th January.

<p>If you only need my permission to delete this page, then by all means go ahead. It started as a joke, and at one stage i did plan to develop it into a portal (wishful thinking), we even got 6 legitimate members! But you're right, I don't care about this page, you may do what you want to it. And I'm very glad the other page was removed, it was very inciteful and nasty and <a href="../../../c/o/g/User%7ECognition_c8b2.html" title="User:Cognition">User:Cognition</a> is quite obviously a closet stoner.

<p>Hi Asbestos, you were the first one to welcome me here some time ago. And I'd like to thank you again for your hospitality. I need some help.</p>
<p>You can find the problem where I need some help here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Neutral_point_of_view#HELP:__Meaning_of_NPOV_policy:_Proportion_of_representation_among_experts_OR_among_concerned_parties" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Neutral_point_of_view#HELP:__Meaning_of_NPOV_policy:_Proportion_of_representation_among_experts_OR_among_concerned_parties" rel="nofollow">NPOV policy on representation, the meaning of the conjunction "or"</a></p>
<p>I think those who answered me are not official administrators. And nobody has been able to answer my latest question on how my interpretation links up with NOR -- as these policies are supposed to be mutually linked. (I also posted this in the village pump and there was no response from any official. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28policy%29#Help:_Meaning_of_NPOV_policy:_Proportion_of_representation_among_experts_OR_among_concerned_parties" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28policy%29#Help:_Meaning_of_NPOV_policy:_Proportion_of_representation_among_experts_OR_among_concerned_parties" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Same thing happened at the help page.</p>
<p>I am quite convinced that my interpretation is the right one knowing the need for expertise in Wikipedia.</p>

<p>Yes, I cut and pasted and did some edits..so what? Like 10% of what I read at wikipedia has sections of articles that are copied verbatim from somewhere else. Wikipedia is about as pure as a backalley whore. If you hadn't have tagged it or I would have just reworded some of the headers, no one would have noticed, and therefore there would be no problem. Furthermore, by rendering the article uneditable, you are preventing changes from being made that would make it more to your liking. There shoud be no academic honor system in wikipedia because wikipedia is not even close to an astute academic foundation. Anyway just my opinion.--<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypergeometric2F1%28a%2Cb%2Cc%2Cx%29_a231.html" title="User:Hypergeometric2F1(a,b,c,x)">Hypergeometric2F1(a,b,c,x)</a> 05:12, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Asbestos! Thanks for the feedback on popular culture. A little explanation. I guess when I see "references in popular culture" in an article I get a bit prickly because popular culture is different in different parts of the world, and the phrasing doesn't seem to recognize that - I guess it seems like assumes that there IS only one kind of popular culture, because the references are pretty much always Anglo-Western. The way things are at the moment, it betrays that Wikipedia is less international than we'd all like. I guess by changing the phrasing I'm trying to recognize the slant rather than leave it as implicit. In fact the idea of including such references <i>at all</i> could possibly be seen as ethnocentric because I suspect they are a concern particular to Anglo-Americans. I had a debate with someone on the Lake Titicaca page about whether such references should be included at all in an encyclopedia article, but I gave up on that one because there seems to be a general consensus that it is. That debate is probably still there if you want to have a look. I guess because the vast majority of these references are American it gives the encyclopedia an American slant, and also makes it seem like such references are truly relevant to the subject being addressed in the article, and I personally think they aren't, fun though they may be for people who are familiar with the references. Also by including them in the article it implies that they are somehow as important as the real facts about the subject, and I think that can come across as patronizing, such as on the Lake Titicaca page, which might discourage non-Anglo-American contributors who hit a page on their area or culture, see a good portion of it devoted to American trivia and get turned off.</p>
<p>However - you are an administrator which means you understand Wikipedia policies way better than me, and I accept what you have told me, so I will stop changing that when I see it. That being said, do you have a page you could point me to where I could read something about Wikipedia's policies or approach on a) ethnocentrism, and b) (in)appropriate article content?</p>
<p>Also you don't need to go through my history - I've only changed it occasionally when I happened upon it, and haven't been at all systematic about it. You've probably hit upon them all already.</p>
<p>Thanks for the advice. You've made me look at it from a different point of view. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMona-Lynn_e37b.html" title="User:Mona-Lynn">Mona-Lynn</a> 20:21, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just had another idea - would you object to "references in international popular culture"? At least then that would recognize that there is also a local version of popular culture. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMona-Lynn_e37b.html" title="User:Mona-Lynn">Mona-Lynn</a> 20:23, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Asbestos - As an administrator I wonder whether you could give me a hand. When i first joined Wikipedia I created an account called Mona-lynn and made a few changes under that name, but then created another account, Mona-Lynn, to reflect the way I spell my name. That's the one I have been using ever since. Would you be able to put the "my contributions" history from Mona-lynn into Mona-Lynn, then delete Mona-lynn? i.e. merge the two accounts.

<p>I'm not the most experienced user but you seem to have some good vibes around here when it comes to disputes. May I ask if you could look over at the <a href="../../../r/a/n/Randal_McCloy_562e.html" title="Randal McCloy">Randal McCloy</a> talk page and the new edit war that appears to be developing under the "Hyperbaric section". An unsigned editer is inserting inappropriate and unsubstantiated information that is ruining the article. I'm not experienced enough to know the exact method for resolving this, but I can see when a issue is over the edge as this one is!

<td><b>Dear Fellow Mediators:</b>
<p>I'm writing to all mediators listed as active to point out several emergent issues that require the immediate attention of all active mediators. The Committee has come to a place where we can neither provide the function we were created to provide (timely formal mediaton for the English Wikipedia community) nor correct matters to be able to provide that function. In specific, we cannot perform any mediations, because most mediators are no longer taking cases, and we cannot add new mediators, because mediators are no longer responding to requests to join the Committee. I am in a place where I continually accept new cases for the committee, only to see them go stale after several months because there is no mediator willing to take it, and where I deny candidates a place on the committee because no mediator will speak up in support of them. I ask that all mediators take ten minutes to look over the following matters:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are <b>five requests</b> to join the Mediation Committee, three with no comments whatsoever, and two that have been up for more than a month without sufficient commentary to determine a consensus on promotion.

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There are <b>four</b> unassigned mediation cases, and will likely be at least two additional ones within the week.

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I beg, beseech, and pray each Mediator to please take a few moments to <b>at the very least</b> comment on the five candidates, and to consider taking one of the open cases. We are at a place where we are literally relying on the kindness of strangers: Almost all cases are being taken by non-Commitee volunteers at this point. Putting the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_mediation_Open_Tasks_311f.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for mediation/Open Tasks">open tasks page</a> (which only changes when we add a new case), and the main committee page on your watchlist so you will know when new nominations and cases are added, would go a long way to helping the Committee succeed. (If having the main page pop up on your watchlist every time someone else comments in a nomination is too annoying, I can move them to subpages like RFA, so that the page will only change when a new nomination is added.)</p>
<p>Additionally, I ask that all mediators check that they have a current email address subscribed to the Mediation Committee mailing list, mediation-l, to avoid the need for future talk page messages of this sort.</p>
<p>My apologies for having to air the committee's dirty laundry in this manner, but I fear it is the only way to get everyone together to bring the Committee back to life. For the convenience of those who simply cannot be involved due to time constraints, I will be listing those that do not participate in any Committee activities as <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Committee_9b92.html#Mediators_Emeriti" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Committee">mediators emeriti</a>, so that we have a clearer picture of who exactly we have available to take cases. I am, by separate posting, asking all mediators emeriti to return to actively participating in the requests to join the commmittee.</p>

I searched for Barry Zwicker before writing the article but it did not show up, presumably because the original article was in limbo over a deletion suggestion. By the way, what is the preferred way to answer an entry such as this one that you just made on my User Talk page?

<p>I see that you are on Speedy Deletion patrol. I have been working on a page that continuously gets a speedy deletion although it is neither patent nonsense nor pure vandalism. Is there a reason why this keeps happening? Does Speedy Deletion get abused? This is completely frustrating that people don't follow the rules.</p>
<p>Can you tell me what I did wrong? How can I update a article if it gets deleted in a split second?</p>
<p>The article I keep writing is "Byron Smith" a mountaineer from Canada that has made quite a bit of news recently in mountaineering. Google the name, it's the first to pop up.</p>

<p>Hi Asbestos! Thanks for your message.</p>
<p>You seem to be hinting that there's some hidden deletionist motive behind me reminding people that AfD is not a vote. If that were true, you'd have a good point. Unfortunately, I can show you plenty of incidences where I do this with people who are "voting" delete. And I can even point out one incidence where I've come down on a "neutral" "vote". The point, of course, is that the direction of the "vote" is irrelevant. The very act of "voting" is the problem.</p>
<p>Many people, both inclusionist and deletionist, vote on AfDs. They look at what others are saying and simply cast a vote for what the majority are feeling. Often this is done by without even bothering to read the article.</p>
<p>This then has an effect on newbies. They find the wonderful world of AfD and leap in with votes. They are told that it isn't a vote, it's a discussion, but they then point to other people on AfD and say "he's voting, she's using the word "vote", they're all saying it's a vote, why shouldn't I vote?". And thus AfD gets ever more broken.</p>
<p>AfD is broken. It doesn't scale. It often produces bizarro results. It can be a pitched battle. But it's all we've got - no-one has come up with a better system. In fact, AfD <i>is</i> the better system - better than the truly broken Votes for Deletion it replaced.</p>
<p>So we have to manage with what we have. What we have is a discussion forum about articles that may or may not be suitable for the encyclopedia. They require community discussion and a consensus to emerge. That consensus is what the closing admin acts upon.</p>
<p>If people are voting, then the admin can't see the consensus; all s/he can see is a tally of votes. AfD doesn't, however, work by a tally. The procedure for closing is complex - an admin reviews the opinions and discussion and takes action based on what the consensus seems to be, what seems right, what seems best, what works. In that context, votes are bad things. They obscure the function of AfD and the discussions. They make life harder for everyone.</p>
<p>So what's the solution? We're stuck with AfD, there's nothing to replace it. So we need to try to make it work better. There are a number of ways of doing that - people have been discussing them on WikiEN-l for a few weeks. The solution was easy: for people to stop bitching on WikiEN-l and to start acting. Stamp out the practice of saying "vote" and "voting". That stops newbies from being fooled. Stamp out voting itself: tell people the truth - if they "vote" without giving a good account of themselves <b>they will be ignored</b>. It's not too much to ask: why do you want this article to be deleted? Say something, add something to the conversation. Don't just vote - it adds nothing.</p>
<p>By policing AfD we start, if not fixing it, at least making it less broken. One day's worth of policing last week had a profound effect. People got very busy, altering their statements to remove the word "vote". Some AfDs were even withdrawn. The entire process, for about 48 hours, was slicker, easier and cleaner.</p>
<p>All from just putting an hour's work slapping people for saying "vote".</p>
<p>I apologise if I hurt your feelings when I slapped you for saying "vote". However, I'd hope you won't use it again, so perhaps I'm not <i>that</i> sorry&#160;;o) The newbie you talk about will never use the term again, either, I'd imagine. I no longer use the term. Other people are turning to each other and saying it on AfD, <i>"this isn't a vote"</i>. People today have changed their "vote" to a statement of their opinion.</p>
<p>This is all good. Honestly. And surprisingly well-thought-out. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 14:40, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ciao, ti scrivo in italiano visto che lo sai&#160;;-) ... gingiva è una variante antica e ormai in disuso per cui secondo me andrebbe sostituita nell'immagine. Ad ogni modo, prenditi il tempo necessario, non è urgente; ma credo che sia meglio che il lavoro lo faccia tu visto che probabilmente hai il <i>file</i> originario e il <i>font</i> giusto per riscrivere la parola.

<p>Hi! I understand u. The reason why i had started to write teh article is simple. We hear in the news and also in die discussions that Iran and Syria are involved in that conflict. We also read and see the Hisbollah has it's links to Syria and Iran and Iran and Syria have an active role. So I tried to write down what is pubished in science about that topic. How are the links between Syria, Iran and Hisbollah. What are the goals of the three and ´how is that part of the conflict look like. U can read it in the media and also in the political science books, btw i study that subject, that there is a triangle between Syria, Iran and Hisbollah which works also in the conflict. So I want to start to write down here the background of the three and what's written by different siencetests bout the conflict and the background. Someone said in the german wikipedia they want to delete it 2. Atm the majority say they should keep the article. Also in the german wikipedia atm there are persons who want to delete all parts of articles which descripe the conflict. They even wanted 2 delete the main article. Hope u will write back soon. --<a href="../../../j/a/p/User%7EJapan01_f443.html" title="User:Japan01">Japan01</a> 14:57, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Asbestos, it#s about the article bout Iran and Syria during the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict. In the german wikipedia. We have now a big article bout this. <a href="../../../../de/d/i/e/Die_Rolle_des_Iran_und_Syriens_im_Libanonkrieg_2006_1a6e.html" class="extiw" title="de:Die_Rolle_des_Iran_und_Syriens_im_Libanonkrieg_2006">Die Rolle des Iran und Syriens im Libanonkrieg 2006</a>. Perhaps you have some people in the english wikipedia who like 2 translate it, if u think u want to do it. In the german article we tried 2 write down what's with the 2 countries and the debate about these countries and their role in this conflict. The article was hard discused in the german wikipedia, but it survived 2 delete process. --<a href="../../../j/a/p/User%7EJapan01_f443.html" title="User:Japan01">Japan01</a> 03:24, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey there, my name is Nick, my username is Potters house and I have encountered a problem with trying to provide any information about Johnny Lee Clary. I have posted this post off to other staff members also. I am not sure if this is the best route to resolve this, but can think of no other way.</p>
<p>The article Johnny Lee Clary has been deleted. I have known Johnny through telephone conversations and email for a short time now (about 3-4 months). He recently came and shared his life story in for our church group for the first time just two weeks ago. Before I met Johnny I became interested in his story i.e. his conversion from the head of the KKK in the US, to being a Christian Minister who now teaches against race hate groups. I found the article <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Lee_Clary_510a.html" title="Johnny Lee Clary">Johnny Lee Clary</a> as it still is today, deleted, except for some small talk. If you read the talk you see what I have said at the time (notice I have gotten no reply, probable my fault as I don’t know heaps about WIKI policy). From my understanding Johnny Lee Clary was posting as The KingOfDixie and looks like he tried to change a few things on Wiki concerning the KKK. While this is a controversial subject, Johnny being the former leader of the KKK would probably know a thing or two and be able to contibute, but that’s another story. He eventually made an article about himself i.e. Johnny Lee Clary. Johnny being quite new to Wiki and ignorant of rules of conduct found himself at odds with some admins and had his site deleted.</p>
<p>[<i>section is entirely too long. cut</i>]</p>
<p>Also note his contributions: Featured articles: · African American literature -- My first featured article. Thanks to everyone who gave feedback. While I didn't start the article, I obsessed on it for an entire month and wrote most of the copy. · Ku Klux Klan -- I began work on this article after it became a featured article. Since then I've mediated several editorial disputes on the article (including one of which kept the article from being delisted as a FA) and made a large number of edits. <a href="../../../p/o/t/User%7EPotters_house_0b0e.html" title="User:Potters house">Potters house</a> 00:11, 27 July 2006 (UTC) Nick.</p>

<dd>Thanks for weighing in on the talk page. With reference to the anon there: it's really frustrating that when one tries to be modest about barging into foreign-language Wikipedias, someone is always liable to say dismisively "see, he doesn't really know any French" (etc.). I can see why some people come in boasting and high-handed instead, just hoping to bull their way through. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 22:35, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm working in close conjunction with Dee Dee Warren who has done a lot of work to the Preterism entry. I have followed the protocol in the discussion page but now that I am trying to make an edit to the actual entry, it says I have been blacklisted. Could you please help?</p>
<p>I want to insert this entry AFTER the paragraph about Sub-variants</p>
<p>Since the late 1990s, some <b>Full Preterists</b> have been progressively trending toward a more universalistic conclusion wherein all people are ultimately redeemed via an application of the New Covenant to all people regardless of their actual profession of Christian faith. This trend is being fervently resisted by traditional Full Preterists.</p>
<p>P.S. I AM a Full Preterist so my critical comments about the trending of Full preterism are well founded, especially as documented in the talk page.</p>

<p>Did you see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Wesleyan_University&amp;diff=101596021&amp;oldid=94619700" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Wesleyan_University&amp;diff=101596021&amp;oldid=94619700" rel="nofollow">this</a>? Further suppression of evidence that a conflict ever occurred. The edit is by an account with no other edits, before or since. The edit summary is "user was removed per admin request", which I suspect is as misleading as much else that came from the same source. I agreed that anything that you and he-who-is-(by his own volition)-not-to-be-named agreed upon was OK with me, but: did you agree on this? - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 18:23, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
