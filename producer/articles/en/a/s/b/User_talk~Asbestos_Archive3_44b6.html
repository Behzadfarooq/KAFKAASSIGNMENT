<p>Hi, there's a new Solution E that's been proposed for the country infoboxes; I've changed my vote from the Solution D that I proposed, earlier. The new option, proposed by <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">User:Zocky</a>, transcludes a subpage instead of using the template mechanism for this.</p>
<p>See: <a href="../../../n/e/p/Nepal.html" title="Nepal">Nepal</a>'s infobox is implemented at Nepal/infobox using <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_Country_7f76.html" title="Template:Infobox Country">Template:Infobox_Country</a>; <a href="../../../t/u/v/Tuvalu.html" title="Tuvalu">Tuvalu</a>'s is implemented at Tuvalu/infobox as a wiki table.</p>

<p>I agree the phrasing of my vote may seem strange. It comes from the fact that VfD has only one of two outcomes - Delete or not ("Keep"). What happens after something is not deleted (say a merge and redirect) is secondary. I vote this way to ensure my vote is clear. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 19:05, 2005 Jan 20 (UTC)</p>

<p>Appreciate the kind greeting and the helpful links; I 'cut my teeth' on a miniWiki for the LiveJournal community <b>milliways_bar</b> so was somewhat familiar with the formatting before I plunged in here.</p>
<p>I do need some help, though -- I'm adding information to some pages linked to <a href="../../../s/a/i/Sailor_Moon_f7f9.html" title="Sailor Moon">Sailor_Moon</a>, and can't figure out how to add them to the section demarcated as SMoon inside a double pair of curly brackets. I finally got the category link sorted out, though (that was a little tricky, didn't expect it to be case-sensitive).</p>

<p>Hi Dbenbenn â thanks for merging the information in the articles to <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_Wesleyan_University_7bf4.html" title="Ohio Wesleyan University">Ohio Wesleyan University</a>. One question: several people (including myself) noted that the pages that were being voted on would have the wrong title even if kept ("<a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesleyan.html" title="Wesleyan">Wesleyan</a>" being the name of any number of different universities). As it is, these are the articles that have now been turned into redirects, and thus the redirects still have incorrect titles. Should I just go ahead and move them to their correct titles? Thanks, <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos"></a> â <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos">Talk</a> 23:42, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Asbestos, I think the easiest thing to do is just make redirects from whatever pages you think need them. Alternatively, you could move, for example, <a href="../../../e/l/l/Elliott_Hall%2C_Wesleyan_0875.html" title="Elliott Hall, Wesleyan">Elliott Hall, Wesleyan</a> to Elliott Hall, Ohio Wesleyan, but that would just result in a redirect at <a href="../../../e/l/l/Elliott_Hall%2C_Wesleyan_0875.html" title="Elliott Hall, Wesleyan">Elliott Hall, Wesleyan</a> pointing to Elliott Hall, Ohio Wesleyan. Redirects are cheap, so having a redirect from the wrong title isn't really a problem. Cheers, <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbenbenn_44bf.html" title="User:Dbenbenn">dbenbenn</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/e/User_talk%7EDbenbenn_8e6c.html" title="User talk:Dbenbenn">talk</a> 00:10, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Looking back at the VfD, you wrote "As far as I understand, a merge doesn't usually imply a redirect". I'm pretty sure that's wrong. The GFDL requires that if you merge text from X to Y, then you have to keep the page history of X. Thus, a vote of "merge and delete" just means "merge", because it <i>can't</i> be deleted after the merge. <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbenbenn_44bf.html" title="User:Dbenbenn">dbenbenn</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/e/User_talk%7EDbenbenn_8e6c.html" title="User talk:Dbenbenn">talk</a> 00:30, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I thought that you needed to have it explained why O'Hara and Bensley/Boyle are not considered suitable for inclusion in the article.</p>
<p>See the following for discussion on Bensley/Boyle:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Medical_analysis_of_circumcision/Archive_2#Bensley.2FBoyle_survey" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Medical_analysis_of_circumcision/Archive_2#Bensley.2FBoyle_survey" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Medical_analysis_of_circumcision/Archive_2#Bensley.2FBoyle_survey</a></p>
<p>For the simple explanation of why the O'Hara survey is unaccepatble see the last paragraph of that link.</p>
<p>I trust you will now let matters be and cease to try and force unscientific trash in Wikipedia articles. Thanking you in anticipation. - Robert the Bruce 20:42, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Asbestos, this is left in reply to a comment left on my user talk page.</p>
<p>I have no objections to the inclusion of the Cochrane HIV report (though I may have reservations over the wording - rather than a balanced report some individuals seem intent upon extracting the few sentences or partial sentences that support their POV). However, I do object to the O'Hara "study" being included - it's clearly nonsense, and the article is better off without it. <b>If</b> it must be referenced, I will ensure that the version you and I agreed upon is included rather than the wild anti-circ POV version.

<p>Hi Asbestos, I am Italian and I can guarantee you that espresso comes from <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_language.html" title="Latin language">Latin</a> <i>ex</i> <i>premÄre</i> (doh, I think); the <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_language.html" title="Italian language">Italian</a> verb <i>esprimere'</i>s past participle is indeed irregular and is "espresso". It is normally used in sentences as <i>Gli ho espresso le mie preoccupazioni</i> ("I expressed him my concers"), which is consistent with the idea of "getting something out". The irregularity is awkward since there are other similar verbs, as "premere" and "spremere" that have plain and regular past participles.</p>
<p>There is no immediate connection between <i>espresso</i> and speed, except express trains. However, these trains are no longer used in Italy anyway, since they changed the name to <a href="../../../i/n/t/InterCity_2842.html" title="InterCity">InterCity</a> in order to be more expensive.&#160;:-(</p>
<p>Express trains, in turn, got their name originally because they were "pushed" through less important stations, stopping only at larger hubs. <a href="../../../o/r/z/User%7EOrzetto_6421.html" title="User:Orzetto">Orzetto</a> 14:54, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

What you called vandalism was me reverting my contributions to this trashcan, because honestly I wont edit of a resource that finds fart fetishism a notable subject and rejects other truly notable subjects because most lousy perverted wikipedia users are narrow minded.<br />

The problem with this is that I have never, ever heard anyone refer to any person from the village of Apples as a "renard" (which is French and means "fox"). At best, this could be an in-joke.

<p>Sorry Man.... Did not know that "external links" to providers of the subject matter at hand counted as "spam" - Where are the rules of Wikipedia? Read about the site in the WSJ. BMI Gaming is the leading national provider of old video arcade games, and though we would be a good resource for those looking to purchase older games. We have be written about in the New York Times, Fortune Magazine, Wired, etc.... - <a href="../../../6/5/2E/User_talk%7E65.8.14.99.html" title="User talk:65.8.14.99">User talk:65.8.14.99</a> 10:21, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>After reading up on the guidelines of Wiki, we object to your categorization of our placing of external links in specific gaming categorys of unique and very hard to find products that we carry. Each and every catagory we have placed a link in we actually carry that title game for sale on our web site, www.bmigaming.com. BMI Gaming is the largest consumer provider of video arcade games and pinball machines in the nation, with over 500 arcade games for sale at any given time. We also host the world's largest showroom and museum of arcade games, with over 220 games set on free play in our showroom based in Boca Raton, FL. We have been written about in the New York Times, FORTUNE Magazine, Wired Magazine, The Robb Report, and countless other local and regional newspapers, in addition to national radio shows and PBS TV.</p>
<p>I would ask politely that you replace the hard work we tried to accomplice this evening, based on Wiki guidelines as set forth here, that we quickly found and read after receiving your messages about us "spamming" the site....</p>

<p>Reply to your post: What we are attempting to do is PERFECTLY FINE by the guidelines on the site. We are NOT "spamming", but very selectively placing one external link in gaming categories where we are experts in the subhect matter at hand.</p>
<p>It would appear from your actions and the guidelines there that you are imposing your own anti-capitalist or communistic views here, which go against the written guidelines stated above taken directly from this site, and denying anyone looking for arcade game information or to buy a game the right to make their own decision. We are NOT just a "e-commerce" site peddling wiggets, but a community, with over 400 pages and over 750,000 words in our web site, with many informative articles about how to buy a machines, how to ship a machine, what to look for in a machine, machine details, pictures, production dates and amounts, game features, gameroom planning information and much more. We are the LEADING RESOURCE on the web and in our local area for people interested in considering arcade games for the home, and by that definition, we should be more than entitled to place strategic links to our site anywhere there is synergy with the subject matter at hand (arcade games) and our expertise in the subject matter. If you have a legitimate complaint, thats another matter. User:65.8.14.99 (Dave) 11:00, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Sam..</p>
<p>So what exactly is your personal defination of "arbritrary links" in the context of your email comments below? Because Wiki sure does not have one, at least where I have read - Perhaps you might send me the link to it please.</p>
<p>Also, you point out below&#160;: "Linking the article "Joust", for instance, toan _informative_, non-commercial article on your site _might_ be within the external linking policy" (sic) -</p>
<p>Sam, have you ever READ Wiki's "external linking policy" or is this just more your bullshit, anti-capitalist office clerk mentality behavioral pattern intended to foster your own self-esteem? You most definitely have NO clue whatsoever as to what Wiki really is about, at least by your offering up your utterly stupid comment that "Wikipedia is about creating an encyclopedia" - Especially then Wiki SPECIFICALLY goes out of its way to state that it is NOT an encyclopedia... Or did do you miss that part in "administer" training? ( Also, for my records, what other two administrators did you "consult" with on this issue? (I saw one above from "Jmabel", who I would take does not have a clue about video arcade games, or us for that matter, or about the published Wiki policy on commercial links) - I have a friend or two here that I would like to discuss your reacent actions with before moving furthur into it.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>yes I do think its good information, collectors use the information as well as the print run information to try and date their MÃ¤rklin equipment. I am hoping that others will add the actual date ranges to the article to improve the accuracy of dating an item.</p>
<p>Regarding the images, I thought that checking the box on the upload page would indicate the rights stuff - so I will go and look at that again and try to add the info. I took them all and am happy to put them into the Public Domain...</p>

<p>Thanks for the tip on templates. I made those changes. It will save me a few seconds of OpenInNewWindow/Copy/Paste time from now on.

<dd>Follow-up Q on templates... I have them working fine, although I find they're prone to edits by other users. For example, I post {{User:Feco/cats}} on someone's talk page. If they click the EDIT link by that section, it launches the editor on my template. I tried sticking a __NOEDITSECTION__ on my templates, but that doesn't seem to help.

<p>There are only a few schools that offer that major, my school cmu being one, and I didnt think wesly did. How did you major there? Were there any job openings after that or did you have to go to grad school?</p>

<dd>You're right, actually. Wesleyan doesn't have a cognitive science major. I had to apply and design it myself, doing what they call a "University Major." It was nice as it meant that I could pick and choose all the interesting classes out of Neurobiology, Philosophy and Psychology, without taking otherwise-required large introductory classes.</dd>
<dd>As for jobs â I didn't even look. At the time I wasn't interested in a job in cog sci, and went straight to grad school to study AI. Now, who knows?

<p>I actually don't have to book, it was cited by a man who contributed this story to another book and cited this book as his reference. As far as what he took from the book I don't know. The only sentences word for word I used are the quotes by reporters. I added my own historical information and topic headings that he didn't have. I borrowed a few adverbs, but not one sentence is 'word for word'. Admittedly, it is not a standard encyclopedic type entry, I really don't know how to make it otherwise. Actually if you read it carefully, you will probably find many grammatical errors, as generally I tend to ignore grammar, and let others fix it. Also the word "incredible" one dictionary definition of this word is 'something hard to believe', so it really isn't an opinion word the way I'm using it.

<p>This will all be moot Sunday,but I still firmly disagree with your position on what is more speculative/realistic.To assume that a man given five days to undergo a ceremony can replace that ceremony and come up with a very expensive central item for the replacement ceremony--which is what the text you retain suggests-- is <i>extremely</i> speculative.That his cited traditionalism may manifest itself in a commitment to restore the Coronation as at least an option for future Popes,as I suggest in the text you have deleted twice,is clearly,as I state,<i>more likely</i>.--Louis Epstein/le@put.com/<a href="../../../1/2/2E/User%7E12.144.5.2.html" title="User:12.144.5.2">12.144.5.2</a> 18:31, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I believe that your vote in Survey_on_Style-Prefixed_Honorary_Titles does not match the comments you make in explanation. The option you vote for is to prefix <b>all</b> known styles--including those of "any random person" (e.g. the fringe anti-Popes).

<p>Hi Asbestos,</p>
<p>There hasn't been much sustained interest in the bootcamp. On a few occasions there have been gatherings there to cover specific topics, and for a while there were weekly meetings on Thursdays. What I found is that people would occasionally pop into the IRC channel during the day, but unless there was an announcement in other IRC chans, nobody would show up. The bootcamps we had were full of non-newbies who were curious (and often learned something)... maybe we need something else for the true newbs? I wonder if I should just cancel the whole thing. <a href="../../../s/j/_/User%7ESj_7824.html" title="User:Sj">+sj</a> <a href="../../../s/j/_/User_talk%7ESj_d037.html" title="User talk:Sj"><font color="#FF6996">+</font></a> 20:04, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>His belief <i>iii</i> is correct, not incorrect. He was asking people not to vote their true preferences, i.e., to prevent <b>any option but A</b> from winning, by voting dishonest preferences for B, C, D, in order to block Z. Votes for B, C, D will not block Z. A vote for <b>A and only A</b> is a vote against Z, a vote for <i>A&gt;B&gt;C&gt;D&gt;Z</i> is also a vote against Z, accorded no greater weight for having ranked B, C and D. His mistaken belief that the system could be gamed in this way is not the point, except insofar as it demonstrated a flaw in the <i>Debian modification</i> of CSSD. Asking people not to vote their true preferences is asking them to vote dishonestly, whatever his motivations may have been and however ill-founded his expectations.</p>
<p>And yes, I was angry, but I am not made to feel he acted in good faith simply because he was in error about the consequence. I gladly assume good faith where an advocation to dishonesty is not made.

<dd>I can't help but think it a little hypocritical, though, that you and Lulu appear to be discussing votes that you state are not your actual preferences, while criticizing Jtdirl for suggesting that other people do the same. Changing your vote "to try to avoid an inconclusive survey result" may be laudable, but above you note that not voting your true preferences is voting dishonestly, and it is on this categorical principle that you have attacked Jtdirl. As both sets of actions are designed to influence the survey by not voting for one's true preference, but instead by calculating the effect of a ranking on the over-all outcome, I can't help but notice a level of hypocrisy in your attacks.</dd>
<dd>FWIW, though, I've changed my votes so that 3&gt;1: Options 1 and 2 are clearly illogical and I freely admit that I don't know what I was thinking. â <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos"><font color="#808080">Talk</font></a> 21:04, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would note, Asbestos, that I disagreed with Whig's suggestion that Jtdirl acted inappropriately in encouraging voters to complete their preferences. And on my User:talk page, I stated that I also felt that Whig's suggestion seemed to be for tactical voting (and I did not change my vote in accordance with Whig's recommendation). That said, I don't really think there is anything <i>wrong</i> with tactical voting as a matter of principle. So while Jtdirl was not wrong, neither is Whig, really. That said, my own vote now reflects my actual preference (and has all along, though I had a slight change of opinion along the way on the merits of alternatives 4 and 3; my first two preferences either way though). <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 22:20, 2005 May 12 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, firstly apologies for the anon edit, my PC has got a virus, have to access internet from safe mode, forgot to log in.</p>
<p>Thanks for your involvement, the reason i have had to relentlessy revert is because Argy edits have turned a relatively neutral article into a list of legal rulings with no analysis, insulting language to Turkish Cypriots and downright lies. He has made no compromises while i have reworded my edits to get him to stop reverting. He has discounted my sources (even though their the same as his!), he has listed a section of human right abuses by Turks, but refuses any wrongdoing was done unto Turks. I would be glad to be rid of this article, but it seems, with the exception of rather good anon edits today and Schnuder, that no one is interested in balancing and removing his insulting POV's.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I can't comment on the article at hand, knowing very little about it. What you could do, however, would be to list the article at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comment</a> (under <i>Article content disputes</i>), and place a notice in the article's talk page saying that you have done so.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>A very qualified user is producing an excellent and impartial article on the Cyprus conflict, user Argyrosargyrou is again filling it with hate filled drivel. Is there no way to stop him? Im not too clued up on procedures in Wikipedia. Thanks. --<a href="../../../e/2E/a/User%7EE.A_0364.html" title="User:E.A">E.A</a> 15:33, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Asbestos,</p>
<p>I've just closed the <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_picture_candidates_Flaming_poi_74f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured picture candidates/Flaming poi">FPC vote</a> on your photo <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlamingPoi.jpg_449c.html" title="Image:FlamingPoi.jpg">Image:FlamingPoi.jpg</a>. It ended up not getting promoted, which I feel is a shame. I must admit I hadn't noticed that tide had turned with the later 'no' votes. However most of these were technical concerns over compression artifacts â I think they were worrying about the blockiness and checkerboard patterns in the dark orange/black regions bordering the flames.</p>
<p>It may be possible to fix this with a less compressed version of the photo then renominating it for FPC in a month or so. Let me know if I can help. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 06:17, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
