<p>Also, that disambiguation that you claimed you were doing...it doesn't really make sense, you changed Wesleyan to Methodism...how many people do you think would have been confused with going to the Wesleyan page, where references are MOSTLY about the doctrine, not some school in CT, which in fact has nothing to do with Methodism these days AT ALL! People are smart enough to realize that when the sentence read "The Church is firmly <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesleyan.html" title="Wesleyan">Wesleyan</a>", it is not about a CT school but about the doctrine.</p>

I POSTED THE SAME THING TO YOUR WESLEYAN BUDDY, JMABEL, BY I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU THE SAME THING SINCE I DON'T MEAN TO WASTE TOO MUCH TIME ON THAT IN THE FUTURE.</p>
<p>YOU ARE APPARENTLY BOTH ALUMNI OF WESLEYAN (CT). THIS MAKES YOU BOTH BIASED EDITORS ON THE ISSUE. COULD YOU PLEASE STOP CHANGING THE ENTRY UNDER WESLEYAN? WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE TO YOU IF IT IS WESLEYAN (CT) OR WESLEYAN (OH) THAT APPEARS FIRST? TO ME? WELL, THAT'S HOW IT APPEARED ORIGINALLY AND I BELIEVE ANY CLAIM AGAINST THE OPPOSITE IS NOT REALLY STRONG. AND SINCE IT IS NOT WELL-JUSTIFIED, GOOD MANNERS DICTATE TO LEAVE AS IT WAS. IF YOU WISH TO LEAVE THE REALM OF GOOD MANNERS, THEN I AM AFRAID IT MAY GET A BIT MORE UGLY. DO YOU REALLY WANT THAT?</p>

<dd>The preceding unsigned (and vaguely threatening) post, and the one above it, were by User:Ranamim (Talk), and refer to discussions on <a href="../../../w/e/s/Talk%7EWesleyan_cef2.html" title="Talk:Wesleyan">Talk:Wesleyan</a>. I've responded on User Talk:Ranamim. The reference to "my buddy" <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">User:Jmabel</a> is apparently in anger over the fact that neither of us agree with his position on <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesleyan.html" title="Wesleyan">Wesleyan</a>. --Asb</dd>

Hey Asbestos,</p>
<p>I think your time will be well-utilized if you add the letters in the word Wesleyan and then link them all to your university by saying that they appear in the name of your university. I am sure your buddy Jmabel will enthusiastically endorse such a worthy cause. How close is that to linking the name of a band that nobody really has heard about and perhaps no one really cares about to the page for Wesleyan University? That's what I deleted. Garbage surely deserves deletion more than info about people that have made significant contributions to society. Feel free to check the additions (claimed to be copyrighted) now. The facts are borrowed, but the text is different, not what you listed from google.com. This is remarkable that you decided to spend a lot of time looking for pages on google.com. It should say something about the opportunity cost of your time.</p>
<p>Take care,</p>
<p>-Ranamim (otherwise known as the 14-year-old hacker)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is in anger over my asking him not to copy-and-paste articles from the internet in an effort to boost the links to his Ohio Wesleayn page. He has thankfully since edited those articles, though appears to be implying here that there never were any copyright issues. --Asb</dd>

"I'm afraid that I am at a loss in understanding what you are accusing me of. --Asbestos 13:16, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)"</p>
<p>Well, I don't know what to say. It seemed pretty clear to me but I guess I didn't make it quite that clear. Perhaps I should ask you if you are a programmer in Washington as well?</p>
<p>-Ranamim</p>

<dd>Again, unfortunate refusal to describe what he meant in his first post, and what appears to be an apparently random reference to Jmabel. --Asb</dd>

Dude, go check out his page. I don't how one say something without insulting your intelligence when you say "I asked Jmabel to see if he could provide a third opinion in our edit war" and Jmabel just so happens to be a graduate of Wesleyan (CT) as well. What would a smart man expect his response to be? Oh, well, let's keep it how Asbestos wants it. Surprise, surprise that he, oh-so-kindly did so!!! And I don't mean to answer anything about the the copyright issue of the Ohio Wesleyan emblem. The case is absulutely the same as the one with your emblem except that unlike you I didn't copy it from the OWU site. I seriously don't mean to waste time explaining something like this to you. And also, I certainly don't mean to keep rubbish on my discussion page (your reference to Jbamel's entry) when I don't need to. Thanks.</p>

<p>I'm sorry if I stepped into the middle of something - I saw that an anon had copied and pasted the content of <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesleyan_University_934b.html" title="Wesleyan University">Wesleyan University</a> to <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesleyan_University_%28Connecticut%29_d197.html" title="Wesleyan University (Connecticut)">Wesleyan University (Connecticut)</a> and made the former a disambig, so I reverted the removal of content, deleted <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesleyan_University_%28Connecticut%29_d197.html" title="Wesleyan University (Connecticut)">Wesleyan University (Connecticut)</a>, moved the former to the latter to preserve the edit history, and re-inserted the disambig at the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesleyan_University_934b.html" title="Wesleyan University">Wesleyan University</a>. I have no idea of the relative notability of either university - I was just cleaning up after someone I thought was a confused but well-meaning newbie. Please tell me if you need me to delete <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesleyan_University_934b.html" title="Wesleyan University">Wesleyan University</a> to move the page back to its original location - I haven't followed the debate at all. [[User:Rdsmith4|User:Rdsmith4/sig]] 01:32, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've moved the article about Wesleyan in Connecticut back to <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesleyan_University_934b.html" title="Wesleyan University">Wesleyan University</a> and added a notice at the top which links to <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesleyan_University_%28Philippines%29_4a5d.html" title="Wesleyan University (Philippines)">Wesleyan University (Philippines)</a>. I hope that's OK. [[User:Rdsmith4|User:Rdsmith4/sig]] 01:50, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Various vandals had moved <a href="../../../w/e/s/Talk%7EWesleyan_University_c80a.html" title="Talk:Wesleyan University">Talk:Wesleyan University</a> to Wesleyan University disambig, so I moved it back to where it belongs. Also, someone had removed the entire content of the talk page and replaced it with his comment, so I restored the content and added his comment at the bottom. As for mediation and whatnot - see <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">Wikipedia:Dispute resolution</a>, but such page moves as I have just been sorting out are no more than vandalism. If anyone moves any of these pages to nonsensical titles again, just tell an admin and the vandal can be blocked. Otherwise, the proper order of dispute resolution is mediation before arbitration. Good luck. [[User:Rdsmith4|User:Rdsmith4/sig]] 02:21, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Copied from another page:</p>
<p>What do you want? I don't understand. I can no longer edit with my old username because your friend, rrickK, who I wouldn't say anything about banned my IP (strangely, it happens so often, there is another request about him on this very page). He did me a favor because I don't wish to spend too much time here. (I wish I were at Edinburgh University to have more time to do so, though) And frankly, like I pointed earlier, communicating with you is not worth my time. If this is insulting to you, I am sorry. This is not a perfect world. We all make decisions based on some rationales. Simply put, I prefer to optimally allocate my time among activites that benefit me the most. That includes not communicating with people to whom I have to constantly explain my logic or actions which seem transparent to people of the level of intelligence that I normally surround myself with. A sufficient number of your comments have solidified my opinion about you. At some point your called that "hatred" or whatnot...well, yes, I do not like dumb people. Your web page's profile added additional evidence to my suspicions. So, that's it. You are Ranamim-free. Go, make the world ....a "better" place. And all the people who I commented about (according to you "insulted") happened to be graduates of the same university over a dispute for pages of THAT university. It is called conflict of interest. I think it is now resolved, so I am back to contributing where I normally do and you to whatever makes you happy. And if you prefer to waste with some requests for mediations and whatever else you like...go ahead. In economics (game theory), it is called Signalling. I take it to be a reflection of the almost non-existent opportunity cost of your time which only strengthens my opinions about you as noted above. But don't expect me to engage in some kind of lengthy polemic about numerous issues. It won't happen.</p>
<p>Ranamim</p>
<hr />
<p>Yes, the RfM is now moot. For your future knowledge -- and I'm not expert on this, never been through this, this is my understanding -- signing on to an RfM is an almost totally different matter than giving evidence on an RfC. Signing on to an RfM says, "Yes, I'm a party to this matter, I'm one of the people who needs to be involved in any mediation." The RfC is just about gathering the facts of the matter in one place. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 17:48, Nov 19, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You might as well be the same party in your RfM. You share an alma mater, some foe, same lack of time constraint, predilection for making mountains out of molehills(although that could be a symptom which a psychology textbook studies very carefully), same IQ...hm, what else?</dd>
