<p>Caucau is one of Fiji's most colourful politicians. A flamboyant figure, she is sometimes careless with her words and her outspokenness has frequently generated controversy. She has defended herself by claiming that journalists have often unfairly quoted her "out of context."</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/e/Asenaca_Caucau_c895.html" title="Edit section: &quot;Indians are like weeds&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">"Indians are like weeds"</span></h3>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_28.html" title="July 28">28 July</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, Caucau sparked an uproar with a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_%28Fiji%29_9e29.html" title="Parliament (Fiji)">parliamentary</a> speech in which she likened <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Fijian_5b85.html" title="Indo-Fijian">Indo-Fijians</a> to <a href="../../../w/e/e/Weed.html" title="Weed">weeds</a>. <i>"A priest warned me that we must keep a careful and guarded watch over fellow Indo-Fijians because they are like weeds. They tend to push to grab and take over the land and the nation,"</i> she said.</p>

Former Prime Minister <a href="../../../s/i/t/Sitiveni_Rabuka_05d1.html" title="Sitiveni Rabuka">Sitiveni Rabuka</a>, however, condemned her remarks and called on the Prime Minister to discipline her. <i>"Caucau's statements were irresponsible and unbecoming, especially from a woman who prays before making a statement,"</i> Rabuka said. He called on her to apologise to the Indo-Fijian community.</p>
<p>Responding to calls for an apology, Caucau insisted that she saw nothing offensive about her statement. <i>"I am simply stating a fact and it was not meant to be racist"</i>, she told the media.</p>

<p>Caucau, who worked as journalist herself whilst pursuing her university studies in <a href="../../../n/e/b/Nebraska.html" title="Nebraska">Nebraska</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, has periodically attacked the media for what she considers to be biased journalism. For the second time in less than a year, she declared at a workshop in <a href="../../../n/a/b/Nabua.html" title="Nabua">Nabua</a> in late January <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> that reporters should be more sensitive when reporting incidents of violence against women, she said, and claimed to have been a frequent victim of journalists quoting her out of context. On the whole, journalists should attempt to focus a lot more on positive rather than negative news, she maintained. <i>"I ask the media to concentrate on positive things rather than just doing the rounds on <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">rape</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incest.html" title="Incest">incest</a>, molestation on women,"</i> she said. <i>"There seems to be a lot of love-hate relationships in Fiji today, between so many and the media, simply because there are so many negative reporting and a serious lack of understanding on journalists' part on working on reports or their stories,"</i> she added. Caucau likened negative journalism to <i>"a bad wound that can fester and spread a nasty smell."</i> She said that journalists should be held accountable for the reports they produced. She was reiterating earlier comments she had made at the Pacific Regional Office for the United Nations Development Fund for Women (<a href="../../../u/n/i/UNIFEM_9761.html" title="UNIFEM">UNIFEM</a>) and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Agency_for_International_Development_ca4b.html" title="Australian Agency for International Development">AusAID</a>.</p>

<p>Caucau found herself embroiled in controversy when she claimed at a workshop on violence against children on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_27.html" title="September 27">27 September</a> 2005 that fathers throughout Fiji have been selling their daughters into prostitution in a "readily available" human trafficking market. Her allegations came on top of claims by <a href="../../../f/i/j/Fiji_Labour_Party_fae9.html" title="Fiji Labour Party">Opposition</a> <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senate_%28Fiji%29_f72b.html" title="Senate (Fiji)">Senator</a> <a href="../../../p/o/n/Ponipate_Lesavua_6350.html" title="Ponipate Lesavua">Ponipate Lesavua</a> that teenage prostitution was commonplace.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/e/Asenaca_Caucau_c895.html" title="Edit section: &quot;Beggars are well-off&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">"Beggars are well-off"</span></h3>
<p>Caucau made headlines again on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_7.html" title="November 7">7 November</a> 2005, claiming that many beggars were imposters. Many were professionals who already had food and shelter, she claimed. Some even allegedly owned and rented out houses to others. According to Caucau, all beggars except the mentally disabled received family allowances of up to <a href="../../../f/i/j/Fijian_dollar.html" title="Fijian dollar">F$100</a> per month, which put them above the <a href="../../../p/o/v/Poverty_line.html" title="Poverty line">poverty line</a>. Some people were using the lifestyle of begging to make money, sometimes as much as F$35 per day, she said. The government had provided them with free training for basic skills, but they had simply moved back to the streets at the conclusion of their courses, she alleged, and some were pretending to be <a href="../../../o/r/p/Orphan.html" title="Orphan">orphans</a> or disabled in order to attract sympathy and pilfer. She called on the police to take them off the streets.</p>
<p>At a question-and-answer session at the Fiji media Council Editors Forum on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_8.html" title="December 8">8 December</a> 2005, Caucau said that people should stop giving money to beggars. Most beggars were on the streets voluntarily, she said, in search of easy money. Giving them money only reinforced their handout mentality, she maintained.</p>
<p>Fellow-panelist and Fiji Labour Party parliamentarian <a href="../../../p/r/a/Pratap_Chand_ad9f.html" title="Pratap Chand">Pratap Chand</a> disagreed with Caucau, saying that most beggars did not enjoy their lifestyle but had no choice.</p>

<p>The decision of the SDL Party to renominate Caucau for the <a href="../../../f/i/j/Fiji_election_of_2006.html" title="Fiji election of 2006">parliamentary election</a>, which was duly held on <a href="../../../6/_/m/6_May_d7eb.html" title="6 May">6</a>-<a href="../../../m/a/y/May_13.html" title="May 13">13 May</a> 2006, was sharply criticized by Ratu <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Cakobau%2C_Jr._fcec.html" title="George Cakobau, Jr.">George Cakobau</a>, scion of <a href="../../../t/a/i/Tailevu.html" title="Tailevu">Tailevu</a>'s most senior chiefly family and son of former <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor-General_of_Fiji_ebde.html" title="Governor-General of Fiji">Governor-General</a> Ratu <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir.html" title="Sir">Sir</a> <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Cakobau_e5d9.html" title="George Cakobau">George Cakobau</a>.

The SDL disregarded his advice, and Caucau went on to retain her seat by a large majority.</p>

<p>Caucau is the daughter of the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Reverend.html" title="Reverend">Reverend</a> Ratu Isireli Caucau, a former President of the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodist_Church_51da.html" title="Methodist Church">Methodist Church</a>. Caucau herself espouses fervent Christian beliefs, claims never to make a statement without praying first, preferably with her advisers, and frequently preaches.</p>
<p>Caucau's religious convictions strongly flavour her social views. She has spoken out strongly in favour of campaigns to discourage <a href="../../../p/r/e/Premarital_sex.html" title="Premarital sex">premarital sex</a>, claiming that single mothers are among the most vulnerable members of society and are frequently abused. She has also strongly opposed calls from some quarters to legalize <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitution.html" title="Prostitution">prostitution</a>, saying that it corrupts morals. In early October <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, she claimed about half of all Members of Parliament were clients of prostitutes, but refused to name any names.</p>
