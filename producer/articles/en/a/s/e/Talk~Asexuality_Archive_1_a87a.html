<p>"There is continuing disagreement over whether asexuality is a legitimate sexual orientation."</p>
<p>Who gets to decide if a sexual orientation is legitimate or not? Apparently not the catholic church! Juryen 22:39, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Noone, and that's the point.

<dd>But although there is no authority on the matter and the opinion has no solid basis, we shall nevertheless divide sexual orientations into legitimate and illegitimate. Juryen 23:54, 1 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yep. As an analogy, take the various small <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">cults</a> around the world. Are they legitimate religions or just a bunch of deluded weirdos following a charismatic personality? Which government or authority gets to determine that?

<dd>Since when are half of these people asexual? I have read biographies on quite a few of these supossed asexual people and none of them seem to fit the mold. Nikoli Tesla was interested in many different women but found persuing a relationship difficult due to his OCD. Salvador dali was good friends with the bi-sexual erotic latin american poet Lorca and married Helena. Hitler had a very terbulent relationship with many different girlfriends. I'm sure there have been many famious asexual people. However, this is more or less name droping. It should be noted that a lot of these people are conjectural and some are just blaintly untrue.
<dl>
<dd>Lorca was gay, not bisexual (he wasn't hyphenated, either). Dali certainly wasn't asexual, since one of his female models has recounted in interview that the artist became visibly aroused in her presence, masturbated, and actually ejaculated onto her.</dd>
<dd>However, he is known to have emulated feminine appearance and dress, and to have actually incorporated his wife's name into his signature, so it is possible he may have been feminine-identified.</dd>

<p>This list of people is absurd, and the NNDB is the only reference for all of them. The NNDB does not provide any information on how they got their information and is of questionable reliability. The list doesn't mention the fact that most of these people are anecdotally asexual, which seems to be the best information source for a person's sexual behavior (unless, of course, their sexual escapades are well known). I think a reasonable person could see that some of these people may not have disclosed their true sexual orientation (Satie is a good example) due to circumstances of the time, and to list them as notable asexuals under the circumstances seems to be misrepresentative. I've deleted the list (yes, I know that's a drastic measure) but until some reliable sources can be identified the list doesn't belong here. <a href="../../../t/o/o/User%7ETooMuchMath_6b17.html" title="User:TooMuchMath">TooMuchMath</a> 03:06, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think the list should stay. There is strong evidence suggesting that these people are asexual, and even if the evidence isn't 100% conclusive, I don't see a problem, as long as it says at the top of the list that not everyone on the list is absolutely certain to be asexual. <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImperialLeader_d216.html" title="User:ImperialLeader">ImperialLeader</a> 02:29, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Benjamin Banneker never married or had children and there is no love story with any woman who i know. That's why he appeared in some biography for Lesbians and Gay people. But a biography said that he was asexual. (Benjamin Banneker, Charles A. Cerami, 2002). As for Immanuel Kant, he is listed in multiple websites in the list "Famous Asexuals" and in his profile in nndb.com say the same thing <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/891/000029804/" class="external free" title="http://www.nndb.com/people/891/000029804/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nndb.com/people/891/000029804/</a>.

<p>The article currently says:</p>
<p>Some Christian religions, '<b>based on</b> 1 Corinthians 7:9 ("1 Corinthians 7:9 <b>(RSV)</b> But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to be aflame with passion.") endorse sex only within marriage</p>
<p>Please cite some Christian religions which based their sex only within marriage policy on the RSV version of the work.</p>
<p>I don't care which version is used. I care that we do not incorrectly assert a decision based on one version which was actually based on some older version. So, for example, I would object to asserting that the Church of England based it's decision on the RSV version, if the RSV version was written after the Church of England made its decision, because that's historically inacurate. That is, please get the history right and don't have churches making a decision based on a work which didn't yet exist in the quoted form. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesday_85fa.html" title="User:Jamesday">Jamesday</a> 06:59, 20 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Asexuality and Gender</span></h2>
<p>I don't know if this discussion page gets read much, but here goes: I just deleted the fiction section of the article, since it was about gender, and not, like the rest of the article, sexual orientation. That said, many people do use "asexual" as a reference to gender, so there should probably either be a section about gender-related definitions of "asexual," or a new article about it. I'm not in a good position to put such a section or article together, but wanted to toss the idea out in case someone who is wanted to take up the task.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AVEN</span></h2>
<p>Quote from the page:</p>
<p>"Some asexuals use a classification system developed (and then retired) by the founder of the Asexual Visibility and Education Network (<a href="http://www.asexuality.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.asexuality.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.asexuality.org/</a>) (one of the major asexual online communities, and abbreviated as AVEN). In this system, asexuals are divided into types A through D: a type A asexual has a sex drive but no romantic attraction, a type B experiences romantic attraction but no sex drive, a type C experiences both, and a type D neither. The categories are not meant to be entirely discrete or set in stone; one's type can change, or one can be on the border between two types. Note that AVEN itself no longer uses this system, on the basis that it is too exclusive."</p>
<p>This sounds strange, if you have a sex drive, shouldn't it per se be impossible to be asexual? I haven't read about the AVEN classification, but I think it would make more sense with something like "...persons are divided..."</p>
<p>--Similar to other orientations, the definition of asexuality is based on who one is sexually attracted to (in this case no one), rather than presence or absence of sex drive.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Uhmm, still sounds strange... What/Where would this sex drive direct its outlet at? (Npov?)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I believe it refers to the fact that some asexuals masturbate, but don't really fantasize about anything; it's only a physical urge.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Being asexual myself, let me field this one. Some of us masturbate, yes... others don't. When we do masturbate, it is usually just to release the "sexual tension" (or prevent cancer) and it isn't usually directed at anything; often we masturbate over the mere feeling of masturbation itself, and the frequency of masturbation is also less than that of a more sexually active individual. Often as little as once or twice a month, compared to 4 or 5 times a week of your average 21 yearold.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
--Uh, why does it have to be directed at anything? Getting horny doesn't have to have an immediate cause, and nor does it have to result in anything actually being done about it.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Asexuality and Religion</span></h2>
<p>I removed three bits in this section. One, I removed the part about sexual attraction not being necessary for sex, and it thus not being much of an issue. Certain conceptions of sacred sexuality do seem to carry the assumption that one will enjoy the act, and that orientation is bound up in the concept of sexuality itself.</p>
<p>Two, I removed the part about these religions having so few adherents that asexuals have nothing to fear. I have my doubts about how NPOV that statement was, and it makes it sound as if the entire purpose of the religions section is to alert asexuals as to possible threats. Furthermore, some asexuals might be members of those religions in question, or considering joining.</p>
<p>Three, I took away the part about asexuals having a harder than gays when it comes to being spotted by some conservative religious groups. I didn't think it was all that accurate -- gays can remain closeted, and some asexuals desire (and possibly have) nonsexual relationships with the same sex.</p>

<p>I think Islam has negative attitude towards asexuality, for example Muhammad has said "Don't practice celibacy like the Christians" ( but I don't know whether it's authentic)</p>
<p>-- 83.146.53.235 13:37, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sexual attraction is obviously not necessary for sex. As for this comment "Without sexual attraction, you cannot sustain an erection when engaging, so you can't really have sex." It is completely untrue. Physical arousal is not 100% dependant on mental arousal, it is possible for a man to be physically aroused while mentally being indifferent or even replused by the situation. Otherwise an asexual man could never have sex.</p>
<p><a name="Debate" id="Debate"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Debate</span></h2>
<p>There was some line about there being absolutely no evidence at all that asexuality is caused by hormone problems/repression/etc., IIRC. I took it out, because I thought it was misleading. No, there's no hard evidence (that I know of) that a lack of sexual attraction is caused by any of those things. But there's not much hard evidence, period. The number of scientific studies on a lack of attraction -- that I know, anyway -- can be counted on one hand. Saying that there's no evidence at all implies that that lack of evidence is on much more solid ground than it actually is.</p>

I see no <i>a priori</i> reason to dismiss the existence of an asexual orientation as distinct from a sexual dysfunction that results in a loss of interest in sex. There are other articles on sexual dysfunctions. Why confuse the issue here with constant harping on sexual abuse, psychological problems, and other conditions that seem not to affect some people who identify themselves as asexual? (Some people mentioned in the literature cited here deny any such ætiology and seem content with what they regard as their sexual orientation.) <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShorne_d9ff.html" title="User:Shorne">Shorne</a> 18:57, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>--I included those things because a substantial number of people don't believe that there's any difference between asexuality and sexual dysfunction and, as the article says, there's no hard evidence either way. Reasonable or not, there is debate as to whether or not asexuality is a legitimate orientation.</p>

<dd>It seems to me that the position that asexuality is not a legitimate orientation should be presented in a single place, not throughout the text. Homosexuality was regarded as "illegitimate", even as a psychosis, by professional organisations of psychologists twenty or thirty years ago. It strikes me that asexuality, still relatively unknown, is just being subjected to the same sorts of prejudices.</dd>
<dd>I'd also like to see documentation of the position that a lack of interest in sex is necessarily a dysfunction. No one disputes that bisexuality is a genuine orientation, so why should the opposite extreme—asexuality—not be so regarded? Low libido is accepted, so why not asexuality?</dd>
<dd>I checked the <i><a href="../../../d/s/m/DSM-IV_1fd8.html" title="DSM-IV">DSM-IV</a></i>. There is no suggestion that asexuality is necessarily a dysfunction. The closest conditions listed are "sexual aversion disorder" and "hypoactive sexual desire disorder", both of which "must result in significant distress for the individual". Asexuals who experience no distress from their lack of desire for sex would seem not to meet the definition of either dysfunction. Again, I'd like to see a source for the claim that asexuality is necessarily a dysfunction, which goes against common sense. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShorne_d9ff.html" title="User:Shorne">Shorne</a> 23:54, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I'm not finding a lot of other links to professionals explicitly saying that asexuality is a disorder, but I'm not finding a lot of links to professionals saying much about asexuality in the first place, and I've heard anecdotal evidence for some asexuals having their doctors or therapists tell them they're disordered. Furthermore, it doesn't really matter that you -- or any other individual user -- thinks it goes against common sense: the point of Wikipedia isn't to pick a side in a debate.</dd>

<dd>Your references are rather weak, I must say. The first and the second are from people who are obviously confused about the subject, equating asexuality with various physical problems and such. These laymen shouldn't be quoted as reliable sources when they don't even understand the subject. The third article does not say what you claim: it says that a lack of interest in sex <b>may</b> be the result of a dysfunction, which no one questions. The fourth article makes the best case: little work has been done in this area because of a bias towards restoring sexual performance/desire in people who are not happy with its lack. That is worth mentioning, along with the reports that some doctors or therapists have leapt to the conclusion of a sexual disorder (which is probably common, just as so many doctors hastily seize upon weight as the cause of a fat person's sore feet without doing any investigation). <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShorne_d9ff.html" title="User:Shorne">Shorne</a> 06:29, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The third article <i>does</i> say that it's a disorder: "(Asexuality), however, is a rare condition and most forms of sexual dysfunction respond to therapeutic intervention." As for the quote from the New Scientist article, it's an acknowledgement that most professionals <i>are</i> going to view it as a disorder. You think this is an example of bias and not a reasonable conclusion? Fine. But I'm sure they don't. Your argument about this fits very well into the "asexuality is legitimate" side of the debate, and I agree that it should be put into the article. But it should be put with the other "asexuality is legitimate" arguments, and presented as one of them.</dd>

But they're instances of what I've found to be common thought among laymen; furthermore, you can't just state that they're invalid because they don't fit a definition of asexuality that is based in the idea that it is legitimate. It seems all right to include a note that the majority of the documented objections to asexuality are coming from laypeople -- as long as you also note that most of the discussions about asexuality at this point are coming from laypeople, period.</dd>

<p>I am a self-proclaimed asexual at this point in my life, but I was once straight, and I do not belive, in my case at least, that I am asexual due to disfunction. My sex drive is exactly the same as it has ever been, it is only my state of mind that has changed.</p>

<dd>Despite my request to have the "can asexuals enjoy sex?" debate moved to the discussion page, user 169.105.136.111 keeps changing the article to say things like "many asexuals have sex," not to mention giving the article POV by saying no evidence exists to say asexuality is unnatural.

<dd>I share your desire to have the discussion brought to the talk page. The next time you edit the article, please state in the edit summary that disagreements need to be discussed here.</dd>
<dd>But I don't think we should say anything at all about what is "unnatural". That's a very pejorative POV; really, it's nothing more than a slur. Asexuality exists, so how could it be "unnatural"? <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShorne_d9ff.html" title="User:Shorne">Shorne</a> 01:17, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That "unnatural" information is in there because there are <i>people that think that it is</i>. To be blunt, it doesn't matter whether you personally think that opinion is wrong. Wikipedia is not meant to be a soapbox: if a number of people think that asexuality is unnatural, <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> dictates that we mention that and present what they think.</dd>

<dd>Honestly, the word "unnatural" isn't even showing up in the recent versions of the article I'm looking through -- I assume the commenter above (who was complaining about giving the article POV) was paraphrasing. What precisely are you taking issue with? If it's just the word "unnatural" -- well, I wouldn't class it as automatically non-NPOV, depending on context, but there are enough perfectly good (but hopefully less offensive) synonyms for it that that can be worked around.</dd>

<dd>However, I'd assumed that the commenter who first used the word "unnatural" was referring to the tendency by one of the contributors to make sentences along the lines of, "There is debate as to whether or not asexuality is a legitimate orientation or a disorder, though there is no evidence for the latter." Those sentences <i>are</i> problematic. No, there's no evidence that asexuality isn't natural and legitimate. But there have been so few studies that there's barely any evidence for the contrary, either. To only single one of those positions out for a comment about the lack of evidence is to stray from NPOV.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>That's what I meant. I thought emphasizing that there was no evidence proving asexuality isn't legit but failing to mention that there is also no evidence proving asexuality is natural was too POV.

<dd>In response to "can asexuals enjoy sex?"</dd>
<dd>Maybe you should ASK an asexual about these things, rather than just guessing. I am asexual. Some asexuals do enjoy sex, and some don't. Whether they enjoy sex or not does not affect whether they are asexual, because asexuality is about not having the innate desire to initiate the sex, and has nothing to do with how the person feels about the actual sex itself. You could have sex everyday, or never ever, and this wouldn't change whether you were asexual or not.</dd>

<p>I made a number of fairly small cosmetic changes to improve readability: the debate section was shuffled around a bit to give what I thought was a smoother read, for instance, as was the variations section. I also moved the research information to its own section because that seemed useful. It's right after the debate section, though, and hopefully the last sentence of the debate section is a good lead-in. I removed the section about what the ram study might mean, as it struck me as better to let the readers make up their own minds; I could be completely wrong about that, of course.</p>
<p>I also changed the very last paragraph to something that I thought was less biased: I thought the phrase "challenging the belief that heterosexuality is the only normal sexual orientation" wasn't as NPOV as it could be, and didn't like the way the paragraph completely singled out conservative religious groups.</p>
<p>There was a bit at the top of the variations section saying that there were variations with asexuality, as with any other orientation; I removed the "as with any other orientation," since it seemed to make the article more NPOV.</p>
<p>Also, Wayland's contributions in the "see also" section: what do people think of these?</p>

<dd>Something about hermits not getting sex, maybe? There's a tendency for some people to associate misanthropy and asocialness with asexuality, too.

<dd>Well the Catholic church and some other conservative religious groups are opposed to 'artificial' birth control and masturbation and premaritical sex and all that so we can assume they will generally be opposed to asexuals who have sex drives of some sort. Many of these appear to think that people can and should enter into family units, reproducing as much as possible so we can expect they will view asexuals negatively in this light. In short, asexuals appear to violate their views that everyone should enter into heterosexual family units that procreate (and only use sex for procreation) so we would espect they would be opposed to asexuals.

Sophocles wasn't asexual, which many sources attest. For example:</p>
<p>"The historian Athenaios reported that Sophocles loved boys like Euripides loved women. The poet Ion of Chios relates: “I met Sophocles in Chios when he was as a strategist on his way to Lesbos. He was an adroit man who liked to make merry at the symposium. Hermesilaos was his friend and the official host of the Athenians. The boy who poured the wine stood at the fireplace, beautiful and blushing. Sophocles, visibly touched, asked him: ‘Do you want me to drink with delight?’ He nodded. ‘So take your time when you give me the bowl and take it away.’ The boy blushed more strongly. Sophocles remarked to the guest who lay beside him: “How beautiful is the line of Phrynichos: ‘Shining on purple cheeks the light of love.’ ” His neighbour, who was a schoolmaster of Eretria answered him: ‘You are doubtless a sage poet, Sophocles, but Phrynichos did not express himself well in calling the cheeks of a beautiful boy purple, because, if a Persian had painted them with purple colour, the boy would appear no longer beautiful. Therefore one must not compare the beautiful to the obviously not beautiful.’ Sophocles laughed and said: ‘So you also won’t like the verse of Simonides that the Greeks appreciate so much: “From purple lips the girl let flow her voice,” and what the poet says of Apollo’s golden hair, because, if a painter had painted the god’s hair golden instead of black, the painting would be worse. Likewise the poetic “rose-fingered”, since, if anyone should dip their fingers into rose-red paint, they would get hands like a dyer but not like a beautiful woman.’ The other guests laughed, and the man from Eretria was struck dumb with the rebuke, while Sophocles turned towards the boy again. This one was just trying to remove a speck from the bowl with his little finger. Sophocles asked him whether he could see the straw distinctly. He affirmed it, and Sophocles continued: ‘So blow it away, lest your finger should become wet.’ While the boy approached his lips to the vessel, Sophocles brought it nearer to his mouth, so that their heads approached each other. When the boy was near him, Sophocles put his arm around him, drew him even closer and kissed him. All applauded and cheered him for having outfoxed the boy so nicely. Sophocles replied: ‘Gentlemen, I’m practising strategy, because Pericles said that I understood poetry but not strategy. Now, don,t you think my stratagem turned out quite well?'’ ”(2)</p>
<p>Of course, Sophocles's strategies did not always turn out to his advantage. He was reputed to have had amorous trysts with pretty boys all life long; Plato swore to it. His pederasty is similarly reported by Euripides, and by Athenaios. The latter, who liked gathering anecdotes about the lives of the great men of antiquity, relates one of Sophocles's misadventures: “One day, Sophocles (who was around 65 years of age at the time) led beyond the walls of the city a beautiful youth in order to enjoy him. The lad spread his rough himation (a cheap coat) on the grass and the two covered themselves with the elegant chlanis of the poet. When the thing was done, the boy snatched the chlanis, leaving the himation for Sophocles. Naturally word of this got around, and as soon as Euripides found out he made great fun of it.” (3)</p>

<dd>As the top of the article says, what you're describing can be found at <a href="../../../a/s/e/Asexual_reproduction.html" title="Asexual reproduction">asexual reproduction</a>. Many asexuals believe "asexuality" (and that's the term used to describe it) is an orientation; that is, lack of sex drive is a characteristic, rather than a symptom. Also note that the article on sexual dysfunction describes a problem or disorder, whereas this article describes people who feel no sexual attraction to other people. There's a big difference, and very little of the material in this article would be appropriate there. I guess a simpler way to put it is, asexuals feel "normal" and natural not seeking a sex life, while those with sexual dysfunction <i>want</i> to have sex but physiologically can't. Further, if your quibble is with the definition of the word "asexual," then one could just as easily claim this article is false because asexual humans still have functioning sex organs. <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/asexual" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/asexual" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> --<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirdhombre_7569.html" title="User:Birdhombre">Birdhombre</a> 20:46, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The first two meanings are biological, and those are the ones TheRaven7 is referring to. The third is a cultural concept, and that's the one this article is about. I don't really know enough about either field (biology or the social construction of sexual identities) to suggest a wording, but I think that the article should probably make this distinction more clearly and explicitly. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 23:54, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sexual desire/attraction?</span></h2>
<p>Being an asexual, and knowing a number of asexuals, are there actually asexuals who claim not to have sexual desire or attraction? This article at present seems to treat it as some sort of biological condition wherein individuals are not sexually attracted to one another. I don't see that as true at all. I generally consider asexuality more the sense that love and lust are incompatible, and that sex is unnecessary, awkward, and possibly even violent. It does not mean having no sex drive, but an opposition to sexual lust for other reasons. It simply sees acts such as cuddling, etc as more intimate and the ultimate expression of love and sexual intercourse as awkward and/or violent and thus acts of lust not compatible with or unnecessary in a loving relationship. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 05:08, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>These kinds of questions come up on AVEN <a href="http://www.asexuality.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.asexuality.org" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> frequently. Some asexuals feel attraction to other people, but don't feel the need to act on it sexually, which is what you're describing. Many can be sexually aroused through physical stimulation, but their brain doesn't connect it to a human being. Some call themselves "aromantic" and don't seem to feel a strong attraction toward other people, other than just as friends. Still others have fetishes but consider themselves asexual because the sexual thoughts are limited to the fetish (i.e. they are attracted <i>only</i> to the fetish trait or object, and are still turned off by the thought of sexual intercourse or sex organs)... if that makes sense. --<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirdhombre_7569.html" title="User:Birdhombre">Birdhombre</a> 18:38, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, I suppose it is rather broad and complex. I've also met asexuals who only see themselves as asexual in their relationships with one sex, but not with the other. I think I would maintain this is asexuality, but it confuses things even further. I would only like to see this page make a clear accomodation all manifestations, as some asexuals may otherwise be turned off to the term, thinking it is necessarily a form of sexual dysfunction. The FAQ on that page is quite useful, and (to me) really makes it clear that there are some clear commonalities amongst asexuals, especially with points such as "Many asexuals can see that other people are aesthetically attractive to them but see this beauty as no different from looking at a beautiful painting or a stunning sunset." <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 19:43, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that's probably the dominant form of asexuality, which is why I took issue with the old wording. Many (most? all?) asexuals have a lessened sex drive to varying extents, but having none whatever seems rather unlikely (although if such a physical condition existed, that individual would probably be asexual by default). Most want relationships based on affection, and some will have sexual relationships simply out of a lack of other options. Others (myself included) would rather remain indefinitely single than become involved sexually, although seeing that as simply the better of two evils, and not being happy about it. (Which is why asexual awareness is important.) And (hypothetically) there's some that would prefer not to have any relationships of any sort. (Although I've never heard of asexuals with certain characteristics, it's important to use an inclusive definition.) <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 17:32, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't like the word because it pretty flatly says it's a biological condition. Not all asexuals would make that case. I don't think it's necessary because celibacy is more of a self-control thing, where asexuality is a "I'm not interested in sex" sort of thing where there isn't anything to control. For that matter asexuals don't vow not to have sex, and some do. It's also unclear what extent social development has on people who identify as asexual. (For instance, it doesn't seem coincidence that 93% of people on AVEN identify as introverted.) Maybe wording it different would help, but having that word there puts it on one extreme of the nature vs nurture continuum. Surely you couldn't edit the homosexuality article to call it "natural" or "inherent", and the same controversy exists here. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 15:28, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Looking through dictionaries, there is a common definition that has to do with the character of something, which is the context in which the word is used. It is appropriate. There must be a word used that separates it from celebacy, because asexuals necessarily lack an interest in sex, not simply choosing not to have it (which is covered under celebacy). --<a href="../../../x/o/m/User%7EXombie_f3f3.html" title="User:Xombie">Xombie</a> 23:06, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is a clear separation. Celibates are people who don't have sex. Asexuals are people who don't <i>want</i> to have sex. Celibates may or may not be asexuals. Asexuals may or may not be celibate. Most celibates are heterosexuals who do lust and do want sex, but not before some "appropriate" time (e.g. marriage). No one has ever claimed that "celibate" is a sexual orientation, so it's very difficult to confuse it with asexuality. But the two do overlap very prominently. Those definitions state not just that inherent means a characteristic, but an "essential" or innate characteristic. Which is at the very extreme "nature" end of the spectrum, where a significant number of asexuals (including myself) would state there is a very prominent "nurture" aspect. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 23:24, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perhaps I was wrong to add a word like 'inherently'. The word seems restrictive if you widen the definition of asexuality to include people with low levels of sexual attraction or low sex drives directed at other humans. In that case it probably shouldn't be considered a fixed trait. After all, many people's sex drives can vary considerably over a lifetime due to biological and psychological changes, and social circumstances. But if you limit the definition of asexuality to people over a certain age who have never noticed a sex drive or whose sex drive has never been directed at other humans, I think it is probably a biological thing, but not definitely. (I wonder what the most likely explanations would have been in the alleged 'cases' of the famous people currently listed on the article page.) <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamantha_of_Cardyke_ac2d.html" title="User:Samantha of Cardyke">Samantha of Cardyke</a> 08:31, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Right, and there is a large gradation among asexuals. This isn't a particularly good poll, but there is evidence suggesting that a significant majority of asexuals are sexual in some way with only a small minority saying they have no libido whatsoever. <a href="http://www.asexuality.org/discussion/viewtopic.php?t=15487" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.asexuality.org/discussion/viewtopic.php?t=15487" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> Although I would agree that asexuality may effect someone's social interaction, another poll shows that 94% of asexual respondents were "loners" as children <a href="http://www.asexuality.org/discussion/viewtopic.php?t=16007" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.asexuality.org/discussion/viewtopic.php?t=16007" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, before sexuality would have had any real social importance. (Since whatever crushes do occur in child years are asexual anyway.) Clearly these are not scientific polls, but nevertheless using the word "inherent" would seem to disenfranchise a significant number, if not most, asexuals from the term. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 16:51, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have no idea what you're trying to pull here. You haven't given a citation stating that it's purely biological, and I can assure you, you won't. Certainly not from any "neutral" source. It isn't a "neutral" point of view to say it is. It's an extreme point of view. And I didn't show those polls as a source for the article. I didn't claim they should be included in the article. I was just making an appeal to reason. As terrible as those polls might be, it's very plain to see that not all asexuals are "pure" asexuals. In fact, it suggests that the strong majority are not. In light of that, you seem content in saying it's "NPOV" to say all asexuals are asexual in the extreme sense, without any sort of citation to back that up in any way, even after the editor who added the word admitted it was probably a mistake. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 21:30, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I stated, this is not a manifesto. If there is little information then the topic should in fact be treated in a strict sense in order to prevent the leaking of NPOV information. Your polls are completely invalid as they are bordering on <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_words_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words">weasel words</a>. Your assertion that those with disinclination toward sex are in any way affected by "nurture" is not backed up by any NPOV scientific evidence. The opinions of only a select few people claiming to be asexual is not evidence of anything about asexuality. I am stating that the word should remain, as there is evidence that those with a low libido are affected by psychological mood (proven by studies of the effects of SSRIs), and asexuality should be separated from simply having a disinterest or choice not to have sex, and it should by nature of the very word be isolated to those with necessarily <i>no</i> sex drive. If you do not agree with "inherently", then suggest another like word to replace it, but there is valid reason to keep it there. --<a href="../../../x/o/m/User%7EXombie_f3f3.html" title="User:Xombie">Xombie</a> 22:02, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You seem to be confusing citation with NPOV. NPOV means a POV that there's a general consensus around. Clearly there is no general consensus that asexuality is "innate". Nor at present is there any citation claiming that it is. In fact it would even appear to be a minority opinion. It is a claim that no dictionaries appear to make. <a href="http://onelook.com/?w=asexual&amp;ls=a" class="external autonumber" title="http://onelook.com/?w=asexual&amp;ls=a" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> The only purpose that word serves is to say that asexuality cannot in any fashion be learned. Science is not NPOV. There are debates between and within scientific fields. The most glaring is the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nature_vs._nurture.html" title="Nature vs. nurture">nature vs. nurture</a> debate. NPOV policy dictates that we don't take the extreme position, which is what you are attempting to do. And if you know anything about science, you should know that in science NOTHING is proven. I'm certain if you read whatever article you're talking about closely, it will not claim that asexuality is purely biological and no other position is valid. (If it did, it would not have survived any serious peer review process.) There is no word to replace "inherently" with, because to put any word there would be to express a POV. The article on asexuality should be about people who identify as asexual, not about what some scientists call asexuality from an ivory tower. Sexual orientations are chosen labels, not imposed. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 23:10, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First, NPOV policy dictates that you are not to insert your or others' opinion into article as fact. Second, I am not making a case for it being purely biological. Third, I already pointed out that the word used fits the <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/asexuality" class="external text" title="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/asexuality" rel="nofollow">definition</a> that would specify it as a state in which the person necessarily has no desire for sex. A merely lower sex drive is in fact psychological, as it can be artificially changed with <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antidepressants.html#Sexual" title="Antidepressants">medication</a> in repeated testing. If you wish you may change the word to something more appropriate to display the distinction. Until such a time as you come up with a "better" word, it should remain. You said that you wish to be reasonable, so compromise. As for your argument regarding "what scientists call asexuality from an ivory tower", this is not a manifesto for asexuals to express themselves. It is not a podium, it is not a blog. It is an encyclopedia.
<dl>
<dd>Exactly. And having the word "inherently" is inserting one opinion – your opinion – as fact. Not having the word there allows space for other opinions currently dismissed. You're correct this is an encyclopedia. And that's why we need to look at asexuality as a sexual orientation and not strictly as some psychobiological phenomenon. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 03:50, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I never stated any opinion. I provided M-W.com as a source, and we've already been over this: there is a definition of the word "inherently" that fits to provide it as a distinction.

<p>OK, obviously "inherently" won't work. How about "<a href="http://m-w.com/dictionary/intrinsically" class="external text" title="http://m-w.com/dictionary/intrinsically" rel="nofollow">intrinsically</a>"? <i>Asexuality is a general term or self-designation for people who are intrinsically disinclined towards sexual behavior and lust.</i> To me, the definition "belonging to the essential nature or constitution of a thing" accurately describes what we're trying to convey here. It doesn't say whether the <i>source</i> of the orientation is nature or nurture (as the phrase "belonging by nature or habit" implies nature), but makes it clear that it's somehow deeply rooted in the person, rather than being a choice (<i>a la</i> celibacy). In spite of the various orientations of people who describe themselves as asexual, I think the one common thread is that they did not <i>choose</i> to be that way, just as one would not "choose" to dislike peanut butter or classical music.

<dd>I just don't find that any better. Intrinsic is tied up very strongly in nature as well, and essentially means the exact same thing. (Oxford: "belonging to the basic nature of someone or something" Dictionary.com: "Of or relating to the essential nature of a thing"). All sexual orientations are essentially chosen. You can't just tell someone they're homosexual or asexual, they have to choose to accept the vocabulary. Celibates aren't necessarily asexual because they might very well have a sexual interest being restrained; asexuals aren't necessarily celibate because a number of asexuals have sex. How about something along the lines of "Asexuality is a general term or self-designation for people who find sexual behavior unappealing." <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 06:06, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ohhh, OK, I think I see where you're coming from now. Perhaps we should be looking at the definition of "nature" rather than the word "inherently" then. :) From M-W: <i>1 a : the inherent character or basic constitution of a person or thing : essence b : disposition, temperament.</i> In this context, "nature" does not necessarily mean "natural," ironically enough. It's "in my nature" that I tend to be a packrat, yet this is something I learned from my father while growing up ("nurture") and is not genetic. Also, when I say "it's not a choice," I'm not talking about choosing a label for oneself; I'm saying I never chose to not be sexually attracted to other people. I think your suggestion of "unappealing" might be the best we can do, in light of this discussion, and perhaps we could move the "Asexual does not equal celibate" line up to the opening paragraph, since we also mention the dysfunction vs. orientation debate there. --<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirdhombre_7569.html" title="User:Birdhombre">Birdhombre</a> 11:34, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's not exactly a fair analogy. Sexual orientation works in scales. Practically no one is purely heterosexual, and practically no one is purely homosexual. A woman may have sexual interest in a woman, or sexually experiment with a woman but still consider herself heterosexual. Or she could consider herself bisexual. Or maybe she decided she didn't like men after all and started calling herself a lesbian. Sexual orientation can change, and saying it can't is exactly the nature side of the argument. Would you define heterosexuality as "the involuntary attraction to members of the opposite sex" or "the inherent attraction to members of the opposite sex"? Why do you need that extra adjective? Your POV seems to be that people can be happily placed in rigid boxes and that sexuality remains constant. However, this is only one perspective, and <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queer_theory.html" title="Queer theory">queer theory</a> gives a very different one. Labels are important, because this article should not marginalize people who identify as asexual but don't take the extreme position. Just like we shouldn't marginalize heterosexuals who have had sexual interest in members of the same sex from the heterosexuality article. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 16:03, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks. I do not believe that sexual orientation is always absolute or rigidly fixed. It is rarely reported but a substantial number of people are reconsidering their sexual preferences at any given time. Though I believe that there are some people (certainly some asexuals) for whom it is determined at birth and is a lifelong thing. But I don't believe it to be true in every case. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamantha_of_Cardyke_ac2d.html" title="User:Samantha of Cardyke">Samantha of Cardyke</a> 07:56, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sorry for misrepresenting you, then. I would agree that many (and probably most) asexuals would keep to that orientation, but unless an orientation is rooted completely in biology, it can change. For instance, Bogaert's article suggests that asexuality for some individuals may result from deeply-seeded religious convictions regarding purity or such. But if asexuality were socially constructed in this fashion, it is easy to see how for instance change in religious belief or practice may eventually result to a change in sexual orientation. (Just to give one example.) I don't think you can say that a sexual orientation is "inherent" to an individual without saying that nurture plays no role whatsoever. If orientation is socially constructed in even the slightest sense, then it is also conceivable it can be deconstructed. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 08:08, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would ask that you remain <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a>. Queer theory is not some "pet theory" of mine, and I do not wholly espouse it. However, it is exceptionally well regarded and well known (the theory actually receives well over 3x as many hits as "theory of gravity" on Google) and represents a point of view that would be absent from the article. Queer theory applies to asexuality because asexuality is a "queer" orientation as that word is used by theorists. I think to say anything is inherent is to say it's permanent, because inherent (in the sense you're using it) means an essential characteristic, and essential means fundamental, necessary, or representing the fixed essence of, which puts us right back where we were. As far as I can tell, there's only been one serious study devoted to human asexuality, which is the Bogaert article referenced in the article. This author does not jump to the essentialist conclusion that asexuality is "inherent", and accepts that some asexuals may have completely normal sexual functioning but see themselves as asexual for other reasons: "In other words, there may be a group of so-called "true" asexual people (defined as those who lack sexual attraction for partners of either sex) who show no physiological response to stimuli with males or females as sexual targets and another group of individuals who show typical attraction and arousal patterns and yet report, label, or perceive themselves as being asexual for various reasons (e.g., not aware of own arousal; deny arousal)." <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 07:55, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Once again: "queer theory" appears to be only applied in peer reviewed study to homosexuality and bisexuality. You are only assuming that it applies to asexuality, which would fall under "original research" and therefore is outside the realm of verifiability (the rules of which I previously linked to you). It is therefore inadmissable to this article's content. It has also already been explained several times to you by both I and others that the word "inherently" is <i>not</i> being used to imply permanence, merely a character which is not necessarily permanent, and you repeating ad-nauseum that it is will not change that. I'd also like to note that the context of your quote is referring to hypothetical <i>future</i> research, not the findings of the article. --<a href="../../../x/o/m/User%7EXombie_f3f3.html" title="User:Xombie">Xombie</a> 16:51, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think it's "original research" because theorists have said rather explicitly that Queer Theory applies broadly. Quoting T. A. Dowson, Robert J. Wallis says that queer theory is "open to 'anyone who feels their position (sexual, intellectual or cultural) to be marginalised'" (<i>World Archaeology</i> 32(2):253.). For that matter, Wikipedia is not a peer reviewed scientific journal, and any widespread theoretical approach should be represented. And as I keep saying, I believe "inherently" does require permanence. And I wish you would take this claim seriously instead of presuming it is rhetoric. You have not adequately demonstrated to me that "essential characteristic" does not require permanence. And certainly his point was regarding future research, but that does not dismiss the fact that he says asexuality is hypothetically compatible with a regular sex drive. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 17:34, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As for the Bogaert article, in context it is not evidence of anything at all.

<dd>I'm not saying that queer theory needs to be introduced, I'm simply suggesting that all points of view should be respected in the opening definition. Neither Bogaert or the Kinsey study claim or argue in any way that asexuality is "inherent". In fact, the Kinsey study notes that there is no precise definition of asexuality and that some studies of asexuality have categorized people with low rather than no sexual desire as asexuals. So to make a factual claim that asexuality is "inherent" is blatantly POV, and one you still have not substantiated with a source. Note also that this article is about asexuality as it is identified in human beings, and not asexuality as a general biological process. I also have yet to see how asexuality could be confused with celibacy, because the former is concerned only with sexual desire where the latter is concerned only with sexual behavior. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 21:25, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

If someone is so deeply religious that they can't stand the thought of having sex, does that count as asexuality? To me, that's repression, or at the very least, a Clockwork Orangesque way of making someone "asexual." As I said before, I think the one common thread among the different people who describe themselves as asexual is that they don't feel they are repressing anything, and they only know that there's something "wrong"/different because sex is flaunted everywhere in society. Celibates, on the other hand, know full well what they're doing. But people often tell asexuals they're just "repressing" or "you just haven't met the right person" or other such lines, so apparently society as a whole can't make the distinction either. Maybe a more basal way of putting it is (as I said in another discussion up above), asexuals are generally comfortable being who they are, whereas people with sexual dysfunction <i>want</i> to have sex but physiologically can't. If it's not "inherent," isn't it a choice? Maybe I'm still missing a piece of the puzzle here. --<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirdhombre_7569.html" title="User:Birdhombre">Birdhombre</a> 21:44, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your choices on the matter:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1.) Both I and Birdhombre offered M-W as a source for the definition. As stated before, our intention with the word fits within the definition. What you personally understand the word as carries no more weight than what we understand it as, such is the nature of semantics. If your problem is with people pushing that asexuality is inborn, we aren't, and have explained how we are not. The dispute with that dispute is therefore solved, as the word is indeed applicable.</dd>
<dd>2.) You keep saying that you disagree with "inherent" yet have refused several offers to replace it with another word. If your problem is with the definition of the word, surely you have no problem with another word to replace it. Stating again: the intention is not to push that asexuality is purely inborn and biological. This solution is perfectly reasonable and will aleviate your fears that anyone will mistake the word for a definition implying inborn trait. I suggest the word "necessarily".</dd>
<dd>3.) You are welcome to proceed with more formal dispute resolution. I am unwilling to continue this debate, as it has gone on for longer than any on this page with no resolution. --<a href="../../../x/o/m/User%7EXombie_f3f3.html" title="User:Xombie">Xombie</a> 21:55, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1) I know what definition you selected. "Involved in the constitution or essential character of something", and as the dictionary then states, this means "belonging by nature or habit". These are not separate definitions, they mean the exact same thing. To say it is in the nature of an asexual to not experience sexual attraction is to suggest it is something deeply rooted and beyond change. It's taking one extreme end. The other extreme would be to say that asexuals are people who choose to avoid feelings of sexual desire. We shouldn't take either extreme, we should take a NPOV.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2) I've refused offers to replace it with another word because
<dl>
<dd>a) you never demonstrated why a word is needed there</dd>
<dd>b) you never gave a source defining asexuality in a way that would require any such word</dd>
<dd>c) I fail to see why a word is needed there</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I <i>can</i> however, see your complaint. But I don't think we can fix it by adding a word there. What we <i>need</i> to do is create a better definition. My suggestion is "Asexuality is a general term or self-designation for people who find sexual behavior unappealing." This makes it very clear that asexuality is not celibacy, because most celibates may find sexual behavior appealing without actually wanting to engage in it. I think unappealing is a good choice (meaning "not appealing to the senses") because it's fairly neutral with regard to nature and nurture, and neither implies rigidity or flexibility. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 01:45, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Psychologically Withdrawn From Sexual Desires</span></h2>
<p>Could it be possible that asexuality is caused by psychological repulsion towards sexual activities? People molested at a young age could perhaps mentally withdraw themselves from sexuality and live upon this, telling themselves that they do not want to engage in affairs pertaining to sex. I think of myself as an asexual because I am not sexually attracted to either gender. This might be caused by my parents persistent reminder that sexual intercourse is to reproduce, but like the dissimilarity between refusing cake because of a diet or just not wanting any, there is a vast difference between celibacy and asexuality. Or perhaps I, like many others, am too occupied with the brusqueness of reality and the pressure to stay a fruitful investment for my parents. This brings me two other dilemmas: 1. Is there something wrong with the way I function considering the years I am in now are the ones where hormones are at their peak, hence causing an array sexual desires (or supposed to, anyways)? 2. If I am normal, what about everyone else? Have their sexual desires surpassed the importance of their well being? <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheau_The_GOD_7c13.html" title="User:Cheau The GOD">Cheau The GOD</a> 22:29, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Contradiction and Inconsistancy</span></h2>
<p>This article seems to have a big problem with inconsistently confusing celebacy with asexuality. In the beginning of the article much care is given to convey the ambiguity that surrounds the definition of asexuality, and in the last line of the section titled <i>Variations</i> ("Note that asexuality is not the same as celibacy, which is the deliberate abstention from sexual activity; many asexuals do have sex, and most celibates are not asexual.") a clear and correct distinction is made between celebacy and asexuality, But in the very next section (titled <i>Asexuality and religion</i>) this view is abandoned and priests, nuns, etc. are labled asexual rather than the more correct and accepted term: celebate. There is no evidence that these religous leaders did not experience sexual desires, they were merely remaining celebate as they believed it would please and honor God. Therefore I am removing this statement, as well as changing the next sentence from "many conservative Christians" to "some conservative Christians" since the word "many" implies some sense of amount which we have no evidence to support any knowledge of, and the word "some" does not imply any sort of amount other than that there is more than none.</p>
<p>The same inconsistancy is appearant in the first line of the section titled <i>Asexuality in fiction</i> which labels a charecter who is devoting his life to chastity as asexual rather than celebate. Also, the first sentence of the next line seems more like an "I told you so" piece of evidence to support the earlier comments that sexuality is supressed in certain religions, and is definately not a good example of asexuality in fiction. I am therefore removing both of them. --<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirabile_Dictu_eb94.html" title="User:Mirabile Dictu">Mirabile Dictu</a> 21:45, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Word Choice</span></h2>
<p>I've noticed a lot of strange generalities in this article, such as here: "...some asexuals believe that their lack of "base desires" allows them to feel a deeper spirituality, although other asexuals consider that an elitist attitude." Such uses of generalities create a sense of questionable accuracy. Was a national poll conducted on this subject? All of the wording seems to suggest a sense of myth or "he-said, she-said" -- it has a feel of "I heard it on the grapevine". Am I the only person with this objection?</p>
<dl>
<dd>What precisely is your objection? You said yourself there's probably been no research or information-gathering on the subject, so how else exactly can anything be said on the subject without citing anecdotal references? So long as anecdotal references are clearly marked as such, they are perfectly reliable sources of what is the current state of widely-disseminated knowledge (or lack of it) on the subject. A citation is no more a garantor of accuracy than the lack of one ought to discredit an argument.</dd>

<p>- It seems perfectly feasible to me that shyness, celibacy, introversion et al be traits with free reign to co-exist or otherwise with 'asexuality'. The above stated perceived 'conditions' are simply other entities complete with their own templates of individual premise and philosophy. Overlaps could exist, although it would be no less probable for them not to.</p>
