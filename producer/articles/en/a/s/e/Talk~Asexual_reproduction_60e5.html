<p>I think additional information is required for asexual reproduction. There is no mention of other methods of asexual reproduction other than binary fission. I think that budding, regeneration, fragmentation, and Parthenogenesis should also be mentioned. User:Seatown, 28 September 2005</p>

<p>Parthenogenesis is a specific case of asexual reproduction but the Parthenogenesis article is confused; starting with a specific form (Parthenogenesis) and then moving to the general (Asexual reproduction) and then to other forms of Asexual reproduction. We need one article to overview Asexual reproduction and then deal in turn with each form. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 01:17, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article on parthenogenesis is sufficiently long (longer than this article) and detailed that I think is should remain as a separate article, though just a bit more focused. The overview article should be here, with "{{main}} templates used in each article to refer to the other article. I no one else wants to take a shot at it, I will, though I'll probably botch it a bit (that what other editors are for, per <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">WP:BB</a>); I'd prefer that someone who knows more biology work this instead. (The goal is to minimize duplication/overlap, while having enough information in each article that <i>is</i> duplicate to provide a bit of context, and to point the reader to the other article if he/she wants more details.) <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 17:26, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The <i>Parthenogenesis</i> article only looks long because of things that shouldn't be there&#160;:-) <i>Asexual reproduction versus sexual reproduction</i> for example should be here.

<dd>No not merge. Parthenogenesis is asexual reproduction, in organisms that normally reproduce sexually (in the majority of animals) It's not as simple as other forms of asexual reproduction, such as binary fission. So no, do not merge these articles. Clean them up yes, do not merge.--<a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHoneymane_ba48.html" title="User:Honeymane"><font color="red" face="Old English Text MT, Papyrus">Honeymane</font></a><sub><a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHoneymane_56f3.html" title="User talk:Honeymane"><font face="KlingonTNG, New Times Roman">Heghlu meH QaQ jajvam</font></a></sub> 07:33, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do not merge, these are not the same thing.67.188.59.33 23:47, 24 January 2007 (UTC)Chris</p>
<p>The logical thing to do would be to have an article named "Asexual Reproduction" and then list the different types of asexual reproduction under that article. Only if a type of asexual reproduction (in this case, Parthenogenesis) requires more detail or explanation, with possible different types in itself, should that type receive it's own article. In this case, a separate article for Parthenogenesis should <i>not</i> describe any other form of Asexual Reproduction unless used to distinguish a similar process from that of Parthenogenesis. A link to the Parthenogenesis article should be in the Asexual Reproduction article as well as the Parthenogenesis article linking to the other types of asexual reproduction (or an asexual reproduction article). 24.182.131.171 04:11, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Do not merge. I agree with honeymane that parthenogenesis is a distinctive enough for its own article for the reasons given. Descriptions of other forms of asexual reproduction in the parthenogenesis article in excess of what is needed to diferentiate them from parthenogenesis could be moved to the main asexual reproduction article. The two are more articles should link to each other as suggested by 24.182.131.171. Ferritecore 22:33, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I strongly agree with 24.182.131.171. There should be different articles for "Asexual production" and "Parthenogenesis". The "Asexual production" page should provide just a brief description of asexual productions and a list of them, with links to the distinct articles if more detailed information is available. The same applies to other articles relating to asexual production. The "Parthenogenesis" page should consist of parthenogenesis only, not other kinds of asexual production. The merge should not take place; rather, a full revise of both articles should be done. I doubt my ability to perform such a big task; however, I will be very content to provide helps in any ways. 石川 09:09, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think moving <i>Asexual reproduction versus sexual reproduction</i> from the parthenogenesis article here is a good idea. I don't think the two articles should be merged though. Parthenogenesis is hardly the only form of asexual reproduction. I found that most asexual reproduction mechanisms have their own pages already anyway, they just need to be filled in with more detailed content. This article should be an overview for all of them with links leading to individual mechanisms such as parthenogenesis. - <a href="../../../t/a/m/User%7ETameeria_af89.html" title="User:Tameeria">tameeria</a> 22:40, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've moved the general discussion of asexual versus sexual reproduction to this article and added other mechanisms of asexual reproduction and links to the main articles for each section. The parthenogenesis article is now more specific for parthenogenesis. That made the most sense to me and seemed to be along what has been suggested. I'm not sure about moving gynogenesis and hybridogenesis out of the parthenogenesis article. At least gynogenesis seems to be a related mechanism, only requiring an additional activation step. - <a href="../../../t/a/m/User%7ETameeria_af89.html" title="User:Tameeria">tameeria</a> 02:12, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article states that ferns do sporogenesis without meiosis. That's new to me - I've learned that they produce spores via meiosis which then grow into gametophytes producing egg and sperm cells which undergo fertilization and give rise to the new sporopyte generation. Can someone provide a reference for mitotic sporogenesis in ferns?</p>
<p>However, in some fungi sporogenesis does happen without meiosis, e.g. conidiospore formation in Aspergillus for example. That needs to be added to the article. - <a href="../../../t/a/m/User%7ETameeria_af89.html" title="User:Tameeria">tameeria</a> 04:12, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've searched high and low and couldn't find any references other than those saying that all plant spores are the result of meiosis. So until someone comes up with a valid reference for mitosporogenesis in ferns, that information should be removed as possibly wrong. I've corrected/changed the paragraph to address mitospore formation in fungi and some algae instead. - <a href="../../../t/a/m/User%7ETameeria_af89.html" title="User:Tameeria">tameeria</a> 16:28, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Parthenogenisis is a form of asexual reproduction so surely it should be part of this article.</p>

<p>Be bold. "Asexual Reproduction" is identical to Parthenogenesis. We are not limiting organisms to one kind of reproduction here. It's a lot of work, and if it's done right, then it will persist.</p>
<p>This is how: 1. Pick the better article based on the title. 2. Include the worse article in the better article. You might want to open two</p>
<pre>
  windows for this.
  This means that it should mention that some parthenogenic organisms
  also reproduce with sex. It should snip the merjer sujestion.
  Note that parthenogenically is bigger than asexually, so it
  should occur once, if at all.
</pre>
<p>3. Paste the superior article under the best title. 4. Copy all of the comments from the inferior article to the superior one. 5. Replace the entire inferior article with #REDIRECT [[]] to the superior title.</p>
<pre>
  In this case, I think "asexual reproduction" should show Parthenogenesis as the
  technical term that people don't typically know. Both terms should be occur 
  in the document, but remember George Orwell's rule.
</pre>
<p>I would do it myself, but I hav a similar job to do with HTML, first. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrewhaha%40edmc.net_dd38.html" title="User:Brewhaha@edmc.net">Brewhaha@edmc.net</a> 11:48, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree with a complete merge/redirect. This has been also discussed before and the consensus seemed to be that they should not be merged (see above). Asexual reproduction is not identical with parthenogenesis. Instead, parthenogenesis is one subtopic of many in the broader context of asexual reproduction.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There was some overlap, but I already merged some general text from the parthenogenesis article here earlier to reduce overlap. Should the merge tag be taken off the page? Or is more discussion needed? - <a href="../../../t/a/m/User%7ETameeria_af89.html" title="User:Tameeria">tameeria</a> 17:53, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
