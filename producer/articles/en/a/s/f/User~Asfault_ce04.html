    <i>A Nickles Journey</i>   
</pre>
<p>This is a great little children's story wrote by a very inspiring author, Chris (He only uses his first name for uknown reasons). He was inspired to write this book when he was only 14 when his English teacher told his class to write a children's story. He had no idea what to write about at first but while he was brainstorming his eye caught sight of a nickle. He imagined what it would like to be a nickle, going from place to place, seeing knew people, or even being stuck in a piggy bank. He then decided to write a story about it. Although it was a very good story and could do well on the market, he decided not to go through the trouble of publishing it. So Chris has allowed for his complete story to be shown here on this site so that other children can read and enjoy it. He also hopes that others writers would be inspired by his story and to write more great children's stories. Below is the complete and original version of the story.</p>
<p><b>A Nickels Journey</b></p>
<pre>
- by: Chirs
</pre>
<p>There once was a nickel named Nick. He was stuck in a piggy bank owned by an eight year old boy. Nick was sad because he wanted to see the world. He had been stuck in that piggy bank since the boy’s first birthday. He was bored of talking to the same old pennies, quarters, other nickels and dimes. He was tired of only being able to see the depressing, pink and rubber bank walls. He wanted to meet new change and maybe even some dollars. He longed to hear new voices, see new pockets, cash registers and banks. So everyday he would sit, wait and hope the boy would spend him One day when Nick was doing his usual grieving he over heard the boy and his father talking “Dad I need a new baseball bat,” the boy said “Son, I just bought you a new video game. I’m not buying you anything else,” the father said in a tired, stressed voice. “But I really, really, really need a new one. My old one is to small and my first baseball game is this Saturday,” the boy exclaimed. “You know, you do have your own money that you’ve been saving since forever,” the father said annoyed. Nick froze. Maybe this is my chance to get out of this joint, Nick thought to himself. “Fine! I’ll use my own money if I have to,” the boy said. Nick could hear the boy’s foot steps growing louder and louder. He saw the top of the bank slowly twisting off then CRASH! The boy had poured all his money on the floor. He grabbed change left and right. Nick could see his lips move as he counted “I need five more cents,” he said. Nick held his breath. It seemed like forever, he would have been sweating if he could. Then finally, the boy whisked Nick out of the pile. Nick’s heart was filled joy and he couldn’t wait for what was next. The boy took his money to the sports store. As the boy traveled up and down the isles, Nick thought about his future ahead of him. No more depressing days in the depressing piggy bank walls and no more talking to the same change every single passing day Nick thought. Finally the boy picked out a bat he liked and took it to the cash register. Nick felt his heart leap as the boy grabbed him out of his pocket and gave him to the man working behind the counter. The man stuffed him in the cash register and shut it. The cash register was dark and cold and smelled a little funny but it wasn’t the piggy bank and that was all that mattered to Nick. “Isn’t this great” Nick said to the other nickel beneath him. “What are you talking about boy,” the other nickel said in a scratchy voice. “You know, being able to see the world and meet new money,” Nick said in an excited voice. “Are you kidding me? The economy is a nauseating life style,” the nickel said. “You get tossed around from here to there and you never get a break. I would kill to live in some child’s piggy bank right now.” Nick thought about this for a little bit. Ahh he’s just grumpy anything is better then the piggy bank Nick thought. Then whoosh! The cash register snapped open and the man crammed more money in and then slammed it shut. This happened repeatedly all the day. Nick got so dizzy, he felt he was going to throw-up. Finally the store closed and everything was still. “Is every day in a cash register like that?” Nick asked the nickel beneath him. “Pretty much,” he said “unless you’re in an ice cream store during the winter time” That night Nick tried to sleep but it was very uncomfortable and scary in the cash register. In the piggy bank he knew all the money. Here he didn’t know anyone. It was also dark in the cash regiter. Even at night in the piggy bank it was light because it was right next to the boy’s night light. But that didn’t bring down his spirit; he still had hope for the future. The next day during the hustle and bustle, when the cash register was opening and closing, he got snatched up from his place and put in a man’s hand who was buying a baseball mitt (he was used for change). The man looked to be around in his thirties, he was well dressed and groomed, and looked in a hurry. He stuffed Nick into his suit pocket, ran out of the store and jumped into his BMW. This should be interesting Nick thought this man looks like he can take me places. The pocket was dark and full of lint and it had a little slip on the top so he could see partially out of it. The man drove really fast and was constantly talking on the cell phone. “What do you mean you haven’t finished the presentation yet!” the man yelled into his phone “if you don’t have that done by the time I get there you’re fired! Is that clear? I’ll be there in about a half hour I just got to stop by my son’s birthday party real quick.” Then the man hung up and started talking to someone else. Nick was so nervous because the man drove so recklessly. He also hoped he didn’t treat his change the same way he treated his employees. Finally the car came to a shrieking halt. Nick almost flew out of the man’s pocket. The man rushed out of the car and bolted to the backyard with the mitt he bought in his hand. Nick hated when he ran because he would jump around the pocket like a jumping bean and would almost fly out. The man started to talk to his family and Nick listened. “Hey Billy I bought you a present,” the man said “Your late again” Billy said annoyed then he opened the present. “A baseball mitt I don’t even play baseball; I play football!” “Ohh I was sure you played baseball,” the man said sheepishly. “Are you staying at least?” the boy asked. “No I got to work,” the man said “Why? You always work. Why can’t you just spare a little bit of time with me on my birthday,” the boy said. “Kid, I got projects to do and people to meet. I don’t have any time to spare. Plus you’re six years old, you can handle it,” the man said annoyed. Then a female voice arose. Nick assumed it was the mother. “Ahh don’t you ever care about your family John!” she said angrily “You never have any time for us. You’re so wrapped up in that stupid snobby corporate job. You don’t even know your own son!” “Now hold on, lets not point fingers…,” the man said offended. “No! I’m tired of waiting for you. I’m done dealing with you and your job.” She said angrily. Then Nick heard a door slam in the distance. Nick was appalled. What a bad father he thought. He was used to the boy’s father at his old home, he was kind and understanding. All the rest of that day the man took Nick everywhere, from coffee shops, to business meetings, to sales calls etc. The man never slowed down, never walked, and never followed the speed limit. He got to know another penny that was also inside the pocket but he was just like the nickel in the register, mad at the world. Finally, when the man was running to a coffee shop for his 6th coffee of the day (Nick thought that had to be unhealthy) Nick fell out of the man's pocket and clunked on the side walk. It had rained before so it was wet ant dirty. Nick felt so miserable but he couldn’t quite figure out why. He soon developed a throbbing headache from all the people that stepped on him while walking by.</p>
<pre>
  When night fell it was cold, dark and very scary.  He kept hearing strange noises and strange shadows.  He felt he was going to cry.  Then to his surprise he saw a woman walking all alone on the street. That’s not very smart Nick thought.  Then all of a sudden a man jumped from around the corner, took her purse and then sprinted away.  The woman screamed and disappeared as she chased him around the corner.  Now Nick was really scared and he felt bad for the change in that purse.  Then it started to rain. How could this get any worse? Nick thought.  Then Nick felt a feeling he thought he would never experience.  He felt home sick.  The piggy bank was still and quiet.  The boy who owned him and his family were nice also. He knew all the money there and they where happy and kind.  The nickel in the cash register was right Nick thought the economy is a nauseating life style.  
</pre>
<p>Nick tried to sleep that night but he was unsuccessful. All he could think about was how much he missed the old days in the piggy bank. The next day when the town was hustling and bustling again he hoped he would at least get picked up of the street. Every once in a while, a child would pick him up and say “Hey look a nickel,” then put him back down. Why do kids do that he thought. Then a boy picked him up and said the usual “hey look a nickel,” but this voice sounded familiar to Nick. Nick looked up and to his joy it was the boy! “Why don’t you put it in your piggy bank when you get home” his father said. “Great idea,” the boy replied and put him in his pocket. Yes, great idea Nick thought with overwhelming happiness. When the boy got home he but Nick in the piggy bank where he was welcomed by his old friends and he never felt unhappy in the piggy bank again.</p>
