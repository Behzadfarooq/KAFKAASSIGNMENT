<dd>Of course "illegitimate" is pejorative. There is no need to use a pejorative term when there are so many value-neutral ways of communicating the same fact.

<p>Actually, she is an activist lecturing the community on morality and gender issues. Her positions on sexuality outside of marriage and sexual morality are entirely relevent; she even champions them in her "Bill of Rights". If you want a more neutral sounding term, say "child outside of marriage" rather than "illegitimate son". 12 April 2006.</p>

<p>CltFn, please stop removing the image of Nomani that I put in the article. If you really believe that I am a liar and this is not my photograph, that "the source is not verifiable," then by all means file a complaint and ask that it be listed for deletion. You have absolutely no case. No editor uploading a photograph is required to <i>prove</i> the source or copyright, which is impossible in the upload notes anyway. We are only required to state it. You of all people are the last to lecture on the sources of photographs, considering that you continually upload pictures without proper source and copyright information, for which you have been frequently rebuked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:CltFn#Images" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:CltFn#Images" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:CltFn%5CArchive_2#Image_Tagging_Image:MuslimCroatsHandschar.JPG" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:CltFn%5CArchive_2#Image_Tagging_Image:MuslimCroatsHandschar.JPG" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:CltFn%5CArchive_2#no_source" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:CltFn%5CArchive_2#no_source" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:CltFn%5CArchive_2#Shoebat_images" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:CltFn%5CArchive_2#Shoebat_images" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:CltFn%5CArchive_2#Image" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:CltFn%5CArchive_2#Image" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> by administrators. In fact that very picture I was talking about earlier, Pearl with Nomani, was finally deleted after you failed to provide satisfactory source information. As for your objection to Nomani making a "grimace," she was not, it was just normal speech. I happen to admire and respect this author. This picture is a great deal better than the one you prefer, which is blurry and of inferior quality. What's more, it shows Nomani accepting an award form a gay Muslim advocacy organization, which has a linked article in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 06:27, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't have any other useful pictures from that event, I wish I did because it's so unfortunate that a regular snapshot during the course of normal speech should be seen as unflattering. However, I will contact some other photographers and see if they have one where she looks as <i>bland</i> as possible without the remotest chance of raising any of these objections, and see if they are willing to grant a free license to Wikipedia for said photograph.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 16:42, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Babajobu, it's a small thing, but I see you removed "what she sees as her right to pray" with the men, and changed it to "her right." I'm not sure we can assert that someone has a right to pray in a certain area of private buildings. It's not a legal right, and given that many philosophers will tell you there's no such thing as a moral right, it's not clear what kind of right we'd be saying it is. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 06:33, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The way it's worded does suggest WP is saying she has that right: "Nomani became the first woman in her mosque in West Virginia to insist on the right to pray in the male-only main hall ..." <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 06:35, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Slim, I agree with those philosophers who say there is no such thing as a moral right. Perhaps that's why when I read "insists on her right" it doesn't occur to me that this asserts that the right exists on any fundamental level, but only that she insists on acquiring that right in the context of the mosque. However, if other readers interpret "insists on her right" as positing the objective existence of that right, then clearly it can be regarded as POV and you can go ahead and change it back. But I have to tell you, when I read "what she sees as her right", I read it as at least weakly implying that the right is a spurious one. Not sure if other readers do. And not sure where that leaves us. Still, if you want to revert, that's fine, I'm a newcomer to this article and am happy to take in the scene a bit before getting imperious about my edits.&#160;;-) <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 06:54, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

But not at the cost of running a picture that looks so silly. This is not a criticism of your camera work: you just happened to catch her at a very awkward moment. Of course, we do prefer to run free license pictures rather than fair use pictures...but we also prefer to run pictures that are typical of a subject's appearance rather than ones that make them look extremely awkward. You say we "are determined to find fault with a perfectly normal picture". What, may I ask, would be our motivation for doing this?

I do understand what you're saying. I was thrown for a loop with that absurd and fabricated attack on the source of my photograph; and mistakenly grouped the other objections in the same light. I never personally saw anything like a grimace in the picture. I suppose this is because in my mind's eye I remember the pleasant speech she gave. It's just an unfortunate timing of the shutter in other people's eyes, I suppose. I don't have any other pictures of her that will do, but like I said in the previous section, I will be making some enquiries.

<p>Hmmm...well we seem to have multiple IPs who all agree that it's important that her child be identified as "illegitimate", even though this is a pejorative term used to communicate a point that is already expressed in a value-neutral manner elsewhere in the article.

My reasons are detailed in the article history, separate for each sentence, after my previous edit was reverted. I beg the editors to get themselves familiar with <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">the policy about bios of living persons</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">rules of attribution</a>. Colleague <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESky7i_219c.html" title="User:Sky7i">Sky7i</a>, I am not questioning your edit comment: "Note that these statements simply report the reality of how her message has been received; not my judgments". I am saying that these judgements are not supported by proper references. Not to say that the first sentence of the deleted paragraph is poorly formulated, so that it is in fact wrong, although I understand what it intended to say. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 01:40, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
