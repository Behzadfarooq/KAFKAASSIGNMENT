<p>While indeed that sentence allows for sidequels, "if part of a trilogy or series" that follows it narrows the definition sufficiently already; also "specific film series" is mentioned.

<p>Quite. Look at it the other way, is Peoples in a position of authority to make Soldier part of the Blade Runner universe? No. Three individuals who would be, are Ridley, Fancher and Dick. Apart from that the Partnership is the one to look to; and they would be in the position to declare Soldier a sidequel.

<dd>We both agree that Soldier is not an official sidequel, but an unofficial sidequel. The question isn't one of authority. The question is, should Followed by list unofficial sidequels or not? The syntax guide allows is (unofficial sidequels certainly fall into "related film that came out after"), but the style guide could be wrong (and need to be corrected). But, in the end, I think there is no harm and some utility in listing Soldier in the infobox. Perhaps flagged there as "unofficial"? -- <a href="../../../j/h/u/User%7EJHunterJ_08ee.html" title="User:JHunterJ">JHunterJ</a> 11:38, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am of the opinion that since it is not an official sequal, nor even an unoffical sequal realy, that it should not be listed in the infobox. The infobox "followed by" should be reserved for real offical sequals.<br />

Regardless of what the infobox syntax says and how it can be interperated, Soldier is not a real follow up film to Blade Runner. Just because Peoples says Soldier takes place in the same universe does not make it a follow up movie in the sense of a sequel. Since it is unofficial and not part of any Blade Runner franchise, it shouldn't be listed.<br />
