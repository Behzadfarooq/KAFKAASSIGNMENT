	    <p>Human resource management From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Human Resource Management) Jump to: navigation, search Human Resource Management (HRM) is both an academic theory and a business practice which address the theoretical and practical techniques of managing a workforce. The theoretical discipline is based primarily on the assumption that employees are individuals with varying goals and needs, and as such should not be thought of as basic business resources, such as trucks and filing cabinets. The field takes a positive view of workers, assuming that virtually all wish to contribute to the enterprise productively, and that the main obstacles to their endeavors are lack of knowledge, insufficient training, and failures of process.</p>
<p>HRM is seen by practitioners in the field as a more innovative view of workplace managment than the traditional approach. Its techniques force the managers of an enterprise to express their goals with specificity so that they can be understood and undertaken by the workforce, and to provide the resources needed for them to successfully accomplish their assignments. As such, HRM techniques, when properly practiced, are expressive of the goals and operating practices of the enterprise overall.</p>
<p>The field also encompasses the sometimes arcane details of what is traditionally referred to as personnel management. Personnel management as a term describes those activities that are necessary in the recruiting of a workforce, providing its members with payroll and benefits, and administrating their work-life needs. In many locales, these activities can require a considerable amount of regulatory knowledge and effort, and many enterprises can benefit from the recruitment and development of personnel with these specific skills.</p>

<p>[edit] Academic Theory The basic premise of the academic theory of HRM is that humans are not machines. Therefore we need to have an interdisciplinary examination of people in the workplace. Therefore fields such as psychology, industrial and organizational psychology, sociology, and critical theories: postmodernism, post-structuralism play a major role.</p>
<p>[edit] Critical Theory Critics of HRM have noted that HRM suffers the problem of the connotation of its own name; treating humans as a resource. It is important to consider, as a special issue of the Journal "Organization" does, the aspects of which HRM are human and inhuman (Steyaert and Janssens: 1999).</p>
<p>Rhetoric has had an important consideration within the understanding of critical theory, of the rhetorics and realities of HRM (Legge 2005). Postmodernism and post-structuralism theories play an important part here because we can consider the importance of understanding and contemplating the reality of language and understanding.</p>
<p>Management Gurus &amp; Rationalism has had the effect of attempting to move academic theory into a rational and sellable product, which management gurus and consultants can sell to business leaders.</p>
<p>New Label: Some critics have noted that in practice, while the philosophy of HRM has changed the workplace, the department or manager who used to have "Personnel Manager" on their door, has now changed that sign to "Human Resource Manager" and that is the only change.</p>
<p>Empowerment has been noted as a HRM practice which by critics has been noted more as a pseudo-empowerment, based on attitudinal shaping (Wilkinson 1998).</p>
<p>Other such HRM practices have been noted as hidden within rhetoric, and many examples particularly within Call Centres are much more Orwellian, and hide the reality, through attitudinal shaping (Wilkinson 1998).</p>
<p>Human Resource Management is part of a business or company which recruits, develops and utilises an organisations personnel in the way which would benefit the firm's objectives. Creating alignment between an organisation's HRM strategy and the core objectives of a business is seen to be essential.</p>
