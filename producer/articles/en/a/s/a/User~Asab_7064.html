	    <p><b>DEBT-WATCH: BORROWER DEFENSE</b></p>
<p>This Wiki site has been created for the purpose of sharing information and experiences with disputing student loans. Although the federal and other loan programs are the best money you can buy to get excellent education, this may also be a one-way ticket into the Lender's Gulag.</p>
<p><b>Why the dichotomy?</b></p>
<p>The university defaults on its promise to prepare you for the career for which you have sought its faculty and resources. Your plans completely ruined, you push yourself another program and get a job. This is where the government decides to gouge your wages, and you do not even have recourse to the law under 34 CFR 685.206c, which is supposed to have provisions to fight the grip of the Lender's Gulag. Since most lawyers specializing in this area have only had experience with loan discharge within bankruptcy court (no longer an option for student loan borrowers) and the rest is either a specialist in easy cases (or may not want to jeopardize their children's chance to go to this particular school because it has such a fine law school), the Department of Education knows that you are on your own! Either death or disability will part you from this debt; otherwise you stay locked in this Gulag!</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Here is the scenario (the actual background)</b>:</p>
<p>You accept an offer of admission from an institution that everyoneâ€™s raving about. Your former professors' opinions also influence you to go to this school since you are also getting their letters of recommendation. All the brochures and information you receive (the Web then was not a resource yet to catch crooks) also reassures you of the excellent prospects you have by going to this university to complete your graduate studies for a Ph.D. So, you decline other offers, pack your stuff, grab your family, and move across the country to build your dreams. At the end of the road, you expect to enter a lucrative profession that is worth borrowing for. Everyone knows that the Ph.D. is the minimum requirement to enter a research field and land in a tenure-track post as professor, but the faculty at this university knows that even better: you are hooked on their mercy!</p>
<p>Since you need financial aid and the school did not offer you any merit-based financial support, you agree to go with work-study and loans. Believing in the integrity of the laws and the school's integrity, you sign the Promissory Note binding you to a future obligation to re-pay. You see no problem with it, because you plan to impress the faculty with your work and hopefully, you get to be considered for a teaching assistantship. This is where you start swallowing the first bitter pills.</p>
<p>The university declines granting you resident status after one year even if you prove that you have completely given up your previous domicile. OK, so they are one greedy bunch, but you decide to focus on your studies. You decide to work through your first year with near maximum course load (the tuition is the same after a certain number of credit hours) so you spend less time and money to complete the most critical phase of your pre-candidate year(s).</p>
<p>It turns out that certain critical library privileges are not even given to you because you are not a TA. You have to work outside school so you do not borrow too much. Here already, the school creates a two-tiered student body: one with privileges and the other one to fill the Gulag. You complain to the university's ombudsperson, they forward the letter to your department, the department gets even, and your life is ruined. You dared questioning their political games. You dispute your loan, and complain to the Education Department. They first do not take you seriously, but when you risk default status by refusing to pay, they start gouging your salary.</p>
<p>At the least, there appears to be a sweetheart deal between lenders and institutions to generate revenue at the ruined student's expense: Lenders give the school the tuition money, and the institution's job is to ruin lives. Since the student would still have to re-pay the debt, the lender is happy because of the long-term stream of money coming from interests and penalties. At the most, we can smell conspiracy that turns politicians into ostriches (no need to hide those heads in the sand).</p>
<p>Despite the legitimate arguments and documents (which prove departmental negligence) provided with your borrower defense, the Education Department's Administrative Wage Garnishment division moves against you. Your constitutional rights to unbiased hearing are cast aside, and you are then just a number in the Gulag!</p>
<p>This is a perfect case for a class action lawsuit, but this one requires determination and principled attorneys! This is not the case for borrowers who just do not feel like paying. Again, CFR 685.206(c) is one of your weapons to fight back. Here is how it reads (click on the link below):</p>
<p><a href="http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/08aug20031600/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2003/julqtr/34cfr685.206.htm" class="external text" title="http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/08aug20031600/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2003/julqtr/34cfr685.206.htm" rel="nofollow">34CFR685.206(c)</a></p>
<p>So, are you fighting and uphill battle? Your thoughts and suggestions are invited. A national dialogue may be necessary to bring Washington's attention to this kind of abusive demeanor from the Education Department and some university faculty. Otherwise, the Gulag will only grow!</p>
