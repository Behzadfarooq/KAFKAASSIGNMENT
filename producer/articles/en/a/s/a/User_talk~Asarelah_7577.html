<p>I didn't delete the stub tags; they're still there just invisible. Saying "this is a stub" more than once in an article is overkill, and stubs are not categories. Other than letting people know the article is a stub (which people can see for themselves without having it pointed out to them once, much less three times) stub tags put the articles in stub categories, so editors specializing in those fields can find articles there that need expansion.

<p>You'll have to take this up with not just me but with all the administrators who supported the decision to get rid of the GW Bush templates. I'm sure we can help you understand Wikipedia policies and practices better, and I'm glad you asked. The first thing you might want to do is review <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_ae03.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is</a> and <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>. Then let me know if you have questions regarding how this applies to the GW Bush template situation. Cheers, --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 04:48, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>One of the first things you need to realize is that Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">is not a bureaucracy</a>. "Process" does not trump everything else. In fact, <a href="../../../u/c/s/WP%7EUCS_6cee.html" title="WP:UCS">using common sense</a> is preferrable to slavishly sticking to a process that would lead to an undesirable outcome. You're right that there is no official userbox policy yet, and I doubt that there really is a need for one: userboxes are a strawman, what's really at issue here is the factionalism, divisivness, rallying around polarizing issues, and other bad influences of real-life political culture promoted not just by userboxes but also by user categories. However, just because a userbox policy may or may not be in the making doesn't mean that we suspend existing policies or throw out common sense along with them. Getting rid of the GW Bush templates was partly a common sense decision, but is firmly rooted in existing policies. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a>. You may have an opinion on Mr. Bush, but if someone creates a template to spread that opinion, they're broadcasting, they're up on the soapbox. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a blog</a>. Messages such as "I like/dislike George W. Bush" are not directed at Wikipedia but directed at the outside world. If you like/dislike Mr. Bush, no amount of me editing Wikipedia will change that. In fact, you wouldn't be talking to your fellow Wikipedians as Wikipedians, you would be talking to the outside world. Contrast that with project-directed speech: if you say "I believe &lt;topic X&gt; related articles are inherently notable and should be expanded and improved", then I can do something on Wikipedia to bring that about. Third, there is simply a pragmatic reason for getting rid of the GW Bush templates: as recent US federal elections have shown, he <i>is</i> a polarizing figure. Given the political realities and the real-life political culture, it's not surprising that bumper stickers about him will sound rude and polemical, no matter what side you're on. Per <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#T1" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#T1</a>, the polemical templates were deleted. Naturally, the sheer divisivness of these templates was confirmed when the side whose boxes were speedied started to list the boxes of the "other side" for deletion. It quickly became clear that there are only two long-term stable solution, only one of which is compatible with the fundamental mission and policies of Wikipedia: (1) Allow all Bush related templates. (2) Disallow all Bush related templates. Only (2) is viable. Option (1) violates all the policies and guidelines above.</p>
<p>Since we're on this topic, I'll mention a few more things that are wrong (but fixable) with the current userboxes. This is purely subjective and only concerns the issue of how templates and user pages can be improved. Consider your user page. Among the first things I see there: "This user is a native speaker of English. ... This user would like to be able to speak more languages." If this was an article, I would rewrite this as "I'm a native speaker of English and would like to be able to speak other languages." Similarly, "single female" instead of "This user is single" and "This user is female". The whole userbox box could be compressed into two short paragraphs without any loss of information. But then, I still wouldn't know about your level of interest in astronomy, or why you think registration should be required (and in what form) for editing. As things are, the bare boxes are just labels with no context, explanation, or background details. By contrast, look at <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Pomeroy_6ac2.html" title="User:Ashley Pomeroy">Ashley Pomeroy</a>'s user page. You can quickly get a sense of who he is, without him having to resort to boxes to do the work. For example: "If I want to look up a fact, I use Google. Google is the world's encyclopaedia. It allows me to evaluate several different sources of information." Compare that with: "This user uses Google as their primary search engine." Ashley's user page is a pretty damn brilliant piece of work, with a personal style that sets it apart from the sterile "This user ...." stickers. He is outspoken without ever coming close to being polemical. It's clear that he is talking about his own views, as opposed to hiding behind a third person attribution of views like "This user believes ..." (how does the box know what I believe?). That said, Wikipedia is not primarily about writing personal essays, but even less so about userboxes. Personal essays are vastly preferrable because they do not interfere with the rest of the project the way the misuse of the template namespace for userboxes does. And they're a lot more informative and fun to read. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 06:03, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As I've explained before, say what you want on your user page within the limits set by the ground rules, including <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Keep template transclusion to a minimum, and don't use the official template namespace for personal politics. All of this follows from existing policies. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 06:02, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Unclear as to why you deleted a category on the Piscataway Indian Nation page. Please don't do this-- and certainly, not without an explanation. Thank you. Polly Cumbo 00:54, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I didn't place the category there. It was already up--and placed there some time ago. From what I could tell, as intended, it provided a link to Turkey Tayac-- and then some. And no, your assumption is incorrect. While I helped with extensive edits on Turkey Tayac's piece, this is not about linking up or writing something about Billy Redwing Tayac. In any event, out of respect to the Piscataway Nation and Turkey Tayac, you should restore it to the way it was before you found it. If that irks, and you really do need to adhere to any and all wiki-rules in the wiki-world, of course, there's nothing to prevent you from coming up with a productive as opposed to a reductive compromise, eh? Now that would be appreciated by any and all. Best regards, Polly Cumbo 14:36, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I deleted this article after it was nominated for <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">Speedy Deletion</a> for failing to meet the notability requirement for biographies. In reviewing the article it also appeared to qualify for speedy deletion by virtue of being a very short article with little to no context.

You may want to have a look at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> for more information on notability guidelines.

<p>I noticed that when you wrote the stub, you added four stub tags, but commented out all but one of them. As a member of the Stub Sorting wikiproject, let me assure you that it's perfectly OK for multiple tags to be applied as long as they are all appropriate. I uncommented the tags, but deleted {{<a href="../../../u/s/-/Template%7EUS-writer-stub_98b1.html" title="Template:US-writer-stub">US-writer-stub</a>}}, since with academics and their need to publish or perish, unless they've written outside their field of expertise. or for a popular audience instead of an academic one, writer-stub is generally not considered appropriate for them, and the information in the stub did not indicate that he had done so. <span style="font-family:cursive"><a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a></span> <a href="../../../c/a/e/User_talk%7ECaerwine_f9c2.html" title="User talk:Caerwine"><small style="font-family:sans-serif;color:darkred">Caerwhine</small></a> 12:57, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Romannose.jpg</b>. I notice the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this file yourself, then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use it on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you did not create the file yourself, then you need to specify where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the file also doesn't have a copyright tag, then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media meets the criteria at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>, use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>.

<p>Hi there...</p>
<p>I was wondering what the reasoning was behind removing the <i>Native American tribes</i> category all over the place, but more specifically for the entry <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lakota.html" title="Lakota">Lakota</a>? I can see how it can be approprite to change this for the individuals, but for an actual tribe, it makes more sense to use the higher level category if you will... <a href="../../../g/a/l/User%7EGalar71_7ed7.html" title="User:Galar71">galar71</a> 20:46, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I removed the Native American tribes category for Hunkpapa and Miniconjou because they are subdivisions of the Lakota tribe. I removed the category "Native American tribes" becaue the Lakota tribe category is under the Sioux tribe category, and thus, placing it both the Lakota tribe category and the Sioux category into the Native American tribes supercategory would be redundant. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsarelah_4a68.html" title="User:Asarelah">Asarelah</a> 21:30, 14 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This however means that if anyone goes into the <i>Native American tribes</i> category, they are not going to find neither Lakota, Sioux or any of the lower levels... I would think that at least Lakota OR Sioux would need to be included in that category, otherwise the category ends up being useless. <a href="../../../g/a/l/User%7EGalar71_7ed7.html" title="User:Galar71">galar71</a> 23:07, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi Asarelah, you took out the anti-semitism category link on the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darien%2C_Connecticut_2fb2.html" title="Darien, Connecticut">Darien, Connecticut</a> page but I'm going to put it back in. You asked why it was even in there. The reason is because Darien had become known for anti-semitism and this was publicized enormously by the book and movie "Gentleman's Agreement" (Gregory Peck starred in it, Elia Kazan directed it). Previously, when I set up the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Darien%2C_Connecticut_6d66.html" title="History of Darien, Connecticut">History of Darien, Connecticut</a> page, I had taken out the section on that and stuck it in history. Now I think it's worth keeping a summary paragraph in the main town page, so I did that. That's the reason someone added the link to the anti-semitism category page.

As the Project reaches its first six months of activity, the great effort all of you have invested in it has turned the vast information available on Indigenous North American topics from a deorganized cumulous into an excellent and easy to consult database. Although much work is still in order, few WikiProjects are able to obtain the amazing results we are proud to show today. To all of you, thank you and congratulations!</td>

<p>However both categories are applicable because the Category:Women at war also includes articles about women in war generally, and the fact that these camps were set up with special sections for women soldiers is an important example for the general case.</p>

<p>If that's her only achievement then, no, not in my opinion. Some firsts are universally accepted as notable. Others are routine. There are currently 243 recognized countries. With a few exceptions like the <a href="../../../v/a/t/Vatican_City_edb3.html" title="Vatican City">Vatican City</a>, all of them either have or eventually will have a first female general - and a first female doctor - and a first female lawyer - and a first female (insert other stereotypically male-dominated profession here) - and a first Hispanic (continue the list ad infinitum). Some of them are notable <i>because</i> of their struggle to become the first. They overcame significant discrimination and adversity and blazed a trail for others to follow. Others simply came along at the right time but didn't have to struggle especially hard.</p>
<p>Army officers are professionals but are not inherently more notable than any other profession.

<p>Hello, I'm writing about your recent subcatgorizations in the Women in ancient warfare category. Do you really think that it is neccessary to have so many subcategories? There are only a few women that fit in each, and in the case of Japanese Women in ancient warfare, there is only one individual. I really think that these extra categories are far too narrow and specific and aren't neccessary at all, especially given how few women are even in the Women in ancient warfare supercategory to begin with. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsarelah_4a68.html" title="User:Asarelah">Asarelah</a> 00:11, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, they may grow, and the Roman sub-categories are useful as subcats of 'Ancient Roman enemies' etc. <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENeddyseagoon_820c.html" title="User:Neddyseagoon">User|Neddyseagoon</a> 00:11, 15 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I doubt that these categories will grow beyond a few more entries. I have been reading every book and every website that I can dig up about Women in ancient warfare, and there are only a few recorded examples in history of women acting as active participants. Furthermore, it isn't appropriate to put the Nubian women in warfare into the Female enemies of Rome category because Candace of Meroe wasn't an enemy of the Roman Empire, she was an enemy of Alexander the Great. It doesn't even say if Shanakdakheto even had any interactions with Rome at all. (Cartimandua was an ally of Rome, by the way, so she doesn't belong in the Female enemies of Rome either). There simply won't ever be enough articles in the supercategory of Women in Ancient Warfare to make any of these subcategories relevant. Trust me on this one. I've been researching the subject of Women in Ancient Warfare for months now.</dd>

<dd>But, however small, they make navigation easier, for we mere mortals who are unfamiliar with the topic - it is hard to tell, and my sub-cats mean they can then be linked to the relevant civilization.<a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENeddyseagoon_820c.html" title="User:Neddyseagoon">User|Neddyseagoon</a> 00:25, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why not simply place the articles themselves into the relevent category for each civilization? For example, Arsinoe III was already in the Hellenistic Egyptians category, so it anyone in that category would find her there. Arachidamia was in the Spartan princesses category, and so forth. Anyone looking at the categories for the civilizations would see each article there, rather than having to go through another subcategory. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsarelah_4a68.html" title="User:Asarelah">Asarelah</a> 00:31, 15 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, but Roman women involved in the Roman army, or barbarian queens which Rome faced, or Hellenistic queens in war, etc.etc. are important themes in themselves, deserving a sub-category within, say, Hellenistic Warfare, which shouldn't be subsumed into 'Hellenistic women' etc in general. And the same is probably true of the Chinese etc equivalents. Also, could we have this conversation just on my talk page, or just on yours - this is getting confusing!&#160;:-)<a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENeddyseagoon_820c.html" title="User:Neddyseagoon">User|Neddyseagoon</a> 10:40, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. I saw your edits adding organisations like <a href="../../../w/r/a/WRAF_a347.html" title="WRAF">WRAF</a> to two categories I'd started about "military people" in line with the WikiProject <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Military_history#Categorizing_military_people" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Military_history#Categorizing_military_people" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> so now I've started off again with a separate "all-female" category for the organisations.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>When using <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_substitution_a63d.html" title="Wikipedia:Template substitution">certain template tags</a> on talk pages, don't forget to <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_substitution_a63d.html" title="Wikipedia:Template substitution">substitute with text</a> by adding <b>subst:</b> to the template tag. For example, use {{subst:test}} instead of {{test}}. This reduces server load and prevents accidental blanking of the template.</p>

<p>I changed your category edit on the Aly &amp; AJ page from Category: Girl Groups back to Category: All-women bands. Aly &amp; AJ are young women, which is why they were in that category. Some other Users and I have been removing a lot of vandalism from the Aly &amp; AJ, Alyson Michalka, and Amanda Michalka pages, and we'd appreciate it if you'd try to help us keep those sites clean as opposed to burdening us with edits that we continually have to change.

<dd>I believe Aly &amp; AJ do play their own instruments and have been playing them since they were younger. Since Aly &amp; AJ are young women, it makes sense for them to go in the Category: All-women bands.</dd>

<p>I believe it is best to actually include the templates on the page itself. Adding the categories is highly confusing (this is coming from someone that has considerable experience sorting stubs). If you can show a Wikipedia policy stating that I am incorrect, then please show me and I will alter my habits. However, I believe my way of editing (which is also the way of every other stubsorter) is correct.--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas.macmillan_a8c6.html" title="User:Thomas.macmillan">Thomas.macmillan</a> 06:38, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm with Thomas on this: I think consistency and convenience trumps tidiness in this regard. Stub templates are the standard, accepted way of populating stub categories, and to mix and match the two just needlessly complicates matters. It's especially confusing when an article ends up with no actual stub tags at all, just "naked" stub categories, and this also causes problems and extra work when renaming stub categories (normally just a matter of editing the template), re-stubbing by 'bot, etc. An alternative would be to code a "stub box" or "multi-stub" template, that transcludes multiple stub templates and mutates their appearance, but no-one has managed to devise a means of doing so sufficiently cunning to meet with general approval. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 23:14, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I´m glad you enjoyed my articles of Margareta Elisabeth Roos and Ulrika Eleonora Stålhammar. I have cited my sources, but i'm afraid i could not find any source in english or in french! Swedish historical subjects are rare in any other languages than the scandianvians, but that is a reason in itself to put the articles in Wikipedia i suppose.--<a href="../../../a/c/i/User%7EAciram_e2e9.html" title="User:Aciram">Aciram</a> 09:55, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
