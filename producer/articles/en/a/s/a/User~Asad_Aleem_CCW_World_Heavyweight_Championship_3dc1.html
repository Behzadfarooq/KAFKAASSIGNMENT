<p>Nickfury, who earlier participated in the CCW World Heavyweight Championship tournament also needed an opportunity for the title. He had a match with Rocky. People were supporting Nickfury but they thought that Rocky would win by cheating but they were wrong.</p>
<p>They were wrong because when once again, the Thunder Gang appeared, Nick Fury went inside the ring and he didn't concentrate towards them even he threw Rocky over all of them. He then threw Rocky inside the ring and kicked him several times and then climbed over the turnbuckles and did a bad jump on Rocky and then he pinned Rocky to get his first CCW World Heavyweight Championship.</p>
