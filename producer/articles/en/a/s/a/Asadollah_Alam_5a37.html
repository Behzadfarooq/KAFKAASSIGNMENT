<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/a/Asadollah_Alam_5a37.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Alam was born in 1919 in <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birjand.html" title="Birjand">Birjand</a> and was educated at a British school in Iran. By a royal order from Reza Shah, Alam married Malektaj, the daughter of Qavam Al-Molk Shirazi. The son of Qavam ol-molk was then married to a sister of the Shah, <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashraf_Pahlavi_c5a5.html" title="Ashraf Pahlavi">Ashraf Pahlavi</a>. Shortly after desposing of the <a href="../../../q/a/j/Qajar.html" title="Qajar">Qajar</a> dynasty, Reza Shah intended to unite Iran's non-Qajar nobility through inter-marriage.</p>
<p>At the age of 26 he was appointed governor of <a href="../../../s/i/s/Sistan_and_Baluchistan_40af.html" title="Sistan and Baluchistan">Sistan and Baluchistan</a> province. At the age of 29 he became Minister of Agriculture in the cabinet of <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammad_Sa%27ed_d1f5.html" title="Mohammad Sa'ed">Mohammad Sa'ed</a>.He early displayed what an American acquaintance describes as a combination of native toughness and Y.M.C.A. dedication.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Assadollah Alam became the main landowner of Birjand after his father's death. He was one of Iran's first big landowners to distribute his holdings to the peasants, insisting that his servants eat the same food as his family. Once, when a would-be assassin was nabbed outside his door, Alam gave the man $40, then had him thrashed and sent into the street without his pants.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p><a name="Priemiership" id="Priemiership"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/a/Asadollah_Alam_5a37.html" title="Edit section: Priemiership">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Priemiership</span></h2>
<p>In 1953, Alam helped organize the counterrevolution that overthrew Dr. <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammad_Mossadegh_d3f1.html" title="Mohammad Mossadegh">Mohammad Mossadegh</a>. Alam was the director of the Pahlevi Foundation, a charitable trust worth at least $133 million, set up by the Shah to finance social-welfare plans out of the profits from royal holdings in banks, industries, hotels. In 1962, he served as Prime Minister at the age of 43.</p>
<p>As premier Assadollah Alam pledged to undertake "an anticorruption campaign with great diligence and all severity." Though the cynical snickered, Alam got free rein from the Shah, carefully began building airtight cases against suspected grafters among Iran's leading bureaucrats and government leaders. His first major target was General Mohammed Ali Khazai, the Iranian army's chief of ordnance, who had parlayed his $6,000 salary into three houses in the suburbs of Tehran, four apartment houses in France, five automobiles, $100,000 in European banks and $200,000 in cash. A military court convicted Khazai of taking a cut out of government contracts and sentenced him to five years of solitary confinement.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>In May 1963 Alam's anticorruption drive was in full swing. In Tehran, a military tribunal sentenced General Abdullah Hedayat, Iran's first four-star general and once a close adviser of the Shah, to two years in prison for embezzling money on military housing contracts, brushed aside his plea for appeal with the brusque explanation that "more charges are pending." The former boss of the Tehran Electricity Board was in solitary confinement for five years; cases were in preparation against an ex-War Minister and twelve other generals for graft.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/a/Asadollah_Alam_5a37.html" title="Edit section: Riots of 1963">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Riots of 1963</span></h3>
<p>The most important event in Alam's premiership were the riots that took place in June 1963 in response to some of the reforms enforced by the Shah and Alam. It was the clerics who triggered the riots during the Muharram holy days. As the faithful jammed the mosques, the clerics assailed "illegal" Cabinet decision, urged their followers to "protect your religion." Small-scale riots quickly broke out in the clerical capital of Qum, led by Ayatullah <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rouhollah_Khomeini_d153.html" title="Rouhollah Khomeini">Rouhollah Khomeini</a>, and in several other cities. Police struck back, arrested Khomeini and some 15 other ringleaders. With that, both sides declared open war and the battle was on.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Screaming " Down with the Shah," 10,000 people, swept through the capital, carrying pictures of Khomeini. Though the whereabouts of the Shah was kept secrets, rows of white-helmeted troops, backed by tanks, immediately sealed off access to royal places in the city and suburbs. In the heart of town green their fire for 40 minute. When the mobs entered government buildings, the troops opened up at point-blank range. The crowd fell back in confusion, regrouped, and raced down main avenues.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Nearly 7,000 troops were called out by Alam's government to restore uneasy peace in Tehran; by then damage was estimated in the millions, at least 1,000 were injured, and the officially reported death toll was 86. It was undoubtedly higher, but since the public cemetery was closed and under heavy guard to prevent further clashes at the gravesides, the real number remained unknown.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> In his memoirs, Alam notes the number of the dead to be about 200, saying that he immediately arranged for their families to recive a pension from the government.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> For the first time in a decade, martial law was imposed on the city, along with a dusk-to-dawn curfew. Hoping to preserve quiet for a while, Alam also announced that troops would remain on emergency duty. Their orders: shoot to kill.</p>
