<dd><i>Capitalism has been the enemy of Asahi since 1930's.</i></dd>

<p>Can this reworded--it's not very encyclopedic as it stands...something like, "The Asahi Shimbun's editorial policies have consistently targeted capitalism since the 1930s"?? --<a href="../../../d/p/r/User%7EDpr_d663.html" title="User:Dpr">Dpr</a> 06:01, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Agreed, and furthermore some of the other accusations of political bias are pretty serious, with nothing cited to back them up. Further, these seem to come from an anonymous user(s?). It may actually be accurate, but I find it suspicious, and having glanced at the Asahi’s English website, there does not seem to be an overt anti-American or pro-communist bias in the articles or editorials. <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethoeph_fb67.html" title="User:Sethoeph">Sethoeph</a> 01:32, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I removed the political commentary about this newspaper. I believe they have no place in an encyclopedia such as this. <a href="../../../j/b/0/User%7EJb05-tmy_61a3.html" title="User:Jb05-tmy">tmy</a> 09:37, 7 December 2005</p>

<p>yeah, and Asahi never had an alliance with the People's Daily of China. I deleted that sentence.</p>
<p>Asahi has an alliance with the People's Daily of China even now. See Asahi’s website. <a href="http://www.asahi.com/international/jinmin/" class="external free" title="http://www.asahi.com/international/jinmin/" rel="nofollow">http://www.asahi.com/international/jinmin/</a></p>

<p>1) The section lacks reliable sources 2) This article has been canvassed on <a href="../../../i/k/e/User%7EIkedanobuo_e09f.html" title="User:Ikedanobuo">User:Ikedanobuo</a>'s private blog, in the comment section. A comment there suggests the problem is that (western) people think Asahi Shimbun is a reliable source, and that this article should be changed to undermine Asahi as a reliable source. While I know Asahi Shimbun has been involved in several "scandals" (the number of them depending on who you ask), that section is not using a NPOV. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">Mackan</a> 08:47, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1) As the article of NY Timse, the newspaper's source is newspaper itself. So all sources are cited already.</dd>

<dd>Everybody knows those scandals in Japan. And those are NOT NPOV. Those are FACTS. If you know those facts, why you want to hide them?

<p>I saw the discussion on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>. I can't read Japanese, so can't check the sources myself. However, it does seem clear that the section is at least disputed, so I'm restoring that tag. Please make a good faith effort, <i>on both sides</i>, to resolve the dispute, before removing the tag. Discuss the article, not the contributors - don't call each other childish, or similar. Notice that there are language difficulties, if it looks like the other person is insulting you personally, please assume it's just a language issue and that no insult is intended. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 17:16, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay, that last bit was as an admin. Let me see if I can kick off something productive just as an editor. To start, about the section about two politicians meeting for lunch. Is it so controversial or unusual that two politicians meet for lunch? And what is the source that they actually met in Tokyo while the paper reported they met in Nagano - the very same issue of the same paper? There was an article, in the same issue, writing that the paper was inaccurate? --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 17:16, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My question would be: what's the point? Newspapers aren't 100% accurate, and never have been (hence corrections and retractions). So what exactly is the reason for having this section? Three reporting errors in 17 years isn't that bad. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 18:12, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>About the section about two politicians meeting for lunch, the date of this article is very important, it was eve of the Lower House election, Sept 11 ,2005. The newspaper looks like to be something conniver in those cases. So those are very important. And I can only do slow contribution for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">Wiki</a>. But what's wrong? You want to push out my contributions? And furthermore, if you can read the Japaese you should google those facts. Those are all big issues. <a href="../../../d/d/r/User%7EDDRG_6b57.html" title="User:DDRG">DDRG</a> 04:37, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>My response is frankly "so what?". You fail to make any case whatsoever for why this info is <i>important</i>. Newspapers and magazinese have retrations, corrections, and mistakes all the time, no matter what country they're from. I could write a whole article on mistakes in the NYT that they fixed later, but it doesn't at all diminish the reputation of the paper. Let's think about this: One point is that the photographer did something, and didn't tell anyone. That would include the reporter, who based the report off the photo. That's not the fault of the paper. So two politicians went to lunch, and it was in Tokyo and not Nagano. I would say the salient point is that they had lunch, not where it was. Again, not a big deal, especially since Japan didn't politically destabilize or fall into the sea as a result. Your real point is the comfort women issue, and you're dealing with material 15 years in the past. Therfore, at this point in time, so what? Any retraction would have been <i>years</i> ago. You're trying to impugn the source because you think ther's something there to impugn, and there isn't. Not only that, your references are vague; you don't have page numbers, article titles, authors, or anything that would allow anyone to find out what it is you're claiming. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 14:15, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I changed the tag to "totally-disputed-section" instead of "disputed" and put the "unreferenced" back in as well. I also moved the whole section down one step, which I hope you will agree to. The reason I changed it to totally disputed is that I don't think it's neutrally presented - as I said, the article was canvassed on a Japanese blog, and the intention of this user is only to discredit Asahi Shimbun as a reliable source, so that "Western people" shall realise it can't be referenced to in the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comfort_women.html" title="Comfort women">Comfort women</a> article. I put the "unreferenced" tag back in because it's not properly referenced. Do you agree with the changes I've made? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">Mackan</a> 19:02, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Aha! Now I see. I wondered why the subject of comfort women had come up all of a sudden on H-JAPAN. There must have been some noise made recently about it, and now the writer wants to be able to discount a source. Problem is, the Asahi has been around for around 10 times as long as this user, and pointing out a few errors is not going to discredit the paper by any stretch of the imagination. 209.6.240.192 20:22, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let's not worry about the overall reputation of the Shimbun, and focus on this article. Is everyone agreed the comfort women issue is an important mistake? If so, we should say so, with good citations. Yes, the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> does publish minor retractions every week, but the <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jayson_Blair_fd29.html" title="Jayson Blair">Jayson Blair</a> issue was still quite important. <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html#Modern_controversies" title="New York Times">New_York_Times#Modern_controversies</a> is a fine example of what this section should look like, a couple of paragraphs covering important errors would be quite suitable. Is the comfort women error similarly important? One good way to tell is if it has other newspapers - not just blogs - writing about it. Does it? --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 14:49, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
