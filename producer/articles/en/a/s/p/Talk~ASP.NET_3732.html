<p>is ASP.net a compiled language?</p>

<dl>
<dd>Yes and No. ASP.NET must be compiled by the server (aka IIS) to a .NET common language runtime, from which it will be interpreted by the server machine. But you don´t need to compile an ASP.NET file to run it on the server, the server does it for you. In this case, the answer is No. --<a href="../../../c/e/d/User%7ECedric.graebin_8323.html" title="User:Cedric.graebin">Cedric.graebin</a> 23:42, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To expand on that, the assembly that is created from your pages is indeed compiled to MSIL, however, the JIT then kicks in during runtime and the corresponding machine code is cached and used on the next invocation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>NO -- The ASP.NET Portion is not compiled, but interpreted by the IIS web server. The parts that are compiled are written in a compilable language such as C# or VB.NET. These parts of the application are compiled on the server.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I beg to differ. Check your %WINDIR%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\%DOT_NET_VERSION%\Temporary ASP.NET Files folder. You'll see the end-result of the "ASP.NET Portion" translated to code (C# in may case) as well as the DLL that was generated. The end result is a compiled page, even if you don't do code-behind. - <a href="../../../n/u/g/User%7ENuggetboy_c60a.html" title="User:Nuggetboy">Chris</a> 00:00, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, ASP.NET is not a language. Second, YES, all parts that made up an ASP.NET application are compiled, including plain-text .aspx files (they are compiled as the first request come into a .NET assembly ("dll") which is stored somewhere in a temporary folder). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 62.168.95.194 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_62.168.95.194_1d17.html" title="Special:Contributions/62.168.95.194">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<p>Warrens, you're correct in your definitions of comprise and compose and I'm not arguing using "comprise". However, the original text ("composed of") was correct. "comprised of" *is* incorrect.

<dd>I agree. It's not just that it's highly pro-MSFT, with all of the benefits listed ( and no context about how important they might be ) - it's also tiresome to read. I'm doing my part to improve the article, as a person who programs against ASP.NET every day. My goal is to bring a more neutral point of view, but also to make the content in this article more useful. As such, I'll be adding an article called <b>Criticisms</b> or <b>Gotchas</b> or something to that effect, of common mistakes or problems and how to deal with them. This could be seen as anti-MSFT ( which I'm not, since I choose to work with their technology ) but I'm doing it to make the page useful to ASP.NET users, not marketing people. <a href="../../../d/i/g/User%7EDigitalEnthusiast_4e7d.html" title="User:DigitalEnthusiast">DigitalEnthusiast</a> 20:34, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article is inaccurate in saying that "in version 2.0, all controls generate valid HTML 4.0, XHTML 1.0 (the default), or XHTML 1.1 output". The XHTML generated is not valid even in version 2.0. For example, all generated JavaScript is wrapped in HTML/XML comments (&lt;!-- --&gt;) rather than XHTML CDATA blocks.

<dd>Sorry if that sounded rude - wasn't my intent. I just don't think "strongly disagree" conveyed my feelings strongly enough. While I see your point that master pages could be notable enough to mention but not for their own article, there are any number of developers who <i>do</i> use them ( myself included ). To many it's as if "master pages" didn't exist, even aren't a part of ASP.NET, however, they <b>are</b> a subset, and only of version 2.0, so I really think it makes sense to keep the two articles seperate. Also, I'm rewriting much of the ASP.NET page, and while I'm removing some content ( that's either confusing, or simply untrue ) it will be longer when I'm finished. If necessary, I'll do the same for the Master Pages article, and point out a lot of the specific issues their use brings up.

<dd><b>Strong Disagree</b>. Master pages are a very important part of ASP.NET, there's a whole lot to be said about them (as you can see in this page), and they're a recent development, as opposed to a feature that always has been native to ASP.NET. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomasmallen_15b8.html" title="User:Thomasmallen">Thomasmallen</a> 15:08, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Disagree</b> I agree that master pages are a part of ASP.NET, but they existed through 2 releases (1.0 and 1.1) without being implemented. Master pages are an important concept in and of themselves. The concept of template-based web-programming was changed from a simple server-side include model to an object oriented approach. //<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBankingBum_8834.html" title="User:BankingBum">BankingBum</a> 06:24, 24 February 2007 (UTC) <a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBankingBum_90b5.html" title="User talk:BankingBum"><font color="darkgreen"><sup>$$</sup></font></a></dd>

<p>Maybe I'm missing something here, but I don't understand the relevance of this statement, or at least how it can be used as a criticism of ASP.NET. Say have this code in my Page_Load, which will cause a runtime division by zero exception:</p>
<p>int a = 0; int b = 1/a;</p>
<p>If I don't catch this exception myself then the ASP.NET runtime will catch it and show an error page. The application will not be restarted and sessions will not be lost. All exceptions are eventually caught by the runtime, meaning that there is really no such thing as an "uncaught exception" in ASP.NET (at least in theory).</p>
<p>If somehow an exception was thrown that was not caught by the ASP.NET runtime, then by definition the process must be terminated, as there is no way to continue after this point. This is the same with any application on any platform, so I don't see how this can be a criticism of ASP.NET. If we assume that there could be an exception that isn't caught by the ASP.NET runtime, then surely the criticism should be "ASP.NET contains a bug that prevents it from catching all exceptions".</p>
<p>Googling for information on this yields nothing. I'm sure my understanding of the way these things work is lacking, however, so maybe someone can enlighten me. Straussian 00:19, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are correct - that sentence is wrong. However, are you sure about session states? I haven't tested it, but I thought that session states get lost when unhandled exception occurs. <a href="../../../d/l/x/User%7EDLX_8f1a.html" title="User:DLX">DLX</a> 13:44, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>DLX asks a good question. This really depends on the severity of the error and the configuration of the session state. If the ASP.NET application uses an out of processes session option (such as the ASP.NET session server or SQL Server session), it doesn't matter what the severity of the error is. The session state will stay alive. In the case of an in-proc session option (the current default in ASP.NET), a severe error will kill the worker process and therefor, the session state. Going to the root of the statement, most unhandled exceptions do NOT crash the worker process and are caught by the default ASP.NET generic exception handler (which produces the "yellow screen of death"). All of this said, its hardly a practical criticism to say that "Unhandled exceptions force the ASP.NET worker processes to shut down" since any application that doesn't handle exceptions cause a process exit. //<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBankingBum_8834.html" title="User:BankingBum">BankingBum</a> 06:32, 24 February 2007 (UTC) <a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBankingBum_90b5.html" title="User talk:BankingBum"><font color="darkgreen"><sup>$$</sup></font></a></dd>
<dd><b>(updated)</b> I've modified the criticisms section and added a bit of accuracy and grammatical changes. The criticism was written a little more like a rant than an encyclopedic criticism. //<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBankingBum_8834.html" title="User:BankingBum">BankingBum</a> 06:55, 24 February 2007 (UTC) <a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBankingBum_90b5.html" title="User talk:BankingBum"><font color="darkgreen"><sup>$$</sup></font></a></dd>
