<h2><span class="mw-headline">Is this still deserving of featured article status?</span></h2>
<p>I'm beginning to think that this article should be removed from the list of featured articles. It seems to me that political ideas and attempts to be politically correct have compromised the factual veracity of this article. This should be a pretty straightforward article about a neurological disorder like epilepsy or aphasia. Instead, it reads as if Asperger syndrome is either some kind of blessing or lifestyle choice and that there are negligible drawbacks to having it. The very fact that many of the participants on the talk page take issue or offense at even calling AS a disorder or disease when it is viewed as such by the medical community is rather telling. I really think the mainstream medical and scientific view should be emphasized, as medicine and science strive to have the neutral point of view that this article lacks. I'm not looking for an argument. I'm simply warning those interested that if this article stays as it is I will probably lobby to have it removed as a featured article. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G.

<dd>I won't comment on the featured status. However, you should note that the same people who object to AS being called a disorder are the ones that are most keen on science in the autism community. If there was a scientifically sound argument to the effect that AS is a disorder/disease, then there would be no significant objection to it. As it stands, calling AS a disorder/disease is just an opinion, albeit one that is held by the majority of the medical community (simply because they have been taught this is the case). If you want to have a philosophical discussion about what the disease/disorder constructs mean, and whether AS fits into the model of said constructs, go ahead. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 20:23, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand the argument, because I take offense to <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourette_syndrome.html" title="Tourette syndrome">Tourette syndrome</a> being referred to as a disorder, but the medical fact is that Tourette's disorder is the DSM name for the condition, whether the "TS community" likes it or not. Wiki is an encylopedia. The debate about disease/disorder/condition/syndrome can be summarized in one sentence, and should not detract from encyclopedic content. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 20:27, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think there's objection to wording that says AS is classified as a disorder, which I think the article already does. As to additional information, I'm inclusionist. If something is notable enough to be considered "human knowledge", it should be in Wikipedia. If there are article organization issues, let's discuss those. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 20:42, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it is deserving of being a featured article, especially since I removed all the crap on theories and therapies to *non-featured*, and hopefully, hard-to-find articles. However, given the recent development at Wikipedia, it wouldn't surprise me if you eventually get the crap back in. I for one will fight such change as long as possible. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 06:16, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>That can be accomplished in neutral, medical terms, without detracting from the medical, encyclopedic quality of the article. For example, some people with <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourette_syndrome.html" title="Tourette syndrome">Tourette syndrome</a> consider it an advantage: in order to introduce that notion into the text of the article, I found and summarized <b>in one sentence only</b> a quote from the leading medical textbook on TS written by the physicians considered almost unanimously to be the leading reliable sources on TS. You can interject these thoughts and issues in a correct, medical, correctly-referenced sense, without writing a speculative, unencyclopedic entry. I hope that, rather than losing featured status and ending up with some tags on the article, you'll all come together and make this happen. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 20:32, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see why. That would be blatant censorship. This is an encyclopedia, not a medical manual. According to Wikipedia, an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a> is "a comprehensive written compendium that contains information on all branches of knowledge or a particular branch of knowledge." The Wikimedia Foundations says: "Imagine a world in which every single person is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing." It doesn't say "the sum of all the knowledge of doctors only" or "the sum of the knowledge the majority agrees with". <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 20:36, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

Please use it wisely&#160;:-) I'm glad to help to any extent I can, but I don't know AS well enough to help with the actual writing. I can help with sources, Wiki stuff, things like that, if needed. Also, it can be helpful to spin off content that may not be "medical enough" into daughter articles, like <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sociological_and_cultural_aspects_of_Tourette_syndrome_9f33.html" title="Sociological and cultural aspects of Tourette syndrome">Sociological and cultural aspects of Tourette syndrome</a>.

Besides, you-know-what-theory is not part of the <a href="../../../c/a/u/Causes_of_autism.html" title="Causes of autism">Causes of autism</a> article, so I guess it is not a crap theory.

<dd>Deserving of featured status? No, and it hasn't been for quite some time. I suggest a serious review of all Wiki pillars and policies, all elements of <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a>, and comparison to numerous featured medical articles of late. You can find examples on <a href="../../../m/c/o/WP%7EMCOTW_eb6b.html" title="WP:MCOTW">WP:MCOTW</a>, which show how far off from being a concise, encyclopedic article AS has become. <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBold_3536.html" title="WP:Bold">Bold</a> action, and deletions of large chunks of speculation as well as <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOVing</a>, may be necessary to retain this article's <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">featured status:</a> not a few minor fixes here and there. Featured article reviews typically allow a few weeks to a month for improvements to happen, and editors voting whether an article should be delisted watch for steady improvement in the article, with editors working steadily and consensually towards achieving the criterion for <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">featured articles</a>. This article has become so unencyclopedic and non-medical that it resembles a personal essay and a website for those looking for speculative information about the condition. There are plenty of good websites about AS on the net: reference <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> in terms of focusing here on encyclopedic content. One place to start working on improvements may be to go back to the original featured version and see what it included, keeping in mind that standards have been raised since this article became featured. Taking salvageable portions and article structure from the original featured article, and deleting non-encyclopedic content that has crept in since the article was featured, may be one way of orienting the work needed. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 17:59, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If keeping it listed requires adding the speculative causes and therapies once more, I vote for unlisting it instead. Besides, the article still is too big, and adding those again would make it much too big. Given the complexity of the subject, I think it is much better to keep factoring out parts of the article in sub-articles and only keeping small summaries. After all, this approach should not interfere with the featured status. Besides, since AS is not a disease, or at least it is not widely accepted as a disease, following examples of diseases doesn't sound like a good idea. Also, look at the link <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">WP:FA</a>. Aspergers and autism is listed in the psychology section, not in the medical section. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 19:02, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Speculative causes and therapies have no place in encyclopedic entry, other than a VERY brief mention as speculation (perhaps a one paragraph summary, mentioning all speculative therapies, for example).

<dd>I just read the entire article. I think Brian is largely wrong. There is a good balance between advantages/disadvantages. A problem is that most of the disadvantages are brought forward by autism researchers, while many of the advantages are from the autistic community. However, Attwood and others are mentioned in the text as having more or less those views as well. That could provide citations to this view. I'm not knowledgable enough to update most of the content related to what various professionals and others have written. My main focus is on original research about autism, and advocating autism as mainly a difference. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 20:09, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It is basically autistics that are online, their forums, web-sites, blogs, mailing-lists and so on. Not unlike other social groups and cultures. Social groups and cultures are part of Wikipedia, and they do *not* draw information from peer-reviewed medical journals! The opinions can be verified, but it have to be done as it is done with other social phenomeny, IOW, not in medical journals. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 21:38, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And, it's not about advantages and disadvantages: it's whether the article is encyclopedic and meets the criteria for featured articles. I'd like to see the article retain its featured status. You can spend time debating whether Brian is right or not, or you can spend time fixing the article via a careful review of the criteria and other featured medical articles. I hope editors will choose the latter while the article is under review. Again, I suggest a review of the original, featured version would be a good starting place. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 20:24, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The fact is, I had the Aspie-quiz here for a short while until RN removed it. I then asked him to remove the other, non-notable tests as well, which he did. The Neanderthal theory haven't been here for quite a while.

Just look at the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_culture.html" title="Autistic culture">Autistic culture</a> and related articles. They don't cite their opinions from medical experts, but from autistic people.

<dd>Yes, but there is a problem here. While neurotypical cultures are typically defined by leaders, newpapers and governments, the autistic community doesn't work like that. There is no single site that can claim to be representable, no government, no common newspaper or anything like that. There are some large organizations like AFF, wrongplanet that sometimes do make headlines in newspapers, but they can hardly be said to speak for every autistic person. This is a preferential, organizational difference problem. It might be handled by citing people like Attwood and others though. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 22:21, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rdos, your assertion that it is policy which is wrong seems to be founded on the fact that policy forbids the inclusion of your unverified theories. It is you who are at fault, not policy. Policy is written fomr the basis of what Wikipedia is: an encyclopaedia. If you want to write about unpublished or fringe theories, you can do that somewhere else; this site is about taking what is verifiable from reliable secondary sources and stating it in neutral terms. We do not do original research, and that includes novel syntheses of published data. Your perspective as a self-diagnosed autistic is not, I would suggest, a great starting point for an objective assessment of neutrality, since it puts you outside both the medical community and the community of formally diagnosed autistics. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 11:15, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I happen to operate several autistic-oriented forums, for instance a swedish forum with 80+ members, most with a formal Asperger's diagnosis. Unlike what you think, Aspie-quiz is not a random quiz. It has been put together at my forum, with help from many people there. New versions even evolve on a wikipedia so anybody can comment on content (not this one, as <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">User:JzG</a> would certainly delete it and ban me). I also happen to have a daughter diagnosed with autism, so I think I know a lot more about the topic than you do <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">User:JzG</a>.

<dd>No, I don't want a diagnos by a doctor. Haven't you looked at my new user page? I thought you guarded it? It clearly says "This user is an Aspie and does not have Asperger's syndrome". It means just that. I don't need the label because I function well enough in society, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't get it if I tried to. As for the validity of Aspie-quiz. The evaluations speaks for themselves. Can be found at the blacklisted site I'm sure you have kept the url to. There are now 5 different versions that have 17,145 answers in total. Many of the questions are useful to determine aspie vs NT as can been seen in the statistics. The results between quiz versions are quite consistent. The rate of misdiagnosis ranges around 20%, similar to the AQ-test. Besides, it seems quite popular. There is a thread about it at <a href="http://www.wrongplanet.net" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wrongplanet.net" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> that has 30 pages of answers that has been running for a long time. And no, I didn't initiate it, BTW. To be frank, <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">User:JzG</a>, it looks like you haven't looked at the quiz (the sources for the quiz are mentioned, which include AQ-test, Martha Kate and several others), the evaluations are public (including source code) and the full Neanderthal theory is also available (not the summary deleted from Wikipedia). I suggest you make yourself familiar with the stuff you are commenting on before posting anything else on this topic. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 13:57, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, but as I wrote elsewhere, I'm not too familiar with what various autism-experts have to say. I've read a lot of the MEDLINE research about autism, but their attitude about autistics usually makes me sic. Certainly, it is not very hard to search for specific topics on MEDLINE, and I can do that if somebody has something concrete. I have no specific additional material I want to include. I'm merely concerned that the current neutral view of AS will be "medicalized" too much.</dd>

<dd>Rdos, I don't "guard" articles, I do guard policy violations. Since you've given an undertaking not to use your page against policy I am taking you at your word. But I do have a problem with the apparent assertion that only an aspie can understand the subject, when that statement is made by a <i>self-diagnosed</i> aspie - I am a bad person, I know, but it riles me. I have indeed looked at the quiz, but it does not interest me particularly. Until it's published in a reliable source it's not of any interest or value to the project.

<dd>I don't think you are a bad person JzG, but I'm a bit touchy about special interest projects, which happens to be the one you have been attacking. Just because I haven't got to peer-review (yet), doesn't mean that my work is bad. I have already agreed that it is original research, and that it cannot presently be included here. However, I think I am allowed to discuss various things I've found out with Aspie-quiz. Some of it might actually already be researched, but not widely now. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 18:12, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A note regarding the idea that this is or should be an article on a neurological disorder like epilepsy or aphasia. Medical POV: there is no indication, let alone evidence garnered via research, much less results published in peer-reviewed journals, let alone replication or falsification of such results, that this is a neurological disorder. We do not know what causes AS. There is little or no evidence of pathology. There is no medical consensus on what causes it, there are no medical treatments, certainly not a cure, and if there were, those so diagnosed generally would not want to be "cured" for fear of changing the holiest of holies: one's personality. Psychology/psychiatry is another scientific POV. These disciplines are, to a limited extent, studying the effects AS has on people's lives, proposing and assessing what can be done to help them understand and interact with "normal people", cope with other problems, etc. Politics is another important POV e.g. facilitating (better) work performance or school results, or preventing/discouraging discrimination. Another increasingly important POV to cover: changing attitudes, "grassroots" activism, media exposure, etc. AS has parallels with homosexuality some decades ago in that it is increasingly seen as a (set of) personality traits rather than a psychiatric and/or neurological disorder. Another similarity is that "patients" are fully aware of the differences between themselves and "normal" people. Their views are important too. Just a few points off the top of my head to address the idea that there is only one (scientific) POV that must be described. <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 11:01, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, "compared more" being the key. Compared with AS (a form of <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism.html" title="Autism">Autism</a> in its own right) Autism is a mixed bag in that it is linked with brain development disorders or brain damage in a pretty significant number of cases (these patients usually also have many other problems inherent to neuropathology). AS is similar to classical Autism without (1) (per definition) delayed language development and without (2) (per my observation) measurable brain pathology. Indeed, a consensus seems to be developing to lump AS and <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_functioning_autism.html" title="High functioning autism">high functioning autism</a> together and consider any differences to be mere definitional artefacts. <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 15:26, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmmm, I don't think I made comment clear enough. I was referring to comparing the articles, not the conditions, as they are already being compared. I was saying that this article should follow the Autism article more than any other for things that should and shouldn't be included. As for Asperger's being the same as HFA, I was under the impression that there were some differences between the two, and that HFA was somewhat more severe than Asperger's. --<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubhagan_33c0.html" title="User:Dubhagan"><font color="black"><b>Dubh</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/u/b/User_talk%7EDubhagan_8d04.html" title="User talk:Dubhagan"><font color="green"><b>agan</b></font></a> 15:40, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Or my response was less than clear&#160;:-) I understood what you meant and agree. For the rest my comments were just some background mainly re the brain damage pitfall (a lot of autism is directly caused by brain damage, e.g. lack of oxygen at birth). HFA = AS is an emerging consensus. I think the autism article gives the various POVs. It's definitely an article to look at for some guidance. <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 17:50, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To all: I have tried to add in as many citations as I could last night in a game of fill in the blanks. Luckily I have a diverse library on AS so it's not a problem for me. I am still working on this so be patient and I should have most of the remaining blanks filled in by the rest of the week (ie. still looking for a citation for the bit about kids with AS playing with older/younger kids. I have seen this countless times in articles, and I know it's true for my son, but can't come up with the reference right now ... will do soon.) Hope this helps save the featured article status; as a mother of a son with AS, it's important to me to preserve this status, in terms of public awareness of AS. If there are any other "facts" in question, please insert citation request and I will try my best to find them. If you have any questions about the veracity of my citations, I would be happy to email you the supporting comments, quotes etc. or post them here if necessary. <a href="../../../p/o/k/User%7EPokey2006_2993.html" title="User:Pokey2006">Pokey2006</a> 14:19, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Theoretically, yes. I originally moved it there, but when I realized it was mostly speculative and unsourced and in disagreement with the DSM, I moved it to the bottom. DSM criteria should be covered, and then divergent criteria (admittedly necessary and used in practice) should be covered in a separate section, IMO. (By the way, DSM is pretty serious about its copyright, and does not like to be reproduced exactly: someone needs to paraphrase the entire thing.) Again, I recommend a review of the sections and headings used in other featured articles for medical, psychological or neuropsychiatric conditions at <a href="../../../m/c/o/WP%7EMCOTW_eb6b.html" title="WP:MCOTW">WP:MCOTW</a>. For example, causes must be included in the AS article, and it is completely glossed over. I hope some people who really know the AS research and literature will spend a few days in PubMed, citing their sources. If you need an example of how to cite PubMed research, you can find it on <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourette_syndrome.html" title="Tourette syndrome">Tourette syndrome</a>. Almost none of the references, books, or inline citations used in this article are cited correctly, and almost all need to be corrected.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Citations</span></h2>
<p>Regarding the need for citations, a lot of those statements that are tagged are widely know (like autism being a spectrum) and are even mentioned in other places on Wikipedia. I was under the impression that if something was widely know, then citations weren't needed. It almost looks like citations are now needed for practically every other sentence. --<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubhagan_33c0.html" title="User:Dubhagan"><font color="black"><b>Dubh</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/u/b/User_talk%7EDubhagan_8d04.html" title="User talk:Dubhagan"><font color="green"><b>agan</b></font></a> 16:30, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm also not a fan of turning an article into a Xmas tree like this.

<dd>There is controversy over *which* spectrum, what the spectrum includes, etctera, how it should be defined, etc. It's not hard to find a citation for any of those kinds of statements from the most reliable sources. (Have a look at <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> to help define the best AS resources: for TS it's pretty clear which researchers fit the criteria listed there.) I'd try to do it for you on PubMed, but I don't have as good of a sense of who the most reputable AS researchers are, so I may not provide the best sources. The fact that some things aren't "widely known" or held is demonstrated by the amount of controversy and editing dissent in the article. What is "widely known" and believed by one or another may not actually be supported by the research. The way to avoid having speculation throughout the article is to simply cite statements from PubMed. Theoretically, info on PubMed has been subjected to some kind of peer review, and is not self-published content. It's really not hard to do ... I tagged only a few to give you all an idea of the work needed, but almost the entire article is unreferenced. If I can be of any help, I'm willing, but I don't know the best sources as some of you may. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 16:44, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, there is controversy how to define the "spectrum". I don't agree that the present criteria in any way have cleared this up. IMO, the borders are more or less arbitrary. I base this on neurodiversity version of Aspie-quiz. All the additional diagnosis (ADHD, Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Hyperlexia, Synaesthesia, OCD, ODD, Prosapagnosia, Dysgraphia and Bipolar) where highly loaded on autistic traits. Of these diagnosis, only one additional axisis formed in factory analysis. It was loaded on dyslexia &amp; dyscalculia. The other dxes simply cannot be meaningfully grouped. This isn't worth anything as evidence in the article, but at least it gives an idea that this is still a controversial area. It is also quit well known in the community that these are common comrbidities. For instance, in addition to autistic traits, I also have tics, ODD, probably OCD, mild prosapagnosia and mild dyslexia. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 18:23, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, adding an example I just thought of: you can still find people, groups, and websites claiming that TS and AS are on the same spectrum, based on some older research which has now been refuted by newer research. The "spectrum" thingie is never clear cut, and it's a statement that should be (and can easily be) cited. That way, everyone reading the article knows exactly which spectrum is supported by the consensus of medical research, how the spectrum is defined, and what conditions are at each end of the spectrum. I tried to tag individual statements, to help orient the work needed. Really, the entire article should be tagged as unreferenced, but I didn't think that would be helpful in terms of understanding why it needs to be referenced and what kinds of statments should be referenced. Others may disagree with some of my individual tags, but I hope they serve as an example, to orient the work needed.

I don't know the research well enough to say. If there is only a review, then the statement should indicate something to the effect that the research is preliminary, and controlled studies have not been done, blah, blah, blah ... <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 18:20, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This connection very likely is not real. It quite likely have two different components: SAD (seasonal affective disorder) and depression because of social problems. Some time ago it was claimed that depression was inherently linked by genes or something like that, but I don't think this is correct. I've researched this too. Turns out that winder-depression is much more common than summer-depression (hence the hint at SAD). I haven't researched depression in Aspie-quiz, for good reasons. I only research primary traits, not environmental impact. Anyway, good work, Sandy. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 18:34, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, Sandy motivated me to spend $30 on a brand new study on the subject ("Comorbid psychopathology with autism spectrum disorder in children: An overview). I cannot post it here, nor any reference to it, but I'll provide som citations:</p>
<p><b>Depression</b>: "Children with Asperger’s syndrome have comorbidity rates as high as 30% (Ghaziuddin, Weidmer-Mikhail, &amp; Ghaziuddin, 1998; Wing, 1981). Ghaziuddin et al. (2002) assert that depression is probably the most frequent form of comorbid psychopathology with ASD."</p>
<p><b>Bipolar</b>: "Bipolar disorder is a second mood disorder and a very serious condition which has proven both difficult to differentially diagnose and treat (Matson et al., in press). For 70% of the childhood cases in the general population, the disorder initially presents as major depression (Roberston et al., 1994). Additionally, symptoms may wax and wane (Findling et al., 2001) and comorbidity with other psychopathologies, regardless of the occurrence of ASDs, such as anxiety and ADHD are common (Carlson, 1998; Masi et al., 2001). The literature with the ASD population is almost non-existent at this point." Highly comorbid with ADHD. Remains to show that ADHD and ASDs are related.</p>
<p><b>Phobias</b>: "The first systematic group study of phobias was by Matson and Love (1990). They looked at the intensity of fears and phobias of autistic children by matching them to normal same age peers. Autistic children were more fearful of thunderstorms, dark places, large crowds, dark rooms or closets, going to bed in the dark, and closed places. The fears and phobias most common in the matched normal developing peers showed little overlap with the autistic group."</p>
<p><b>OCD</b>: "Charlop-Christy and Haymes (1996) operationally defined obsessions as continuous verbal requests across settings in their study. They note that DSM-IV criteria were used, but it is unclear whether the DSM-IV criteria applied were for OCD and/or ASD. Nonetheless, it is instructive to see these targets described in such a manner for ASD children. The authors label theses behaviors as aberrant and the authors appear to support the notion that in this context, the obsessions (e.g. looking at maps, tossing a ball, playing with a helicopter), were a form of stereotypic behaviors. They also noted, however, that some autistic children display obsessive behaviors while others do not."</p>
<p><b>Psychosis / Schizophrenia</b>: "Taken together, these preliminary results suggest that autism and childhood psychosis are distinct disorders." I wonder about this. I think I'll research this in next Aspie-quiz --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 19:46, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not me. I'll help as I'm motivated, but my direct interest in keeping it featured is generally low. Prevalance is another terribly poorly studied topic. I simply cannot believe that there is no cross-racial, large-scale, multi-DSM "disorder" studies. How can hypothesis be put together without this information? I do plan to access this as well, the best I can. BTW, the incredible small studies I sited above, which are <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, are simply nothing compared to the study of this I made in neurodiversity-version of Aspie-quiz. I had several hundred people that indicated each condition. What about comborbidity between ASD and Tourette? I've not managed to collect more than 6-7 individuals in each version, so I have no idea about that. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 20:12, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We face the same dearth of broad-based population studies in Tourette's research, and I think (hope?) I managed to convey accurate and relevant info in the TS article. Even if you don't want to keep the article featured, if it doesn't improve, it could end up with disclaimer tags, which wouldn't be good for Wiki or for AS info. Right now, it should probably be tagged as not citing sources. Comorbidity between TS and AS? A Burd Kerbeshian (can't remember spelling on his name) study indicated a higher than expected comorbidity, but it was based on outdated prevalence estimates. Newer research casts his, and some Barone-Cohen (sp?) stuff, in a new light, indicating the numbers could be explained by chance. There is currently no evidence of a TS/AS genetic link, although tics are present in some individuals with autism, particularly AS. Autism spectrum disorders are a secondary cause of tics, known as tourettism. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 20:36, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Having tics myself, I have doubts about the proposed causality. The study also have prevalence estimates for AS/TS comorbidity (8.3%), however 13 subjects is a very small group. My results are as follows: Version II, 11 answers, 5-10 points above normal. Version III, 20 diagnosed + 16 self-diagnosed, slightly below normal score, ND, 14 diagnosed (as normal score), 43 self-diagnosed (considerably above normal). Seems like TS/AS comorbidity is generally lower than for the other conditions we discussed before. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 20:57, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've been following the debate between Kärfve and Gillberg.

Officially, he did it because of privacy issues, but I don't know. Anyway, this was research on DAMP, a dx somewhere between ADHD and AS. DAMP is increasingly less used these days in Scandinavia, probably somehow due to the Kärfve - Gillberg conflict. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 06:16, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">An idea</span></h2>
<p>Just a suggestion: feel free to ignore me, or to toss around the idea for a few days. I've been trying to help clean up this article, but the more time I spend in it, the more I realize there is very little medical, reliable, verifiable content. It has really deteriorated and isn't encyclopedic. I was wondering if our efforts would be better oriented if you reverted to the last Featured Article verion, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asperger_syndrome&amp;oldid=22829980" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asperger_syndrome&amp;oldid=22829980" rel="nofollow">more or less this,</a> and then worked on rebuilding and bringing new content into that version? It would be far easier to reference and update the old version, than to continue trying to fix the new version. Just an idea: it might help keep the FA status, and it seems to provide a much better starting place than the mess of the current article. Any valuable changes made to the newer version could be added to that older version after the revert (things like DMOZ). I'm trying to help with the references, but I'm finding that a lot of the references aren't actually reliable, medical, peer-reviewed sources. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 22:47, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have no vested interest either way, but the content is so highly speculative, that it doesn't provide a good foundation from which to build. Almost none of the foundations of a medical article are even present at all, and most of the article deals with speculation and controversy, rather than adding speculation and controversy to the end of established views and practices. The last FA version seemed to afford a better starting place. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 23:58, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Then, we reorg away, I would imagine. Building from what we have is the foundation of how an article is built. I just cannot see restarting from an older version as being a viable option.

<dd>DEFINATELY one of Rdos's crackpot theories!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is no evidence whatsoever to suggest slower sexual maturation, in some cases the contrary applies. There is sometimes a problen with parents trying to delay maturation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The only thing I will say is that, just as aspies are more likely to be able to relate emotionally, successfully to (aka "get it on with") someone from a different culture (because in such a case diversity and difference is a positive expectation in both parties, not a source of alienation), it is probable that a relationship with someone much older or younger would also stand a similar chance of success for similar reasons. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 02:03, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's not a "crackpot" theory, but then it haven't been proved by published research either. Looking younger than their biological age and feeling younger is just some of those things that Aspies tend to answer more often YES to in Aspie-quiz. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 18:02, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>That only cover physical and mental maturity, not sexual maturity. There's a difference. Personally, as a person with Asperger's, I've always been told I look older than my age (when I was in grade 12 people were asking me what university I was going to). Also, if you quiz NT's on whether they look older or younger than their biological age, you could get the same answer. There is no evidence to suggest that Asperger's affects how old you look, but it's more likely a case of family genetics, as there is not an Asperger's (or Autistic) look. As for mental maturity, I've heard that Aspies can more mature in some ways, but less mature in other ways. Personally, I've always related better with adults, but at the same time I can act immature for my age, which seems to correlate with what I've heard. As for sexual maturity, from what I understand, puberty is puberty, no matter who it hits. However, the difference between Aspies and NT's could be in the mental understanding of it. Personally, I feel I've always had a mature understanding of it, though I'm sure that's not always the case. Rdos, if you do study it further, I'd suggest looking at the mental understanding of sexuality in Aspies. --<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubhagan_33c0.html" title="User:Dubhagan"><font color="black"><b>Dubh</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/u/b/User_talk%7EDubhagan_8d04.html" title="User talk:Dubhagan"><font color="green"><b>agan</b></font></a> 18:50, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Where are your sources? And don't say "Aspie Quiz" for several reasons, as follows:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>"Aspie Quiz" is only an account of certain self reported aspects of the type of Aspie who isn't too caught up in their own interests to take online quizes, (operated by people who think of them as Neanderthal pedophiles), and AS/NT/other folk making fun. This would be somewhere between an artificially and incidentally selective minority and "not enough to be representative"</li>
<li>"Aspie Quiz" does not ask the question "are you attracted to much younger people (not girls, there ARE gay Aspies and lady Aspies, some of them are even straight, y'know, and all the gender/sexual ambivalence Aspies are famous for makes it even MORE interesting). So you are interpreting the results on invalid, untested premise.</li>
<li>"Aspie Quiz" is "original research".</li>

<dd>Unfourtnately it might be true, I had a class mate that was aspie and he was actually masturbating under the table during class, and I'm not joking. As for myself I wouldn't say that I have had any problems with slower sexual maturity or something, I lost my virginity when I was 15, which at the time felt very appropriate and the girl was 16, so it was neither pedophilia nor slower sexual maturity. Although out of all profesionals I've talked to they've said I display very little to no symptomps of AS anymore. <a href="../../../x/s/p/User%7EXSpaceyx_4a74.html" title="User:XSpaceyx">User:xSpaceyx</a> 15:22, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>oh, for gosh sakes. Anything "might" be true about anything. We need medical references, not anecdote and individual stories bloating the talk page. Some of the problems with your argument are: a few anecdotal cases do not equal a medical correlation. OCD is associated with AS, and could explain the behaviors. Other comorbids need to be accounted for. Please leave speculative anecdote off the talk page, and focus on medical evidence and studies published in peer-reviewed journals or from reliable sources. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 15:31, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Remember Sandy we are only confirming and defining source material that was questioned, from personal experience here. I've seen that kind of behavior too. It's not as overt as just "shucking down" in Wal-mart. Masturbating under the table, hands over active in pockets, no perception of when it is inappropriate to be nude in company...my personal guess is that there was a secondary disorder of some kind involved.</dd>

Some of these concepts are hard to source, simply because of the search terms (I leave it to you imagination), and the more people discussing them, and looking for sources or terms to FIND sources, and ways to present them, the better, because they ARE important aspects of AS --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 15:56, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An interesting thread and a interesting topic. Contrary to some claims here, it seems to confirm my view rather than disprove it. I've had a hunch all the time that many "odd" sexual behaviors can indeed by explained if put into the context of another species. This is true for not "understanding" how to show one's sexuality. What is there to understand? Most of it is innate behaviors anyway, and NTs have no problems because their behaviors are the accepted one's! If courting and sexual behaviors weren't largely innate and genetic, how could two strangers from different cultures ever hope to fancy each others? This is clearly an important aspect of a species survival.</p>
<p>I was asked about pedophilia on my talk-page, and I responded that it wouldn't surprise me if it was correlated with autism. That's because pedophilia obviously is quite maladaptive in our species, and so fits with the other differences in sexuality.</p>
<p>I did research some sexual deviations in version II and III of Aspie-quiz, but those failed. I'm starting to suspect that part of the reasons they failed might be similar to why some physical traits failed. The NT-control group was almost exclusively scandinavian, while the aspie-group was more diverse. If homosexuality and BDSM had different prevalence in various etnic groups, this could explain this failure.</p>
<p>At least I "debunked" asexuality as a "sexual" trait. It didn't cluster with the sexual traits group, but with the social group, so I assume it is not something real at all. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 20:10, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you think pedophilia correlates to autism, why don't you check to see if any convicted pedophiles have autism-type diagnoses. --<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubhagan_33c0.html" title="User:Dubhagan"><font color="black"><b>Dubh</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/u/b/User_talk%7EDubhagan_8d04.html" title="User talk:Dubhagan"><font color="green"><b>agan</b></font></a> 21:23, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Might be hard to do, and just checking for diagnosed is not a good idea. A recent finding is that many criminals could be diagnosed ADHD, but if you check if a population of criminals have been diagnosed as ADHD, you end up with very different results because many of them have ended up criminal because of lack of diagnosis and support. If I new a "pedophili-site" I could simply post a link and ask them to take the quiz. I did that on BDSM and exhibitionism sites, and they scored higher than normal (compared to links posted on more regular sites). A definite "innovation" in Aspie-quiz is the referrer information. It can link people to specific sites. That's also how the NT-control group is put together. It consists of a couple of manually selected sites that are unrelated to autism and psychiatry. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 05:58, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So your basically saying you have no way to link Asperger's and pedophilia? That's what I thought.

<li>I went through one small section of the article many days ago and tagged a few statements which needed references, only as an example.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Asperger_syndrome#Citations" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Asperger_syndrome#Citations" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>Those statements still haven't been referenced, and more unreferenced statements were added this morning.

<li>Have you read all of the talk page entries here?</li>
<li>Most of what is referenced is referenced to Attwood's book, which although a reliable source, is secondary to peer-reviewed journal articles, easily available at PubMed.</li>
<li>Specific examples, starting from the top of the article:
<ul>
<li>Lead: <s>a reference for Lorna Wing paper (a name at least?) and Asperger paper. Note that the article contains no history of the condition.</s></li>
<li>The description of AS in the Definitions section suffers from tense changes. I took the original crack at that sentence, it was changed several times, and now it goes through several different tense changes and doesn't flow. <s>In that same section, there are multiple missing citations, and the section immediately goes into controversy, without providing a thorough analysis of accepted medical knowledge about the condition. There is one paragraph about AS as defined in the DSM, and then two paragraphs deviating from the DSM. We're never told what the Szatmari definition is or what paper they appeared in.</s> There is no reference for the ICD-10 statement, so the reader doesn't know the connection to schizoid disorder. <s>There is no Classification section, as called for in medical articles, which discusses how AS is different than other pervasive developmental disorders.</s> Basically, what is there is incomplete, unreferenced, uncomprehensive, and goes immediately into controvery and conflicting definitions, without adequately defining the condition.</li>
<li><s>The article should start with Classification, then Symptoms and Signs, then Causes. There is no Classification section,</s> Symptoms and Signs are presumably (?) covered under Characteristics: why not call them Symptoms and Signs, and why not organize them according to the diagnostic criteria, to attain encyclopedic tone?</li>
<li><s>Causes: completely omitted. The reader doesn't know, from reading this one (unreferenced) paragraph if the condition is genetic, environmental, an interplay, and may be due to "refrigerator mothers" for all the reader knows. The paragraph that is there says: Nothing. Besides being speculative and unreferenced.</s> Many of the issues I'm raising are available at <a href="http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/asperger/detail_asperger.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/asperger/detail_asperger.htm" rel="nofollow">NINDS,</a> which is in the public domain. <s>If no one here is going to write these sections, it wouldn't be that hard to take them from the NINDS, and reference them to the NINDS.</s></li>
<li><s>The prevalence section is completely uncited, speculative, unreferenced, and doesn't give the basic info a reader needs to know.</s> It also doesn't cover everything typically covered under epidemiology.</li>
<li><s>There is no pathophysiology or diagnosis section.</s></li>
<li><s>The entire Characteristics section is largely unreferenced, containing multiple, vague statements beginning with weasle words like "some people feel", and "some autistics assert." Weasle, unreferenced, original research has no place in Wiki, and even less in a medical article.</s></li>
<li><s>Relationship to autism is poorly written, unreferenced, and overlaps sections: is it wanting to be history or classification? It achieves neither.</s> Moved to History</li>
<li>Cultural and sociological views is largely speculative.</li>
</ul>

<p>Shall I keep going ?

Since I don't know AS well, I don't know which are the best sources to use, and which are the most accurate, but the article right now is not covering the basics, is not referenced, and is largely speculative original research of the type one expects to find in a personal website rather than an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 20:12, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Zeraeph, I've offered several times to help, but no one seems to be taking the offer. I largely wrote <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourette_syndrome.html" title="Tourette syndrome">Tourette syndrome</a>, so I know you can make the medical format work for a condition that is not a "disease" or a typical medical condition. I just don't know AS well enough to do the actual writing. If people will just stick in PMID numbers, I can do the full references, for example, and help with copy-editing. But, it seems that some are more interested in promoting original research than fixing the article :-) In that case, the article gets tagged, and no one reads it anyway. Perhaps some consensus to stand up to the "original researchers", and insist that the article be referenced, will help the article. The FAR process typically lasts two weeks, and one has already passed.

<dd>PS, I suggest using the writing medical articles link as a starting place. Just go section by section, grabbing the text that is available in the article, and referencing it. If you just put it in order, and if others provide some idea of a PMID number or a source, I'll be glad to help with copyediting and completing the references.

<p>What it eventually comes down to in the context of this article is things that are well-known in the autistic community and virtually unknown or ignored in research circles. That many issues are deemed as original research only gives an indication of the quality of peer-reviewed research in the area.

<dd>I'd believe that argument, except that the same can be said about TS, and I still managed to write and reference the article, including the controversial statements. If you want to write a personal essay on Wiki, there will always be a tag at the top of the article, and no one will read it anyway. So, by putting out original reseach, you're shooting the article, yourself, and Wiki in the foot. You can spin the controversial and speculative parts into a daughter article (if you can reference the statements to reliable sources): they don't belong in the main article, which doesn't even cover the basics.<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 20:14, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd be more content with an article that is "unreliable" than a medical article that reads as if AS was an terrible disease. I think it is preferable that readers don't bother to read it, and thus search for autistic community sites instead, instead of walking way with a totally biased idea of AS. I'll expect the same thing can be said about TS, but it doesn't seem like there is any strong community fighting for a non-disorder-view of TS.

<dd><i>but it doesn't seem like there is any strong community fighting for a non-disorder-view of TS</i>. You're wrong. In fact, a chapter of one of the most authoritative tomes on TS covers that issue, and it is mentioned in the TS article. The TS article still has to cover the basics. The discussion happens where it belongs: on websites, not in an encyclopedia. An encyclopedia is not an advocacy organization. Can you please point out examples of where the article on AS is now reading like a "terrible disease"?

<dd>I haven't had time to look at them, but just wanted to caution against using *general* websites for medical articles. You have to be sure it's a reliable, medical, peer-reviewed site, rather than a "general info anyone can put it up" site. The NIH site, in and of itself, is a valid source, and they keep very up to date (notice the date). It's also in the public domain, so you can "plagiarize" it and reference it directly (see the statement at the bottom of their page). On the other hand, some individual websites (even those listed as HonCode, which is not really enforced) are not reliable sources of info, unless you can establish the author's credentials via <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> (as an example, see the blog I cited on the TS article, because of who the author is and what his credential are in the field of TS). For example, I would not consider the aspergersyndrome website as a reliable source, since it doesn't appear to be peer reviewed. If a website sources a statement with a specific study, then you go to PubMed, use the advanced search, and find the specific study. The Yale site is a good primary, verifiable reference, since they are recognized as leaders in the field, so you could reference them directly. But, even better ... For instance, the Yale website above does cite specific studies. Just to give you an example of how to use PubMed:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>1. The Yale Child study link says: <i>The validity of this condition, as opposed to high-functioning autism, remains a topic of debate (Szatmari, 1992).</i> I used that example because the Szatmari criteria were never explained.</li>
<li>2. Go to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=Limits&amp;DB=pubmed" class="external free" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=Limits&amp;DB=pubmed" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=Limits&amp;DB=pubmed</a>
<ul>
<li>2a. If you want to get specific, click on limits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>3. Put Szatmari into the author field, and asperger into the main search field, and search: yields 9 articles</li>
<li>4. There is only one 1992 study: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=1483978" class="external" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=1483978">PMID 1483978</a> . Is that the one? If so, you can make statements based on that study, reference it as (PMID followed by the number), and I'll help fill in the full reference information later.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Three other cautions: you can find a website to say just about anything. Can you find a study in a reputable journal? For example, on the sexuality discussion above, go straight to PubMed and see what you can find, or go to google scholar first. And, just because you can find a factoid on PubMed, that doesn't make it accepted medical consensus. There could have been later studies which refute those findings, the study could have methodological limitations, etc. That's why I can't do more of this work for you: I don't know the full body of AS research as I do TS. And, be careful about how strong the study is. A controlled, blinded study on a very large sample which has been replicated is gold. A small sample, preliminary, not replicated study has to be qualified as such. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 00:42, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I was just providing medical based links that talk about what the research shows.

<dd>I'm sorry, I hadn't clicked on them yet. I was just speaking in general terms :-)) On the Szatmari stuff, you can search on him as the author, and put in keywords to narrow down what you're looking for. Or, look for it first on Google Scholar, and then go to PubMed when you know what you're after. Hope this helps, <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 01:03, 3 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>On another referencing note, I saw that you added Szatmari's book to the Reference list. Keep in mind there's a difference between references and inline citations. References are sources that are widely used and upon which most of the article is based, or which are used as multiple inline citations. If you plan to use the book to source a particular statement, then you insert an inline citation, indicating the specific page number from the book. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 01:06, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, all his research is in autism and Asperger's, and PubMed gives me 106 choices for Dr. Szatmari, though I probably do have the ability to contact him directly :) I might just try that, and I might just direct him to this article while I'm at it, only for his input though. --<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubhagan_33c0.html" title="User:Dubhagan"><font color="black"><b>Dubh</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/u/b/User_talk%7EDubhagan_8d04.html" title="User talk:Dubhagan"><font color="green"><b>agan</b></font></a> 01:15, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It was that 1992 reference in one of the links I've provided. That PubMed link was right, but it doesn't provide his full study, which I am currently searching for, though I have found a more detailed reference to it (Szatmari, P. (1992).

<dd>Some people feel that much of the social difficulties in Asperger Syndrome are more accurately characterized as "mutual misunderstanding", in that neither the autistic nor the neurotypical understands each other. Some autistics assert that they have a much easier time reading body language of other autistic people, and that neurotypicals have difficulties interpreting autistic body language. Comparing the nonverbal communication problems that often occur between people from different cultures is a common support given for this theory.</dd>

<dd>Actually, there is no specific medication for Asperger's itself, but rather for some of the "side effects" (can't think of a better word), like depression, anxiety, and others. There was a Therapies section that linked to the page about the different therapies, but someone must have removed it. The therapies are highly controversial, which is why they were moved to their own article. But your right, a treatment section should be established, touching on the therapies with a link to that article, an mentioning the medication stuff I said here. Like I said, I'll be picking away at it throughout the week, maybe even establishing a sub-page in my userpage first before adding to this article. --<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubhagan_33c0.html" title="User:Dubhagan"><font color="black"><b>Dubh</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/u/b/User_talk%7EDubhagan_8d04.html" title="User talk:Dubhagan"><font color="green"><b>agan</b></font></a> 21:12, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Here are the DSM codes: <a href="http://behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/dsmivtrcodes.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/dsmivtrcodes.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></p>

<li>299.80 Asperger's Disorder</li>
<li>299.80 Pervasive Developmental Disorder NOS</li>
<li>299.80 Rett's Disorder</li>
</ul>
<p>Are these the five pervasive developmental disorders referred to in the text? Why do AS, Rett's, and PDD-NOS have the same DSM code? This all needs to be covered in a section called "Classification", where the similarities/differences/controversy with ASD's can also be covered (<s>and ASD still needs to be defined in the article</s>).</p>
<p>The database used in the Wiki infobox for AS does not include the code 299.80 -- it uses 299.8. <a href="http://icd9.chrisendres.com/index.php?srchtype=diseases&amp;srchtext=299.8&amp;action=search" class="external autonumber" title="http://icd9.chrisendres.com/index.php?srchtype=diseases&amp;srchtext=299.8&amp;action=search" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> And, it leasts even more codes for diagnosis 299.8 (Atypical childhood psychosis and Borderline psychosis of childhood). This needs to be resolved for the reader. This is exactly the kind of discrepancy one expects to resolve by reading an encyclopedia.

<p>This section is very interesting, and it would be a shame to lose it because it's simply not referenced. How about some discussion of signs and symptoms and characteristics from the DSM point of view? That seems to be completely missing? I just did a quick pass, and it looks like a lot of what is there may come from Attwood's book. Does someone have that book, and can someone adequately cite the entire section? I found one example of unreferenced info which I know has been studied: there is a good, quantitative study of the content of the narrowly-defined interests in AS, as it has been contrasted with the obsessions of TS.

<dd>This is well-known thought within the autistic community, hence not original research. Maybe you won't find it on PubMed, but that seems like a restrictive source of knowledge. You might find some books on the subject, most notably Jasmine O'Neill's. Some caveats: (1) The anti-cure perspective is not dependent on social contributions. In fact, Temple Grandin has been criticized for using the 'social contribution' argument to divide the autism spectrum, as if only those who are able to contribute to society are worthy of existence. (2) Autistic rights is the movement (also called autism self-advocaty movement; autistic pride is part of that and not a separate movement really. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 15:41, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>However, Asperger syndrome does not guarantee one will have a miserable life. The intense focus and tendency to work things out logically, a characteristic of Asperger syndrome, often grants people with the syndrome a high level of ability in their fields of interest.

<p>ND, looking at your articles (above) I find (based on reading abstracts only: perhaps you have access to the full text of the articles?):</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Test—retest and interrater reliability of the AQ was good. The AQ is thus a valuable instrument for rapidly quantifying where any given individual is situated on the continuum from autism to normality. Its potential for screening for autism spectrum conditions in adults of normal intelligence remains to be fully explored.</i> (appears to be a controlled study with good sample size)</li>
<li><i>The results indicate that it has good discriminative validity and good screening properties at a threshold score of 26.</i> (appears to be a preliminary study, not controlled, but abstract doesn't really say)</li>
<li><i>At a cut-off of 26, the AQ-J had satisfactory sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value, but it had low positive predictive value (0.24)</i> and <i>The AQ-J and two short forms are useful not to predict but to rule out mild HPDD,</i> (appears to be a controlled study of good sample size)</li>
<li>Based on the abstract only (again, no access to full text of the article, which is in Japanese) <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15724518" class="external" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15724518">PMID 15724518</a> appears to make the strongest case, but still doesn't tell us it's reliable for diagnosis (as opposed to screening). (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=16586157" class="external" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=16586157">PMID 16586157</a> seems to be a variant of the same study, and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=16473340" class="external" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=16473340">PMID 16473340</a> doesn't appear relevant to the discussion - is measuring something different.)</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, so given that I'm not up on AS issues as all of you are, what am I missing? The <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_Spectrum_Quotient_16b3.html" title="Autism Spectrum Quotient">Autism Spectrum Quotient</a> article seems accurate. That is, the AQ is a screening questionnaire, not a diagnostic tool, more useful for ruling out AS, but it's value even as a screening tool has still not been fully established. Is that not correct? <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 16:36, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>At a cut-off of 26, it's useful for ruling out AS. That is, if you score 26 or lower, the odds that you have AS approach zero. Now, at a threshold of 32, it appears to be sensitive, but this is based on only one study that I know of. That is, if you score higher than 32, the odds that you meet diagnostic criteria seem to be about 60%. (In my personal experience, Aspies tend to score around 36-38). <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 00:08, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Going back to the article content in question <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asperger_syndrome&amp;diff=61876548&amp;oldid=61876204" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asperger_syndrome&amp;diff=61876548&amp;oldid=61876204" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>, yes, it may be senstive, but even the text indicates confusion over "sensititive to what?" The fact that math majors score higher on the AQ quotient doesn't mean it's AS that is being measured. (Math major undergraduate here, with no AS qualities whatsoever. Maybe it's measuring mathmatical abilities :-) It's not clear just what the quotient is sensitive to, at least to the uninitiated reader like myself. My concern is that the text added left implications that go beyond what is known about this AQ number. What do highly respected groups like the Yale Child Study Center have to say about the AS Quotient? Do they use it? Maybe those who know the AS literature better than I do can fill me in, but PubMed and Google Scholar are screaming to me that this quotient does not have widespread acceptance in the broader medical community, and it's largely a Barone-Cohen concept. As far as I can tell, the most reputable USA AS centers (e.g.; Yale, KKK) don't even refer to it. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 16:42, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, is there literature that says the AQ is not reliable? Clearly, there's literature that says it is. You have a point that most of the research that says "AQ yay!" is by Baron-Cohen and collegues; but if you care about authority, there's not much more authoritative than Baron-Cohen in autism research. About the scores of mathematics students, note that they were interviewed afterwards and diagnosed with the DSM-IV. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 00:15, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>OK, so now that I've read up on this instrument, how would you like to adjust the text? Here's what we have now:</p>
<p>The prevalence of AS in adults is not well understood, but Baron-Cohen et al. documented that 2% of adults score higher than 32 in his Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) questionnaire, developed in 2001 to measure the extent to which an adult of normal intelligence has the traits associated with autism spectrum conditions.[23] All interviewed high-scorers met at least 3 DSM-IV criteria, and 63% met threshold criteria for an ASD diagnosis; a Japanese study found similar AQ Test results.[24] <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 00:24, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That paragraph is fine. I questioned a different paragraph, the one about the "Geek Syndrome" article being printed along with the AQ questionnaire, and how "geek" is not known to be related to AS. It's probably fine as it stands now. Though I'd say that since mathematics students tend to score higher in the AQ, at least being a math geek is likely associated with AS. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 01:33, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I mean is that it's probably true that the article argued that "geek syndrome" is the same as AS. But the reasoning that it's "because it was printed alongside the AQ Test" is speculative.

<p>Interesting stuff. The journal-published studies disagree with some broad, sweeping generalations and assumptions, replayed in the article. The Mindblindness sources show exactly where this article's weakness is: it quotes a bunch of non-peer-reviewed books, but when you get down to the journal-published studies on PubMed, you find the cases are not quite so clear. I am very troubled by the amount of sourcing this article has that is not based on actual peer-reviewed, journal-published studies. I don't consider the article even remotely medically-sourced yet, but it's getting much closer :-) <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 00:57, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Although they are not recognised as often, there are adults with Asperger's. Adults are not as regularly treated, yet they still have similar problems as children. They may find it difficult gaining a job or getting into undergrad or graduate schools because of poor interview skills or a low score on Standardized or Personality tests, due to this they may be more vulnerable to poverty than the general population.[24] If they do get a job they may become victims of bullying or be misunderstood at work. They may also have difficulty finding a life partner and getting married because of poor social skills. Even later in life, many people with Asperger's report a feeling of being unwillingly detached from the world around them.</i> There are adults with AS?

<dd>Can't be unreferenced, there is already references. Well until we can find good resources for a poverty-Asperger's link this seems to be our only proof that may be the first building block for a paragraph explaining the link. I have checked Google and found some interesting articles about Asperger's and poverty, but many of them say it's just "in the works" or it's "possible" not definite. Remember I have this conidtion and I know some books about it and they too say there is a "possible" link between Poverty and Asperger's, but all agree that poverty is risk factor, but not possibly linked or correlated. <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalconleaf_2d7b.html" title="User:Falconleaf">Falconleaf</a> 4:10, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

</dl>
<p>Additional "rambling" in the same section: "Studies suggest there is a genetic vulnerability to Asperger syndrome". Where is the evidence for this? "Vulnerability", just as "pathophysiology", implies a specific disorder / disease cause of AS.</p>
<p>"Current research points to structural abnormalities in the brain, impacting neural circuits". I can guarantee that there is absolutely no study that have linked the structural abnormalities in autism to any impact on neural circuits.</p>
<p>"The condition may stem from abnormal changes that happen during fetal development". Speculation. It might be in the reference article, but this has not been proved either. Also, this clearly is offensive to autistics that claim the phenotype is not a disorder, and thus doesn't have anything to do with fetal development. Th thing is that none of the early markers of autism in fetal developments have been proved to have a causative role. These could simply be correlated just like a vast number of other traits are. Correlation is not causation. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> (<a href="../../../r/d/o/User_talk%7ERdos_77b6.html" title="User talk:Rdos">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rdos_a972.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rdos">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>Rdos, you may not be familiar with the research, but it exists. Period. Yes, the article has a weakness in that people here never written the sections citing the actual PubMed abstracts, so I had to summarize from the NIH. Perhaps that is because the article has been a repository of original research for so long that editors didn't realize that they should be citing real research. If you would stop complaining and obstructing progress on the article, and spend some time in PubMed, you would find that the NIH doesn't report anything that isn't based on journal-published research. I'm trying to help you keep your featured article: I'm not going to do every bit of work for you. The NIH does not publish speculation: they publish a summary of journal-published research, and are accepted as a reliable source (the same can't be said of some of the books used to cite some of the speculative content). <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 12:03, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Yes, it should. I've been asking editors who know the most reliable sources in this area to do it for over a week. I don't know the good research from the bad in AS, as I do in TS. I don't know which research is refuted, which is controlled, which is replicated, etc. People who follow AS should know that, or should have access to authoritative tomes on the topic which give references to the research, summarizing the strength of each statement and what kinds of studies it's based on. I've given multiple sources of finding that kind of research above, and places where the work could start. Again, I think the problem is that folks here might not have realized how much of a repository for original research this article had become, or how little referencing of actual, journal-published research is done in the article. Most of the article is currently referenced to non-peer-reviewed books and articles. I don't know if that will get past FAR or not. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 13:08, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The weakest, most vague, and most unreferenced part of the article is the whole section that used to called "characteristics", now under Symptoms and signs. Most of it really should just be cut, because it's enough to keep the article from retaining its FA status.

<dd>During the school years, many are perceived as highly intelligent underachievers, clearly capable of outperforming their peers in their field of interest yet persistently unmotivated to do regular homework assignments (sometimes even in their areas of interest). Others, in contrast, may be overachievers who are hypermotivated to outperform peers in school. This adds to the difficulties of diagnosing the syndrome. In more serious cases, the combination of social problems and intense interests can lead to unusual behavior, such as greeting a stranger by launching into a lengthy <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monologue.html" title="Monologue">monologue</a> about a special interest rather than introducing oneself in the socially-accepted way. <a href="../../../p/o/k/User%7EPokey2006_2993.html" title="User:Pokey2006">Pokey2006</a> 04:31, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sure that the "study" of Autism in a US metropolitan area is the one I refered to below. It is not a prevalence study, it is a study of children in special education. Because of the lower average black IQ (15 points), blacks are much more likely to end up in special education, therefore this study is basically useless when it comes to prevalence of autism, much more so when it comes to prevalence of AS, which is usually diagnosed after 3-10 years of age. My study is ongoing. I will let it accumulate a couple of thousand answers before I terminate it and present more reliable conclusions. Anyway, thanks for the links to the persentage of Internet users per race.

<dd>This is the only case where you have backed your statements with research. I don't know the field, don't know the journal, and don't know how valid your source is (in terms of whether his conclusions enjoy widespread support in the medical community, or if there is refuting evidence). You can find a study that supports anything: is there widespread consensus and support from other studies, or is your report the whim/opinion of one author, who got published in a less-than-prominent journal? Others here will have to figure that out. I guess I shouldn't fight so hard for this article to keep its star if it's going to again revert to a personal essay and repository for original research as soon as external focus is off of the article. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 12:25, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's because I've been deeply involved in this aspect, and even asked professionals to do extensive searches for me. Without that, I too might be fooled by summaries by NIH that isn't backed up by any real research.

<dd>Well, something tells me to trust the NIH more than your "professionals who have done extensive searches". Again, this is Wikipedia, not your personal website. Do you have a blog? It might be a good place for your ideas. I have many of the same issues wrt TS research as you do with AS, and I can tell you the NIH summary of TS doesn't contain anything speculative, unproven, or biased. If you don't have time to properly refute the NIH info from reliable sources, then you might not want to make speculative, unsourced, original research entries into Wikipedia. Wiki uses reliable sources, and the NIH is one. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 13:20, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sandy, I welcome you to provide the studies that prove that every race is equally affected by AS. This is a long-runner in autistic circles, probably mostly in curebee-circles and parent-circles, but nobody to this date have been able to provide any meaningful reference for it. The other hopelessly speculative information from NIH about fetal development leading to autism is equally un-researched. It is not my reponsibility to provide studies that refute this, but your to provide evidence for the claim. Look at this MEDLINE article for instance: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15184241&amp;query_hl=4&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15184241&amp;query_hl=4&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 13:46, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Rdos, you apparently don't understand how Wikipedia works. I suggest that you spend more time reading policy. Every statement added by every editor needs to be referenced to a reliable source. I've added content that meets that criteria, because quite simply, no one else had written the sections. If you have additional content that refutes what I've added, it's up to you to add it and reference it from reliable sources. Further, the reference you give above doesn't disagree with anything stated in the article. There is a genetic factor, and probably an environmental one as well: same is true for most neuropsychiatric spectrum conditions (e.g.; TS) -- nothing new there. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 14:33, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sandy, I'm gonna have to agree with Rdos on this one. All NIH says about rase is <i>Asperger disorder has no racial predilection</i>. It includes no details and no source. The statement is just there. Referring to one unsourced statement isn't exactly a reliable source. Now, I also found this statement: <i>Individuals with Asperger’s Syndrome are found in all racial, ethnical, intellectual, and socioeconomic backgrounds (Case-Smith, 2001)</i>. Now, I went to look up the reference provided in brackets, and turns out it was a study in occupational therapy for children with Autism, not a study in prevalence. Otherwise, I haven't been able to find anything discussing Autism/AS and race. --<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubhagan_33c0.html" title="User:Dubhagan"><font color="black"><b>Dubh</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/u/b/User_talk%7EDubhagan_8d04.html" title="User talk:Dubhagan"><font color="green"><b>agan</b></font></a> 17:19, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeah, but they only use one US city in each case. A proper race study will go all around the world to study it, as I've said above. Besides, using only two races isn't sufficient enough for a full racial study anyway. Also, using one US city doesn't address environmental factors as a potential cause either. --<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubhagan_33c0.html" title="User:Dubhagan"><font color="black"><b>Dubh</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/u/b/User_talk%7EDubhagan_8d04.html" title="User talk:Dubhagan"><font color="green"><b>agan</b></font></a> 17:50, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That would be geo-racial, would it not? Racial studies using appropriate qualifiers in a region would be just as valid, if different than what you're suggesting. It'd certainly be interesting to see how AS prevalence in various regions around the world would be, but it should have little bearing on prevalence within accepted racial bounds, unless you are suggesting that a non-significant racial mix is present in the cities in question. --<a href="../../../k/e/y/User%7EKeyne_c410.html" title="User:Keyne">Keyne</a> 19:35, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Out of curiousity, isn't there a message board or newsgroup or something where you all deal with these questions and issues on an ongoing basis? When we're trying to salvage this article, which has still not been fully referenced, copy edited, written or wiki-linked, I can't understand so much debate over one sentence. Just fix the sentence to something you can all accept as a compromise, and move on to the more important work. Some sources say there is no racial predilection, others disagree, cite both sides, and move on. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 20:28, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Because the NIH source is in the public domain (see the info at the bottom of their page), it is OK to use it verbatim. I had originally summarized it, but since RDos disagreed with my summary, I substituted the exact wording. Since there appears to be some controversy here, I thought it best to stick with the exact wording from the reliable source: if you can better reword it, that works for me, but if it gets too far away from the NIH wording, it will need to be referenced from other sources. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 13:27, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

Medical studies published in journals don't require page numbers: books do. The MOST preferred reference for any medical article is the actuual PMID study.

<p>To be honest, I like Sandy's template that was there before - we should probably replace the PDD one with something like that one of these. Templates in see also are also a common occurance, in case anyone is wondering (albiet not with the blue top). As for the references, do not remove them, period - they are needed and yes some articles with only a few paragraphs sometimes need 100+ citations so there is no "number limit" - the idea is that every claim needs to be referenced.

<p>All I'm saying is that, like with all other templates I've seen, if the article is listed on the template, than the template should be posted on the article.

<p>RN, where do we stand on the template? I see an addition of a See also article was just made (a needed one, I think?), so we have See also in one place, and the template in another. Do you plan to expand the template, and we shouldn't have a See also as well as a template. I can envision the See also getting out of control again, if we don't hold it what's in the template. Maybe you can look at the way I had reorg'd the deleted AS template to include all of the PDD template? <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 12:19, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>In A Guide to Asperger Syndrome (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), Christopher Gillberg also criticizes the "no significant delay" clauses of the DSM, and to a lesser extent some of the others, and argues that the clauses represent a misunderstanding or oversimplification of the syndrome. He states that although there may well be significant delay in some areas of language development, it is often combined with exceptionally high functioning in other language-related areas, and he argues that this combination superficially resembles but is in reality very different from normal development in language and adaptive behavior.</i> Natche24 21:38, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd><i>Szatmari suggests that AS was promoted as a diagnosis to spark more research into the syndrome: "It was introduced into the official classification systems in 1994 and has grown in popularity as a diagnosis, even though its validity has not been clearly established. It is interesting to note that it was introduced not so much as an indication of its status as a 'true' disorder, but more to stimulate research ... its validity is very much in question."</i></dd>

<p>One critique I do have of the section is that there are many theories on the causes and research going into each of those theories. Covering only two of those seems only unfair. Maybe we should just list the causes that are being researched. Something like this:</p>
<p>Example: <i>While the cause of AS is currently unknown, there is research being done on several possible causes. Researchers at the University of California are looking into the possibility that AS is caused by abnormal changes during fetal development.(Citation) Another area being researched...</i></p>
<p>Other possible causes that I've heard include genetic, environmental and vaccines. They all should be covered in a way similar to how I wrote the fetal development one. --<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubhagan_33c0.html" title="User:Dubhagan"><font color="black"><b>Dubh</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/u/b/User_talk%7EDubhagan_8d04.html" title="User talk:Dubhagan"><font color="green"><b>agan</b></font></a> 23:03, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that it would be good to include mention of ongoing areas of investigation, but I suggest keeping in mind two things:
<dl>
<dd>1) I don't find it helpful when articles say who is doing the research or where it's being done (e.g.; <i>Researchers at University of California ...</i> ). Unless the need to include this info is compelling, it's easier on the reader just to see "Research into ... " whatever, and then the reference cite indicates who/where the research is ... it begins to feel like a vanity entry when specific researchers are mentioned, and if subsequent institutions are also doing research, they get left out.</dd>
<dd>2) Make sure PMID cites are used, or at least official websites calling for research, so that entries include published research, or research from legitimate teaching and research institutions (UC Davis, Yale, Kennedy Krieger, etcetera).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I completely agree that the Causes section is incomplete, and as mentioned before, regret that it had to be summarized from NIH since it was not here. It certainly should be expanded, but not by the method used by Rdos (deleting verified content, and introducing speculation). Let's try to take care that we don't make it sound speculative, rather scientific. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 23:14, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Causes of autism has two tags at the top: that is a tipoff that it probably is mostly unreferenced original research as well, and means most people won't read it, and it needs to be cleaned up as this article has been.

The article is largely unreferenced, has a lot of prose problems, and reads like a speculative essay. Many of the references needed over there can now be found in this article.

<dd>That's fine with me, Zeraeph, it was just an idea. If anyone is interested, Causes really needs to be restructured. It needs to start with what is known, and branch from there into what is being investigated, in a more clearly organized way. For example, AS is known to have genetic underpinnings, blah, blah, blah, twin and sib-pair studies have shown such-and-so, blah, blah The exact genes have not been identified. It is believed to be polygenic (???) and so on. Then, there are also environmental issues ... and expand on each one of them. It would also help to stay away from mention of particular researchers and research institutions, and just lay out the research. I just find it very sad that a currently featured article links to a series of articles, every one of which is tagged and problematic.

<p>I just found this quote about this book, on the Yale site:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Now in a fully updated Third Edition, The Handbook of Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders, edited by Yale Child Study Center faculty Fred R. Volkmar, M.D., Rhea Paul, Ph.D., Ami Klin, Ph.D., and Donald J. Cohen, M.D., has, since the first edition, become the most influential reference work in the field of autism and related conditions. In two volumes, this invaluable reference provides a comprehensive review of all information presently available about these disorders, drawing on findings and clinical experience from a number of related disciplines such as psychiatry, psychology, neurobiology, and pediatrics. For more information, visit our publications page.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Once again, I encourage those who are concerned about the "medicalization" of this article to seek out sources that will help write the rest of the story. The resources are out there: they just have not been accessed. I just discovered that Donald Cohen (now deceased) was one of the authors of this book. He was the source of most of the text that allowed me to discuss the latent advantages and positive aspects associated with Tourette syndrome on the TS article. He was a unique individual with respect to his ability to write respectfully and about the positive aspects associated with neurological differences. Again, I insist that the information is out there: I hope others will look for it and finish writing the rest of the story, rather than tearing down the accurate information that is now in the article. You can balance the article by introducing missing content, not by tearing down accurate content. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 14:15, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">DMOZ NOT NPOV</span></h2>
<p>After careful thought I realise that the substitution of DMOZ for "external links" is grossly inappropriate.</p>
<p>The reason is very simple, the continued inclusion of any link in DMOZ depends entirely upon the POV, and good graces of the page editor, and, while the Asperger's syndrome page lacks an editor, it could get one at any minute, and until then is controlled by an editor further up the tree.</p>
<p>There really is no excuse for introducing this degree of bias into an article.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 12:32, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure I agree with you, and I've not observed that to be a problem with DMOZ. Can you please give an example of a worthy site that is not in DMOZ, and if there is one, do you know if the webmasters have submitted it? But anyway, we need to pay close attention to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>. Some criteria for inclusion should be established here. Specifically, if a particular link is not already in DMOZ, the reasons should be examined: there may be a good reason DMOZ rejects a particular site. For example, I just reverted a site claiming to be the most popular: if it's the most popular, it should already be in DMOZ. If you let one external link in here, without it being the link to a nationally or internationally-recogized non-profit representing AS, you may end up in a position of having a web directory again.

<dd>It astonishes me that you can spot every minute flaw in a Wikipedia article and yet never have noticed the extent of the bias in DMOZ?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Currently nothing gets into the category (including a new editor) without the approval of the last editor back along the line. Very few of these editors meet Wikipedia's high standard of impartiality and neutrality, the one in this instance falls further short of it than most (and since I found that out the link really has to go), but that isn't really the point. Which is that there is no point in having a neutral article that includes only a link to a directory of external links that could be suddenly biased in any one of a number of directions, suddenly, or dramatically, on whim or towards agenda, with precious little accountability, and nothing anybody her could do to mediate, at any minute.</dd>

<dd>I think DMOZ can still be included, but if there are sites not listed on DMOZ, then we can include those too.

<p>I agree with Sandy that some of the links have got to go such as the websites for AS people because there are so many. Some othe informational web sites are advertisments for books they need to go. As for the schools there are also to many to count and also need to go. On the other hand I feel like the Adult issues and some of the organizations should stay. Natche24 19:43, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok, I've condensed it.

<dd>Wow, I go away for a few hours, and you all chopped it away :-) First, Zeraeph, I'm still wondering what DMOZ has left off? Can you please give me an example? If the commercial links added are the problem, I can see why DMOZ might leave off commercial links. Also, you don't need MedlinePlus in the External Links because it's in the Info Box at the top of the article. The Brenda Myles link feels commercial -- isn't that basically a bookseller? And there's another book publisher there: that raises more eyebrows than the excessive number of links, since they are commercial. More importantly, I'm thinking you all might want to agree on criterion as to what gets included, so you won't have to edit war it in the future. If you allow commerical websites, you could end up with every AS snakeoil seller.
