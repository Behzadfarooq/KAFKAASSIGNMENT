<p>I'm deleting a large chunk of text - however, since I wrote the text originally, no one should be concerned.&#160;:) I asked a friend knowelegeable about such matters to contribute some text, which I consider far superior to my initial entry and am thus putting in wholesale. <a href="../../../-/-/_/User%7E--_April_95d9.html" title="User:-- April">-- April</a></p>
<p>AS is the common shorthand for it. Or ASP</p>
<p>Quick question about the following sentence from near the end of the article: <i>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual's diagnostic criteria have been roundly criticized for being far too vague and subjective.</i> Is it the DSM's Asperger's diagnostic criteria that have been criticized, or *all* of the DSM's diagnostic criteria for all the disorders it tries to cover? I don't know, but I think the sentence or paragraph could be reworded a little to remove that confusion; as it is, I could read it either way. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a> 17:07 Dec 18, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Both. Some people think that all or the vast majority of the DSM-IV is nonsense. A slightly larger number of people think that the specific entry for asperger's is nonsense. The former is arguably off-topic, though. -<a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a></dd>

<p>This is an outstanding article that I found to be highly evolved and a really great read. The only personal link I have to Autism was with a woman I dated with three autistic children. She was phenomenal to endure the perpetual frustration of teaching them and attending to their needs. From then on, I have been keenly aware of autism clinical trials and am looking forward to potential diagnostic, clinical, and therapeutic breakthroughs in this often confounding disease. --<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiewalker_b307.html" title="User:Piewalker">Piewalker</a> 05:23, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Asperger's Disorder" is a non-neutral term, a point made humourously at the <a href="http://isnt.autistics.org/" class="external text" title="http://isnt.autistics.org/" rel="nofollow">"Institute for the Study of the Neurologically Typical"</a> [parody]. "Asperger's Reorder" would be more accurate, but that term is not in popular use.</p>
<p>If "Asperger's Syndrome" were used, and "Asperger's Disorder" was a redirect, that would surely be better IMO. --Morosoph 14:48, 4 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>It really should be named "Asperger's Syndrome". I tried to rename it, but I wasn't successful. I can't tell if the software was really stopping me, or if it was the "helpful" people riding on "Recent Changes" that were stomping on me in the middle of trying to rename it according to the instructions on how to move a page. -- <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmillar_a6b9.html" title="User:Amillar">Amillar</a> 18:53, 6 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems to me that this page *should* be at Asperger's Syndrome, simply based on standard usage.

<p>Although this comment has nothing to do with the improvement of Wikipedia I would like to thank all of you for making Asperger's Syndrome a "Featured article". I have Asperger's Syndrome and regularly meet people who have prejudices towards autism. When they think of autism, they think of a child that plays with the wheel of his toy-car for hours in a row. They don't seem to comprehend that there are people with a type of autism but still seem to function relatively well in a society. Sometimes they don't believe I have Asperger's because I function so well and they think of the social problems I mention as nonsense. Making Asperger's Syndrome a featured article on the Wikipedia main page may well improve the understanding people have when they think of Asperger, autism and me. Thank you.

<p>I've heard that Asperger's is much more common among males than females. And that females show very different symptoms than males. I.e. is not as hindered in social relations and not so obsessed with a strange hobby. I also think that Asperger's is a genetic disorder. <a href="../../../b/l/_/User%7EBL_57f1.html" title="User:BL">BL</a> 12:09, Apr 17, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(wo)Man, quit this! I know at least five boys with it (when I take myself in the count) and only one girl. In game therapy, when I was a child, I was in a group where there were as many as five boys and only one girl. So in my personal experience the share of boys in the total group of aspergerists is even bigger than 3 out of 4.--<a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaesarion_63c7.html" title="User:Caesarion">Caesarion</a> 13:03, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Asperger's and autistic disorder are more common among males (by 4:1, IIRC) but the symptoms present in pretty much the same way. I personally believe that AS/Autism has a genetic component in many if not most cases, but there is a great deal of dispute about that. Remember also that a "syndrome" is defined by its common features; virtually by definition we don't know what causes it at the time it is designated a "syndrome" <i>cf.</i> "AIDS" <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> 17:01, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>same here, im still a teen but i think i've done a satisfactory job of attempting to overcome those difficulties in regards to social relations. great to see a page so well written. And in response to BL's comment above, I'd like to see if anyone can find evidence as to how asperger's might be genetic. my father displays symptoms characteristic of aspergers (the dsm-iv-tr guidelines are way too vague), and it would be logical, from a wired article on the 'geek syndrome' (<a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) that it is somewhat genetic. *shrug*, just my two cents. - <a href="../../../a/p/p/User%7EApplegoddess_1a4f.html" title="User:Applegoddess">Applegoddess</a> 08:44, 30 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a serious question, raised in the "Criticism" section of the main article. I have met a number of women with AS, and most of them would not come across as particularly masculine personality types. AS is a complex phenomenom which can affect people differently, and there is a lot more to it than unusual or obsessive interests, but going by something one woman with AS said to me once, it is possible that some girls with AS can show an exceptional interests in traditionally "feminine" activities e.g. dancing. Even a lot of men with AS are about the last people you would expect to find getting into a fight in a bar. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 01:29, 2005 Feb 1 (UTC)</p>
<p>Someone has tried to reply to this on the actual article, but the article is now getting confused. When Baron-Cohen, rightly or wrongly, advanced his theories about AS being an extreme form of "male intelligence", he really did mean by that mental traits you tend to get in men, not just a socially constructed phenomenom. Therefore this does raise some important issues about females with AS. The person who attempted to reply to this is entitled to their opinion, which may merit discussion, but it is not the same as Baron-Cohen's opinion. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Genetic Traits</span></h2>
<p>Are autism, ADD, dyslexia, or Asperger's genetic traits? Are there any good links to sources with an opinion? I am very high-functioning to the point that I am usually <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passing.html" title="Passing">Passing</a>. I strongly feel that Asperger's is a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_construct.html" title="Social construct">social construct</a>, or at the least it is a learned trait, and thus not intrinsic to an individual. The entire thing is a vicious cycle; higher intelligence and mildly poor social skills create a "snowball" effect as a child grows up: I was teasted and ostracized by other children for my Asperger's symptoms, thus I developed emotional problems due to stress. My proof is that I used to have obsessive compulsive disorder-symptoms as a child to the point that I was a prisoner in my own home, but after moving to a new town and starting my life over in my teens, this stopped utterly; my social skills also drastically improved. I feel that I became emotionally withdrawn not for lack of trying but because I was excluded from growing up with the same emotional support as other children. I strongly agree with the statement that Asperger's is just an extreme case of the way the "male-brain" works (although it applies to both genders). But the snowball effect is that once a child is teased, excluded, etc., the emotional detachment and anguish this causes leads to psychological problems that really wouldn't have developed to such an extent in a caring environment (I am not a psychologist, and I am not hubristic enough to think that these broad claims I am making should be taken as fact, but I feel they should be researched). Why must a person's self-worth be based on their level of social-interaction? If I speak to someone and dont' necessarily look them in the eye, does this mean I have less value as a person? What are we, wolves? A person's intelligence, integrity, and creativity are what make us most true to ourselves, not how well we interact socially. Under <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Smith_aff1.html" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a>'s social model (Adam Smith wrote the Wealth of Nations and I feel his work led to the rise of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consumerism.html" title="Consumerism">consumerism</a>, people have become consumers who gratify their immediate needs and those who believe in truth and expression; artists, scientists, etc. are ignored. <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rousseau.html" title="Rousseau">Rousseau</a> was disgusted by this and developed the concept of a <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohemianism.html" title="Bohemianism">bohemian</a>, someone who lives on the fringe of society and refuses to be tyrannized by public opinion. Rousseau (in The Social Contract) defined freedom as setting your own rules and then obeying them (under Smith, society sets the rules, so no one is harmed, and thus all members become well-suited to social interaction). Do I feel that, under rules I have set for myself, social interaction comes first? No. "Staying true to myself" does. I am eccentric. This is not a problem; <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Stuart_Mill_d597.html" title="John Stuart Mill">John Stuart Mill</a> in "On Liberty" called for a return of "the eccentric" to society. Mill said that as a society we live in an age where there is a "tyranny of the majority"; public opinion (proper social interaction helps this) determines what is right and wrong, not objective truth. Public opinion "raises the low and lowers the high", and consumerism and conformity have won out over self-expression. I am receiving a mixed message; on the one hand, I am supposed to "be myself" and revel in this; "everyone is special" is a cornerstone of teaching in schools. However, it would appear that "some people are more special than others" (To paraphrase Animal Farm). <a href="../../../n/i/e/Nietzsche.html" title="Nietzsche">Nietzsche</a> would call this "herd-mentality". Ultimately, Mill says that eccentricity in society must take precendence over public opinion, because it will broaden our sense of freedom and lead to a search for the best life. I am deficient at both verbal social skills and non-verbal signals. This in no way makes me less of a person. Social interaction does not define such things as creativity, ambition, love; things that make us truely human. But I look around today at a consumerist, conformist culture that excludes all eccentricity. Was society always like this? I don't think so. I think we just assumed that society was always like this, that this was the way things are supposed to be because we cannot remember it being another way (post hoc ergo propter hoc). Again, it is a vicious cycle; eccentric, above-average intelligence "Asperger's" children are ostracized by others growing up; this is what leads to our loss of social coordination and the ability to function with social signals; I believe that this is a Pavlovian trait. Case in point, the trademark "bland, unexpressive face" (noted in the entry in this article on Georgie from Dead Like Me) is not an intrinsic flaw in our character; it is a Pavlovian trait. We have been taught to fear social interaction because it usually ends in rejection, and thus we have developed a passive-aggressive defensive mechanism, a "turtle" response if you will. We should consider this strange reaction to awkward social events not a deficieny of ourselves, but something forced on us. We live in a culture where youth, beauty, and consumerism are king (read <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brave_New_World_b07b.html" title="Brave New World">Brave New World</a>, I find it precient). Of thousands of scientists or great thinkers today, who can name even a handful? But pop culture icons and movie-stars are worshipped. Do bubblegum-pop bands have anything meaningful to say? About knowledge, the soul, how I should live my life, etc? The tyranny of public opinion has set in an I fear what is to come. Many intelligent, though eccentric, "Apserger's Syndrome" patients have been excluded from contributing to society, and under false pretexts and broad social label have been almost completely marginalized. For those like myself that have symptoms that fall under the umbrella-term of "asperger's syndrome", I feel that the tyranny of the majority is pushing us Towards A "Lurker Caste"; in effect we will "<a href="../../../l/u/r/Lurker.html" title="Lurker">lurk</a>" on the margins of a social order which they have created tailored to their specifications (this all happens unconsciously mind you) but only watch from the fringe, a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disenfranchise.html" title="Disenfranchise">disenfranchised</a> group subjected to great misery, in a world not of our own making. ---Name Withheld, 17:04 EST, Sep 13 2004(UTC)</p>

<dd>On the question of whether it is a genetic trait, much evidence definitely points to it being a real, neurological difference, and not just a matter of social training. In one family I know, one child is clearly Aspie while the other three are not. All the children were raised the same way. That's just one data point, but if you do any reading, you'll find it is a clear trend. I'd recommend the book "Pretending to be Normal" as a good starting place. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmillar_a6b9.html" title="User:Amillar">Amillar</a> 22:26, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm, I remember writing tirades of this length about morality and ethics on a MUD I was wronged on, but I didn't ramble or rely on irrelevant name-dropping or flawed arguments. To refute you shortly, a human is a social animal; it's also many other things. Therefore, the less of any trait out of all seen and known human traits one has, the less human one is. Moreover, I might have had the article's symptoms some time in my life, though I could well understand social clues; the problem was I was un-coordinated, astigmatic, neurotic, and withdrawn. But those problems solved themselves with all the suffering I went through. <a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysdexia_bda0.html" title="User:Lysdexia">lysdexia</a> 20:15, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Is ADD genetic? I read a book about ADD called "Scattered Minds" I forget the writer. He was asking where it come from as well. ADD tends to be more prevalent if a parent has ADD as well. He also found that ADD tends to be more prevalent in people with emotional problems relating to parents, specifically feelings of love and acceptance. His theory is that there is a genetic portion of it that makes us more sensitive to developing it and that emotional relationships as a child are the source. It is hard to say though, many people with ADD may actually have Aspergers syndrome, it can have similar symptoms, including obsessive behaviour. I do show obsessive behaviour, but the obsession seems to drift and refocus on other things all the time. The writer of the book also showed obsession, he spent more than 1000 dollars in a week (I think that was the figure) on cds... specifically classical music.</dd>

<p>(Comment) I have aspergers and attend a youth club for people with aspergers. We have 5/6 female members. So far, 1 is obsessed with pigions, 1 with Anime, 1 with star trek and the other 2/3 we arnt sure about. Out of the remaining 2 or 3, 1 shows obsession with people like michal jackson, but im not sure if that counts.</p>
<p>The male members do suffer obsessions also. I myself am a computer and war game fanatic. My freind alan is a star wars fanatic, my freind danny a guitar nut etc....</p>
<p>While it may be genetic, females and males act very similar in most respects.</p>
<p>Also, my youth club attendances have helped, as have other strange freinds in other places (Epilepsy, dislexia and at 1 point a strange goth creature named shaun....)&#160;:P However, I'm probably 1 of the more nomal people with aspergers... ---Chris Barrett, Dec 31, 2004</p>
<p>I agree with the original poster that AS is very much a <i>social construct</i> and I say that as someone diagnosed with AS myself and initially saw it as an explanation for my teenage woes. By defining AS as an autistic spectrum <i>disorder</i> in effect the psychiatric establishment claims our brains are deviant, abnormal, pathological.. yet the scientific evidence is very inconclusive and very few AS-diagnosed adults have had a brain scan (fMRI or PET) anyway. Besides most of the alleged differences in the orbito-frontal cortex can be attributed to neuroplasticity. If you spend most of your time alone glued to a computer screen or game console, then inevitably your brain will rewire itself to adapt to the new environment. The obsessive interests you mention are pervasive in our decadent society. Indeed I'd say most people are obsessed with one thing or another, usually watching soaps or indulging in consumer junk. Society is literally driving people insane, amplifying subtle neurological differences that set in train much more profound differences in the development of personalities and performance levels.

<p>Asperger's syndrome shouldn't be in the category of eponymous diseases because it isn't a disease. You can't be cured from it. It doesn't kill you. It doesn't hurt you or give you illusions.

<p>No disagreement. Both are acceptable usages and neither is "official".

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pro-cure POV attack</span></h2>
<p>Someone is trying to push here pro-cure POV. I analyze their contributions in detail.</p>
<p><i>The Asperger’s Syndrome community, particularly on the internet, is deeply divided along ideological lines into two broad groups loosely known as the “pro-Aspie” group and the “pro-cure” group.</i> <strike>That's right.</strike></p>
<p><i>Pro-Aspie groups believe that Asperger’s is not a disability, but simply a part of the individual’s personality. Therefore, they actively oppose many forms of treatment of the condition. They strive to change the world to accommodate them based on the assumption that the condition will never be cured as a matter of principle. To this end, they encourage social skills education for sufferers and education for those living with people with Asperger’s.</i> Word sufferer isn't appropriate for an article that strives for NPOV. It is indifferent for pro-Aspies whether you can "cure" Autism or not, so don't start to talk about it here.</p>
<p><i>Pro-cure groups are opposed to and offended by the pro-Aspie culture likening it to the growing <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro-anorexia.html" title="Pro-anorexia">Pro-anorexia</a> culture on the internet. Pro-cure groups claim that their position is supported by scientific fact. They believe that the primary aim for sufferers is to not suffer any more. They want to be cured, and in the mean time, want to be able to live life as best as possible despite their condition.</i> You can't compare pro-autism to pro-anorexia movement. Those conditions differ remarkably. Autism doesn't kill you. Pro-anorexia movement claims that anorexia is a choice, but everyone (including pro-autistics) knows that autism isn't. I am also curious what are those scientific facts. Discrimination and planning schools and other institutions only for NTs don't count, then we also had to eliminate the blacks, the blind and the lefthanded.</p>
<p><i>It is worth noting that one is more inclined to adhere themselves to a group or a website if it involves expressing a desire to remain as one is rather than to change. Why join a group with the express desire to no longer be a part of the group? This explains why you may find many pro-Aspie sites on the internet but few pro-cure communities. This does not mean that all Aspies are pro-Aspies, or even a majority. The overwhelming majority of parents and those who face the daily realities of living with a sufferer support the search for a cure, as do most adult sufferers.</i> What is your source on this opinion survey?</p>
<p><i>Further inspection of the forums on the pro-Aspie community websites as well as the autism wiki reveals an anti-responsibility, anti-employment, almost anarchist agenda whose scope extends far beyond the limited topic of developmental disorders. Opinions are labelled as “ignorant” and “a misconception” even though they are held by many sufferers themselves.</i> This kind of defaming isn't allowed in Wikipedia! I am curious how many pro-autistic website have you read. I might know what community is in question, bu I say no names... One community isn't reliable sample.</p>
<p>I'd like to know if there are pro-cure communities and organizations outside US. I haven't heard any before stumbling on Cure Autism Now Foundation in Internet.

<p>I modified the section to be NPOV, but I still dispute the factual accuracy. I don't see a "division" in the online Asperger's community among autistic/Asperger's people surrounding the cure issue. I think the claim to the contrary needs a reference if the section is to stay in the article. <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 11:48, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Here are some more things that need referencing in the "Asperger's on the Internet" section:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is claimed the anti-cure group is known as the "pro-aspie" group. I have never heard of this naming scheme for the anti-cure group. I would like to see a reference for it.</li>
<li>I have heard a few autistic/Asperger's people express a desire for a cure, while the overwhelming majority that I have met do not and I have not seen a "division" of any kind in the online community. The section claims some people believe the pro-cure Asperger's people are the majority and that there is a division. I would like to see a reference for this.</li>

<dd>I have to emphasize that the my mother tongue isn't English and I don't understand all the nuances of the text. I thought that division could also be 1:50, not necessary 2:3 or 1:1. When I commented the text, I didn't notice that it stated "two broad groups". There is only one broad group. I have corrected my comments. I haven't also heard of word "pro-aspie" before. Maybe they derived it from pro-anorexia. Putting pro in front of a word show that the phenomenon has remarkable opposition. Hence pro-aspie can't be a neutral word, because it assumes the oppositon, which isn't the case. -<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHapsiainen_6f9e.html" title="User:Hapsiainen">Hapsiainen</a> 03:37, Feb 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In addition to having never heard of a pro-cure faction (I and my son both have AS), my neurologist has never heard of such a "faction."

<dd>Actually, I saw a program on the science channel (I think it is owned by the same company as discovery channel) that found a skeleton with a combination of human and neanderthal characteristics which dated at some time after the Neanderthals were believed to have gone extinct. It is possible that everybody is part Neanderthal. I'm not sure if I taped it or not but I'll provide more information if I do find it. However, I don't think the show mentioned Asperger's or mitochondrial DNA. <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 03:40, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>There is almost no evidence for human-neanderthal hybridisation (see, <i>e.g.</i>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/15/science/15nean.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/15/science/15nean.html" rel="nofollow">this NYTimes article</a>) - some questionable skeletons, but no mt DNA evidence as far as I am aware. There is one external reference, but I couldn't find <i>evidence</i>, just speculation. AFAIK the neanderthal DNA which has been extracted is very different from modern human DNA, suggesting that is hybrids did occur, they were either did not have offspring (reasonable, hybrid sterility is common) or were very rare. The incidence of autism/AS is <i>far</i> too high to be explained by this.</dd>
<dd>More to the point though, the information is in the article, and seems to have been accepted <i>with absolutely no evidence</i>. I may have missed the announcement, but it seems that if the "evidence" suggested in the article really existed, that knowledge of this stuff would have made its way to participants in a workshop on Neanderthals (cf, the NYTimes article). <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 20:37, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It should be pointed out that mtDNA is independant of nuclear DNA, unlike nuclear DNA, mtDNA comes only from the mother. A lack of Neanderthal mtDNA in modern humans only tells us that no purely female lines of Neanderthal descent current exist. Some positive references for Neanderthal Hybrids.</p>

<p>Don't remove the section that says that Asperger's is linked to early vaccinations. My mom attended a seminar about Asperger's (when you have the duty of raising a boy with Asperger's, you tend to learn a bit about it) and that is what they thought the cause was. As these early vaccinations rose, the cases of Asperger's also increased.</p>
<p>Please don't write a response to the vaccine-case on this talk page. Do it on mine. - <a href="../../../b/-/1/User%7EB-101_6b01.html" title="User:B-101">B-101</a> 13:58, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC) (<a href="../../../b/-/1/User_talk%7EB-101_e7e9.html" title="User talk:B-101">User talk:B-101</a>)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That all the people interested had to go from here to your talk page? How clumsy, this is the natural place for the response. The theory that the vaccines cause Autism isn't accepted by the scientific community. Some weaknesses of the theory (from Quackwatch.org):</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>The known number of ASD cases has been increasing since 1979, but there was no jump after the introduction of MMR vaccine in 1988.</li>
<li>Cases vaccinated before 18 months of age had similar ages at diagnosis as did cases who had been vaccinated after 18 months or not vaccinated, indicating that vaccination does not result in earlier expression of autistic characteristics.</li>
<li>At age two years, the MMR vaccination coverage among the ASD cases was nearly identical to coverage in children in the same birth cohorts in the whole region, providing evidence of an overall lack of association with vaccination.</li>
<li>The first diagnosis of autism or initial signs of behavioral regression were not more likely to occur within time periods following vaccination than during other time periods.</li>
<li>A weak statistical association existed between MMR vaccination and initial parental concern, but this appears to have been due to parents' difficulty in recalling precise age at onset and a preference for approximating the age as 18 months.</li>

<dd>There may be more to it than just co-incidence - many people will argue very strongly that <i>their</i> child never showed any signs until they were vaccinated (autism or AS). However, vaccination is a traumatic experience, and it might serve as a <i>trigger</i> in children with AS/autism. I am (by word of mouth, though I could find out if it's published or not) that trained professionals could identify children with autism or AS in first birthday videos, even though the parents did not suspect anything at the time. So the first time a parent <i>notices</i> it may not be the onset - after all, most parents first experience with a baby with AS or autism is their own child. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 15:43, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just to underscore what Guettarda said - doesn't vaccination typically take place at about the same age when symptoms of "minor" forms of autism such as AS would first become readily noticable? It's not like you can easily tell if a six-month-old is an Aspergian, most of the symptoms involve things that just don't tend to come up that early in life.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dog eating homework idiom</span></h2>
<p>The text says: "When a teacher asks a child with Asperger's, "Did the dog eat your homework?","</p>
<p>Well, what would a non-aspie child answer <i>if she was unfamiliar with the idiom</i>?</p>
<p>I was an intelligent child, and they thought I was aspie (even a couple of years before that became a fashionable diagnosis in my region), and one of the reasons was that I always questioned idioms like that. I would answer "No, I don't have a dog" and the NT teacher would balk at that. I still don't know if I was/am aspie or not, (I've got a diagnosis that says I am, but I don't have any problems "reading other people"), but I wonder what a non-aspie child would answer, and I think it's a weird example.</p>
<p>Not everyone (especially children!) has heard that expression or would make sense of it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think a better example of an idiom would be "I don't bite." It's commonly used as a slightly disparaging thing to say to somebody perceived as "shy", and might be something most aspies have heard directed at them at one time or another, and had no idea what it meant. <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaibabsquirrel_3907.html" title="User:Kaibabsquirrel">Kaibabsquirrel</a> 04:59, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have no knowledge of the matter or opinion either way, however this sentence ignores the fact that immunisation could have increased the chance of autism or Asperger in males, and not so much in females?

<li>The most important issue is that studies which have looked for a correlation between vaccination and AS/autism have failed to find any correlation.</li>
<li>If immunisation was somehow "causing" AS or autism, then you should see similar levels in males and females because the proportions immunised are similar. So the underlying cause must be something other than immunisation. Of course it could be possible that the relationship between immunisation and AS/autism could be different in males and females - but that is a totally separate argument (and, AFAIK, not supported by the existing studies). <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 01:20, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi, I am the inventor of the word Aspiette. Just because my word isn't popular yet, it doesn't mean you can change the original definition that I made of it! Geez - since when you do have the control over the word that I invented? It was, after all, a natural progression from the nickname Aspie to adding the 'ette' onto the end of it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Geek vs. Asperger's</span></h2>
<p>One section of the page makes pains to distinguish being a "geek" from having Asperger's. There is no black and white distinction here, its all shades of grey. Ask "geeks" about there childhoods, you'll find that Asperger's/autistic childhoods arn't all that uncommon. Even amongst the many "geeks" who never fully fit the current diagnostic criteria, you will find many autistic traits.</p>
<p>The question shouldn't be "do I meet the DSM criteria?" but rather, "are these my people?". Believe me, you'll know pretty damn fast when you walk into a room full of Aspie's and/or autistics if you belong there. Or maybe you partly belong there, but whatever the case you don't need a doctors note to know what you are.</p>
<p>Imagine how far the gay culture and gay rights would have gotten if you needed a doctors diagnosis of homosexuality to identify as gay. Regrettably Asperger's is a label which we do not define for ourselves. I honestly wish there was another word for "us" which isn't up to the experts to define. Entropy888 05:28, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Agreed. As recently as April 2003 I didn't think I was quite allowed to count as an aspie, just because I don't have the trait of taking metaphorical phrases literally! All books on aspies up to then treated it as an essential defining symptom, just because of its interest to NTs. Yet my social aspieness is major enough that I got diagnosed in a single session. <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tern.html" title="Tern">Tern</a>, Aug 19, 22:33</p>

<p>I don't know the official stats from empirical research, but during my Psych training, we were taught that the traits for autism spectrum disorders and dyslexia/dyscalculia cosegregate, or occur together in family trees of related individuals. Dyscalculia is especially common in aspergians whose particular troubles involve complex abstract reasoning. It is often the case that aspergians have excellent memory retention skills, but a very concrete experience of the world that makes intensive abstract reasoning, such as in algebra and so on, particularly difficult. --adam black 22:44, 2005 Jun 8 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Gillberg thinks that dyslexia is probably no more (or less) common in aspergians than in the general population, but that dyscalculia probably is overrepresented (despite a high incidence of Aspergians being exceptionally good at math).</dd>
