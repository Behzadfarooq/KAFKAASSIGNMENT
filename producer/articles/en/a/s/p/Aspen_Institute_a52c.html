<p>The Institute was largely the creation of <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Paepcke_9789.html" title="Walter Paepcke">Walter Paepcke</a>, a <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> businessman who had become inspired by the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Books_dfc4.html" title="Great Books">Great Books</a> program of <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortimer_Adler_468f.html" title="Mortimer Adler">Mortimer Adler</a> at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Chicago_7f0f.html" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, Paepcke visited the decaying former mining town of Aspen in the <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roaring_Fork_River_e443.html" title="Roaring Fork River">Roaring Fork Valley</a> and was inspired by its natural beauty, envisioning that it could be transformed into a place where artists, leaders, thinkers, musicians from all over the world could gather in a place secluded from their daily lives. In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a>, in order to help fulfill his vision, Paepcke organized a 20-day international celebration for the 200th birthday of <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poet.html" title="Poet">poet</a> and <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosopher.html" title="Philosopher">philosopher</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe_cb5b.html" title="Johann Wolfgang von Goethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a>. The celebration attracted over 2,000 attendees, including many notable international intellectual and artistic figures of the day, including <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Schweitzer_70b0.html" title="Albert Schweitzer">Albert Schweitzer</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Jose_Ortega_y_Gasset_90c5.html" title="Jose Ortega y Gasset">Jose Ortega y Gasset</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thornton_Wilder_b1a7.html" title="Thornton Wilder">Thornton Wilder</a>, and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Rubinstein_5bfd.html" title="Arthur Rubinstein">Arthur Rubinstein</a>.</p>
<p>The following year, in 1950, Paepcke founded the Aspen Institute, and later the <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspen_Music_Festival_a8cc.html" title="Aspen Music Festival">Aspen Music Festival</a> and the Aspen International Design Competition. Paepcke sought to create a forum “where the human spirit can flourish,” especially amid the whirlwind and chaos of modernization. He hoped that the Institute could help business leaders recapture what he called “eternal verities”—the abiding values that guided them intellectually, ethically, and spiritually as they led their companies. Inspired by philosopher Mortimer Adler’s Great Books seminar at the University of Chicago, Paepcke created the Aspen Institute Executive Seminar. In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a>, the Institute sponsored a national <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photography.html" title="Photography">photography</a> conference attended by many of the nation's most noted photographers, including <a href="../../../a/n/s/Ansel_Adams_4d06.html" title="Ansel Adams">Ansel Adams</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorothea_Lange_dce7.html" title="Dorothea Lange">Dorothea Lange</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Shahn_a351.html" title="Ben Shahn">Ben Shahn</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berenice_Abbott_64fc.html" title="Berenice Abbott">Berenice Abbott</a>. During the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>, the Institute further expanded with the addition of new organizations, programs, and conferences, including the Aspen Center for Physics, the <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspen_Strategy_Group_e24e.html" title="Aspen Strategy Group">Aspen Strategy Group</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspen_Institute_Communications_and_Society_Program_1393.html" title="Aspen Institute Communications and Society Program">Communications and Society Program</a> and other programs that concentrated on education, communications, justice, <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asian</a> thought, science, technology, the environment, and international affairs.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>, through a donation by <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corning_Glass_eae9.html" title="Corning Glass">Corning Glass</a> industrialist and philanthropist Arthur A. Houghton, Jr. the Institute acquired an additional 1,000 acre (4 km²) campus on the eastern shore of the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chesapeake_Bay_70ed.html" title="Chesapeake Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a> in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryland.html" title="Maryland">Maryland</a>, known today as the Wye River Conference Centers.</p>

<p>Today the Aspen Institute seminar programs have expanded to include sessions such as Global Values and Leadership and Pursuing the Good Life. The Institute supports 20 policy programs and partnerships directed by leading policymakers and practitioners. The programs explore topics such as prospects for peace in the Middle East; communications, media, and information policy; economic opportunity in rural America; social innovation through business; the nonprofit sector; creating smart solutions to help Americans save, invest and own; and community initiatives for children and families.</p>

<p>The Aspen Institute leadership initiatives include a variety of programs for accomplished young entrepreneurial, government, and civic leaders spanning a number of different countries. Through these programs, the Institute is identifying young men and women between the ages of 30 and 45 who have already achieved a certain level of success and encouraging them to reach yet further — for significance by benefitting society at large.</p>
<p><b>The Henry Crown Fellowship Program</b> seeks to develop our next generation of community-spirited leaders, providing them with the tools necessary to meet the challenges of corporate and civic leadership in the 21st century. The program is a unique mix of intellectual and personal development seminars designed to broaden the perspectives of the participants and hone their skills in values-based leadership.</p>
<p><b>The Africa Leadership Initiative (ALI)</b> brings together as Fellows successful young leaders from Ghana, Nigeria, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya. The program encourages the Fellows to take more responsibility for the society in which they live and work.</p>
<p><b>The Aspen Institute-Rodel Fellowships in Public Leadership</b> seek to enhance American democracy by bringing together the nation's most promising young political leaders to explore and discuss the underlying values and principles of western democracy. Open to men and women who are in elective office and ideally under the age of 45.</p>
<p><b>The Central America Leadership Initiative (CALI)</b> seeks to develop a new generation of community-spirited leaders in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. The region is home to a growing number of capable young leaders in all sectors of society. CALI is designed to capture the energy, the talent, and the resolve of these leaders leaders who have already realized a certain level of success and inspire them to assume a more proactive stance in addressing the foremost challenges of their region and their times.</p>
<p><b>The India Leadership Initiative (ILI)</b> is a collaborative venture between the Aspen Institute, the Aspen Institute India, and the Global Markets Institute of Goldman Sachs. Like the Henry Crown Program, ILI focuses on young (ages 30–45) entrepreneurial, government, and civil society leaders from across India. It provides them with an opportunity to better understand their own leadership values and those of their peers; to engage more vigorously in the foremost challenges of their communities and country; and to explore new ways to work in concert to improve Indian society and the world at large.</p>
<p><b>The Liberty Fellowship Program</b>, inspired by Aspen Institute seminars and modeled after the Henry Crown Fellowship Program, is for motivated leaders in South Carolina.</p>
<p><b>The Nigeria Leadership Initiative (NLI)</b> is an international nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that aims to provide a platform for highly successful Nigerian leaders who are uniquely qualified to influence the future development of Nigeria, to enhance or develop their values-based leadership skills, and to assume a transformative role in the future development of Nigeria. The mission of the NLI is to create a growing global network of credible and very accomplished community-spirited Nigerian leaders who are committed to taking responsibility for driving positive change in Nigeria and Nigerian communities.</p>
<p><b>Socrates Society Seminars</b> serve as a forum for emerging leaders to explore leadership challenges. Discussions are built around advance readings of classical and contemporary works, and led by dynamic moderators who encourage participants to share their interpretations. The weekend sessions are not lectures, but rather exercises in the Socratic method: the primary benefits derive from diverse, thoughtful, and active contributions by Socrates participants.</p>
