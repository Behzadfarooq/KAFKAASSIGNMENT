<p>I see asparagus has its own family. I always thought it was part of the lily family.</p>
<p>Is there any truth to the <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_legend.html" title="Urban legend">urban legend</a> (rural legend?) about asparagus being more hardy in salty <a href="../../../s/o/i/Soil.html" title="Soil">soil</a> than most other economically useful <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plant.html" title="Plant">plants</a>?</p>
<p>Is there any particular reason there's nothing at "Asparagus", which simply redirects here? It would seem like it should either be at "Asparagus" or have a Disambiguation page there if there are other things also called "Asparagus".</p>

<p>Possibly it's not great manners, but asparagus is kind of made to be picked up. Kind of like a chicken leg, it just works. It's better if not cooked too much though. BrianHFL 01:13, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You may pick up and eat asparagus if it is served in the proper manner. It's part of cultural lore (at least in some socialogical cirlces) that polite diners, even ladies all dressed up in their finery at a well-appointed table, commonly eat asparagus by picking them up from a side plate and dipping the tips in a small, personal bowl of hollandaise, delicately eating the tips (and only the tips, mind you) in a dignified, particular and carfeul manner. On the other hand, I think most most of you are correct: one is not supposed to chase it around the dinner plate, digging one out from underneath the mashed potatoes and roast beef juices to hungrily shove it in his mouth, voraciously gobbling it down while gripping a can of beer in the other hand, making sure to make lip-smacking finger/licking noises like some uncouth American eating greasy fried chicken while wearing his three-day underway and watching 'football' or wrastlun.

<p>"Unlike most vegetables, where the smaller and thinner are the more tender, thick asparagus stalks have more tender volume to the proportion of skin."</p>
<p>NO NO NO! Large stalks are like a rope. They have tougher fibers as they get older. This explains the baseball bats people foist on me at the market. Any comment? <a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDominick_690e.html" title="User:Dominick">Dominick</a> <a href="../../../d/o/m/User_talk%7EDominick_f59a.html" title="User talk:Dominick"><sup>(TALK)</sup></a> 14:30, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Besides, "more tender volume to the proportion of skin" just don't make no damn sense. Tenderness is not measurable by volume. --<a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunkendub_726b.html" title="User:Funkendub">funkendub</a></p>
<p>The larger ones get a lot more fiber. Maybe thats what I mean. <a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDominick_690e.html" title="User:Dominick">Dominick</a> <a href="../../../d/o/m/User_talk%7EDominick_f59a.html" title="User talk:Dominick"><sup>(TALK)</sup></a> 17:00, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm also skeptical, but I have seen it claimed that thicker asparagus stalks are better, for one reason or another. One asparagus trade group even <a href="http://www.asparagus.org/maab/facts.html" class="external text" title="http://www.asparagus.org/maab/facts.html" rel="nofollow">bluntly says</a> "The larger the diameter, the better the quality!", although they aren't quite an unbiased source. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 05:16, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dominick is right. The larger the stalk, the tougher it is. The fibers are much more rope-like in thicker stalks. "better" could mean higher in fiber (or fibre), which is probably healthier. When served in "nice" restaurants you'll almost always see small tender shoots. Supposedly the tips are more prized, but I like the whole stalk. BrianHFL 01:18, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dominik is certainly correct: the larger ones have a woody character that just gets more bitter and spongy as the size increases. Dark green, thin, long ones are the best because they are the most tender and flavouful. So, if you see these in the stuper-market, please leave them for me and you can go eat those giant green trunks of 'celery.'

<p>Someone had written this: <i>According to Zach Zellmer (a leading resologist in the area) it also makes one's urine smell peculiar. This is believed to be due to the breakdown of the <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amino_acid.html" title="Amino acid">amino acid</a> methionine, which causes the production of the sulphur-containing methylmercaptan. This theory can be viewed along with another at <a href="http://www.asparagus.org/maab/faq.html" class="external free" title="http://www.asparagus.org/maab/faq.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.asparagus.org/maab/faq.html</a></i> Then, someone else removed it but he shouldn't have - this information is accurate and I can personally attest to it. I've always been fascinated by asparagus's ability to alter the odour.<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocEss_fb29.html" title="User:DocEss">DocEss</a> 17:50, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ooops - scratch that - it is indeed included in the article but was included twice. Superfluous, I believe too.<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocEss_fb29.html" title="User:DocEss">DocEss</a> 17:53, 22 October 2006 (UTC)<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocEss_fb29.html" title="User:DocEss">DocEss</a> 17:55, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Here's the relevant paragraph from the reference:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allison and McWhirter first showed that the ability to produce methyl mercaptan after eating asparagus is not universal. Some people would produce detectable amounts in the urine after eating only three or four spears of asparagus, while others would produce none even after eating as much as one pound (0.45 kg) of asparagus. In their random sample of 115 human subjects, they demonstrated that this ability occurred in about 40% of the population, with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. In a larger study of 800 volunteers, Mitchell and co-workers verified these findings in both men and women, and from a pedigree analysis of two families, with one spanning three generations, the autosomal dominant mode of inheritance was also confirmed. Interestingly, the BMJ later reported a study in which all the subjects could produce methyl mercaptan, but their ability to smell it in the urine differed. Those who were able to smell the odour in their own urine could smell it in the urine of anyone who had eaten asparagus irrespective of whether or not that person could smell it. The authors suggested that the ability to smell these substances in one's or, indeed, another's urine was also genetically determined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The summary on the wiki page completely misrepresents this. Two studies, one shows variation in production, a later study says production is universal (if varying) but ability to smell varies. This is not at all the "no correlation" that the article claims.</p>
