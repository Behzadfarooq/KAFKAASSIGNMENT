<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Aspie"</span></h2>
<p>The article uses the term "aspie" to refer to people with Asperger's. Is this an accepted term? Could it be perceived as inappropriate? I really don't know the answer to this, but it just sounds strange to me.</p>
<p>Yes Aspie is an entirely accepted, if perhaps less than scientific sounding, way to refer to a person diagnosed with Asberger's. In fact your use of "people with Asperger's" is in many ways more offensive as some people like myself do not consider themselves to "have" Asperger's but rather to "be" Asperger's. <a href="../../../s/y/m/User%7ESymmetric_Chaos_0a64.html" title="User:Symmetric Chaos">Symmetric Chaos</a> 14:01, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's an informal term, meant to sound less imposing (and possibly less judgemental) than "person with Asperger's Syndrome". By comparison you might want to note that the article <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left-handed.html" title="Left-handed">Left-handed</a> speaks of such people as "lefties". -- <a href="../../../w/r/i/User%7EWrittenonsand_3868.html" title="User:Writtenonsand">Writtenonsand</a> 01:06, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Sorry guys - I didn't read this first before making changes, but even in this light, unless we're going to explain the use of Aspie and provide sources to verify that this is commonly used and provides no offence to anyone then, for the moment, I'm taking them out. Some may still take offence or find the phrase unnecessarily informal, and as it doesn't aid in any way to use the phrase (in fact when reading the article I didn't know what it meant) I see no benefit in leaving it in. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETompagenet_9d27.html" title="User:Tompagenet">Tompagenet</a> 12:27, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think we can keep this link. Several reasons:
<dl>
<dd>It's me who added it to the article</dd>
<dd>It's a text by a renowned specialist</dd>
<dd>The article does not contain any other reference to SPD and schizophrenia spectrum disorders, which often overlap with AS</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>That's more of an argument for including a mention in the article itself rather than just an external link.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">dubious science fiction mention</span></h2>
<p>This sentence bothers me:</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is a semi-jocular theory within <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction_fandom.html" title="Science fiction fandom">science fiction fandom</a>, for example, which argues that many of the distinctive traits of that <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subculture.html" title="Subculture">subculture</a> may be explained by the speculation that a significant portion thereof is composed of people with Asperger's.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It seems to be completely unreferenced. Also, it's not a paragraph&#160;:). Maybe we should just remove it.... any thoughts anyone? <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 23:52, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The sentence is also in the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction_fandom.html" title="Science fiction fandom">science fiction fandom</a> article.

<p>in copy-editing this section, i took some liberties with this sentence without realizing it was an express topic of conversation. i hope i didn't step on any toes. it seem to merit inclusion, and to fit vaguely with the following paragraph, so i merged them. in particular, it didn't seem to be an example of a previously mentioned concept, so i removed "for example". i also have the impression that "jocular" was the wrong word here, but perhaps i am mistaken. i thought that "somewhat" would fit better with standard english than "semi-".<a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_sacre_5c53.html" title="User:Le sacre">tej</a> 01:59, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm comparatively new here and haven't participated in any debate here before, so if this isn't formatted right, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I am becoming severely irritated at what I have added about the science-fiction/Asperger thing being removed as supposedly anti-Aspie. I am not, having both ADHD and a lesser case of AS myself, and with a son similarly afflicted.</p>
<p>I am anti-cultural bigotry. There is a long, established history of science fiction being regarded as "that crazy Buck Rogers stuff", with a similar lack of regard for those who read it. This whole "that explains the science fiction weirdos -- they all have a personality deficit disorder" attitude is a slam which stains anyone who is a fan of the genre, and it is NOT "neutral point of view" to let a bigotry, even one held by a professional in the field, go unremarked-upon. Try substituting some other group for Star Trek fans in Attwood's remark, like Jews or blacks or Democrats, and see if it still sounds harmless.</p>

<dd>Explicitly describing it as bigotry still isn't NPOV or encyclopedic, in the least. This is not a grey area and it is not negotiable. You don't find such language on the page describing the Holocaust, for example, no matter how clear it seems to some (probably virtually all) people that words like "bigotry" apply. <a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurplePlatypus_df26.html" title="User:PurplePlatypus">PurplePlatypus</a> 00:08, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, I have changed it to the softer word "prejudice". I'm not trying to be inflammatory or non-encyclopedic in style but I think that this prejudice/bigotry exists, and to not at least note it is in fact not encyclopedic, in the larger sense of the word.</dd>

<dd>I see that you claim to have written most of the article. Look, I'm not trying to pee in your pool, pardon the phrase. I don't dispute any of the good work Dr. Attwood has done, and I'm not trying to mess up your article. But to haphazardly classify entire groups of people, "jokingly" or not, as having a serious personality deficit disorder, is at mininum careless on his part, and at worst, yes, bigotry, and it seems to me, perhaps naively, that an article on the topic which is intended to cover the entire topic, should have a mention of it in some fashion.</dd>

<dd>Just to deal with one admittedly fairly minor thing, I didn't write most of the article, though a fair chunk of it is my work. My biggest contribution was taking what was once an incredibly disorganized dog's breakfast of an article and editing it into something FA-worthy (it was already an FA before that, but the standards for featured articles changed and it was in danger of losing that status at one time). By no means did I do this single-handedly, but I think it's safe to say I was the single largest contributor. But I couldn't have done it if there hadn't been lots of good stuff there long before my arrival; it was just a bit haphazard. Many paragraphs in the article as it stands today are Frankenstein's monsters I assembled from bits that were in three or four different places before, but for the most part you can't tell they were stitched together in that way; they actually read better than the originals. (Others have since improved them even further, of course; I don't edit this article much anymore.) Just thought I'd take a moment to clear that up.</dd>

<dd>I don't see what Attwood said as bigotry. I'm a science fiction fan, a geek, and an Aspie -- and when Attwood says something like that, I nod and think "yup, he's probably right. No wonder so many of my friends are also geeks and SF fans. And no wonder I feel so at home among them." I think that reading "that explains the science fiction weirdos -- they all have a personality deficit disorder" into it is seeing a slam that isn't actually there. It's not bigotry, just an acknowledgement that SF is an area of interest well-suited to the Aspie mind. But no one said all SF fans are Aspies, nor do any of us here think that being an Aspie is a negative thing, really. -- <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManekiNeko_cc64.html" title="User:ManekiNeko">ManekiNeko</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EManekiNeko_2e50.html" title="User talk:ManekiNeko">Talk</a> 00:33, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whether we like it or not, having AS is regarded in the mainstream culture as having a mental disorder: AS disqualifies one from military service, from being a cop or a firefighter, from being electable to political office. The broad brush, even used with the intention of jest, is damaging -- if said about an individual, even in the same joking manner, it very well could be grounds for a libel or slander suit, and it strikes me that if it's wrong to disparage a stranger in this way, it's more wrong to disparage a bunch of strangers.</dd>

<dd>David, you've also posted the above to my user page. I'll answer it here if you don't mind. Firstly, you do not quote your sources (other than the one in the Asperger syndrome article which doesn't support your claim) so according to the Wikipedia rules your additions have to go. I posted a question to your talk page in order to get some background and see if I'm wrong. From your response here, it appears that I am correct, so I would recommend that you take the axe you have to grind with Attwood somewhere else where it might do some good. Attwood's jocular speculation does not have anything to do with Asperger's syndrome. Please realise that Attwood does not represent Aspies. For all you know, I might disagree with him completely and could write pages why I believe he is wrong. I could, for example, take your advice, substitute one thing for another and replace your contribution to SF Fandom with the following: "There is a theory held by some mental health professionals who deal with fandom, including leading expert Dr. Tony Attwood, that many Aspies' personalities match those of SF fans, and therefore most Aspies are SF fans. This rather sweeping generalization is regarded by some as an offensive stereotype, reflecting cultural bigotry on the part of non-Aspie health professionals." But personal beliefs (your and mine) are not relevant to Wikipedia. Bottom line, I do not think the Asperger syndrome article is the place to discuss this and if the Attwood page is a good place, you should still quote your sources in order to let your criticism stand. Otherwise, next thing you know Attwood will be claiming this is libel and all that. Finally, I suggest that you study WP rules before adding POV stuff. And just maybe you could subscribe to WikiEN-L and lurk there for a while. And please forgive my brusqueness. Anywhere else I would rewrite and rewrite until it was totally NT but not here. <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">&#160;AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 02:26, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For the record, it isn't a two-way street: for a psychiatric professional to falsely characterize someone with AS as also being a <i>Star Trek</i> fan will not damage her or him. For a psychiatric professional to falsely characterize a <i>Star Trek</i> fan as having a pervasive personality disorder can be life-destroying. People can lose their security clearances, their jobs (not everybody works in IT, y'know), the control over their finances (as per recent stories in the Los Angeles <i>Times</i> about professional conservators), even the custody of their children.</dd>

<dd>David, it follows from my and your arguments that you and I are both correct, so I've changed the article to reflect both views. I hope you can agree with the change. I've removed your arguments, which - while both compelling and applicable to the opposite POV - only served to convince other editors and have no place in the article itself. If you agree, you may want to similarly update the SF fandom article. (The Attwood article still needs a better quote I think.)

I am in process of doing another websearch to find them, but so far have not; it may be that the pages I saw before have been taken down. Nonetheless, I will continue to search with several different engines, and you may rest assured that if and when I again find those other instances where he said that, I will post links to them here on Wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>I think others have already explained why this doesn't make any sense. (And libel? Being called a possible Aspie is libel? It's something to be <i>proud</i> about, if you ask me.) Attwood didn't say that "sf fans = Aspies," or if he seemed to, I believe it is an out-of-context interpretation. He said Aspies are frequently sf fans, and yes, there are a lot of them. It's not the same thing. -- <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManekiNeko_cc64.html" title="User:ManekiNeko">ManekiN</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManekiNeko_cc64.html" title="User:ManekiNeko">ko</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EManekiNeko_2e50.html" title="User talk:ManekiNeko">Talk</a> 23:17, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I remain seriously concerned about Dr. Attwood's comments, regardless of how minor you personally perceive them to be. As an internationally known expert, his statements can be introduced into legal procedings which can destroy lives. People can lose security clearances, employment, child custody, or control over their own finances on the basis of false association between <i>Star Trek</i> and science fiction fandoms and Asperger Syndrome. Even if they are simply the *examples* of fixations you purport them to be, his casual use of them is careless, and his repeated use of them over the course of several years does lead one to think he believes they are significantly related. Science fiction has been referred to as "that crazy Buck Rogers stuff" for many decades, and here is a mental health professional who is saying, in effect, <i>yes, interest in that genre is evidence of mental illness.</i> It is not a small matter.</dd>

<dd>Whether we like it or not, having AS is regarded in the mainstream culture as having a mental disorder: AS disqualifies one from military service, from being a cop or a firefighter, from being electable to political office. The broad brush, even used with the intention of jest, is damaging -- if said about an individual, even in the same joking manner, it very well could be grounds for a libel or slander suit, and it strikes me that if it's wrong to disparage a stranger in this way, it's more wrong to disparage a bunch of strangers.</dd>

<p>As a random Aspie reading this, and a science fiction fan, it seems pretty darn clear the 2 groups overlap. What's wrong about mentioning it? The fact that it confrims some people in their silly prejudices is not enough reason to ignore the truth.</p>
<p>And, I, like others, do not see Aspergers as something to be ashamed of. I'd like a cite to "keeping us out of the military, police, etc".</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposal: move page (rename) to "Asperger syndrome"</span></h2>
<p>It seems that academic and psychiatric authorities (eg national institute of neurological disorders and stroke, part of the nih, at <a href="http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/asperger/detail_asperger.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/asperger/detail_asperger.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/asperger/detail_asperger.htm</a>) prefer to call it "Asperger syndrome" rather than "Asperger's syndrome." I have seen parallel mentions on reputable sites of "Asperger syndrome" and "Asperger's disorder." (ie, the possessive apostrophe is only used with "disorder," not "syndrome." I suggest we move the page to reflect this. When I was trying to figure out which way was most correct, I came to Wikipedia; so I think we should try to be as accurate as possible, even if it's a rather quibbling change.<a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_sacre_5c53.html" title="User:Le sacre">tej</a></p>

<dd>I agree with Tej. Though I saw it called both Asperger Syndrome and Asperger's Syndrome in the course of my research, the former seems to be significantly more common, especially in material from the last few years. Asperger's Disorder is preferred by the one practicing psychiatrist I've mentioned it to but I would prefer to steer clear of that for reasons related to the "Shift away from view as a disease" material in the article. <a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurplePlatypus_df26.html" title="User:PurplePlatypus">PurplePlatypus</a> 21:04, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I haven't read Sowell, and from what I see here, I certainly wouldn't agree with Sowell, but the content does not seem to be inappropriate to me -- it seems to be a reasonable presentation of the POV those who don't think autism is involved. The fact that I (and many here, clearly) may think Sowell's idea is hogwash isn't relevant to whether his ideas should be mentioned here. What <i>is</i> relevant is whether Sowell is in any way notable enough to be mentioned in this context, I think. If he is, I thought his theory was addressed fairly. I don't know if he is or isn't that notable as I was trusting other editors on that issue. The content didn't have a whiff of linkspamming or anything like that -- I really do think it was written up in a neutral way. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManekiNeko_cc64.html" title="User:ManekiNeko">ManekiNeko</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EManekiNeko_2e50.html" title="User talk:ManekiNeko">Talk</a> 09:15, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I still disagree -- I don't understand why presenting an alternate viewpoint should not be done. (However, as I mentioned, I have not read Sowell, and I do not know what sort of reputation he has in this area. Maybe the whole world thinks he is a quack. And based on the presentation of his ideas here, I certainly don't <i>agree</i> with him.) It still seems that people are trying to remove the content specifically <i>because</i> they don't agree with Sowell, and that is POV. That is my concern here. However, if I'm the only one who feels that way, so be it. I will go by the consensus and won't revert. I just think presenting conflicting ideas in controversial topics neutrally is generally a Good Thing. 68.193.45.148, I think based on your edits you are perhaps leaning a bit towards POV (trying to add the list of suspected autistic celebrities, wanting Sowell's anti-AS ideas removed), and I sympathize with your intent (as an aspie myself who does not support pro-cure ideas, etc.), but I just don't see Wikipedia as the place to make that point. But being rigid about objectivity is undoubtedly one of my more aspieish traits... <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManekiNeko_cc64.html" title="User:ManekiNeko">ManekiNeko</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EManekiNeko_2e50.html" title="User talk:ManekiNeko">Talk</a> 11:26, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wasn't around when this discussion was talking place, but I notice that there are no Sowell references in the article anymore. I've read his main book on the subject. While probably non-scientific, I think it's of general interest. I'd say a mention of that probably belongs in the <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_functioning_autism.html" title="High functioning autism">high functioning autism</a> article. Sowell deals with kids who have speech delay. Aspie kids don't have speech delay ("clinically significant" speech delay according to the DSM, whatever that means.) In any case, it should be noted that he's an economist. His observations are based on the fact that his son was a late talker, and I guess he didn't like his son labeled autistic or retarded. His son I believe is now a software engineer, which Sowell takes as proof that he's of course not autistic. (I'm a software engineer too.) I've heard rumors that his son does in fact appear to be autistic. Sowell's criteria for distinguishing between HFA kids and "Einstein Syndrome" kids is vague, ad hoc and uncientific; basically this: (1) They have several engineers or musicians as close relatives and (2) They understand at least some of what they are told. Sowell I believe tracks the progress of many kids who have been referred to him. It's silly to suppose that his group of kids are, in any significant proportion, going to grow up to be like Einstein or Edison. However, his results may be of interest in other respects. I don't recall the exact claim, but I believe most of his kids start to speak within 2 years of the parents starting to worry (without so much as speech therapy most of them). Isn't that pretty much equivalent to the results of some ABA studies? (ABA has not been validated by <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double-blind.html" title="Double-blind">double-blind</a> studies and it's unclear how kids are selected). Now imagine that these kids had been referred to Lovaas instead of Sowell. He also refers to research of a professor, Camarata I believe is the name -- if this professor has some published results, that would be more scientifically relevant as well. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 14:46, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>FWIW, while we were discussing whether to keep the Sowell references in the article, 68.193.45.148 seemed to agree to leave the material in while a discussion was ongoing in here, but then deleted the material only a few minutes later while it was still being discussed. I was tired of dealing with him so I didn't put it back that time. Since no one else has either, I guess one could say that consensus is that the material isn't necessary. But I did find it inappropriate to delete it under those circumstances. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManekiNeko_cc64.html" title="User:ManekiNeko">ManekiNeko</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EManekiNeko_2e50.html" title="User talk:ManekiNeko">Talk</a> 23:46, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for signing your post!&#160;:) Clearly our edits are overlapping at the moment here and on the article page. I reverted the article just now for two reasons -- you probably figured out that one reason is that we are in here discussing this issue right now. So I rv'ed that for the moment so we can at least discuss this for a bit longer if anyone wants to contribute. (As I mentioned above, I will go by what consensus says -- it's just that no one had really responded yet to Ryan's request for disagreement, and now that I have... well, I hope we can have a discussion.) Also, the list of rumored autistic celebrities is a separate issue -- those shouldn't be posted here without sources. (Not just random websites, either.) So that had to be reverted as well. That's been discussed here on the Talk page in the past, I think. If there are other changes to your stuff that you are asking about, I'm not sure because I didn't do them, but maybe someone else will answer. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManekiNeko_cc64.html" title="User:ManekiNeko">ManekiNeko</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EManekiNeko_2e50.html" title="User talk:ManekiNeko">Talk</a> 11:59, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

It might be true in other areas, like <b>real</b> medical diagnosis like cancer, but has no relevance for AS. In fact, diagnosis are done by questioning the person to be diagnosed and family.

<dd>With respect to self-diagnosis, at least, my view is that you have the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burden_of_proof.html" title="Burden of proof">burden of proof</a> exactly backwards. It's the person making the surprising and almost bizarre claim (self-diagnosis is <b>not</b> problematic) that needs to provide citations, not the person reporting the mainstream view. The problematic nature of self-diagnosis <i>is</i> mentioned in passing in a number of the AS-related articles and books I've read, but I don't have the references handy (they were all borrowed from my university library). But none should be needed - the claim was considered <i>obvious</i> and <i>commonplace</i> enough by Gillberg and whomever else to not need citations in those publications, so I don't see why it would need any here. I would be very surprised if you could find a psychologist who <i>does</i> think self-diagnosis is reliable. (You did mention one test, but I have no idea whether that was a controlled experiment in a scientific journal or a self-selecting survey on a random web site, and in any event, there is no single reliable test for AS - as you correctly point out, the process of diagnosis is more nuanced than that.)</dd>

<dd>You and Ryan are entitled to your POV regarding self-diagnosis. The problem is the wording (which is not neutral) and the fact that self-identification tests have been removed from the article. This makes this a POV-issue. If for example, there were links to popular self-identification tests, like the AQ-test and/or Aspie-quiz, it would not be a problem. I suggest a proper section about diagnosis. In this section you can put both the idea that some find self-diagnosis problematic, can present the most useful aspect of professional assessment (support from society) and give links to self-identification. THat would solve the problem of NPOV. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 06:03, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It does not seem to me that self-diagnosis being "problematic" is an AS-related thing, necessarily -- it's considered problematic <i>in general</i> in psychological and medical fields. We aren't supposed to rely on self-diagnosis most of the time when we have physical illness, either. However the term "dangerous" that was in the article always bothered me a bit -- it was as if it was implying that self-diagnosis would cause spontaneous combustion or something.&#160;:) I don't think it is necessary to say self-diagnosis is dangerous in the article. The way it reads now, saying that there was a "rash of self-diagnoses" but not saying whether those were good, bad, correct, or incorrect, seems like a good way to deal with it. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManekiNeko_cc64.html" title="User:ManekiNeko">ManekiNeko</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EManekiNeko_2e50.html" title="User talk:ManekiNeko">Talk</a> 23:23, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fact? Not many things in psychology are facts. For example, if Simon Baron-Cohen thought this was a 'fact', why did he construct the AQ-test? Why did Tony Atwood write the paper "The Discovery of Aspie"? Why put up the Australian AS-scale? The Aspie-quiz draws sources of questions from 9 different sources, most which are from professionals in the field. IOW, I think it is highly unlikely this is a 'fact' agreed upon by most professionals. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 08:20, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know about Attwood or the Australian scale, but Baron-Cohen did <i>not</i> create the AQ test specifically for self-diagnosis if I understand my reading correctly. And in fact he makes an effort to explain that a high score does not necessarily indicate that one is autistic. Having said that, though, I believe that self-dx'ed aspies are quite often right, but of course I wouldn't want to see that in the article <i>unless</i> there's a good citation.

<dd>As for the issue of burden of proof. It is the article that is proposing something (self-diagnosis being problematic, Geeks not being AS). I'm not advocating for inserting that self-diagnosis is fine and all Geeks are Asperger's. I think these claims should be <b>removed</b>. Therefore, I think the burden of proof lies on the people that are proposing unsupported ideas. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 06:36, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>Okay, let me come at this whole issue from a different angle.</p>
<p>I assume from your above comments that you agree with this much: Geeks universally (or very commonly) <b>being</b> AS is a clear example of a claim that <i>would</i> need citations. What you may or may not have noticed, however, is that the way the article currently reads (after your deletions) <b>is</b> tantamount to making this claim.</p>
<p>Similarly, even if I assume for the sake of argument that you are correct that about not being able to make claims one way or the other about self-diagnosis (even though I think that's BS), the article as it stands strongly implies that self-diagnosis is <b>not</b> problematic, and even by your arguments (let alone mine) this is just as POV and unsourced as the reverse claim.</p>
<p>For these reasons, I will ascede to removing these specific claims from the article <i>if, and only if,</i> a more neutral way to end the geek paragraph can be found, one that does not carry these implications.

<p>I saw that Ryan reverted a link to the AQ test. I suppose (reading the other discussion about Geeks), he think self-diagnosis is a horrible thing. However, this too is a NPOV-issue. Many people are interested in self-tests for AS. For instance, more than 1000 people take the Aspie-quiz each month. Therefore, I think there should be a section about this, or a separate article on the subject. Suggestions are welcome. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 04:25, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is a link to the Geek Syndrome article and even a mention that the AQ test may be found with the article. So it's not completely inaccessible. I don't really think that it's Wikipedia's place to provide self-diagnosis links, though -- do we do this for other syndromes and conditions? It seems maybe less than encyclopedic. OTOH if the test is mentioned in the article a link to it is not a bad thing. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManekiNeko_cc64.html" title="User:ManekiNeko">ManekiNeko</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EManekiNeko_2e50.html" title="User talk:ManekiNeko">Talk</a> 04:32, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Whether Baron-Cohen would be horrified or not is quite beside the point. His AQ-test also isn't very well designed as it only is asking about negative aspects of AS. I also doubt he has done a proper evaluation of it. There are many other tests that seems more reliable like the Aspie-quiz and Geek-test. As for other "syndromes" and conditions not having links to self-tests, for instance look at <a href="../../../i/n/t/INTP_d8c7.html" title="INTP">INTP</a>. The people believing in self-identification also frequently are the ones that believe AS is mostly a personality type, and as such is possible to self-identificate, just like temperament types. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 04:31, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Baron-Cohen has done serious studies including the AQ test. But the results weren't "If you score highly on the test, you have AS" -- more like "If you score highly on the test, you might want to get evaluated for AS, because Aspies score highly on the test as well." There is a difference. Thinking of the test as the super-duper Aspie test is simplifying it way too much. As far as the Aspie-quiz and Geek test, have studies been done on the reliability of those tests? Re: <a href="../../../i/n/t/INTP_d8c7.html" title="INTP">INTP</a>, I don't think of that as a syndrome or condition, really. Though admittedly there is a fine line there...

<dd>I'd love to see that too, but as I noted in the Prevalence section, there isn't much systematic research on Asperger adults (dammit). There is a study that shows that of those with AS who go to university, most are in math and the hard sciences (to nobody's great surprise - what I would like to know is how many of the ones in arts are in philosophy, but the study didn't say). There were also some comments in one of the books I consulted to the effect that more Aspies than you'd think settle into undemanding, repetitive jobs, such as most factory work, because apparently they mind the repetiveness a lot less than most non-autistics. Which on a personal note, is <b>so</b> far from accurately describing me that it's one of the reasons I'm <i>not</i> that sure that I'm an aspie myself. <a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurplePlatypus_df26.html" title="User:PurplePlatypus">PurplePlatypus</a> 05:00, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed. Such a proposal would need some very good arguments indeed even if this hadn't been a featured article. I see this as vandalism. Besides, I'd say that a one-sided merge proposal is rather strange (s/he didn't place a merge proposal on the Autism article). The other edits by the same anonymous user were also problematic so I've reverted the article to the previous version. However, since I'm a relative newbie editor, any advice would be appreciated (e.g. do I need to do anything else or is the reversion enough?).

<dd>Thanks! One of the reasons I'm asking is that I'm still a relative newbie here on WP and thought I'd check if I'd got a handle on the part of the NPOV rule I've interpreted as follows: WP does not report the truth as the editor knows it but as reported in the various media/etc. Even if it's wrong (unless other citable sources or common sense dictate otherwise). But that's just one interpretation of one rule, and I have already seen there's more than meets the eye on WP so any additional pointers from more experienced editors (present company included) would be much appreciated. <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">&#160;AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 11:43, 1 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You have indeed hit on a point that is difficult, subjective and sometimes a source of disagreement. I don't have a 100% satisfactory response to your point about "as reported in various media/etc"; Wikipedia runs on consensus, so if enough people disagree with RN and myself (and their reasons for doing so aren't total crap), then IMDB magically becomes a valid source. Personally I view them much the same way whoever wrote some of Wikipedia's FAQs suggests viewing Wikipedia itself; a good starting point for your research but not something to be relied upon as your sole source. I guess it comes down to how reliable one views a particular source as being. One example that is used often; we would not use the website of an extremist political group as a source, <i>except</i> for the purpose of reporting the views of that group specifically. But it must be admitted that this one may not be so clear-cut. <a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurplePlatypus_df26.html" title="User:PurplePlatypus">PurplePlatypus</a> 07:26, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for your insights, which I find very helpful. FWIW, from my own Internet searches I get the impression that this started out as a speculation around March 2002. I now agree that it would be better to leave this info out (or if it is mentioned in a WP article, to cite IMDB as its source). One would certainly expect that any reliable confirmation originally not available on the Internet (from e.g. a magazine interview) would have been picked up and posted all over the place by now, so we only have the one source, the IMDB. As pointed out elsewhere, Spielberg himself is probably aware of the info but has done nothing to dispel it so perhaps he agrees that he has AS traits. He probably doesn't find the AS label in any way offensive.

<p>Does anybody agree with my viewpoint that the paragraph talking about "females with Asperger syndrome do not necessarily come across as particularly masculine personalities" should be removed entirely? This interpretation of the extreme male brain theory seems to me to be obviously not how it was intended to be interpreted. The theory is all about the thought differences between an "average" man and an "average" woman and what would happen if these differences were taken to an extreme. It's much more to do with empathising and systemising than it is to do with actual personalities and interests. In fact the actual <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism.html" title="Autism">autism</a> article calls it the "empathising-systemising" theory to avoid misunderstandings and I believe that a description of the theory more similar to that in the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism.html" title="Autism">autism</a> article would help avoid confusion.</p>
<p>To balance this out slightly the paragraph below it (the "Proponents of the extreme male brain theory often refer to systemizing vs empathizing..." paragraph) could be padded out a bit with some more detailed explanation.<a href="../../../r/a/o/User%7ERaoulharris_b0d8.html" title="User:Raoulharris">Raoulharris</a> 18:19, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with your take on the theory. However, this paragraph describes a (minority) response to the theory. I see you're new to Wikipedia so I'll try to explain a bit further. If such a minority is large or notable enough (see e.g. <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>), Wikipedia needs to document its existence and probably the counter-responses it may elicit (see <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>). Before removing the paragraph and repairing the rest, you may want to check the discussion page and its archives to see whether or not the existence of the minority has been verified. If not, you may even play the devil's advocate and try to find reputable external sources that report the variant view. Bottom line - you can remove the paragraph unless reputable sources reporting the minority view are presented. (Also, ideally, things should be balanced out by the description of the theory itself...)<a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">&#160;AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 21:01, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd gladly present my evidences. First, the section "Possible causes and origns" is terribly biased. It presents underconnectivity theory, extreme male brain theory, pre-operational autism theory, mirror neuron deficiency theory and the social construct theory. None of these theories have any evidences in favor of them, at least not that are consistent with the whole autism spectrum. Many of them are considered as "outdated". The most obvious theory, that of neurodiversity is not presented, but is assumed to be part of the "social construct theory", which I find highly ambigious.</dd>

<dd>Correct, but it looks like social construct theory is right so far. That is, there is no single gene or set of genes which could be said to predict a diagnosis or lack thereof. Of all the autism genes identified so far, it's possible for someone to have them, and not be diagnosable as autistic; and it's possible for someone not to have them, and be diagnosable. We can only speak of probabilities, and make generalizations. Almost anything said about autistics could be characterized as a "stereotype". It's possible for people to be "not quite autistic" as well as "only a little" autistic; and if you were to compare the brains of the two, you would not find significant differences. A behavioral spectrum exists; but the spectrum split is crearly arbitrary and ever-changing. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 19:34, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, the neanderthal theory, which has been removed, clearly anticipates that no single or small amount of genes will ever be linked to autism. Introgressive hybridisation will result on a huge amount of genes, and the genes could potentially be different in different populations as well if they were introgressed separately. It is only the presented theories and simple explanations that so far is loosing credibility. The neanderthal theory clearly also predicts the neurodiversity philosophy. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 19:43, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand the Neanderthal theory was removed because it was deemed 'original research'. I would've argued that it is only original research if you specifically wrote it for the purpose of including it in Wikipedia, which I assume is not the case. (Though the fact that the author of the theory is the one trying to include it is probably what tipped the balance against it). Then the argument for exclusion might have been that the citation is not formal enough or not unbiased enough. In either case I think it's possible to give precedent examples of notable citations in Wikipedia that follow the pattern of citing websites when that's the only source of notable information. Biased sources can simply be noted as biased.<a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 20:03, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As to its merits, I think there are some problems with that theory, but it's scientific. That is, it's falsifiable empirically (through genetic tests, though I'm not sure that's practical). A good argument against its scientific standing, however, is that there's no published body of work behind it. I have read some references to Neanderthal behavior as 'autistic'. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 20:03, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Looking over the entire category, AS does not seem to fit in with the rest anyway. As an alternative you may want to find out if renaming the category to "eponymous diseases and syndromes" would be feasible. On the other hand, "childhood psychiatric disorders" has to stay since it fits per definition (DSM) and quite a few of the other childhood psych disorders are linked with the autistic spectrum. <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 21:04, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've categorized the causes into different models. I think this is more proper, at least to get the neurodiversity thinking into this section. I'm not sure where to place the "extreme maleness theory". While I have strong dislike for it, I still realize it might be more of a neurodiversity model than a pathology / disease model. Possibly the social construct theory should be changed to social construct model instead, and described as such. I don't really think social construct is a theory as it proposes no actual theory as to how the various traits of AS could be caused by cultural forces. I suppose the "refrigerator mother theory" could be a social construct model theory. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 07:43, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>All that means is that theories in the autism field are very tentative and not backed up very well at this point. Also, it's possible for many different theories to explain different aspects of something. For example, extreme male brain and social construct explain different things and are not incompatible. (In evolution, consider the theory of natural selection vs. the theory of genetic drift). Also, autism is likely a blanket term in addition to a social construct, so it's not surprising that it's full of different models. Some models really may explain what it is in a small portion of the cases. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 18:02, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your wording seems distrbingly careless and implies a prevelance of pedophlia in Aspies. This is NOT to my knowledge of the last 16 years true. However I and many people who are Aspie do find it easier to comunicate with children. Personaly I feel that children have a realistic excuse for not understanding concepts that I believe my peers should.

<p>I wasn't asking for the prevalance; I was asking if Aspies are <i>more likely</i> to never (or more slowly) grow out of that kind of attraction. Symmetric, I will be more than happy to elaborate further if we can find a private place for it.

<dd>It wouldn't surprise me if that were the case. I've heard many describe slower maturation in Aspies, perhaps not being fully mature until their mid-30s. It would be a logical consequence of this slower maturation if males also were attracted to much younger girls. Besides, it is a general feature of all males to favor young girls.

<dd>I have never come across any evidence whatsoever of any correlation between pedophilia and autism. Shultz is either making it up or confusing it with something else. If anything Aspies are quite asexual. Only one in 11 autistics ever marry. Most reach adulthood as virgins.

<dd>I don't know where you get your statistics from (1 in 11 autistics marrying). This seems to be much too low figures.

<p>Shultz, the Talk page of a Wikipedia article article is, in principle, not the place to ask questions unrelated to the building of an encyclopedia (see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, e.g. <i>Wikipedia is free and open, but restricts both freedom and openness where they interfere with the purpose of creating an encyclopedia</i>). While there are exceptions, especially when editors are getting to know one another better, this is certainly not the rule and in this case clearly not acceptable to some editors currently working on or following the article. So I respectfully suggest you try and find answers elsewhere. I hope you will succeed and trust you will use any information you come by responsibly. Just in case you yourself are an adult who is sexually attracted to minors but are fighting this desire, please look for psychological help if you don't have help already. If you have given in to such a desire, stop and get yourself that help NOW. <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 14:37, 1 February 2006</p>
<p>Frankly, I can't cite, but I've noticed no trends toward being attracted to younger people in Aspies I know, or myself (and I am Aspie). I'm a bit offended by the implication, in fact.

<p>A. You cannot pass on your DNA without there being a chance of the child having Aspergers B. Considering the manner in which you think to be disturbed is more than a little troubling C.

<dd>That's impossible to know. A child could have more autism genes than you and appear "less" autistic. A child could have no autism genes and appear "more" autistic. What factors affect this are unknown and I don't believe they are necessarily pathological.

<dd>Clearly you suffer from shame and a low self-image, perhaps brought on by experiences of social adversity, and you assume autism equals shame and low self-image, so therefore autism is bad. People can have these problems for a variety of reasons, and they are treatable. I'm willing to bet most people are different from the majority in some respect. It makes no sense to feel sorry for yourself for being different. You assume that people don't respect you because you're Aspie, but it's very possible that has little or nothing to do with it, and it may not be even real. It's a common Aspie trait to be a bit paranoid about what others might think, to have low self-worth, to believe that you're a fake and so on. This baggage can be discarded. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 15:17, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Neuro, don't Aspies online more frequently troll, albeit often inadvertently? I may not know that a comment I'm typing may be a trollsome comment. There are mental mechanisms that "warn" people if what they're typing will be viewed as trollsome, however mine only detects so much. It can't warn me as much as these mechanisms can warn normal people.</dd>

<dd>For a good long while, I thought that if "the newness wears off" in a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship, and we've known each other for so long, and have become rather warm and comfortable with each other, that at that point, I could tell her about my disorder. After such a long and good relationship, wouldn't she not mind nearly as much as she would have if I had told her from the get-go??</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I can speak from personal experience. The reaction can vary from 'why didn't you tell me earlier?' to 'you lied to me' to 'that explains a lot'. There are books on the subject aimed mainly at females in relationships with Aspies. Some will find this to be a good excuse to end a relationship that's not going well for entirely unrelated reasons. I think it would be good if these books dealt with the fact that AS has not been proven to be a disorder, and is simply defined that way arbitrarily by psychiatry. In any case, Aspie marriages seem to have a lower success rate, in average, than neurotypical ones. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 15:17, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually RDos, hopefully the future will be kinder to my child's childhoods (and adolescences) than my past was to my childhood and adolescence.

<p>As an aside, I have aspergers and have been quite successful in relationships. I have found online dating to help me start them though - match has been good. I actually think it is much easier to date a girl who is not an aspy - I am not self hating, but I recognize relationships are not my strength. It's nice to have someone in the relationship who is good at them.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposal to remove the "extreme male brain theory" subsection</span></h2>
<p>I would like to hear the opinion of other editors on the following: This <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asperger_syndrome.html#The_.22extreme_male_brain.22_theory" title="Asperger syndrome">subsection</a> describes the theory and states that it is controversial. However, this is just one of the various Autism/Asperger theories already mentioned in the <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asperger_syndrome.html#Possible_causes_and_origins" title="Asperger syndrome">Possible causes</a> section, which already characterizes it as part of an "area of debate and controversy". In addition, these theories are already described elsewhere, e.g. in the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism.html#Models" title="Autism">Models</a> section of the Autism article (as also argued <a href="../../../a/s/p/Talk%7EAsperger_syndrome_c0a4.html#New_edit_moved_from_article_to_talk_for_discussion" title="Talk:Asperger syndrome">above</a> by <a href="../../../r/a/o/User%7ERaoulharris_b0d8.html" title="User:Raoulharris">Raoul Harris</a>). I think this can be removed entirely from the Asperger Syndrome article.

<p>Please don't remove text regarding Simon Baron Cohen's theory. His work is apparently important and respected, or else he wouldn't get funding or be the head of a research institute at Cambridge. It definitely merits mention. BTW, I don't have Asperger's, and I have no stake in any particular theory. I can understand how those of you with Asperger's may not want it mentioned, because you don't want someone else's theory and research defining you as a person, but it still needs attention. According to Dr. Cohen's online empathy quotient (EQ) test, I have a strongly female brain, having scored a 68/80. This corresponds with results from my MMPI (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory), which placed my personality in the female range. As a man, this really doesn't sit well with me, but I was told that men with advanced degrees are more likely to test as female. Does anyone have any information about whether results on the MMPI are used at all in diagnosing Asperger's? Do certain results in the male range correspond with a positive diagnosis? BrianGCrawfordMA 20:04, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The proposal is to remove from the Controversies section, perhaps to move it elsewhere. As to your question, there's a rough correspondance between those tests and a diagnosis. But there's really no test that can replace a subjective psychiatric diagnosis at the moment. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 21:53, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes, I know exactly what the proposal is and I still disagree with it. Maybe I wasn't clear before. Possible etiology of a medical condition should be included in the main article describing the condition, just as it is in a diagnostic handbook like Merck's Manual. As things stand, a reader has to follow links to explore the possible causes of autism. As a reader, I'd rather have a short description of each theory in the article itself. If I'd wanted more in-depth information, I would have looked in a textbook, not an encyclopedia. BrianGCrawfordMA 22:15, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>AS is NOT a medical condition. Because it is not a medical condition, it is not necesary to include etiology nor causes. If causes should be mentioned, non-medical causes must also be mrntioned.

<dd>Now that you mention it, the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism.html" title="Autism">autism</a> article's Etiology section is missing a 'natural variation' explanation.

<dd>Rdos calm down nobody is saying AS is a medical condition. But because there are theories about the reason for the existance of AS they all deserve to be mentioned.

<p>in regard to the list of arguments supporting the theory of einstein having asperger's as quoted in the article, i thought it necessary to delete "was a late talker", as asperger's is associated with early talking, and indeed being a late talker is oftentimes cited as evidence against speculation of particular famous people having had asperger's, including einstein</p>

<dd>According to DSM-IV "there is no clinically significant general delay in language (e.g., single words used by age 2 years, communicative phrases used by age 3 years)". This seems to suggest that language is normally developed not before the usual time and not much (though possibly a bit) afterwards. Of course there are exceptions, and the DSM-IV could just be completely wrong on this matter.

<dd>The DSM is basically a concensus reached by a show of hands, and it's still a pretty subjective guide. Researchers sometimes apply different criteria and some have said that there's really no difference between high-functioning autism and Asperger's. Psychiatrists might apply their own biases and there can be diagreements as to the right diagnosis. I understand there's one study that compares long-term outcome finding no significant differences. In the autistic community there's no concensus as to whether a difference exists at all. Some have made fun of it.

<dd>You must be referring to pretending to be NT? (Something the article doesn't have any info on). The limit is energy reserves. You'll be exhausted after a while, more so in certain settings, for example after a social gathering. This doesn't mean there's something wrong with you.

I find that "different" people tend to get on better with other unusual people (i.e. intelligent, new to the school, dyslexic, etc. - in fact you'd probably find that everyone I've ever been friends with falls into at least one of those three categories). Your experiences could be different from mine though since I haven't been diagnosed as autistic (though you may want to emphasise "diagnosed" - on the DSM-IV I fit the AS section quite neatly, but I'm not going to do a self-diagnosis or go for a real diagnosis), so I can't really say that I have a completely accurate understanding of your position, but I definitely fall into a socially awkward category so my observations should have some relevance. Symmetric Chaos' description of normal people wouldn't apply to all of them, just the sort you probably wouldn't want to get along with. <a href="../../../r/a/o/User%7ERaoulharris_b0d8.html" title="User:Raoulharris">Raoul Harris</a> 22:18, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Your description seems pretty accurate for the majority, but those are, as I said, "the sort you probably wouldn't want to get along with".

<dd>To be honest, I used to go to special school for aspie children, and I left because so many of them were so godamned weird. So common with hyperactive, violent, shouting, running, etc. That's why I ultimately actually started in a normal high school later. Because I could actually work more "in peace" there. So I wouldn't critize the NTs because my kind can be just as weird, or even ALOT more weird. <a href="../../../x/s/p/User%7EXSpaceyx_4a74.html" title="User:XSpaceyx">XSpaceyx</a> 08:54, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"being an NT that does not fall into Raoul's "idiot" category will probably alieneate you both from Aspies and most NTs to some extent" that's very true, but I'd rather not be friends with people I put into that category, otherwise I wouldn't put them into that category. It limits me to being friends with other people who view those people as idiots, but that means I just have friends who are similar to me, which I don't see as a negative thing. I may have to change when I go into work (though I hope not) but my approach works fine at a school level. I understand that other people may have different views though. <a href="../../../r/a/o/User%7ERaoulharris_b0d8.html" title="User:Raoulharris">Raoul Harris</a> 14:27, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's really something you need to take up with the doctor who diagnosed you, if you have been diagnosed. If you don't think you've been diagnosed correctly, get a second opinion or suggest a diagnosis that you think better fits your symptoms. In the U.S., a patient has the right to contest a diagnosis and have any objections put on record if he or she feels it is incorrect. I don't know about Sweden. Don't fall victim to the kind of backwards reasoning some schizophrenics exhibit, i.e., "Only sick people take pills. I'm going to quit taking pills so I won't be sick anymore." Likewise, it sounds like you're saying, "Only sick people have been diagnosed. I refuse to believe in the idea of diagnosis, therefore I am not sick." (By the way, if you think I'm suggesting that you're schizophrenic, I'm not.) <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G. Crawford">Brian G.

I have a friend with Asperger syndrome, and he has said his parents hate how "unsocial" he is, so every once in a while, just to prove to himself he CAN if he has to, he'll act "socially normal." He told me that it does not come to him naturally, and that he has to think about it every word he speaks, every move he makes, but that it is possible and he can pull it off.</li>

<p>In light of Michelle Dawson's research, which has become noticed recently, this paragraph no longer seems to make sense. Using the Raven IQ test, this research shows that lack of speech is not synonymous with low cognitive functioning - as is intuitively assumed by most people. In fact, it appears that the less speech a person has, the higher the score in the Raven test. (That's right, if you measure cognition with a Raven test, Aspies are not as smart as full autistics).

<dd>-- Seems to imply that it's not correct to say that autistic persons score high or low on "intelligence tests" in general, but that "autistic children did poorly on the verbal comprehension part of the Wechsler [IQ test] but exceedingly well on a part that tests non-verbal intelligence and reasoning." Also "Healthy [<i>sic!</i>] children and adults performed similarly on both the Wechsler and the Raven test. But speaking autistics scored up to 30 percentile points higher on the Raven test than the Wechsler test"</dd>

<p>I would even question the statement on its own. The difference in the diagnostic criteria between Asperger's syndrome and Autistic Disorder is speech delay, nothing more. This has been taken to mean (by researchers as well as laypersons) that Aspies are "smart autistics". And there might have been a reason for this conclussion by looking at IQ correlations with speech, based on IQ testing using the Wechsler test. But the Wechsler test is language-based, so it's not surprising for non-verbal autistics to do badly on it. (How researchers missed this for 50 years is amazing). The conclussion that Aspies have normal to high cognitive functioning -- implying that full autistics do not -- is flawed. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 23:48, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm being tested for Asperger's... I have to say, about half apply, but I most certainly don't agree with some of these symptoms.</p>
<p>1) I know why I get made fun of, and when. 2) I understand people, but do not know how to effectively communicate. 3) I do understand what I read, and don't just memorize things. I'm teaching myself high school/college level physics, and I do understand. I know because it does make sense to me. 4) I do obsess, but most commonly over more than 1-2 things.</p>
<p>I also think that Aspies can be geeks/nerds... not that they have something in common. I believe that a disorder cannot be responsible for your interests. Honestly, that's ridiculous (in my opinion).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">asperger's or introversion?</span></h2>
<p>ive done some research on asperger's and ive discovered that there is a strong overlap between the traits of simple introversion and asperger's syndrome, and that many people who are just introverted could be misdiagnosed as asperger's, or asperger's itself is just introversion.</p>
<p>There are many, "casual" traits of asperger's that relate most strongly to introversion some of which ill list now:</p>
<p>.deliberate avoidance of peak performance for fear its not good enough</p>
<p>.(more coming.......)</p>
<p><br />
Ill get on to those later, but i'd like to point out that "casual" traits get to the true meaning of the matter, coz, among other things, they are less grounded in biased perception. I've got alot to say in this section.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>COMMUNICATION DIFFICULTIES: I'd like to note the differences in communication between introverted and extroverted children, based on very limited vocaularies(being young).</p>
<p>The introvert: hasn't got sufficient vocabuary to communicate needs to a sufficient point of exactitude,when coaxed puts energy into trying to find the words well enough; avoids letting loose ideas out into the open.(As you might guess from this,introversion correlates highly with <b>perfectionism</b>, another highly mentioned trait of asperger's.</p>
<p>The extrovert: (more coming)</p>
<p>PLEASE PUT ANY COMMENTS IN OTHER SECTION!</p>
<ul>
<li>People with Aperger syndrome don't MEAN to be introverted, in fact, many are frustrated that they have social difficulty and want to be as socially comfortable as everyone else is. Introverts CHOOSE to be introverts, people with Asperger syndrome just have social difficulty.</li>
</ul>
<p>WTF? you...er....don't know what introversion means, do you? Discuss! (keeping in mind whats said above)</p>

<dd>What about Wing's claim: "There is no question that Asperger syndrome can be regarded as a form of schizoid personality"&#160;?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">intp</span></h2>
<p>Personally, Im at a loss as to why people put asperger's above, say, intj, because "its just a personality test", you know, like, "which beetle are you?", and because of the mystique , formality and percieved "hard logic" of psychiatric diagnoses. People adopt an attitude of "yeah, this intp thing seems to fit you, but at THE END OF THE DAY, you <i>have</i> been <i>diagnosed</i>"(By an all-knowing) . In reality, the dsm is <i>very</i> subjective and unprofessional and typology <b>completely</b> outstrips it in scientific value.Where psychiatric diagnosis is just listing a bunch of arbitrary and ambiguous negative traits of some people with little to no insight into the cause of these behaviours, typology provides a full functional analysis among other things grounded in many many years of research.I cannot emphasize this enough.Sure, it draws many natural critcisms, but have you ever tried to argue with a parrot? I would call a kid intj before asperger's anyday, and if he didnt want me to cal him that, call him a perfecty natural human temperament, then I wouldnt, and so I certainly would not call him a psychiatric abnormality based on a few undesirable behaviours, and, with his little knowledge of anything outside of this, have him beleive that.(though, being an intj, this <i>might</i> not be so much of a problem:)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think you are oversimplifying things. Yes, INTP and AS is more or less the same thing, but based on slightly different traits. The problem is that the traits of INTP/AS are not acceptable in today's society. It will not be better if you just view AS/INTP as a personality-type, because then psychodynamically schooled people will inevitably demand that these kids receive intensive teraphy for their "quirks", because it might help in their world. Even worse, some totally scruplus social authorities will take the kids actions as a sign that they should be placed in foster-care. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 08:41, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>While many people with AS may test as INTP, I disagree that you can call the groups 'more or less the same' unless most INTPs have AS. Compare the percentage of population which tests INTP with the percentage on the autistic spectrum. If I remember correctly, the latter is much smaller.</dd>

<dd>I had a long reply written with a couple of words to go when my browser refreshed and my work was lost and I'm not going to write it all again so I will summarise it into a few key points. 1) None of the top five results on yahoo search with suggested terms say that Lisa has asperger's. 2) Nor does Lisa Simpson page. 3) I couldn't find "what asperger's has done for us" with a google search. 4) Suggestions that Lisa has asperger's are very rare, but due to references to these suggestions and pages listing people with asperger's traits have led people to believe that this suggestion is common. 5) Lisa has no problems with socialising and therefore does not have asperger's (unpopularity is due to intelligence), though she may be at the autistic end of normal. I'm sorry I haven't backed up my points properly, but it was way too much to bother to re-type. <a href="../../../r/a/o/User%7ERaoulharris_b0d8.html" title="User:Raoulharris">Raoul Harris</a> 17:06, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Third result is <a href="http://www.geocities.com/richardg_uk/famousac.html" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/richardg_uk/famousac.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which says "Famous people with autistic traits" not "famous people with autism". The fourth result (<a href="http://www.newsflash.org/2004/02/si/si001864.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.newsflash.org/2004/02/si/si001864.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a>) is the closest to saying it, saying "The Simpsons’ Lisa Simpson, Bobby Fischer, Alfred Hitchcock and Isaac Newton. The internet suggests an even longer list of impressive names possibly sharing the same condition.", note that this says the "internet suggests", so it is not a link saying she has it, instead another example of my fourth point. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanon_(fiction)" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanon_(fiction)" rel="nofollow">fifth result</a> does not mention asperger's at all, though a previous version of the page did. What asperger's has done for us is the same as the first two results in the other yahoo search. I see your point with the fourth and fifth results, but neither of them, in their current state, suggest that Lisa has asperger's, although they come pretty close. I agree that it must say she has it somewhere, but I don't know of any page which says she has it, and I've looked at many pages, so I think people just believe the suggestion is common when it actually isn't. <a href="../../../r/a/o/User%7ERaoulharris_b0d8.html" title="User:Raoulharris">Raoul Harris</a> 17:11, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I must say when I first saw the picture of the simpson family, I was thinking along the lines of homer, if current definitions didn't require a prerequisite of at-least normal intteligence.Homer's just an idiot all over.I also thought of marge possibly, but I was shocked when it said <i>lisa</i>.She probly has above-average social skills.Imean come on,<b>lisa?</b>It's just ridiculous.the suggestion of her having asperger's seems to be popular fanon, which i think youll find on the wikipedia "fanon" page.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Social Impairments: "NTs"</span></h2>
<p>The acronym "NT" is used in this section with no indication of its meaning. This should either be spelled out in full or, if it refers to the use of "Non-autistic" above, should be indicated there -- particularly since "NT" does not logically flow from "non-autistic". Also, it looks odd that "aspie" is uncapitalized while "Non-autistic" is capitalized in that comparison; shouldn't they match capitalization? — <a href="../../../l/o/m/User%7ELomn_e5f3.html" title="User:Lomn">Lomn</a> <small><a href="../../../l/o/m/User_talk%7ELomn_137a.html" title="User talk:Lomn">Talk</a></small> 15:30, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, upon re-reading, it is explained above, though the juxtaposition of "non-autistic" and "NT" still seems obtuse to me. Is there a preference for using one or the other for the sake of consistency? — <a href="../../../l/o/m/User%7ELomn_e5f3.html" title="User:Lomn">Lomn</a> <small><a href="../../../l/o/m/User_talk%7ELomn_137a.html" title="User talk:Lomn">Talk</a></small> 17:02, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"NT" implies more than simply non-autistic. It stands for neuro-typical and refers to someone who is not neuro-divergent, someone who is, for lack of a better word, normal. Someone who exhibits no disorders, autistic or otherwise. So a preference for consistency sake is kind of impossible since they are in fact talking about different things, and while interchangeable in some sense, they aren't synonymous.(<a href="../../../f/o/s/User%7EFossaFerox_a862.html" title="User:FossaFerox">FossaFerox</a> 03:47, 17 March 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<dd>That would make sense if three paragraphs up it didn't say that NT's were just non-autistics&#160;:). Anyway, I cleaned it up and removed the NT stuff because it is inspeak which should be avoided. We really need a reference for that theory though, because as is it definately looks like OR to me. <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Just another star in the night</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 22:35, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Star Trek... again</span></h2>
<p>I would like to add my thoughts on the Star Trek debate. But I think that it may be time to start a new thread -- the "dubious science fiction mention" thread has gotten a little unmanageable (imho). Unless I've missed something, the citation supporting the ST quote does not seem to be in question. Nonetheless, presenting the ST quote as a statement of fact would probably qualify as an <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_authority.html" title="Appeal to authority">appeal to authority</a>.</p>
<p>Therefore, I'd like to propose a compromise that might enhance the article in other ways too -- the creation of a "trivia" and/or "conjecture" section within the article.</p>
<p>By placing the ST quote in a trivia section, that takes a lot of the statement's "weight" out of the mix. We could add the MBTI statement, and other "dubious conclusions" in that section as well. This should satisfy all as the information is in the article, but not given the weight of more important (and perhaps more supportable) "facts". <a href="../../../y/c/a/User%7EYcaps123_2c17.html" title="User:Ycaps123">Ycaps123</a> 21:02, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can see the wisdom in what all of you are saying. All that I am advocating for is to make it easier for the casual reader on wikipedia to put all of the information about AS together in their own minds. IMHO, this requires prominently placed and well summarized MAIN ARTICLE notices. The readers of the AS article deserve to know that <a href="../../../c/a/u/Causes_of_autism.html" title="Causes of autism">Causes of autism</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversies_in_autism.html" title="Controversies in autism">Controversies in autism</a> are both critical to understanding the "big picture" of AS.

<dd>I was not entirely convinced that AS described me until I read the parts in an older version of the AS article about MBTI (I have tested INTP) and Star Trek (I am an avid trekkie as evidenced by my DVD collection). For me, having access to the aforementioned information (and some old documents/videos from my primary school days that I discovered after reading the article) was crucial to my realizing that I most likely have AS. I firmly believe that information is power. All that I would like is for others to have access to the same types of information on AS that I have been lucky enough to read in the past on wikipedia. <a href="../../../y/c/a/User%7EYcaps123_2c17.html" title="User:Ycaps123">Ycaps123</a> 04:31, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd like to call your attention to the fact that I said, "I most likely have AS". I truly believe diagnosing oneself to be a very foolish exercise. You can accuse me of <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apophenia.html" title="Apophenia">apophenia</a> if you wish. Admittedly, there is absolutely no way in which I can be objective about my meeting the DSM-IV criteria or not -- although my "stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms" are clearly visible in videotapes of me from my childhood. I also cared more for the company of adults than children when I was younger. But as I eluded to previously, the Star Trek quote was really the "straw that broke the camel's back". I am also INTP. I am a college student who still plays with toy airplanes and/or builds them out of Legos, I teach computer skills part-time, etc. "...common [often lifelong] interests are means of transport (such as trains), computers..."

<dd>If you have other evidence for your self-diagnosis, I certainly don't presume to dispute that, and encourage you to seek the appropriate professional for a confirmation so that you can get whatever therapy and/or medication are necessary should the confirmation be positive. I just don't think (Dr. Attwood apparently to the contrary) that you should necessarily regard an interest in <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a></i> as a determining factor, and that using that as a diagnostic criteria applied to others can be incredibly damaging. Lots of people like <i>Trek</i> and have been involved with active <i>Trek</i> <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fandom.html" title="Fandom">fandom</a> without having AS -- my wife, for instance, just to cite one specific example.</dd>

<dd>Davidkevin... We may have to agree to disagree because contrary to your implication, I do not think that Attwood meant to infer that AS is the <a href="../../../c/a/u/Cause.html" title="Cause">cause</a> of Star Trek fandom. I think that he was simply commenting on a possible <a href="../../../c/o/r/Correlation.html" title="Correlation">correlation</a> between AS and the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trekkie.html" title="Trekkie">trekkie</a> phenomenon. That is an entirely different connotation because, of course, it would be a fallacy to argue that <a href="../../../c/o/r/Correlation_implies_causation.html" title="Correlation implies causation">Correlation implies causation</a>.

Again, I don't recall where that stat comes from, but I assume it applies to the entire spectrum.

In any case, the spectrum is so large that the statistic is probably meaningless.

<dd>There are references, and they are reliable. That aside, I reworded it to indicate a weaker connection between the disorders. The resemblance between them is widely acknowledged and in fact is one of the biggest obstacles with diagnoses. There is research suggesting that indicates there is far more than a resemblance between the conditions, but it isn't entirely conclusive. I'll try to find some of the studies and let you wiki experts decide if you want to change it back to a less speculative wording. For starters, the connection to bipolar disorder can be found in "Wozniak et al (J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry 1997;36:1552-60)".

<h2><span class="mw-headline">PING Rdos</span></h2>
<p>Self-diagnosis is not reliable. Period. No matter how badly you want it to be. We've had this discussion before. Every expert in the relevant field says it's not reliable, including the ones you tried to point to as saying it was. Wikipedia is for verifiable information found in reliable sources, and you will not find a reliable source that says self-diagnosis is reliable. Saying the experts are all wrong, with <i>nothing</i> to back that up, simply doesn't wash.</p>
<p>So quit edit-warrring over it already. <a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurplePlatypus_df26.html" title="User:PurplePlatypus">PurplePlatypus</a> 11:02, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I won't start an edit war over this minor issue. I really don't care if Bram is mentioned or not, and I did the revert mostly because of the claims that "self-diagnosis" would be unreliable. Now I see another claim that AS is a "medical condition"! Why can't these ignorant wikipedians keep-off this article if the don't know more about AS than that it's part of DSM? I'm sure I've mentioned before that I have hard evidences that self-diagnosed AS is just as reliable as "medically diagnosed". Self-diagnosis might not qualify for support, but it sure isn't any more unreliable than professional evaluation. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 12:00, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I suspect it's more a case of you reading more into the phrase "medical condition" than is intended. In any case, if you have this hard evidence, point me to it. You are correct that you claimed to before, or at least said something similar. To be blunt, I didn't believe you, and I still don't. (I think I also pointed out that even if it exists, it would at best have to be mentioned <i>alongside</i> the consensus of professionals, not supplant it). <a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurplePlatypus_df26.html" title="User:PurplePlatypus">PurplePlatypus</a> 21:25, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the personal attack! Asperger syndrome is a condition identified, researched, and treated by by medical professionals. It is a medical condition, like color-blindness. Bram has no training in how to distinguish "has AS" from "doesn't have AS" so as to agree reliably with people who research it, and even if he did that wouldn't enable him to make a disinterested evaluation of his own personality. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 18:39, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>And how do psychiatrists distinguish "has AS" from "doesn't have AS" in your opinion? Frankly, what Rdos says is probably right. The Asperger autistic is obviously more aware of what he is than a person examining from the outside. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 01:55, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The "disinterested evaluation of his own personality" is an especially important point, <i>especially</i> among people with conditions like AS, because (and I speak here as someone who until recently thought he was one - and still would if I thought self-diagnosis was workable) part of what it <b>is</b> to have such a condition is for one's perceptions of one's own actions to be less than reliable. But this is straying into <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>; it's the consensus of professionals that we have to reflect in our writing here, not our own reasoning. <a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurplePlatypus_df26.html" title="User:PurplePlatypus">PurplePlatypus</a> 21:25, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> insists that AS is a medical condition? Comparing to color-blindness? Since when did color-blindness become a medical condition? Cancer, heart-failure, asthma and so on are medical conditions that can be diagnosed on physical traits. AS is no such thing. It cannot be diagnosed with any reliable physical method, and instead professionals ask <b>patients</b> lots of questions. To me it is quite clear that a knowledgable patient could "self-diagnos" without the help of a professional. To back up my claims I simply refer to the close to 10,000 individuals that have answered Aspie-quiz. There is no meaningful difference between the group that identifies as "self-diagnosed" and the group that identifies as "professionally diagnosed". --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 21:20, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That, Rdos, would be original research and wishful thinking. We know you believe in self-diagnosis, but that is not the point. I approach from the experience of seeing firsthand how psychological diagnosis has become a convenient "grease" for public school bureacracy. Nowadays when a teacher wants to get rid of a disruptive student, the teacher fills out a questionnaire in the appropriate way to get the kid declared ADHD or passive-agressive or what have you. I don't accept their diagnoses and I don't accept diagnoses from the subjects themselves for the same reason. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 05:32, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't support schools giving kids DSM diagnoses to "get rid of them". I'm not sure I support any of these diagnosis myself, but then I see the reality also. They are needed because otherwise far more dangerous things would happen to these kids. So until we have some better attitudes in society towards autism and ADHD, we'll just have to accept "medical diagnosis" of them. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 07:03, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is not so much kids to be given a diagnosis of AS, any more than it would be a problem for kids to be given a diagnosis of left-handedness. The problem is that kids are being told their brains are disordered. Imagine having to go through school with that label on you. Kids who in the past would've been considered gifted and geeky are now given a brain disorder label (<a href="http://ericec.org/fact/asperger.pdf" class="external text" title="http://ericec.org/fact/asperger.pdf" rel="nofollow">example</a>). It's fine to recognize that some people are different, but to suggest that the difference is invalid and disordered is really unjustified IMHO. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 15:32, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm unfamiliar with them as well but recently there have been a lot of developments, such as being nearly able to distinguish and diagnose autism based on brainwaves (? I think brianwaves... something to do with the brain anyway...) as well as treatments based on that. There was quite a bit on it in an episode of Dr. Phil - but I think it is still somewhat experemental, but I'm not sure. Supposively they were going to treat the people on the show with it, as least IIRC. Oh, and autism IS a medical condition. Maybe in the article we can say "the vast majority of professionals consider it a medical condition" if you'd like but it pretty much just IS AFAIK. <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Just another star in the night</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 22:27, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Frankly, I doubt it. Do the brain waves distinguish someone who is a little autistic from someone who is not quite autistic? How is the boundary determined? And how good a predictor is it? Even genetics probably can't predict more than 60% for classic autism and 90% for a broad spectrum. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 01:49, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Asperger's Childrens relations with opposite sex individuals</span></h2>
<p>I am currently in the process of being diognosed with Asperger's Syndrome. I have already been diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsionate Disorder and have deep difficulties concentrating on school work and other simple things. I recently found myself in grave trouble because of an incident I had with a fewllow female classmate. I am curious, is Asperger's Syndrome a cause of poor relations with the opposite sex? If so, what kind of difficulties do Asperger's Children face? And what kind of sensitive topic issues (drugs, alchol, sex) so Asperger's Children find difficult to talk about with other much more socially developed children?</p>
<p>I am also curious if Asperger's Syndrome is the cause of violent behaviour seen with William Fruend or if violent behaviour associated with Asperger children is that cause of others bullying against children with the syndrome. -Capt.Nero</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have no research or statistics to quote here offhand, but I can tell you that by the very nature of the condition of course people with Aspergers will have more difficulty communicating with members of the opposite sex. Aspergers is termed a high-functioning condition. This is because people who have it can, in time, learn to compensate. It's a matter of learning the rules of social interaction on an intellectual level rather than being blessed with an innate understanding of what goes on in social interaction. Growing up I was horribly uncomfortable going into any situation where I didn't know the "rules" that governed it. This would include everything from taking part in new extracuricular activities to talking with girls. Children with Aspergers syndrome go through social integration much later than normal children. Heck, I'm 20 years old, a college student, and still working on it (only had one serious girl friend thus far). As for the bullying though, I'm a bit torn here myself. Children with Aspergers aren't inherently violent, not all of them at the very least. I have seen research that suggests many or even most are as children, but in all the instances I've seen it fails to be conclussive. There's a lot of research and findings concerning Aspergers that are unconfirmed at best (such as people with Aspergers being prone to self-injury as babies/toddlers). It's best not to put too much faith in it. On a personal level, I would say this is especially true for you. Forgive me if I'm reading too much in to this, but it looks like you are looking to use Aspergers as a crutch and a justification for violent behavior. I don't think you can or should be able to do that. Instead you should try to control your anger. The bullying that many people with Aspergers (myself included) is usually the result of us just being "different". Different in the sense that we aren't as social as others expect or are often odd in our early social interaction before we've developed a full understanding of what is expected of us.

<dd>The only language that aspies understand is disipline, you just have to discipline aspies more than usual children. Out of all aspies I've met the "stranger" ones are the ones whose parents accept their children's odd behaviour. 213.89.67.167 17:17, 5 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You are of course "dead wrong" in your claim. Discipline is *not* the way you teach your Asplings to behave. Just look at the correlation between autistic traits and ODD. You don't want them to ignore everything you say by commanding (or worse hitting) them. This is a bad strategy. The good strategy is to convince them they need to learn the social language and motivate them. You cannot do this with discpline. Nobody becomes motivated with discpline. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 13:28, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Many people with lung cancer smoke, so lung cancer causes smoking (that was actually suggested by someone). You need to be careful with cause and effect. You could be right, but the effect you describe could just be due to the parents of "stranger" autistic children giving up on changing their children. <a href="../../../r/a/o/User%7ERaoulharris_b0d8.html" title="User:Raoulharris">Raoul Harris</a> 06:47, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You both provide a very good point, you shouldn't force your children to become something that they aren't. HOWEVER if you want the best for your children and they are aspies they will eventually have a high risk of being bullied, or just have great difficulty to make friends. So if you want the best for your childrens mental well being then you should still try to learn them to supress some things that other people may find odd.

<dd>It is not a correct link. One should not look at how "strange" they are, but how well adapted they are. Also, not everybody understands that many Aspies, and especially the ones which are oppositional to authority (parents and others), need a different type of motivation to learn how to behave. You need to convince them (verbally) that it is in their best interest to behave in a certain way. The whole process relies on mutual acceptance and respect, not one party telling the other how to behave --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 13:35, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Autistic intelligence is different, not superior or inferior to NT intelligence. Check out the work of Dr. Mottron for some research that's starting to look into this. It appears autistics score higher than the norm in the Raven (PRM) IQ test, but lower in the Weschler. The Weschler inadvertently measures a type of linguistic intelligence NTs are good at, and which probably is useful to get by in the world we live in. BTW, this research suggest classic autistics are smarter in the Raven than Asperger autistics, thus contradicting what the introduction of this article seems to imply. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 19:15, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

There is an error in the test norming, so Autistics scoring in the 80 percentile might not be exactly right, but the shape of the graph should still be valid. Compare to a bit over 60 percentile for Asperger autistics. I don't know if these are "classic autistics" but from this I infer that "more autistic" means "smarter in the Raven" (provided the individual is testable). I should caution this research is unreplicated as of yet. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 15:02, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I assume that you have been editing as 68.38.2.225. It is considered extremely impolite to edit an article unless you are logged into your wikipedia account. If you do not have a wikipedia account, you can create one by clicking on the link in the upper right hand corner called "sign in / create account". Once you have a wikipedia account and are logged in, you should always sign your contributions to discussions with four <a href="../../../t/i/l/Tildes.html" title="Tildes">tildes</a> (no spaces). Finally, it is also considered rude to do lots of edits to a page within a short amount of time. That is, you should make all of your changes at one time if possible. There is a button called "show preview" that allows you to view the changes that you have made without actually applying them to the article.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Eye contact and emotions</span></h2>
<p>Some people with Asperger syndrome do truly lack, or have reduced levels of emotions. For example, many people with Asperger syndrome have difficulty with [[eye contact]]. Some make very little eye contact because they find it overwhelming, whereas others have unmodulated, staring eye contact that can cause discomfort to other people.</p>
<p>I don't see the link between emotions and eye contact (other than the influence of the lack, or excess, of eye contact on the emotions of <b>other</b> people). <a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApokrif_eeef.html" title="User:Apokrif">Apokrif</a> 18:47, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I definitely agree that there is no connection between emotions and eye contact. I've managed to find out where the change occured <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asperger_syndrome&amp;diff=45302065&amp;oldid=45265806" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asperger_syndrome&amp;diff=45302065&amp;oldid=45265806" rel="nofollow">diff=45302065&amp;oldid=45265806</a> and I can't understand why it was done. I've read a lot about AS and autism and have never seen the suggestion that autistic people have a lack of emotions. The apparent link between emotions and eye contact, it seems to me, is not intentional. It comes from taking something that made sense and adding in the sentence "Some people with Asperger syndrome do truly lack, or have reduced levels of emotions" to follow the previous sentence saying that autistics often have strong emotions (author's explanation is "I didn't want to remove the edited sentence because I don't know enough, but it's certainly not true in the general sence, many asperger really don't have emotions"). Unfortunately that makes it sound like what you quoted. As far as I'm aware the added sentence is untrue, so should be taken out and it would make sense again, but I don't know for certain that it is incorrect so I'm uncertain about removing it. I think I will remove it anyway, but if it is correct it should at least be reworded. <a href="../../../r/a/o/User%7ERaoulharris_b0d8.html" title="User:Raoulharris">Raoul Harris</a> 19:49, 20 April 2006 (U

<dd>There is a book today called <i>Eat Right for Your Type: Complete Blood Type Encyclopedia</i> and it mentioned that there might be a blood type, dietal cuase of Autism and Asperger's. It suggests that people with A blood have an increase prevalence of Autism and Aspergers, it also states that it might benefit from eating a low lectin, high secretin diet (D'Adamo and Whitney 104-105).

<p>Yes, it is an issue of nature verses nurture. So it is theorically possible to develop symptomes of Aspergers. Asperger's is a special gift and should be developed over time execially in mild cases of Asperger's. It is also posible for stress to be a cause of the symptoms of AS. On the other hand on the nature side it is also possible to be born with AS there just is no evidence backing that "you can only be born with Aspergers not develop it later",</p>
<p>I don't think that it's be feasible to develop Asperger's Syndrome... after all, isn't it caused by portions of the brain not developing, and therefore not functioning correctly? If this is the case, then it wouldn't be possible-- unless you were to have some sort of head trauma that rendered those portions of the mind dysfunctional. <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBit188_b674.html" title="User:Bit188">Bit188</a></p>
<p>I disagree with that statement because. I have AS and recently had a brain scan, MRI and EEG and found that my brain functioned correctly. How is at possible to have a functioning developing brain and still have AS. Therefore, it is possible in people with mild cases of AS to not have a functioning brain.</p>

<dd>The concensus is that autism, unlike schizophrenia, is present since birth. This is not entirely true, however, if you consider what are called "regressions". Even some adults report becoming "more autistic" sometimes, and the reasons for this are unknown. Given that there's no medical test for autism, and no organic characteristics that absolutely must be present in all autistics, it's not impossible to suppose that a completely average individual biologically could display autistic behavior. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 17:05, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is not at all unusual for people on the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_spectrum.html" title="Autistic spectrum">Autistic_spectrum</a> to be entirely unaware of any difference between themselves and NTs until that difference is demonstratively shown to them with emphasis on specifics. Because of this, it is entirely possible for someone with AS to go through decades of their life intellectually compensating for what NTs do innately and never know it. However, the author of <a href="http://www.autistics.org/library/more-autistic.html" class="external text" title="http://www.autistics.org/library/more-autistic.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a> has proposed (although not in the article) that such compensation, or "faking NT-ness" as some might call it, takes a physical toll on the brain, which has a cumulative effect, leading to an early burn-out of the specific brain infrastructure needed to maintain the compensation. This, in turn, makes compensating less and less possible with age. If, like I propose, someone has been compensating all their life without realizing it, the decay in compensating ability may appear to the uninitiated to be "development" of AS later in life. I hope my 2¢ on this talk page can serve to refocus any possible self-investigation of the issue. 66.218.54.163 06:06, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Even if all your arguments on the subject are correct, they're the best we've got.) <a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurplePlatypus_df26.html" title="User:PurplePlatypus">PurplePlatypus</a> 08:34, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Two angles:
<ol>
<li>Policy - wouldn't you agree that the warning needs to go unless it can be sourced?</li>
<li>Arguments in support of removing the warning: PurplePlatypus, your first argument rings true to me. But I think it logically leads to the following: Those who <i>correctly</i> self-diagnose with autism have (1) used their intelligence to sufficiently discern the differences between themselves and most people they encounter; and/or (2) accepted a description of such differences from a trusted person (e.g a parent). On the other hand, those who <i>incorrectly</i> self-diagnose with autism already have (per definition) such skills by nature and are simply missing the point, being stupid, etc. In the end this argument seems self-defeating to me. I agree that that the warning should go (or, conversely, be added to all conditions that might be self-diagnosed).</li>

<dd>I think <a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurplePlatypus_df26.html" title="User:PurplePlatypus">PurplePlatypus</a> logic is flawed. You don't need social skills to determine you "lack" social skills. This is quite easily observed. It is not hard to understand that you have no friends and have been bullied. It's not hard to understand that people misunderstand you either. Besides, the whole issue of self-identification have been demonstrated with Aspie-quiz. The self-diagnosed group is not less autistic than the professionally diagnosed. In some versions the reverse seems to be true. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 13:08, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think Rdos oversimplifies the case. Determining that one lacks social skills is indeed relatively easy, though perhaps not quite so easy as he (?) makes it sound; most people are not especially self-aware and rationalize their failures. But that is <i>not</i> all there is to diagnosing AS; indeed, it is barely even the beginning of the process. A lack of social skills can have many causes, and AS is one of the less likely ones. The differences among the different pervasive developmental disorders in particular are very subtle and can be difficult to detect. I would certainly not trust myself or anyone else I know to draw the relevant distinctions reliably.</dd>
<dd>As far as Aspie-quiz, it would help if you would provide a citation so others such as myself could check what is actually said about it. I would be particularly interested in how it was determined who was more or less autistic; your descriptions to date have made the argument sound circular, but that might not be the case if I could actually see the study in question. Where can this data be found? I apologize if you have already answered this somewhere, but in several months of intermittently discussing the matter with you I have not seen a clear citation. <a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurplePlatypus_df26.html" title="User:PurplePlatypus">PurplePlatypus</a> 21:59, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurplePlatypus_df26.html" title="User:PurplePlatypus">PurplePlatypus</a>, you might see a multitude of autism-related diagnosis, and if one's prospect is to make the correct distinctions between those (IMO arbitrarily) defined conditions, an official diagnosis would of course be more reliable. However, my opinion is that the autism spectrum should be broadened to include other diagnosis like ADHD and Tourette, because these have so many features in common with autism. I'd prefer a single diagnosis, and possibly "light", "moderate" and "severe" additions. ADHD would be "light", as well as some highly functional aspies. Traditional AS would be "moderate" and autistics "severe".

<p>(Cutting down on the indents to keep this readable) I don't think finding a source should be hard, but I am not 100% sure I agree that one is necessary. It is mentioned in passing by both Attwood and Gillberg, but both appear to consider it so obvious and clear-cut that no source is needed. I am inclined to agree.</p>
<p>ADDED LATER (my initial attempt to post the above edit-conflicted with Rdos): Your view is interesting and seems plausible to me (especially as someone who once considered himself to probably have AS, had two psychiatrists dismiss this as a possibility because I'm too high-functioning in various ways, then had the same two people come to the surprising-to-me conclusion that I <b>do</b> have ADHD). But if this is only your view, and not that of someone who has (say) published it in an academic journal, it runs afoul of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.

<p>Sourced or not, other articles does not contain such comments about self-diagnosis, so why should it be here? I'm inclined to think that the reason is that some people don't want to here about self-diagnosed Aspies. In any case, if it should be here and not in other articles, there should be a good reason for this, and I don't think something that Attwood and Gillberg mentioned in passing qualifies as such reason. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 09:11, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

An anonymous editor put in "(Wendt 2004)". I cannot accept this as a source for the "self-diagnosis not recommended" assertion and have re-tagged it. In order to verify this, the entire source (full text available on-line per link provided by the same editor) needs to be read - a direct quote would be better. Anyway, I read most of the thesis (which actually sounds quite authoritative to me, but is not indexed or listed at PubMed) but did not see the assertion. I found this:</p>
<p>"5.3.3 SCREENING INSTRUMENTS The ICD-10 (WHO 1993) and DSM-IV (APA 1994) are the official diagnostic criteria that are used for Asperger syndrome, but a wide range of screening instruments for autism spectrum disorders has been devised in recent decades. The ASSQ (Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire) (Ehlers and Gillberg 1993, Ehlers et al. 1999) is widely used and is considered to be a reliable and valid parent and teacher screening instrument for high-functioning autism spectrum disorders in a clinical setting (Ehlers et al. 1999). It identifies the children with autistic-like conditions who are on the borderline of autism, with an average range of intelligence referred to as HFA and AS (Ehlers et al. 1999). There is a danger and also a temptation to use this tool as a diagnostic tool, which is not the correct way to confirm a diagnosis, as the ASSQ has not been validated."</p>
<p>Is this the citation? If so, I'm afraid it does not support the assertion at all. This is not about self-diagnosis or criteria but about the ASSQ questionnaire for parents/teachers of young children. And even if it would apply, it would only state that a self-diagnosis using the ASSQ is not valid in a medical/research setting, which, I think, is completely understood by most if not all people making such a self-dx. <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 22:16, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Raoul-you have to remember to cite your sources plus the number you gave (less then 75)[...]" Whatever edit you are talking about it wasn't made by me. My edit was to remove the sentence about the phrases "asperge" and "sperge" from the culture section. It was later added back in then removed again (I think by Rdos). <a href="../../../r/a/o/User%7ERaoulharris_b0d8.html" title="User:Raoulharris">Raoul Harris</a> 07:12, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've never heard of a "Social IQ" before, and certainly no one has offered me to take a social IQ test. Where/how can I take one?

<dd>I disagree based on recent data collected by the [National Autistics Society <a href="http://www.nas.org.uk/content/1/c4/28/61/ignored.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.nas.org.uk/content/1/c4/28/61/ignored.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nas.org.uk/content/1/c4/28/61/ignored.pdf</a>] since they come from a credible source they should not be religated to another article which is not likely ro be read by people searching from the internet. Another reaoson is that this study is collected on 217 adults not children which is rare for studies. Please read the study provided by the link before moving the data to another article. Please, do not forget to comment before moving. In addition the data says that 50% live at home, 33% live in residental setting, 8% live in independent with residental persenal or family support, and 3% live independent.

<dd>Thank you for the study link. It is clear that this study is extremely biased and unscientific. The study depends on *parents* views of their children. It doesn't survey already adult autistics. Another problem is that only 38% answered the survey, which is also very problematic. We have no idea why 62% didn't answer. For this reason, the results might not even be representable of the *parent* population views. Another problem is that the AS diagnosis is quite new, and not many children who received their dx with help of parents is anticipated to be old enough so we can assess if they can live independently or not. Another problem is that at another location it is claimed that as many as 50% of adults are undiagnosed. Clearly, most of these do live independently, because otherwise they would need to pursue an dx. I suggest these claims should be removed until a study on a mixed-age *adult* population can be presented. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 11:41, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Besides, it is no wonder that 50% live at home. This is the natural consequence of the survey methodolgy. We don't know how many of these 50% will still live at home in 10 years time. It is possible (even probable) that autistics leave home later than normal, but this is not what is claimed. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 11:54, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Here are some indications: Aspie-quiz II: 237 diagnosed, 365 self-diagnosed (1.54:1) Aspie-quiz III: 608 diagnosed, 1319 self-diagnosed (2.17:1) Aspie-quiz ND: 161 diagnosed, 449 self-diagnosed (2.79:1) Total: 1006 diagnosed, 2133 self-diagnosed (2.12:1)</p>

<dd>A caveat with your data above is that diagnosed individuals might be less likely to take the test. Why take it if you already know what you are? I'd be interested to know what the relative scores of self-diagnosed vs. diagnosed are. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 20:49, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes. there are some problems with whom takes the test. Another problem is that only people that have access to Internet can take the test. The scores of diagnosed and self-diagnosed are virtually identical, with self-diagnosed a bit higher. The ADHD group score very simuilar as well, although usually a little below.</dd>

<p>Aspie-quiz II: Diagnosed 117 AS-score, 73 NT-score; Self-diagnosed 120 AS-score, 69 NT-score. Aspie-quiz III: Diagnosed 122 AS-score, 80 NT-score; Self-diagnosed 125 AS-score, 78 NT-score.

<dd>It is interesting that the self-diagnosed score is a bit higher. But this doesn't necessarily mean that self-diagnosed individuals are more "severe". The prevalence of ASD in ADHD seems to be around 30%, so high scores for ADHD are not surprising. What this test is missing is data on how sensitive it is, i.e. how well it predicts a psychiatric diagnosis, and how many autistics does it miss. With this information, you could provide the quiz to a random sample of adults, and find the prevalence of ASD in the adult population. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 00:57, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is some information on "sensitivity". In the neurodiversity-version, 14% of diagnosed AS is given the "NT-label". 73% get the "very likely Aspie"´. It is possible to get down to around 6% of "misdiagnosis", however, I'm not sure if this really is wanted. Using the PCA-loadings as criteria, increases the misdiagnosis to around 25%, which was how Aspie-quiz III was scored. This seems to show that the official diagnosis is not exactly related to the factors that questions in Aspie-quiz generate. I am tempted to give both an Aspie/NT-score based on PCA-loadings and a judgement if a professional diagnosis is feasible. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 18:32, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">unemployed or underemployed.</span></h2>
<p>In the Prevalence section there is a sentence that is not clear to me, "A high percent (95%) are either unemployed or underemployed." I do not know if 95% is true because a I know people with outism and all of them have jobs or at school. Plus the source of this sentence is not found in (Frey 2006) as indicated in the article. Should it be kept or removed. Natche24 18:51, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
