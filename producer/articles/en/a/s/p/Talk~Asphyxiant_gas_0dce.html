<p>Way outside my expertise, but surely <i>all</i> non-toxic gases except oxygen are asphyxiant under the definition given? Cheers, <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Clark_9084.html" title="User:Sam Clark">Sam Clark</a> 21:43, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've looked again, this material is getting better, but still a stub, and belongs as a section in <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxia.html" title="Asphyxia">Asphyxia</a>. The crucial point is that an <i>Asphyxiant gas</i> is not a gas property or classification. <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxia.html" title="Asphyxia">Asphyxia</a> is the issue, and a gas is cause. <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxiant_gas.html" title="Asphyxiant gas">Asphyxiant gas</a> will redirect to Asphyxia. That should be part of the move. <a href="../../../w/i/d/User%7EWidefox_7e44.html" title="User:Widefox">Widefox</a> 00:21, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>"Typically asphyxiant gases are dangerous in confined spaces[1], is not supported by reference. Reference [1] details a balloon inflated with asphyxiant gas, not a breathable space with a mixture of escaped gas, as in your examples. These are two distinct cases. Both of which are valid, but both require separate references as assertions made in one do not necessarily hold in the other (gas densities, mixing etc). Taking this to the extreme - whereas it's always fatal to breath 100% non oxygen gas (for long enough), in a confined space releasing some asphyxiant gas might not be dangerous at all, because all the original oxygen is still there (confined space remember). <a href="../../../w/i/d/User%7EWidefox_7e44.html" title="User:Widefox">Widefox</a> 03:41, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>excuse me, I read the whole text (2 pages if I remember correctly). I've clearly laid out my comment, and I stick by it <i>there is no mention of</i> <i><b>asphyxiant gas</b></i>. More than that, if I remember correctly, most deaths were due to asphyxia (hence I moved the ref to <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxia.html" title="Asphyxia">asphyxia</a>), and the only gas mentioned killed by poisoning, not asphyxiation, so it was a confusing reference.

<dd>Adding to the little I wrote on your talk page, the original article (written by a vandal BTW), hence how I came across it, was very alarmist. It needed a major refocussing as without Asphyxiant gases we can't breath.

<p>I do not understand the disambiguation to <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxia.html" title="Asphyxia">asphyxia</a>. This is quite different from the typical use of a disambiguation link where there are other possible encyclopedia article with the same name. That is not the case in this instance. Asphyxia is already linked in the opening paragraph and better belongs in a see also link than as a disambiguation link for an ambiguity which does not exist. I move to delete the disambig and add a see also link. I will go ahead in the next few days unless there are objections. <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 00:07, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I object. It needs disambiguating for 1 simple reason. The terms <i>asphyxiant gas</i> and <i>asphyxiant</i> are almost equivalent. Gas articles refer to themselves, and link to <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxiant.html" title="Asphyxiant">asphyxiant</a>! if we allow <i>asphyxiant gas</i> then we also need liquids, solids, etc. It is only OK on asphyxia. wikipedia is not a dictionary. This strong link is needed, delete or no delete! <a href="../../../w/i/d/User%7EWidefox_7e44.html" title="User:Widefox">Widefox</a> 01:33, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think that you are confusing the issue. You are arguing here for deletion, not for the disambiguation link. They are no more equivalent than <a href="../../../p/n/e/Pneumonia.html" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walking_pneumonia.html" title="Walking pneumonia">walking pneumonia</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspiration_pneumonia.html" title="Aspiration pneumonia">aspiration pneumonia</a>, <a href="../../../e/o/s/Eosinophilic_pneumonia.html" title="Eosinophilic pneumonia">eosinophilic pneumonia</a>, ad nauseum. It is not common to link a disambiguation at the top of a page for a compound word which happens to have another word within it. This is not a "subarticle" of a "main article." Any link to asphyxia should be in either see also or simply within the text. If you wouldn't mind, please focus on the disambiguation and leave the debate about the existence of the article to the deletion page (or another section on the talk page). <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 02:11, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>With respect, you asked for objections, I gave you one. Please don't discount it. The term only relates to <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxia.html" title="Asphyxia">asphyxia</a>, hence main article. The overlap/duplication of <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxiant_gas.html" title="Asphyxiant gas">asphyxiant gas</a> examples and those at <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxia.html" title="Asphyxia">asphyxia</a> is also clear, and requires disambiguation, as I have done in other articles. Deletion or not, that is clear. Additionally, please see WP:WINAD as to why this article currently is of little merit, and needs disambiguation. <a href="../../../w/i/d/User%7EWidefox_7e44.html" title="User:Widefox">Widefox</a> 12:43, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am dismayed at your lack of communication - not only have you failed to respond to an attempt at compromise (such as a see also link) but have actually added without discussion another identical disambiguation link within the text and a separate one for Davy Lamp. Again, I dispute your claim that this is a subsection of asphyxia and have myself provided examples of similar articles for you to review. To these, I add <a href="../../../e/r/o/Erotic_asphyxia.html" title="Erotic asphyxia">erotic asphyxia</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strangling.html" title="Strangling">strangling</a>, and <a href="../../../p/o/s/Positional_asphyxia.html" title="Positional asphyxia">positional asphyxia</a>. These do not have disambiguation links to asphyxia. I feel that your use of the disambiguation links in this manner is atypical. I understand that you are of the opinion that asphyxiant gas belongs within asphyxia. However, this is most certainly a POV and your POV is currently the one which is prominently displayed on the page despite my attempts to engage you in conversation and compromise. Discussion about deletion should remain on the AfD page or a separate section of this talk page. <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 00:35, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't understand. I have justified and talked extensively. I just don't agree with you, and I'm not the only one, so for the rest of us, this disambiguation is useful. You must admit that I've even been very generous considering my opinion on the validity of the page, which I've made clear from the start. I was curious as to whether it had any merit, so I went with it. The duplication of information is IMHO not in itself so bad - I've never said the article has no merit, it is an important safety issue (that I've had myself), just that it's (currently) better in the main article with the already listed asphyxiant gas examples! And you misjudge me, I'm guilty of using extensive disambiguations myself, as the general reader does not know about parent articles unless they are <i>spelled out</i>. And when it comes to medical/emergency issues, I know that I feel better to err on the cautious side (think someone quickly flicking through in a panic) - the standard I'm holding this page to is the <i>exactly the same standard</i> I use with my pages (see <a href="../../../h/o/r/Hornet.html" title="Hornet">hornet</a> and <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_hornet.html" title="European hornet">European hornet</a>) with similar issues (and independently that I've seen on other pages). <a href="../../../w/i/d/User%7EWidefox_7e44.html" title="User:Widefox">Widefox</a> 01:18, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
