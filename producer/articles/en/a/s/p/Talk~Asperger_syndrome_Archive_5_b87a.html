<h2><span class="mw-headline">Extroversion and Asperger's Syndrome</span></h2>
<p>Hello, I would like to describe myself as someone with Aspergers' Syndrome, but i acknowledge i am very different to many Aspergers people i have encountered in local support groups and media/psychology stereotypes. I do know that when i was young boy i would have intense interest in things like dinosaurs, computers science and art, but i had a very intense creative imagination - I didn't really fit in primary school but i had some close friends who would defend me despite my socially eccentric behaviours. Thing is, when i became a teenager i became less and less like an AS person, i still have the interest in pursuit of knowledge - But i seem to undergo a process of self-realisation and ended up being very sociable and popular. I never had any awkward 'body physicality' and i was coordinated to the point of being a competent artist, musician, rugby player and break dancer. I never had any problems relating to people, i understood queues, i had no inhibitions and became versatile as a conversationalist and i haved flirted with many girls and would describe my social success as something better then average. And then i got into the whole drug/rock scene and i seemed to be antagonistic of the Asperger Syndrome typical - i do admit i had great interest in chess/poker/art/producing electronica/philosophy and psychology. aswell as attraction to conspiracies, ancient cultures and eccentric sciences/art/personalities i never exhibited any Aspergers Syndrome traits typical in this article. I will say this though - I am obsessed with hygeine/beauty/gym/mental/physical/spiritual perfection and i will not settle for 'average'. Now i know this is purely anecdotal, but i know my father has Aspergers and its very strong even as an old adult and i seem to have not been effected. I'm wondering if my ability of analytical/intuitive which was very high in IQ tests attributed to my reading and accessing of situations set me apart from AS typicals? (At A Levels, I was nominated to be Social Coordinator of my school for my people skills). perhaps the idea that i have successfully self-actualised myself in my teenage years with active socialisation that i have forced my natural Asperger's Syndrome self to die. I'm sorry if this story doesn't make sense, I have to attend a charity drive this morning so i was in a rush. Any thoughts from everyone who has been diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome or know of anyone with it that doesn't fit the characteristics of Asperger's Syndrome (such as social impairment, yet obviously have some AS tendeancies)? --213.106.102.178 00:13, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Eh, I suppose I am less affected by Asperger's Syndrome than most. I am still socially inept, but people tell me that I have a great sense of humor, and I do enjoy puns and sarcasm. I have very extreme interests, but a wider range than most people with AS. I also have no learning disabilities, and I'm working somewhere around five or more years above grade level (which means twelfth grade or higher). I was diagnosed only two to three months ago, and since then my mother has put me in a social skills group, which I begin next week. I currently only know one other person with AS, and her and I are worlds apart in behavior. I am an "Aspie-girl" as well, so this may have some sort of effect on the level of severity AS has for me... -- <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBit188_b674.html" title="User:Bit188">User:Bit188</a></dd>

<p>Great idea to create a list with a link. As the person responsible for suddenly adding a couple of dozen books into further reading, I did feel it looked cluttered but didn't want to toss anything out (coincidentally, I have this very same problem with my bookshelves at home).&#160;:) This solves the clutter problem without having to ditch any titles. I will continue adding to this list as my own personal collection expands. <a href="../../../p/o/k/User%7EPokey2006_2993.html" title="User:Pokey2006">Pokey2006</a> 04:09, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>After reading the referenced article I think that Westernmost is right to remove but for the wrong reasons. The article (Frey) says that other researchers say that psychotic eposides are more likely but give no sources. I am agree ing with removal for that reason not because it puts us Aspies in a bad light. We should respect (valid) studies. However Frey is quite bad and I suggest perhaps removing as claims AS people have a 50% incidence of lack of oxygen at birth. If this was really true I'm sure much more would have been said on this... What do others think? --<a href="../../../i/m/c/User%7EImcdnzl_42a9.html" title="User:Imcdnzl">Imcdnzl</a> 02:52, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is not very clear in what AS differs from other forms of (HF-)autism. If I understand well, people having AS can/"must" still have a "normal" life? Is this the reason why "Rain Man" is not listed as example movie (the main character having too heavy problems to live a normal life)? Please elucidate...

<dd>From what I can tell, it's mostly a matter of subtlety. You can't entirely mistake there being a disorder (or at least, a HUGE quirk) of some sort with "Rain Man" type autistics, but I know plenty of "Aspies" who went for years without being diagnosed with it, and who if you were to talk to them online, you quite probably wouldn't know they had any disorder unless they told you. Hell, <i>I</i> might have it (I'm suspecting it, lately, anyway), and though I've been diagnosed with <a href="../../../a/d/h/ADHD_4f6a.html" title="ADHD">ADD</a>, the first time I ever heard of Asperger's was after I met a couple of Aspies on a forum I used to frequent (that forum turned out to have like half a dozen more diagnosed Aspies, interestingly enough. Then again, not only did it have a couple of thousand members, it was also partially devoted to fan fiction, and Aspies are apparently frequently drawn to writing, so perhaps it's not all <i>that</i> surprising). Then again on here (since the Wiki has a user category for Aspies), then on <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Legal_a031.html" title="Boston Legal">Boston Legal</a> where "Hands" was a bit... er, more Rain Man-esque, except less Rain Man and more "nervous wreck", with a side of <a href="../../../o/b/s/Obsessive_Compulsive_Disorder_dcc5.html" title="Obsessive Compulsive Disorder">OCD</a>... though I'm somewhat taking the Boston Legal character with a grain of salt, since it was fiction, and in a series that tends to have ultra-kooky characters and situations to begin with. Anyway, again - I think it's a matter of subtlety, in large part (at least, in many cases it is), the difficulty in detecting it or in some cases, the difficulty in identifying it as Asperger's and not something else entirely. It's a ranged disorder then, so... I dunno, in some cases, maybe there's a technicality. Or something. (Did I mention I have ADD?

<p>I have big problems about Ryan's continuing removal of Aspie-quiz. I suggest that either the entire section should be removed or there should be some objective criteria for inclusion. It is not true, as Ryan claims, that only Aspie-quiz was added by site-owners. The same thing applies to the Geek-test (added by Amy of AFF). I don't know about the DSM-test, but it was so badly designed that I really wonder why removing this wasn't the first priority of Ryan. I suggest that either we feature the best tests (based on some criteria) or delete the whole section. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 08:11, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Causes and etiology</span></h2>
<p>"It is currently thought by many that Asperger syndrome and autism share the same etiology. Others suggest that the two conditions have differing etiologies. Debate in this area is ongoing. Various models to explain Asperger syndrome have been proposed, with some of them gaining wider acceptance than others. Quotes from experts and the comparison of older research to more recent research may be of particular interest."</p>
<p>This paragraph says absolutely NOTHING, it reads like one of those excerpts from horrible high school papers that are always circulating through chain emails. I realize that there's not a lot of concensus in the area, but surely it can be better summarized than "Some believe A is the case. Other do not. There are a lot of theories. Some are more popular than others." This is really shocking in a featured article. I lack the expertise to improve this, but it certainly needs to be done. -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 08:24, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You're absolutely right. "The two conditions"? Autism isn't considered to be "one condition". My understanding is that most researchers believe there is no such thing as just one kind of autism. Autism is a collection/spectrum of syndromes, disorders (including Rett's, PDD-NOS etc.) and differences with a range of suspected "causes" including a possible genetic predisposition and possible environmental triggers. One theory is that Asperger syndrome is simply an autism spectrum disorder but without a speech delay. Some believe Asperger syndrome is same thing as high functioning autism -- there is no difference except in terminology. Certainly, Asperger's has been associated with genetics since it's been observed that some extended family members show similar traits; often the fathers. It's certainly very complex and really an expert in the field should be approached to write this section. Really, nobody really knows for sure what's behind this and that's why the writer was so vague. But it could be improved. <a href="../../../p/o/k/User%7EPokey2006_2993.html" title="User:Pokey2006">Pokey2006</a> 04:12, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It would be possible to change this text, but it shouldn't start to present any causes or theories, because this section has been moved to <a href="../../../c/a/u/Causes_of_autism.html" title="Causes of autism">Causes of autism</a>. I don't agree with the idea that there is a huge collection of syndromes. It turned out in the neurodiversity version of Aspie-quiz that the additional diagnoses (Hyperlexia, Dyspraxia, Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, OCD, ODD, Prosapagnosia, Dysgraphia and Bipolar) have very high loadings on autistic score. In fact, most of these have similar Aspie and NT scores as diagnosed autism/AS and self-diagnosed autism/AS. Even if all diagnosed &amp; self-diagnosed autism/AS is removed from the additional diagnosed, the scores differences are similar to when autism/AS is removed from the entire population. This tells me that the autism-spectrum should be extended with many neurodiversity-diagnoses instead of being split more. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 13:21, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Aspie Comments</span></h2>
<p>(WARNING: Long Comment) - This comment is probably going to seem quite long, and maybe to some not the optimum in perfect prose, however for a long time viewing this page on my watch list and observing the history I have had some comments which in general people may or not think are relevant. I have noticed in general this article has focused on medical scientific viewpoints of Asperger's Syndrome, while this may in general be most fitting with the wikipedia NPOV policy with regards to Asperger's Syndrome this standard practice in some ways actually violates the NPOV concept, a large number of people who actually have a diagnosis of Asperger's Syndrome disagree with the conclusion that the neurological wiring of an AS person is defective or a medical phenomena. It is known in the scientific community and the medical community quite rightly that AS causes a different way of thinking which is obvious by the fact this is a neurological difference we are discussing here. However in my experience (by the way I happen to be diagnosed as fitting the criteria for AS from the Early Years Centre, Nottingham, diagnosed by Professor Elizabeth Newton herself) as both an officially diagnosed AS person and a member of a large number of groups for AS persons on the internet the current medical stance is both controversial and one sided.</p>
<p>Now I understand wikipedia policies in many ways regard the viewpoints of AS people as original research, however one must note that persons with AS are on the inside looking out, and from that position will struggle to pass through the peer review process to publish articles in a way that wikipedia would consider valid as a reliable source. While I understand the reasons for this I also know that the opinions in a predominantly NT (NeuroTypical (Non-AS)) society where we are outnumbered something like ~150:1 (Estimated as figures vary depending on source even if one only uses "official" sources) where those whom form scientific, public, medical and peer reviewed studies are in general those on the outside looking in, many of the peer review studies being funded by organizations with a financial benefit in creating a treatment or cure for AS or Autism, in some cases offering unproven treatments for financial gain or unproven causes to advertise such treatments (See MMR, Vaccines, Chelation etc).</p>
<p>I feel regardless to us as individuals and as a group being outnumbered by every peer review process that for such an article as this to be NPOV then the alternative view of AS people looking from the inside out must be considered. Yes I agree much of it is not peer reviewed and yes it should be discussed fully before being taken as a true representation of actual AS people; however I do not believe, as one of the few sources of information on AS which claims to be free and unbiased, that viewpoints of AS people should be ignored in any way although they should be discussed.</p>
<p>Anyway I don't feel I have left much out of my comments at this time so I shall end my comment now, however I shall be happy to do all in my power to answer questions people may have on my comments and defend this position if need be, I also will be willing to retract from my position if a valid reason why my position is invalid can be argued successfully. <a href="../../../m/t/t/User%7EMttJocy_afa1.html" title="User:MttJocy">MttJocy</a> 04:00, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Gillberg study</span></h2>
<p>There is a lot of reference to the Gillberg study in this article. I think those references should be reconsidered; Gillberg has been involved in an "academic fight" where he refused other scientists (notably sociologist Eva Kärfve and paediatrician Leif Elinder) to peer review his source material. Denying peer review must make the result very questionable, at least until they are confirmed by other researchers and scientists. As far as I know the results, so far, are unconfirmed and hence shouldn't be referenced here.</p>

<dd>He refused to show others a particular set of data due, he says, to privacy concerns, but he has <i>numerous</i> peer-reviewed journal articles on these topics.

I suppose you haven't ever got the idea that if you can convince me that based on Wikipedia policy the content should not be on my userpage I will remove it?

<dd>FWIW (and I'm not going to comment on NOR or user page blocking) I don't believe Rdos' theory is "offensive" as JzG has characterized it. The Refrigerator Mother theory is offensive. Theories that say autistics are brain damaged, poisoned, broken, etc. are offensive. Theories that say autistics are limited in various ways, that we inherently can't do this, that or the other, are offensive. Claims that autistics are a burden, mad, a devastation, costly, and so on, are offensive. For the Neanderthal theory to be offensive, you'd have to think that Neanderthals were inherently inferior, which would be racist (or specieist if you will). <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 19:06, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I came here looking for some information to help a student, and instead I have seen, essentially, an entire treatise on ego and pride. Without pointing fingers, certain individuals seem to believe that instead of contributing to the body of knowledge in a way that is acceptable, they can instead disrupt the process. And I go away knowing less than I should about an important topic, because being right is more important that helping people. 70.115.211.122 22:53, 1 July 2006 (UTC)pissedoffteacher</dd>

<dd>The opposite of pride is shame. It would not be in the best interests of autistics to be ashamed. It's really as simple as that. It doesn't have to do with "superpowers". There's no denying that some autistics have special talents, and it's fine if autism is celebrated by pointing those out, with appropriate perspective. When autistics are first diagnosed, they often feel ashamed of themselves. This is something psychology professionals should of course work to avoid. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 23:46, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
