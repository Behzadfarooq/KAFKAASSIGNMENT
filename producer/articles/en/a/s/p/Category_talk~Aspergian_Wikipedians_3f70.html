<p>I think there would be a lot less self proclaimed "Aspies" if the syndrome had any severe stigmatic indications. IANAP, but I think this is relatively faddish, since the main indications are extreme depth of knowledge in a subject, and social awkwardness. I have the greatest of sympathies for those with diagnosed Autism, but this seems more like a nerd bandwagon. <a href="../../../c/f/p/User%7ECfpresley_8cc2.html" title="User:Cfpresley">Cfpresley</a> 18:19, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Excuse me? Bandwagon? I have been medically diagnosed with Asperger's. Do you think I want to be this way? NO. And if there were any severe indications, we'd be Autistic. Asperger's is basically a less severe form of Autism, and it is more than just savantism and social awkwardness. Not only that, but we are also classified as being on the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_spectrum.html" title="Autistic spectrum">autistic spectrum</a>. Asperger's was defined by Hans Asperger in 1944 (same year as Autism), named and translated into English in 1981, and included in the DSM-IV in 1994. That doesn't sound like a fad to me. --<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubhagan_33c0.html" title="User:Dubhagan"><font color="black"><b>Dubh</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/u/b/User_talk%7EDubhagan_8d04.html" title="User talk:Dubhagan"><font color="green"><b>agan</b></font></a> 05:39, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I was tested by a university and found out that my parent's speculations about me having Asperger's syndrome were true. I also found out my IQ was 149. For those of you who dont know, that means I was one point away from being genius. I know that I am not a wannabe.--<a href="../../../e/i/y/User%7EEiyuu_Kou_cec8.html" title="User:Eiyuu Kou">Eiyuu Kou</a> 18:55, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think he's speaking against the socially akward who don't have aspergers and are just very bad at talking with girls who "self-diagnose" themselves with aspergers without any evidence based solely on the fact that they have an extreme depth of knowledge in a subject and social akwardness, thinking, I guess, that the prescense of symptoms obviously means that they have aspergers, so they self-diagnose themselves with it as a means of having a social clique, and you can't deny that aspergian wikipedians is a social clique, and association with dead smart people who other people have alleged to have aspergers, leading them to make claims that "People with aspergers are a higher form of human life" and "Lack of Aspergers is a disorder", which is disgusting, quite frankly</dd>

<p>- I don't know about the rest of you but I really don't think Asperger's should even be listed as a disorder. In fact Asperger's has been proven to make people smarter. I'm proud to have Asperger's and I can understand why someone would fake having it. Because we're the ones who invented everything. There isn't a single successful inventor that did not have Asperger's. Asperger's is not a disease. In fact, lack of it is a disease. Now then, I've added both tags to my userpage and it still wont add me.

<p>Well said Hathkrast.</p>
<p>i am 15 and i have aspergers. i always feel put down when its called disease, condition, mental illness and disorder. it is just a difference. i mean many aspergians do fine in a normal school and i go to a normal school. i have always found it hard to make friends but i have a few good friends and they mean all the world to me. I find things such as shape and space, co ordination and organisation difficult and i have been bullied alot in the past, but am good at english literature and history and drama and people often ask me for help at those subjects, im also not bad at statistics and numerology, its shapes and all thoses stuff i hate!! i also hate art as well. im sooo glad i could give it up last year. Yearh, so please people dont use those words, its really horrible and makes us more vullnable when not necessory!! i hate it! from Rebecca</p>
