<dd>NO Rdos, that's what YOU and your web-board buddies think about the article. I'm going to let you in on a secret Rdos, THIS ARTICLE IS NOT YOUR PERSONAL PLAYGROUND. It IS NOT about your ego, despite your repeated attempts to make it so. It IS NOT a sounding board for your pet beliefs about Aspergers. It IS NOT an excuse to bully people into accepting junk science and personal opinions as factual information. Stop using your feelings of stigmatization as an excuse for redefining the scientific method. You sound ridiculous when you denounce articles for being "peer reviewed". It amazes me that you think such a thing is a criticism. It only makes sense when taken in the context of what you beleive, that is, garbage "science" and clueless opinions from unqualified individuals, yourself included. If you want to sabotage the credibility of an article by cramming it full of unverifiable nonsense, the you are a vandal and should be dealt with. In all honesty, I have yet to find a single point you've made that is worthy of inclusion, and repeatedly find myself reading your posts and wondering why you are regarded as anything other than a POV pusher with no idea how silly you sound. 70.115.211.122 22:22, 14 July 2006 (UTC)Tired of humoring you</dd>

<p>WHOA!! While I agree that this is not Rdos' personal feifdom nor about his ego is certainly isn't Sandy's and Rn's personal feifdom nor about their egos either.(I hope you aren't a sockpuppet?)</p>
<p>...and if you read the wrongplanet link you would see that, in fact, the opinions of Rdos's "web-board buddies" were fairly balanced and took both sides...(not too sure he read it himself?)</p>
<p>Except it shouldn't BE about "sides" and whether RDos or Sandy is "the boss of this game", it should be about presenting as much accurate and balanced information as possible, as well as possible.</p>
<p>There used to be a genuinely, superlative, breathtaking article in this slot, a real show stopper. Now it has morphed through RDos pet lunacies to become overcited, colorless and dry as dust.</p>
<p>If I didn't have too much respect for the effort it took several people to satify Sandy's personal criteria for citations I SWEAR I would revert the whole thing to 2004 when it was truly remarkable.</p>
<p>My choice would be to see a reasonable amount of the citations from this text merged into a reversion to 2004 along with any new information that has shown up. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 22:34, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The difference is that, while Rdos is inserting unreferenced original research, many of us were trying to help you keep your featured status, respecting principles established not by any of us, but by Wiki policies and procedures. Plain and simple. It's not my criteria, never was. It's Wiki's. Perhaps I, personally, misread that any of you were interested in keeping your featured article star. Sorry for the intrusion if you weren't. An unreferenced article doesn't meet featured article criteria, that's all. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 22:41, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I am not a sock puppet, and yes, I realize my post was... strongly worded. However, I feel I made several points very plainly that others have merely danced around. How much time has been wasted undoing what Rdos has done? It frustrates me when individuals sabotage other's efforts by their failure to understand.

Please try to temper your comments towards the anon editor, me, and yes, even towards Rdos. And please refrain from speculation about sock puppets in proximity to my name. I would say Anon also needs to remember civility but s/he has already indicated his/her comments were too strongly worded. If you don't care about the featured status of the article, that presents no problem: I have no vested interest one way or another in the outcome.

<dd>Nice, Natche!! (But did I miss the mention of Wrong Planet in that article - I didn't see it?) That article would support a statement like, <i>Internet sites <s>such as Wrong Planet</s> have made it <s>very easy</s>easier for <s>thousands of</s> individuals to connect with each other. [66]</i> The insertion of a specific reference to Wrong Planet is where the thinly-veiled, unencyclopedic advert comes in. References to one particular group -- when there are so many others -- is out of place in an encyclopedia, unless there is a reliable source somewhere which specifically singles out Wrong Planet as in that specific quote. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 01:35, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Back to the original objection, since Rdos and his friends are arguing that the article is dry and doesn't cover the "moving away from a disease" aspect, again, someone should write that content, using reliable sources. I am quite sure they are out there. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 01:35, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wrong Planet has 5000+ members (no telling how many of those members are actually active members). Four of them, instigated by Rdos, don't like the new article. hmmmm ....

It is various users that have been changing the content of the article towards the view in the autistic community. I basically had no part in this. When I moved causes and therapies to separate articles I didn't add anything. I just reorganized the material. OTOH, Sandy and several other people have made extensive damage to this article, more or less rewriting it from medical sources and totally ignoring the autistic community. I suppose I would be happy with this if the neutrality of the article had been preserved while making it more encyclopedic, but this is not the case. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 07:49, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd><b>THAT</b> right there, in an nutshell, encompasses my problems with you Rdos. In that single sentence you have two of the most prominent examples of my problems with you.</dd>
<dd>FIrst, your repeatedly use "medical community" as a stand in for "<b>SCIENCE</b>" as though they are interchangeable. Why? As we see, it's because in doing so you can then denounce all <b>SCIENCE</b> based studies as <b>medical</b> viewpoints. The next step, denouncing the <b>SCIENTIFIC METHOD</b> is easily accomplished, as it is the main method of the <b>medical</b> viewpoint you like to denounce.</dd>
<dd>However, this is... disingenuous. Psychological studies adhere to scientific method, but ARE NOT the "medical" viewpoint. Nor are sociological studies, nor evolutionary biology studies, etc. It is their adherence to <b>scientific method</b> that you object to, and it's obvious why. Your "non-medical" viewpoint refuses to adhere to scientific method as a rule, so reputable information from such studies is hard to come by. Of course, said alternative views COULD be tested in repeatable, verifiable, studies, but generally are not.</dd>
<dd>Second, and this is one that should be obvious even to you, you ARE NOT the "autistic community" as if such a thing existed in the first place. As in the previous example, you are being intentionally disingenuous. The "autistic community" you claim to advocate for is non-existent, as much so as "blacks" or "jews". They have MANY different ideas about many different things. What you should be saying is "my single individual idea about what is important to me that realtes to autism" and no more. The arrogance to claim to speak for an entire "community" is infuriating.70.115.211.122 06:30, 17 July 2006 (UTC)<b>STILL</b>tired of Rdos

<dd>Hey, Zeraeph, I believe this is my third or fourth request: can you provide an example of a worthy article that is not included in DMOZ? I would like to understand what is going on in the AS category on DMOZ, considering some issues I've seen in the past in the TS category (which are different than what you mention.) Thanks in advance, <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 14:19, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I believe I already explained to you why that is completely irrelevant to the reasons why a DMOZ category edited by a single, notoriously biased and agenda driven editor is not an acceptable substitute for an "External links" section in a Wikipedia article that is supposed to be NPOV?

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>a)Why you dismiss everything you didn't initiate by calling it "unencyclopaedic", and yet refuse to explain your personal definition of "encyclopaedic" (figuring out how come a links page under the sole control of a biased and agenda driven editor is an "encylopaedic" substitute for a few links under the, usually effectively impartial, control of the entire community of Wikipedia is only ONE of the aspects of your perception of "encyclopaedic" I have problems grasping).</dd>
<dd>b)Why you freak out unless you have total control of this Wikipedia article, AND YET are quite comfortable with a DMOZ category under dysfunctional control that you have no control over whatsoever?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Incidentally, if you have another, REAL reason for wanting to see links omitted from the DMOZ category, I believe a few have been left on the article, which you would know already if you had bothered to READ the talk page instead of just scanning it for personal insubordination to quell. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 15:19, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The section titled Cultural and Socialogical Aspect touches on the shift in view, and that section has a main article link to the Autistic Culture page. Though if there is something missing, let us know. If there is something in an earlier version that got left out, provide a link to that version, and if there is a website or two (or more) out there that talks about it, provide them.

<dd>I hardly think the autistic perspective is only applicable to "Cultural and Socialogical Aspect". Some time ago, Sandy wanted to use an older version of the article because it was not "cluttered" by "original research" from the autistic community. I'd say I'd rather use a month-or-so old version, as it has not been excessively cluttered by disease-thinking. NPOV is not created by adding a small section to an article. It has to be integrated into the whole. I tried to NPOV the causes section, but it was reverted. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 12:56, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>Some time ago, Sandy wanted to use an older version of the article because it was not "cluttered" by "original research" from the autistic community.</i> While it's possible I may have said this, I don't recall saying it, and if I did, my comment was misunderstood. I have not seen any past version of this article that meets current Featured Article standards. If you decide to revert to an older version, it will still not meet standards and will need to be referenced. The only version of the AS article that has ever been referenced is the current one, and the decision on FAR has been to hold older FAs to current standards.</dd>

<dd>Once again, I want to point out that a referenced article is not incompatible with a non-disease-oriented view of the condition. The information needed to present all sides of the story is out there, from reliable sources. Rather than tearing down what is here, focus on building up what is missing. It's out there, and can be referenced, if efforts are focused on finding it rather than arguing. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 14:30, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No Rdos, I am afraid I do not equate "getting rid of Sandy" with achieving neutrality, any more than I equate "getting rid of RDos" with achieving featured article status.

I do believe that Zeraeph is on the right track (above): build and re-add, by referencing content, rather than destroying referenced content.

<p>Personally, as a person with AS, I don't see this article as focusing on it being a disease. All I see this article focusing on is mostly how it affects the individuals who have it, I don't see it being negative. I can't see what info that is currently there can be proven wrong. Sure, the shift in view could be expanded upon, but at the same time, views of AS are ever changing as new things are still being discovered about AS, so it might be a little hard to keep track. Plus, there is still a medical aspect to AS that can't be denied. --<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubhagan_33c0.html" title="User:Dubhagan"><font color="black"><b>Dubh</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/u/b/User_talk%7EDubhagan_8d04.html" title="User talk:Dubhagan"><font color="green"><b>agan</b></font></a> 13:41, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think at least the causes section is now acceptable, and NPOV. The same thing should be done in the treatment section. It suffers from exactly the same problem. There is no mention that many people in the autistic community does not regard "treatments" as necesary, and at least are against curing autism. This isn't mentioned, and should easily be able to be referenced. Ideally, the treatment section should be of similar length as the causes section. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 17:17, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Right now, neither is comprehensive, but Causes raises more eyebrows than Treatment. (For example, I can go to any number of websites and find far more information on treatment: this article barely scratches the surface.) You can expand with any information referenced from Reliable Sources, but Wiki spells out in various places (I think <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>?) that peer-reviewed, medical sources are much better than individual websites, self-published books, or non-peer-reviewed books. Other editors have already expressed concern about the references being used in the article, and PMID numbers will help deflect that criticism. I don't know the AS research inside and out, but I really believe if someone can go to a library and get hold of the book I mentioned above, you'll be able to find the balanced information you seek, which doesn't focus on a "disease" or "disorder-oriented" approach. You can also just try searching Google scholar. HTH, <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 19:06, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, but don't forget, those sections have main article links, so they don't need to go in the great detail you seem to be preaching. How much more detail can you go into with the Causes section anyway, there is no known cause but several ideas are being researched, which is what it says. There really is nothing more to be said on the Causes section, ESPECIALLY with a main article link. As for Treatments, it touches on the common treatments and that it is a controversial subject. With a main article link, what else needs to be said? --<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubhagan_33c0.html" title="User:Dubhagan"><font color="black"><b>Dubh</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/u/b/User_talk%7EDubhagan_8d04.html" title="User talk:Dubhagan"><font color="green"><b>agan</b></font></a> 05:05, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There is some known information. A link to a daughter article doesn't substitute for a summary of the info in the daughter article, or a basic overview of Causes. For instance, twin and other studies have shown there are genetic factors. The section which was blanked discussed this information. Even if an article branches to daughter articles, the main article needs to provide a summary/overview. If the NIH summary was not to everyone's liking, there are general summaries like it on several other websites, detailing what is known and what is being investigated. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 05:17, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>oops, sorry, forgot to answer the second part of your question. I think Treatment could squeak by FA, even though it's not comprehensive right now. At least it says something, even though there is so much more that could be said. I understand if you all don't want to add treatment information that is sought by many parents of children with AS: at least there is a shell of basic info there now. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 05:21, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'll look into more research being done on causes starting Tuesday, as I am busy until then. Maybe list each cause that is being researched, with a small summary of what the study actually entails, but more than that will make the section too long. As for Treatments, the treatments listed are the treatments being sought.

<p>Nowhere NEAR answering my question, I didn't ask "How do you excuse and/or justify using the phrase "encyclopaedic tone", what I asked was:</p>
<p>What do YOU, personally, mean, when you use the phrase "encyclopaedic tone"? What meaning is actually in your head?</p>
<p>...and if you really don't have a specific answer (rather than excuse or justification) for that, perhaps you should consider specifying what you object to instead of hiding behing a generic "catch all" in future?</p>
<p>As for "Wrong Planet", it self references.

<dd>Don't take any offense. I'm trying to figure out this process as I go along, and it isn't quite as intuitive as I'd thought.

<dl>
<dd>ah, I see ... Let me try to clarify: anyone can comment on a FARC. (Well, if a rash of new editors sign up because Rdos soliticed outside help, those kinds of votes are typically discounted, simply by mentioning that the editor just registered: in that case, the admin closing the vote typically discounts those votes. You've had a Wiki account for several months, so you are entitled to vote on the FARC.) I'm just another editor, no different than you. Regardless of what happens with *this* FARC, it should be instructive for future editors, to highlight problems, and to help this stay the best article possible. Also, in case you don't know the criteria for a featured article, you can find them at <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">WP:FA</a>: they are 1 - 5, and you'll see people on the FARC referring to those specific criteria (for example, 2a is prose, 2d is NPOV, etc - my numbered list addresses specific criteria for a FA). <a href="../../../f/a/r/WP%7EFAR_432e.html" title="WP:FAR">WP:FAR</a> is for reviewing featured articles to make sure they still meet the criteria: since I'm active there, I can't hold a double standard for this article. The article was on track to NOT have to go through FARC, because of all the work done, until Rdos raised a POV issue. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 02:36, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sandy, quite frankly, I'd rather see the current article removed from <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">WP:FA</a> if it is not changed to incorporate / reflect prevailing attitudes in the autistic community. Attitudes are not original research. They are just attitudes held by a large group of autistic people. Also, I can tell you that parents with autistic children are also part of the autistic community. It is mostly a small minority of highly vocal curebees that wants their view of autism as a horrible disorder retained in the name of "peer-review". The article would do far less damage tagged with various tags than left featured and hopelessly biased. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 09:26, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Whether the article should lose its star is up for a community vote: you may prefer original research over a featured quality article, but everyone has a say. In case you are referring to me, I don't know what you mean by the word "curebee", but I'm not one. And, it doesn't appear you are in a position to know who the "majority" is or what it wants. The article can end up tagged if you prevail: people are less likely to read a tagged article, so it seems that you are advocating for willfully harming the article and Wikipedia. Attitudes *are* original research if they are not backed by primary sources. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 12:24, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I also know the autistic community pretty well, and their viewpoints. I also know several major sites like AFF have made their own wiki, probably in protest for the bad article here. I don't want to harm the article here. I want it to be acceptable to autistics at large, which it currently isn't. I could do a poll at wrongplanet to see their view on it if you don't believe it is not acceptable to autistics at large. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 12:40, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sandy, would you see any possible way to have this article conform to the FA standards whilst presenting the appropriate balance? Surely the sterile medical viewpoint is not the only one that exists on this topic, and unfortunately that counter-viewpoint is not something that has been overly peer-reviewed (if at all) per the stringent FA source requirements. How would one present this when the only extraordinarily reliable sources push the opposing view (and would not consider the alternative)? There really must be some way to do this <i>and</i> keep FA (which is actually shaky <i>without</i> said counterpoint). --<a href="../../../k/e/y/User%7EKeyne_c410.html" title="User:Keyne">Keyne</a> 12:44, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Pick a subtopic of the article that is currently problematic, put it in a sandbox, and let't work on it there together. A small enough topic just to serve as an example. I'll edit as well, and we'll prove to ourselves it can be done. I've been involved for much too long with too many families with AS to believe the research you seek is not out there: I firmly believe that those complaining about POV simply aren't digging up the research. Further, if things are phrased correctly, they don't need to be backed by PMID sources (even though I believe they probably can -- look at the examples Rdos found.) <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 17:15, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

There should be newer examples, but I don't know them because I haven't bothered so much about refuting medical models of AS lately. They are so stupid that they don't really need refuting. By the way, Baron-Cohen's "extreme maleness" model probably should be there.

<dd>Not from me ... I'm not the one adding the category, or who added the category, and talk page comments don't need to be sourced. Material added to an article needs to be sourced. If another editor later re-adds the category, you can certainly ask them for a source. I'm not a fan of the whole IDEA/504 legislative mess in the USA, and I'm not going to spend my time researching someone else's edit. Has anyone checked what else is included in the Special Ed category? My point was to not read too much into a category, which is an internal classification to help other Wiki editors. When it was first deleted, I spent a wee amount of time trying to decipher who had added it, but I couldn't find it in edit history, so I'm not inclined to worry about it. My other point was that, should that editor re-insert it, you should be prepared to back up your deletion. It's not a concern to me, but you all may be dealing with it in the future, if it gets re-added. More importantly, there's a lot of work to be done on the article, and spending time on a category that may or may not ever be re-added here by an unidentified editor may not be the most productive use of time. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 12:35, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Because I honestly don't think the number of Autistics (a very broad category) in special ed is particularly relevant to the relevance of special ed to Aspies? --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 11:50, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for fixing the See also: whew, didn't want to see a new problem crop up, that another editor might notice on FAR. On the special ed category, who knows who added it and how long ago, so I'm not going to worry about it, but if that person puts it back, I don't think a reasonable argument can be made to delete it. Autism makes up a very big chunk of Special Ed. A category is just a place to group topics that other editors may want to see when looking at a particular topic: I view it as more of an "internal" function. For example, if there were a new special ed law, the people keeping up with that might need to know what articles might need to be updated, or something to that effect.

Children who benefit from certain therapies or accommodations are not being "cured": treatment does not equal medication or something drastic like <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_brain_stimulation.html" title="Deep brain stimulation">deep brain stimulation</a>.)

<dd>The basic idea is that some wish to "cure" Autism (and related subsections) whereas others simply want an easier time as they are (therapies/accomodations). It's a bit much for this talk page, though, but you are correct: the medical community is primarily interested in furthering a nullication of the "adverse" affects ASDs have, so much research into "positive" methods (enhancement, rather than removal, as a goal) is not and probably will not see the light of day.

<dd>It's controversial material, from a non-peer-reviewed source. Material like that can be added as long as it is not given undue weight: that is, the context of the material should be presented, and not presented as medically-accepted fact. And, the same can be said about material from medically-reviewed sources: just because something can be found in PubMed, doesn't make it "fact" -- there can be newer, conflicting or refuting research, or the study could suffer from methodological problems. That's why I suggest going to a larger medical tome (such as the handbook above), because it likely analyzes all of the past research, including what has been refuted or replicated. Even medically-referenced statements must be put in context. For example, "a prospective, blinded, controlled study on a large sample, replicated by two subsequent studies concluded that ... " is very different from "a retrospective, non-blinded, unreplicated look at a small sample of patients found that ...

I don't have time to read the whole thing right now, but in a recent article about TS, there was some concern raised about the validity of some of the brain imaging conclusions, because of highly-selected and biased samples. There was a question as to what the studies might actually be measuring. So, whomever adds a comment should read the full text of the study, and just put the results in context. It's particularly important to read the "Discussion" section of the study, as that is where you typically find the study weaknesses or a discussion of the strengths of the conclusion. Wording, for example (just guessing at content here, to provide an example), "a controlled (or uncontrolled?) brain imaging study on a small number of clinically-referred subjects (6) raises the possibility that ...

<dd>I have never said it should be referenced "exclusively" from PMID. I have pointed out that PMID sources are the strongest for medical articles, and that current FA medical articles are laregely referenced from PMID sources. The article is currently referenced, which is far better than a few weeks ago. There is a question about the strength of the references, and this has been noted in other places by other editors. The better your references, the stronger the article, the more likely to retain FA. PLEASE take note that this article had satisfied most of the commentators on FAR on July 9, and it was not headed to FARC until you raised POV. The article had been referenced. Now, the article is undergoing FARC review, and the quality of the references is part of that review. Wikipedia asks that articles be referenced.

<dd>Not my fault. If the referencing had been done without biasing the article I'd never had to question it's NPOV. Besides, once again, this article should *not* be a medical-only article, but a balanced article that will leave readers with a correct impression of AS. It currently doesn't do that. If this requirement can be met while keeping the featured status, I'd be happy about it. I believe it can be met by leaving out controversial aspects and place them in daughter articles. Neutral summaries can then be provided instead of detailed descriptions of the exact controversies. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 13:35, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is an excerpt: "There is sometimes no single prevailing view because the available evidence does not yet point to a single answer. Because Wikipedia not only aims to be accurate, but also useful, it tries to explain the theories and empirical justification for each school of thought, with reference to published sources. Editors must not, however, create arguments themselves in favor of, or against, any particular theory or position. See Wikipedia:No original research, which is policy. Although significant-minority views are welcome in Wikipedia, the views of tiny minorities need not be reported. (See Wikipedia:Neutral Point of View.)</p>
<p>Make readers aware of any uncertainty or controversy. A well-referenced article will point to specific journal articles or specific theories proposed by specific researchers."</p>
<p>This has a lot to do with the current state of affairs.</p>
<p>1. The view held by the autistic community is probably a majority view among autistics, but at least it is a minority view among those that can be viewed as experts in this field. It therefore should be part of the article for POV-reasons.</p>
<p>2. Controversial topics are not pointed out. For instance, the summary of causes and therapies are not noted as controversial.</p>
<p>3. Non-PMID theories are left out. The neurodiversity view, held by the majority of the autistic community, and some professionals is not presented.</p>
<p>Excerpt from "popular culture": "Articles related to popular culture and fiction must be backed up by reliable sources like all other articles. However, due to the subject matter, many may not be discussed in the same academic contexts as science, law, philosophy and so on. Personal websites, wikis, and posts on bulletin boards, Usenet and blogs should still not be used as secondary sources."</p>
<p>IOW, cultural aspects of AS does not need to backed up by PMID or peer-reviewed research. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 11:56, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One thing I am absolutely certain of is that there is no need for citations to be PMID, here, or anywhere on Wikipedia! Aspergers, like all forms of Autism, also has educational and cultural aspects that cannot realistically be sourced from PMID by any reasonable standards. I also feel that self-published sources should be avoided in most cases...these, however, would seem a valid exception:</dd>

<dd>I am beginning to wonder if there might be a case for dividing this article into <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asperger_Syndrome_92e0.html" title="Asperger Syndrome">Asperger Syndrome</a> and Asperger Syndrome(clinical), because there is a case (though not neccesarily a clear cut one) to be made for seeing the two as different topics, it's way over recommended article length ANYWAY.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 12:47, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That is how/why "sociological and cultural aspects" typically get divided into a separate article, which becomes the more interesting one&#160;:-) By doing that, you can include info from non-medical sources more easily. Several Wiki physicians encouraged me to separate the info in <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sociological_and_cultural_aspects_of_Tourette_syndrome_9f33.html" title="Sociological and cultural aspects of Tourette syndrome">Sociological and cultural aspects of Tourette syndrome</a>, to strengthen the main article. Now, we all know that the "TS community" cares more about the info that was split out: they can find it all in one place, and refer to it often&#160;:-) And, every time someone wants to speculate about whether George W. Bush has Tourette's, vandalism can occur in the daughter article rather than the main article. The main article has to provide comprehensive coverage of the medical basics, known info, and areas of investigation: the more interesting info can be found in daughter articles.</dd>

<dd>Article length is still fine: remember, reviewers look at prose size, not overall size (which is an older, technical limitation). I will run a current prose size check and post it here.

<dd>Whatever you all decide, but in my mind, the hardest obstacle to overcome right now is 2b) comprehensive. In the minds of outside reviewers, who may vote, 2d) POV and 2e) stability may take on greater importance, so that's in Rdos' court, since I think he is the only one contributing to those concerns on FAR.</dd>

<dd>On a technical note, and I really don't know the answer to this, I don't think you can change the name of the article and retain the featured status? I really don't know: I've not seen it done before, since doing that inherently implies the article is not 2e) stable. One way you may get around that (and I'm really not sure on this either), is to include something like a dbalink at the top (disambiguation) which says, this article discusses the clinical view of AS, for &lt;whatever&gt; view, see &lt;name of article&gt; ... <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 13:34, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>That shouldn't be a problem...after all, I feel sure you will have a free hand with Asperger syndrome (clinical) (which is best "clinical" or "medical"?), and with your special interest in FA I feel certain you will not have the slightest difficulty in achieving FA status for it at the first opportunity.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The best way seem to be:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>create Asperger syndrome (clinical) using the existing text</li>
<li>revert this page to the last featured version</li>
<li>delete all none clinical text from the new Asperger syndrome (clinical) (copy any that seems relevant back here)</li>
<li>start reviewing the medical information here for synopsising and seeing what else needs adding. There are SO many other features of AS that need sourcing and adding it's unreal, like "aversion to children" (fact/fiction/both), gender ambiguity (fact/fiction/both). Misconception debunking...</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That way this article can stand or fall in the current FARC in accord with the wishes of the community (I warn you, it will probably fall, but can always re-submit, but are we really that bothered?) and the Asperger syndrome (clinical), which is, essentially, a new article, will have a clean sheet upon which I feel certain it's submission will ultimately be accepted.</dd>

<dd>I couldn't support that, because of concerns about changing the name of a featured article, which has to be comprehensive, stable, and NPOV.

<dd>I will go one further and state that I pledge my support for any section of this article presented for FA status under Asperger syndrome (clinical) or similar, because I believe it is warranted, but NOT as <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asperger_syndrome.html" title="Asperger syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a>(generic), because it isn't.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 14:09, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do not support the notion that the main article should be a medical article with non-medical daugther articles. There is already a autism community article, which deals with what happens there, but this is separate from providing balance in a featured article which is floating around everywhere on the Internet. I think we should simply keep to the concept that was practised here before, to put controversial topics in daughter articles. That includes causes, therapies, prevalence / epidemy and similar topics. The main featured article should describe what AS is and shouldn't dwelve into controversial research by anybody. This way it can be both featured, balanced *and* referenced. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 13:22, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
</dd>

<dl>

<dd>One reason for wanting to do it this way is that people seeking information on Asperger Sydrome most usually need an accessible, readable explaination of what it actually is, not a lot of far less accessible, or relevant (TO THEM) medical information from academic sources, which, of course would have to be linked. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 13:29, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

However, I cannot see promoting the clinical side over the cultural dissent or vice versa. It's really two sides of the same coin, if you get my drift and really seems like it should be addressed in completion in the same article.

<dd>Yes, I see the dilemma. I don't know how long FARC will last, and the admin closing it can sometimes be convinced to leave it open if work is ongoing and progress is demonstrable, so I do hope everyone here will put their heads together, come to consensus, and just get it done.

There is nothing POV about the title: the current title is Asperger syndrome. Changing it to include (clinical) could be viewed as a POV fork, leaving out other aspects.

Since Asperger's Syndrome was officially defined in the DSM-IV, several possible causes of AS have been investigated by researchers. These possible causes include: genetics,[36] epilepsy,[37] folic acid,[38] a serotonin dysfunction,[39] cerebellar dysfunction,[40] an enlarged amygdala and hippocampus,[41]and other brain problems.[42][43][44]". It speculates about epilepsy (a comorbid), folic acid (I have on idea about this cause), serotonin (serotonin is a "status" substance), cerbellar dysfunction (speculative), enlarged brain parts (what is the causative effect?) and various other brain problems, which no doubt have not been proved to be causative either. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 14:23, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article should contain "good" investigations into causes of AS, Rdos, and that does include "medical causes." <i>Everything</i> is speculative about that section, so please do not attempt to dismiss one speculation for another, especially when one has history of debunking previously understood/"popular" speculative causes. --<a href="../../../k/e/y/User%7EKeyne_c410.html" title="User:Keyne">Keyne</a> 15:58, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Back to basics. It seems to me that there is a clinical viewpoint on AS, it exists, right, wrong or various, so as far asd I can see it isn't POV to say that a clinical viewpoint, and clinical research, exists in it's own right?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What would be POV is to say whether that clinical viewpoint (or rather, any perspective on it, because some of them conflict too) was right or wrong, or even MORE right or wrong than any other.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It can be argued that AS is a case similar to deafness, where those affected are largely functional and intelligent people, and where it is almost impossible for those not affected to have any easy understanding of it, or perhaps full understanding at all.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thus there are many more "non-clinical" aspects than clinical ones.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thus it would be POV to suggest that the clinical aspects of AS are predominant over the others in any sense. It would also be POV to exclude the clinical aspects.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think that the most important thing is to present ALL aspects of AS as fairly, accurately and effectively as possible. Until all points of contention and conflicts are resolved it is probably best NOT to have FA status. Who wants FA status for an unbalanced and inaccurate article that nobody is happy with anyway?</dd>

</dd>
</dl>

<p>Allright, with the talk page archive, I sorta lost track of where we are. I think, if you don't want FA, you can do whatever you want. But if you do want FA, the main article must be 2a) well written, 2b) comprehensive, 2c) factual, 2d) neutral and 2e) stable. All of these proposals are moving away from comprehensive and neutral (by splitting content, and according to POV) and into an argument in favor of instability. But again, it's a choice you all can make. If you *do* want FA, time's a wasting. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 16:24, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe I'm too close to the topic, but I can't figure what you're asking in the RFC, so I'm not clear on how others can comment. But I also think it's good to wait for other involved editors to catch up here: there are some allegations of "bulldozing" on the FARC, which are entirely unfounded. Are we overlooking Pokey, Dub, RN, Nande (can't remember how to spell it) and other editors, who haven't checked in to these recent developments, and supported the work that was done? By no means was anything done to this article without consensus, and the statements to that effect on the FARC are simply unfounded. And, since it's been many days since I edited the article, I think the comments are a bit heavy-handed. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 16:48, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article and prose size</span></h2>
<p>Back with size info: current overall size is 50KB, which is not a problem, so there's no need to even check prose size. No one lately objects to overall size of 50KB, since a well-referenced article will be at least 50KB. Some current FAs have up to 125 overall KB, because of all the references. Prose size looks only at the prose: that is, how much the reader actually has to digest. Since this article is only at 50KB overall (which includes references, templates, pictures, etc), it's content (prose) is undersized relative to many current FAs. The article content should be beefed up. Here is how you calculate prose size: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SandyGeorgia#updating_prose_size" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SandyGeorgia#updating_prose_size" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 13:14, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Firstly, "neurodiversity" is not a cause; it is a result. Secondly, we do need examples with proper citations. Removing the examples and leaving the citations looks horrible and leaves the reader no room to easily figure out which reference goes for what. I'm all for other references that are not specifically medically-based, but they really must come from good sources.</p>
<p>If we can refute some of the currently listed causes, then let's do so! Blanking them out is <i>not</i> an option, in my opinion. Find sources that refute those studies, and then we will remove them. --<a href="../../../k/e/y/User%7EKeyne_c410.html" title="User:Keyne">Keyne</a> 17:03, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Keyne, you might want to check the version I had written on Causes, and which was deleted -- you have to go back around July 13.</p>
<p>This is a perfect example of why I keep trying to get you all to look at that book (now in talk page archives) which had Donald Cohen as an editor. We have some GREAT wording in the TS realm from a medical textbook that he also co-authored, and I suspect if you’ll look at that book, you may find some similar wording, because he was that kind of person. If you find it there, you can reference it to an authoritative medical tome&#160;! This is info I was able to reference in the TS article, just for you to see an example:</p>
<p>“A brief time spent with members of the Tourette’s community reveals that, although Tourette syndrome can be a difficult condition, not everyone wants treatment, especially until they learn precisely what else they may “lose” in the bargain (ref). As discussed by Leckman and Cohen in Chapters 1 and 8, there may even be some latent advantages for individuals with Tourette’s. Genetic disorders may indeed be selective adaptations to changing environmental conditions. (HECK, you can use that line&#160;!! p. 408 from the Leckman/Cohen book refd in the TS article) For example,” … and then they give the example of sickle-cell anemia conferring resistance to malaria … continuing …</p>
<p>“Others suggest that the question is not what (behavior) is good or bad, but to what purpose the range of variation seems to be for. Nobel Laureate Konrad Lorenz suggests that “humanity as a species in danger, and … many of the dangers threatening it derive from inherited norms of behavior unique to the species – those adaptations to yesterday which, today, under greatly changed circumstances of human life, may prove harmful” (in Tiger &amp; Fox, 1989).”</p>
<p>p. 409 “Some adults with Tourette’s syndrome believe that overemphasis on cure supersedes a more complete definition of the disorder. For example, the 4:1 ratio of males to females suggests differences ….</p>
<p>“Another concern is that losses could occur in the process of ‘curing’ TS … “ followed by a long discussion …</p>
<p>My point is, the info to merge these two views (medical and neurodiversity) is probably out there – go find it, and try Cohen as a resource. I am quoting from the top medical tome on TS, and he was an author, and he was also involved (now deceased) with autism at Yale&#160;! I won't bore you with more TS excerpts, but there is an entire chapter in this book dedicated to this, so I really wish someone would find that other book by him in a library somewhere, as it may solve this dilemma. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 17:40, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Causes_-_epilepsy" id="Causes_-_epilepsy"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Causes - epilepsy</span></h3>
<p>It is claimed that "epilepsy" is a cause of autism (note autism, AS isn't mentioned). However, this is not what the article claims. It is a comorbidity study of autism spectrum disorders and epilepsy. Since it is a comorbidity study, it doesn't say (and cannot say) that there is a causal relationship.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Causes - serotonin</span></h3>
<p>I did a search on the Neanderthal psychology forum for this. I new this has been refuted in several studies. <a href="http://www.bepress.com/context/gruterclassics/article/1025/type/native/viewcontent/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bepress.com/context/gruterclassics/article/1025/type/native/viewcontent/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. Citation: "we now know that human leadership, bonding, and obedience can also be affected by the functional state of neurotransmitter systems like serotonin"</p>
<p>Here is another study: <a href="http://www.annalsnyas.org/cgi/content/abstract/1036/1/382" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.annalsnyas.org/cgi/content/abstract/1036/1/382" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. Citation: "The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) has been implicated in the modulation of aggression in animals and humans."</p>
<p>I know there is also a study of serotonin levels in various animal species, but I have lost them. The consensus is that serotonin level is correlated with perceived status. After a high-status individual looses status, he will also decrease serotonin-levels. It is also well known that anti-depressants work on serotonin, so for serotonin to be a cause of AS it must be proved that depression is a cause of AS, which seems highly unlikely. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 18:02, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>OBJECTIVE: The cause of autistic spectrum disorder (i.e., autism and Asperger's syndrome) is unknown. The serotonergic (5-HT) system may be especially implicated. However, cortical 5-HT2A receptor density in adults with the disorder has not been examined, to the authors' knowledge. METHOD: The authors investigated cortical 5-HT2A receptor binding in eight adults with Asperger's syndrome and in 10 healthy comparison subjects with single photon emission computed tomography and the selective 5-HT2A receptor ligand 123I iodinated 4-amino-N-[1-[3-(4-fluorophenoxy)propyl]-4-methyl-4-piperidinyl]-5-iodo-2-methoxybenzamide (123I-5-I-R91150). RESULTS: People with Asperger's syndrome had a significant reduction in cortical 5-HT2A receptor binding in the total, anterior, and posterior cingulate; bilaterally in the frontal and superior temporal lobes; and in the left parietal lobe. Also, reduced receptor binding was significantly related to abnormal social communication. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' findings suggest that adults with Asperger's syndrome have abnormalities in cortical 5-HT2A receptor density and that this deficit may underlie some clinical symptoms.</i></dd>

<dd>Twin and family studies suggest there is a genetic vulnerability to AS and the related disorders, but a specific gene for AS has not been identified. Multiple genes are thought to be responsible for causing AS, since the symptoms and the severity of symptoms vary widely among individuals.<sup id="_ref-NINDS_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NINDS" title="">[1]</a></sup> Current research points to structural abnormalities in the brain as a cause of AS.<sup id="_ref-NINDS_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NINDS" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[3]</a></sup> These abnormalities impact neural circuits that control thought and behavior. Researchers think that gene/environment interactions cause some genes to turn on or turn off, or turn on too much or too little in the wrong places, and this interferes with the normal migration and wiring of embryonic brain cells during early development.<sup id="_ref-NINDS_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NINDS" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>

<dd>Researchers at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California_04ab.html" title="University of California">University of California</a> have proposed that AS stems from abnormal changes that happen during critical stages of fetal development. Defects in the genes that control and regulate normal brain growth create abnormal growth patterns; these may cause overgrowth in some brain structures and reduced growth or excessive cell loss in others.<sup id="_ref-NINDS_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NINDS" title="">[1]</a></sup> Using advanced <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain_imaging.html" title="Brain imaging">brain imaging</a> techniques, scientists have revealed structural and functional differences in specific brain regions between the brains of normal versus AS children. One study found a lack of activity in the frontal lobe of AS children when asked to respond to tasks that required them to use their judgment. Another found differences in brain activity when children were asked to respond to facial expressions. Other methods of investigating brain function have revealed abnormal levels of particular proteins in the brains of adults with AS, which correlate with obsessive and repetitive behaviors.<sup id="_ref-NINDS_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NINDS" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>

I don't see why that's hilarious at all--it's a request for more <i>information</i> in support of the hypothesis, as it isn't <i>fact</i>, which is something both will need to do before it can be confirmed as being "caused" or "next step"-ish. --<a href="../../../k/e/y/User%7EKeyne_c410.html" title="User:Keyne">Keyne</a> 19:10, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Neurodiversity is really not a specific theory or hypothesis. It is more on the same rank as the medical approach to AS. IOW, while a medical hypothesis asssumes something is wrong with the autistic brain, neurodiversity assumes the differences are functional and part of human diversity. There is really no (accepted) neurodiversity theories, mostly because the medical researchers doesn't use it as a model when formulating their hypothesisis.</dd>

I was just trying to form a starting point so the section can talk about <b>all</b> potential causes, not just the two that were there before (which came from only one source, nonetheless). --<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubhagan_33c0.html" title="User:Dubhagan"><font color="black"><b>Dubh</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/u/b/User_talk%7EDubhagan_8d04.html" title="User talk:Dubhagan"><font color="green"><b>agan</b></font></a> 18:04, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article split</span></h2>
<p>Wow, miss a day, miss a lot.</p>
<p>Anyway, I like the idea of splitting the article between the medical definition and the cultural view. The sections Classification and diagnosis, Causes, Treatment, Prognosis, Epidemiology, and History can all go into the medical article, while the rest can go into the cultural article.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't care if this article loses FA status after a split and name change, the new articles can always reapply later. In order for this article to be viewed as NPOV by all parties involved, it needs to be split, otherwise it could get quite diluted.</p>
<p>However, before we split the article, we should discuss what the new articles should be named and if we need a disambiguation page.</p>

<p>AS has two aspects to it, a medical and a cultural, and in splitting them we can better focus on each aspect. It is not about POV. I'm currently seeing that the cultural aspect isn't being talked about fully because it doesn't conform to medical proof. If we split the article, we can better discuss the cultural aspect without having to worry about interference from the medical aspect. --<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubhagan_33c0.html" title="User:Dubhagan"><font color="black"><b>Dubh</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/u/b/User_talk%7EDubhagan_8d04.html" title="User talk:Dubhagan"><font color="green"><b>agan</b></font></a> 17:52, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I still do not see why it would not be possible to have one article discussing both "sides" (medical opine vs. cultural opine) as it stands. Care to comment on why you'd think it wise to separate two oppositional POVs into multiple POV-driven articles? --<a href="../../../k/e/y/User%7EKeyne_c410.html" title="User:Keyne">Keyne</a> 17:38, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The split could be done within the article itself too, grouping all the medical stuff together and the same with the cultural stuff. Either way, the current version has too much emphasis on the medical. --<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubhagan_33c0.html" title="User:Dubhagan"><font color="black"><b>Dubh</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/u/b/User_talk%7EDubhagan_8d04.html" title="User talk:Dubhagan"><font color="green"><b>agan</b></font></a> 17:52, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The more I look the more obvious diversifying seems to me too.

<dd>It's almost as though, in this case, neutrality depends almost entirely on the perspective of the article and there are so many diverse perspectives, think that is my answer to your question too Keyne.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 17:42, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, again, you all might not care about FA (I don't know, that's up to you), but you should know that the standards for getting FA are very high now, while keeping the one you have won't necessarily be quite as hard. It's likely the votes on FARC will mostly be from *you*, while the votes on FAC will be from a much broader community, and the standards have gotten much higher.

<dd>It isn't so much about "FA" or whatnot, but the article (and indeed, other articles) really should be held to similar high standards. It makes for good reading, work, and all-round information. That said, I do not see why we could not present differing viewpoints (appropriately) in this article and <i>still</i> retain/regain FA status. It seems foolish to split it into multiple POV articles, when we're trying to promote an NPOV standpoint! --<a href="../../../k/e/y/User%7EKeyne_c410.html" title="User:Keyne">Keyne</a> 17:51, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you are missing my point here Keyne which is that there is more than one perspective on AS and what is POV depends on the perspective. I am advocating splitting it into perspectives not POV...and the article is long already without even touching on some really well known aspects of AS like gender confusion and the curious aversion to children and/or reproduction that some Aspies have.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To me it should be split into perspectives giving the points for and against each, which either makes one very long, rambling article, of a dozen or so tiny ones, so that the easiest breakdown is to split it into "general", "clinical" and "cultural" or similar. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 18:21, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Keyne: truth is, all Wiki articles should ideally aspire to meet FA criteria, because the criteria are what Wiki is supposed to be about. This discussion of splitting the articles is a loss of valuable time. There are already too many really bad autism articles on Wiki: we don't need more to work on. Put up a straw poll, give it 24 hours, and then get moving in whatever direction is decided. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 18:00, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed. Also, if we're splitting the article between clinical and non-clinical lines, we should make effort to flesh out both viewpoints appropriately, in appropriate sectioning. --<a href="../../../k/e/y/User%7EKeyne_c410.html" title="User:Keyne">Keyne</a> 19:01, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is not possible. It would not be NPOV if the cause and therapy sections would be based only on medical aspects. There are several sections that <b>must</b> have both perspectives.

<p>Just looked at it: only had a chance to glance at the top. It doesn't flow, since you dive right into characteristics, without giving any defining basics first. I think if you can do some rearranging, you can fix that ... <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 19:19, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>When people look up AS, they are mostly concerned with the characteristics. Characteristics ARE the defining basis, they incorporate the diagnostic criteria and expand on it. Besides, diagnostic criteria are part of the clinical aspect, characteristics are the only thing that both the clinical and non-clinical communities agree on. Of course, the diagnostic criteria <b>could</b> be considered part of the characteristics, and be the first subsection under characteristics instead of under the clinical perspective.

<p>Is there really any consensus for splitting the article? I'm getting pretty tired of trying to NPOV the causes section and getting it reverted all the time.

<dd>Work on this article should not continually be sidetracked by one divergent opinion, and if four people are working on the article, you should go along with their consensus. Splitting the article -- although I haven't examined it in detail -- doesn't trouble me, since sections can easily be rearranged. It's more important now to get the missing content written, and you keep resisting any efforts to do so, while never proposing written, referenced content that supports your views.

<p>Rdos, I think your misunderstanding the inter-article split. the Clinical section should only deal with what's being done in the medical community. The Non-Clinical section deals with what's being talked about outside the medical community. If the non-medical groups have a problem with the research into causes and the treatments, then that should be talked about under the Non-Clinical section, possibly in it's own subsection. --<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubhagan_33c0.html" title="User:Dubhagan"><font color="black"><b>Dubh</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/u/b/User_talk%7EDubhagan_8d04.html" title="User talk:Dubhagan"><font color="green"><b>agan</b></font></a> 19:53, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK, I looked closer at the split, and I think you can make it work, although it still needs some tweaking for flow, and some missing content. The split whacked out some of the references, though.

<dd>No, have a closer look (for example, number <s>16</s> 8). The first full instance of the named ref has to occur first in the text: they have to be juggled a bit. We also have to make sure that the first reference to each book -- subsequently referred to in other refs -- still occurs first. I can easily fix them if you want me to, but it may be best to wait a bit. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 20:46, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suppose it'd help if I knew which uniform style would be appropriate. For example, we have a lot of "Romanowski and Kirby (2005) p. 336."-style references.

<p>If we could come to a consensus regarding which style we will be using for what references (such as the differing ones as I mentioned above), I will try to fix them in the morning.

<dl>
<dd>I'm stumped on the style. It's been a hodge-podge. The problem I have is that web cite doesn't handle journal articles correctly, some of the pre-existing refs used web cite, some used web cite when they shouldn't have (for journals or books), so we have a real hodge podge. I don't know how to fix it, but journal references should end up looking like they do on <a href="../../../c/y/s/Cystic_fibrosis.html" title="Cystic fibrosis">Cystic fibrosis</a> (notice format on author names there, journal italicized, PMID at the end, and full-text after that when available). Most of the medical journal articles are correct, I think -- I've been checking them. The rest: I don't know what to do. I haven't noticed anyone else doing a lot of ref cleanup, so I think you can probably pick a style and do what you want. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 03:03, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

Stop complaining, and start writing&#160;:-) There is no POV fork here, since everything is in one article. The solution was brilliant: you are complaining, but in the weeks I've been here, I have not seen you write and reference any of the content you claim is missing. I've only seen you delete referenced content. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 20:58, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No what is biased is bringing non-medical POV to medical section, which is what you want to do. That would give the article a non-medical slant. I'll repeat what I said earlier, anything being done within the medical community should only be mentioned in the Clinical section and any view being put forward should only be under the Non-clinical section. THAT'S how you maintain NPOV, by not letting the differing sections interfere with each other. That way BOTH views are present. If the non-medical community has any problem with the research, causes, treatments, etc. they should be brought up in the Non-clinical section. --<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubhagan_33c0.html" title="User:Dubhagan"><font color="black"><b>Dubh</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/u/b/User_talk%7EDubhagan_8d04.html" title="User talk:Dubhagan"><font color="green"><b>agan</b></font></a> 21:03, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That is breaking the rules of wikipedia. It is called POV-forking.

<dd><i>A POV fork is an attempt to evade NPOV guidelines by creating a new article about a certain subject that is already treated in an article often to avoid or highlight negative or positive viewpoints or facts.

Is someone going to restore some medical causes to the article? <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 02:09, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Removed "Neurodiversity" as something clinical research is poking at (they aren't). It should be inserted in the non-clinical section, preferrably with better wording to express what the article talks about, more specifically (read: less OR). I don't see why it couldn't be included, but reading into it should probably be avoided.</dd>

<dd>Some clinicans obviously are, or think somebody should be. I will reinsert it without labeling it neurodiversity. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 08:15, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Um, do you not know what Neurodiversity is all about? The line <i>We are taking the regular characteristics of bright boys and calling that an illness</i> says the same thing the Neurodiversity people preach. --<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubhagan_33c0.html" title="User:Dubhagan"><font color="black"><b>Dubh</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/u/b/User_talk%7EDubhagan_8d04.html" title="User talk:Dubhagan"><font color="green"><b>agan</b></font></a> 02:24, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, however, then the line about neurodiversity should include that as a prelude to somewhat explain to the reader where and what the concept portrays and contains, rather than having a out-of-place looking reference to a term that is not used in that article. It's about introducing clarity&#160;:) --<a href="../../../k/e/y/User%7EKeyne_c410.html" title="User:Keyne">Keyne</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I understand where you're coming from, Dubhagan, but we were still going beyond what is actually stated in the reference. We can't make that kind of jump. And the article wasn't talking about research into causes at all. I'm not saying not to introduce the concept, just not under Research into causes. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 03:07, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, while I was cleaning up the references, I saw that we do not have a medical source for the statement about above-average intelligence as part of the condition. Since that is not part of the diagnostic criteria, we should really try to find one. It's OK to use non-medical resources to reference some kinds of statements, but if we're going against the diagnostic criteria, I think we'd better be able to back it up. Non-medical websites which say "usually" don't make a strong case. I'm going to spend some time in PubMed looking for one: there's got to be something there. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 03:13, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for correcting my terminology: to clarify, I mean sources which have the benefit of peer review by (theoretically) unbiased medical editors, as in journal publications.

<dd>Moot point now, I removed it, it didn't belong there anyway. Diagnostic criteria mentions that intelligence is normal.

<p>Dubhagan, the old version said: <i>and is characterized by normal intelligence and language development, but deficiencies in social and communication skills.</i></p>
<p>Did you mean to also take out normal intelligence and language development? <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 04:24, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, AS is defined by what it affects, not by what it doesn't affect. If you think they should stay, then they should be after the deficiencies, not before. And it said "average to above average intelligence", not "normal intelligence" when I removed it. --<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubhagan_33c0.html" title="User:Dubhagan"><font color="black"><b>Dubh</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/u/b/User_talk%7EDubhagan_8d04.html" title="User talk:Dubhagan"><font color="green"><b>agan</b></font></a> 04:36, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This claim seems pretty controversial, and to a large degree contributes to the POV-problems there: "There is no one best treatment modality for all persons with AS, but most professionals agree that early intervention is beneficial for children". I think it should simply be removed. The citation is not from a reputable source that evaluates autism-treatments either.

<p>Four references are not needed to back up what is in the DSM. In fact, no references are needed to back the DSM definition, except the DSM definition. The condition is defined as no cognitive impairment. The problem before, which required a ref, was a statement about "above-average" intelligence, which is not part of the diagnosis. If you stick to the definition, you don't need references, much less 4 in the lead, which makes it look like a controversial statement, which it's not. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 11:30, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's specifically "controversial" in that it uses intelligence as a sort of marker to "divide" the spectrum, and some people do not find that quite appropriate. Nevertheless, it (avg.+ IQ) is unfortunately one of the primary distinctions from other ASDs . Whether or not it is "right" can be reserved for the body, I'd think. If we can separate it without gutting the distinction, that may perhaps be for the best. --<a href="../../../k/e/y/User%7EKeyne_c410.html" title="User:Keyne">Keyne</a> 20:22, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Improper reference and citation</span></h2>
<p>Here is the claim: "People with severe AS symptoms may frequently be diagnosed with clinical depression, oppositional defiant disorder, antisocial personality disorder, Tourette syndrome, ADHD, general anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, or obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Dysgraphia, Dyspraxia, Dyslexia, or Dyscalculia may also be diagnosed; however, while elements from all of these conditions are associated with AS, the cause is usually the syndrome itself, rather than a separate condition.[37] "</p>
<p>It is backed up by the AS-IF site, however this site is not authorative for the causes of AS, and how the comorbidities are related. The last part "however, while elements from all of these conditions are associated with AS, the cause is usually the syndrome itself, rather than a separate condition" should be removed unless better referenced. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 11:57, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't know if the rest of the claims are properly cited either: "While there may be a correlation between them, the disorders are distinct. Research indicates people with AS may be far more likely to have the associated conditions, but the connection appears to be largely one of resemblance. For example, the "obsessions" common to those with AS are usually focused on a special interest; these differ in nature to those specific to OCD, which tend to be based on anxieties, such as a fear of germs"</p>
<p>The cite is to a book I don't have. However, I doubt that the cite can show that the conditions are distinct (see the ref on this I added in the diagnostic section about the dxes not beeing properly delimited). It would need a PMID citation. The claims of different ethology for obsessions also would need a PMID-citation --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 12:07, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've long had a problem with some of those book cites. Comorbidity is sticky because of ascertainment bias issues: those with more comorbids tend to come to tertiary, clinical attention more than those who don't have comorbids (Coffey, Park 1997). A laundry list is problematic on that score, but it shouldn't be hard to find an up to date analysis of comorbidity in PubMed: I saw several last night. (Yes, I do think we need to go through some of the sources: the book sources are suspect in my mind.) <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 13:36, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe some treatment is called for in terms of making the article comprehensive. It's a very sticky topic because of referral bias, but can't be just glossed over. TS is a perfect example: tics are part of the autism spectrum, yet many are inaccurately diagnosed as TS (See Mejia, Jankovic, Burd/Kerbeshian, Freeman, and many more.) Some sort of clarifying statement on where the research stands would be helpful. I believe it can be found in PubMed. I've also found it's very important to parents, who are tying to figure out what's what and how to treat it: for example, if OCD is a separate condition, it may respond to SSRIs; if what looks OCish is just part of AS repetitive rituals, it may not require or respond to an SSRI. And so on ... more, if a child happens to have separately inherited a number of other conditions (OCD, ADHD, mood disorder), then there are some very helpful resources with respect to explosive outbursts and inflexible behaviors which can be used in focusing treatment. So, I hope some brief summary of comorbidity issues can be made. Sometimes the comorbids are causing more problems than the condition itself. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 13:36, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps, but my <i>personal</i> opinion is that comorbids are not different if they are part of AS or not. So, in the case of OCD, which I have quite a lot of experience with, I don't see why the outbursts or behavioral outcome would be different if its part of repetitive rituals / special interests or not. What seems to be important is '<i>how</i> you deal with people with OCD. I don't think the traditional stereotypical treatments are anywhere near optimal. For me, the absense or presence of explosive outbursts is more related to environment, and especially how people are behaving themselves towards the OCD individual. It is also controversial, but a Aspiesh environment is probably the best treatment available for OCD and ODD. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 13:47, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good stuff, Rdos ... you can probably build a paragraph around it. "A small, uncontrolled study showed X, but did not examine long-lasting effects, while a controlled study on Y found Z, but didn't consider A." And so on ... as long as it's worded to reflect the relative strengths and weaknesses of each study, I think it will do. I don't have time to read the full-text, but if you have it online and want to build a paragraph around it, you could quote the relevant parts for us. It sounds fairly comprehensive&#160;? (I hope it wasn't expensive: I've spent a pretty penny accessing articles I couldn't find in my local hospital library.) <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 14:37, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know what to make out of it. Many claim to improve IQs, but according to large controlled studies of black children adopted into white homes, gains in IQs are not lasting. Blacks still end up at the black average IQ. For this reason, I think any increase in IQ in ASDs is not believable, unless it is confirmed 20 or so years after the intervention. The article criticizes most of the studies for lacking control-group, not using screening instruments for ASDs (that's really something, when they claim to cure it), not recording problem behaviors (tantrums and so on). I think this paper would make a new proper treatment section. I haven't time to do it today though. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 15:04, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because it's a recent review, I like it. Because you have access to the full-text, not just the abstract, I like it even more. What concerns me is, who is the author and what kind of consensus does s/he enjoy? I don't recognize the name among leading autism researchers. What do others say on the topic? Can we be sure it's a through review? How strong is the peer review for that particular journal? I may have to go buy that Cohen PDD book myself&#160;:-) I wouldn't say necessarily a "new" treatment section, rather new information complementing what is typically said in the treatment realm; covering the basics, but then going into the "buts" ... <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 15:15, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One other thing to keep in mind: "treatment" or intervention is not aimed only at increasing IQ. It's also aimed at increasing daily functioning in various realsm (for example, behavior, social and academic). Since we're talking about AS here, increase in IQ would not necessarily be the main concern. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 15:17, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dr. Asperger's Own Work On A Connection To Celiac Disease?</span></h2>
<p>I had hoped to find something that would resolve my perplexity about the way in which Dr. Asperger's own work on a link to celiac disease has been either forgotten or rejected by later researchers on the subject. It seems odd that most discussions of a condition which received Asperger's name completely omit his thoughts on the role of dietary irritants. I understand that controversy remains around the model (as refined in recent years) of undigested opioid proteins from gluten and casein concentrating in and overstimulating areas of the brain that affect autism-spectrum behavior. But in light of work by Reichelt, Panksepp, and Cade, and in light of the dramatic improvements some families have achieved treating autism-spectrum disorders based on this model, and particularly in light of <i>Dr. Asperger's own thoughts on the topic</i>, it seems negligent to have no mention whatsoever of this angle -- even if only to explain why the expert mainstream has examined and rejected it (if that is what has happened).</p>
<p>Is there someone familiar with the writings of Asperger and these other researchers on the celiac/exorphin connection who has the expertise and perspective to integrate some mention of them into this article? 66.32.215.243 16:54, 19 July 2006 (UTC) Alden G</p>

<dd>As briefly as I can: I've seen claims that Dr. Asperger believed the symptoms we now call Asperger Syndrome were an expression of celiac disease. I don't know whether these claims (about his belief) are true but they're typically supported with a reference to one or more articles like this one: Asperger H., Die Psychopathologie des Coeliakikranken Kindes. Ann. Paediat. (1961) 197: 146-151. I haven't found any such article myself and I'm not sure I'd be able to read it adequately if I did. Obviously today we know more and we understand that there is no single, universal explanation for autism. But K Reichelt (University of Oslo) and RF Cade (University of Florida) have apparently succeeded in showing how the lack of certain critical enzymes (as in celiac disease) leads to accumulation in the bloodstream and the brain of specifically identified opioid molecules ("exorphins") that originate within the structure of casein and gluten. They have identified and made extensive use of tests for metabolites of these "exorphins" (in the urine for Reichelt and the blood for Cade), tests in which strong positives correlate strongly with cases of autism that resolve or improve on the GFCF diet. If I recall correctly, Cade has demonstrated the mechanism through rat models of autism and schizophrenia and has shown through necropsies that the exorphins in question do (surprisingly) accumulate in relevant areas of symptomatic brains, where they would presumably hyperstimulate receptors and result in excessive activation of that area's function. He also writes of one research group in which 100% of subjects tested positive and responded to a GFCF diet. I don't have the insight or qualifications to evaluate any of this myself but I'm always frustrated to find instances like this article or expert radio discussions which simply ignore the whole angle. If it's for real, it's very important; and if it's not, there are apparently many people who need to be enlightened as to why it's not (most of the GFCF community, I suppose). Since it was apparently Dr. Asperger himself who set in motion the whole dietary avenue of investigation, it would seem appropriate to summarize the expert consensus on his speculation and on the proper perspective in which to view Reichelt's and Cade's modern work. That's about all I can offer in a nutshell. Googling Reichelt (Kalle) or exploring celiac and GFCF sites should lead to a fair amount of material in the area and to people who are more familiar with it than I am. 69.15.111.19 23:02, 19 July 2006 (UTC) Alden G</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tweaking Keyne's lead</span></h2>
<p>I don't think it's "ugly", but here are some ideas:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Research regarding AS is split into two sub-groups: those that seek a "cause" and those that seek information regarding the syndrome's symptoms, which may then be possible to use as a diagnostic screen. While no research has been definitively shown as an individual factor, many have exposed base differences in things such as brain structure. To what end is currently unknown; however, research is on-going.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Saying it's split into two groups sounds ... "definitive" ... as in, needing a reference. I also don't agree with the sentence: there are many who seek a cause and ALSO seek information -- that is, who fit into both camps. RDos has uncovered a gazillion good sources above: maybe you can find some wording in one of them, so as not to have to figure it out on our own, which would require backing into a reference?

Wing’s writings were widely published and popularized. AS became a distinct disease and diagnosis in 1992, when it was included in the tenth published edition of the World Health Organization’s diagnostic manual, International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), and in 1995 it was added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), the American Psychiatric Association’s diagnostic reference book.</dd>

<p>It's definately 1994. The DSM-IV-TR (current version) was later published in 2000. No corrections were issued in between dates. --<a href="../../../k/e/y/User%7EKeyne_c410.html" title="User:Keyne">Keyne</a> 01:56, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, that puts us in a bind, since the stupid NINDS site says 95, and it's ref'd all over the place. We can add a clarification to the footnote, but what do we say&#160;? Where did the 95 come from? Are there different dates used on the DSM, as in, copyright vs. publishing date or something? <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 02:01, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I really have no idea. I daresay NINDS is incorrect on that fact, as so many other sources seem to indicate the pub date of 1994.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Additions to treatment</span></h2>
<p>I think I'm satistified with the current treatment section. I cited most of it directly from the full-text study I found above. The only "novel" interpretation I did is that self-injury, aggression, noncompliance, stereotypies, or spontaneous language is not core-autistic symptoms. The article mentioned these as primary targets, however it did not classify them as non-core autistic symptoms, but rather wanted to view them as symptoms of autism. However, none of these are part of the DSM definition, so I think my addition here is valid. Feel free to differ. Indeed, the article were so critical that it is probably not even necessary to refer to Dawson. It seems like curing autism to some people is the same as curing the above PTS symptoms! --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 07:56, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is currently quite a big discrepancy between what Sandy's original link says are usually treated in behavioral programs, and what the review study says are usually treated. I think this discrepancy largely is because NIHs article describes non-cure ABA, while the PublMed review deals with "cures". There is quite a bit of inconsistence here. Of course, in reality, the "cure"-programs only seems to work on symptoms from a bad environment while the non-cure program actually could make a difference&#160;;-) --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 12:21, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why separate research into causes from other research?</span></h2>
<p>I don't see the rational for this. Many of the things described in other research has implications for causes, like the differences in brain regions. It also looks rather ugly, IMO. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 08:11, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It wouldn't be so bad if the section was fleshed out a bit more than it is currently. I'd get to work on that, but interpreting and rephrasing direct medical opinion isn't precisely one of my strong suits.&#160;:)</dd>

<dd>If we're in a bind, merging the section back together wouldn't be bad, especially now that there is less argument over NPOV and whatnot, but that shouldn't take place over supplying more information than current. --<a href="../../../k/e/y/User%7EKeyne_c410.html" title="User:Keyne">Keyne</a> 12:57, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
