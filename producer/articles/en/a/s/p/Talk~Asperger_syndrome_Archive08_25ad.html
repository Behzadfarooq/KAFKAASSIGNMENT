<p>Hello, I know you do not trust anonymous editors... But I have Asperger's so I know... And this is what my psychiatrist told me...</p>
<p>Think it'd be appropriate for a talk page archive now? I don't think we've touched some of the top half in a pretty long while now and the page is just getting enormous&#160;:3 --<a href="../../../k/e/y/User%7EKeyne_c410.html" title="User:Keyne">Keyne</a> 13:00, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was ready to suggest that sometime yesterday, but Zeraeph has initiated some admin action against me, and has referred to this talk page as reference for his claims of my "abuse". If you don't mind, I'm afraid we'll need to leave it up for a few days, until admins can comment on his allegations of my abusive behavior.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Stuff that still needs addressing</span></h2>
<p>Just a section to add/strike things off as we complete the focus.</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Lead needs additional information.</i> Second paragraph summarizing history/etc is only two sentences. (min three for good prose)</li>
<li>"Research" section needs a lead-in that will hopefully <i>better</i> address the research fork, <b>or</b> it needs to be satisfactorily merged into one section;
<ol>
<li>"Research into causes" needs <strike>a lot of</strike> more work. We need more information about the listed research;</li>
<li>"Other research" needs <strike>a lot of</strike> more work. We need more information about the listed research;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>"Comorbidities" could probably use some fleshing out;</li>
<li>"See also" should appreciate slightly better NPOV to reflect the diversity of the subject;</li>
<li><s>Should probably have a few more "best case" sourcings for some of the non-clinical subsections;</s></li>
<li>Is NPOV still an issue in other sections, and if so, we need ideas to address it;</li>
<li><s>General wikilinking still needed;</s> Causes and Research need to be wikilinked once they settle in;</li>
<li><s>References need cleaning up to be a tad more uniform; and,</s></li>
<li>Should probably have one or two more "fine tooth combs" passed through the article to scour for inappropriate grammar, consistency, and out of place junk.</li>

<dd>Glad you got to those: unless you think I should move more quickly, I was still planning to wait until the text is further along before Wiki-linking. I'm also hoping that editor I messaged will run the bot first. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 20:15, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm of the mind that "sooner" is better than "later" as it directly affects the readership of the article, but I'm not the one offering to wikilink.&#160;:) Basically, "whenever"; but, much still needs to get done--may as well cross something off the list(s), y'know? We can always adjust new additions fairly easily.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Keyne, I think I'm done Wikilinking: I've seen lots of criticism lately on <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a> when articles are *overlinked* with links to common terms.

<li>So I don't forget where I put the automated bot peer review: <a href="../../../a/s/p/Talk%7EAsperger_syndrome_peer_review_373d.html" title="Talk:Asperger syndrome/peer review">Talk:Asperger syndrome/peer review</a></li>
<li>Asked someone to run a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Epolk#Bot_cleanup" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Epolk#Bot_cleanup" rel="nofollow">bot cleanup.</a></li>
<li>And, I added the ref about above-average intelligence to the lead, leaving the other ref Zeraeph mentioned. RDos, I fixed some of your refs in Causes and Treatment (there were some conflicting dates), so please check that I didn't mess them up. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 17:43, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Rdos questioned the reasoning behind the splitting of the "Research" section in the archives. As near as I can figure at this point, it is mostly to serve as a minor distinction so that "Causes" does not "pollute" the other discoveries being made. If it's objectable, we can always mash them back together, but I think it'll work better if we simply flesh them out as they are. --<a href="../../../k/e/y/User%7EKeyne_c410.html" title="User:Keyne">Keyne</a> 18:32, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Rewording of treatment section</span></h2>
<p>I think these were not appropriate. It was the simple studies that had been somewhat effective in their attempts to treat comorbidities. The "packet plans", which intended to cure the syndrome have not been evaluated properly (the ASAT CART was not done on groups), side-effects had not been evaluated and so on. I think the new version is not acceptable at all. It is misleading and misqouted. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 20:36, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure who reworded them, but I couldn't decipher what was being said there this morning. I'm still not able to decipher it:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Research</span></h2>
<p>The prose is still problematic: no matter how many times I read this, I'm not sure if it's saying anything:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Some research is to seek information about symptoms to aid in the diagnostic process. Other research is to identify a cause, although much of this research is still done on isolated symptoms. Many studies have exposed base differences in areas such as brain structure. To what end is currently unknown; however, research is on-going.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The idea to merge the two Research sections may solve this and eliminate the need to try to figure out what to say in a lead. Some of the sections and sentences are very stubby: if someone else doesn't get to them first, I'll work on them while I'm wikilinking. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 21:55, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, Causes is still not comprehensive. I'm bringing forward the old summary from Archives, as it provides a starting place:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Twin and family studies suggest there is a genetic vulnerability to AS and the related disorders, but a specific gene for AS has not been identified. Multiple genes are thought to be responsible for causing AS, since the symptoms and the severity of symptoms vary widely among individuals.<sup id="_ref-NINDS_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NINDS" title="">[4]</a></sup> Current research points to structural abnormalities in the brain as a cause of AS.<sup id="_ref-NINDS_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NINDS" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[5]</a></sup> These abnormalities impact neural circuits that control thought and behavior. Researchers think that gene/environment interactions cause some genes to turn on or turn off, or turn on too much or too little in the wrong places, and this interferes with the normal migration and wiring of embryonic brain cells during early development.<sup id="_ref-NINDS_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NINDS" title="">[4]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Researchers at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California_04ab.html" title="University of California">University of California</a> have proposed that AS stems from abnormal changes that happen during critical stages of fetal development. Defects in the genes that control and regulate normal brain growth create abnormal growth patterns; these may cause overgrowth in some brain structures and reduced growth or excessive cell loss in others.<sup id="_ref-NINDS_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NINDS" title="">[4]</a></sup> Using advanced <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain_imaging.html" title="Brain imaging">brain imaging</a> techniques, scientists have revealed structural and functional differences in specific brain regions between the brains of normal versus AS children. One study found a lack of activity in the frontal lobe of AS children when asked to respond to tasks that required them to use their judgment. Another found differences in brain activity when children were asked to respond to facial expressions. Other methods of investigating brain function have revealed abnormal levels of particular proteins in the brains of adults with AS, which correlate with obsessive and repetitive behaviors.<sup id="_ref-NINDS_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NINDS" title="">[4]</a></sup> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 22:22, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The lead as I wrote it was mostly a placeholder, so yes, it really doesn't say much, currently (better than totally blank space, however!); it needs to be rewritten, as noted in comments. As for the causes section, I did my best to syphon what I could from the old version above, but not all of that was research into "causes" so [most] mismatched ones were inserted into "other research" (obviously pending possible future re-merge).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Either way, the entire research section needs to be expanded quite a bit. As it stands, it's almost exclusively a bunch of one-line blurbs that tosses unsuspecting readers into links, which, for all they can tell, <i>might</i> be related to AS research. I'll fiddle it some more, but new content isn't really my forte. --<a href="../../../k/e/y/User%7EKeyne_c410.html" title="User:Keyne">Keyne</a> 22:41, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a name="Inconsistency_in_characteristics" id="Inconsistency_in_characteristics"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Inconsistency in characteristics</span></h2>
<p>The article currently has three different "lists" of defining characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>AS is characterized by:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Limited interests</dd>
<dd>Repetitive behaviors or rituals;</dd>
<dd>Peculiarities in speech and language;</dd>
<dd>Socially and emotionally inappropriate behavior</dd>
<dd>Problems with non-verbal communication; and,</dd>
<dd>Clumsy and uncoordinated motor movements.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The most common and important characteristics of AS can be divided into several broad categories:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>social impairments,</dd>
<dd>narrow but intense interests, and</dd>
<dd>peculiarities of speech and language.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The Table of Contents</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Social impairments</dd>
<dd>Narrow, intense interests</dd>
<dd>Speech and language peculiarities</dd>
<dd>Writing peculiarities</dd>
<dd>Emotional peculiarities</dd>
<dd>Other peculiarities</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is confusing to the reader: readability would be improved by finding a way to merge and standardize the text and lists into one list. For example, when the reader encounters early on that AS is characterized by "Repetitive behaviors and rituals", where does the reader go in the Table of Contents to find information about that characteristic? <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 21:55, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Another thing in the same section:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The most common and important characteristics of AS can be divided into several broad categories: <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_skills.html" title="Social skills">social impairments</a>, narrow but intense interests, and peculiarities of speech and language. Other features are commonly associated with this syndrome, but are not always regarded as necessary for diagnosis.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The reference to "other features" is never explained, so the reader doesn't know why it is mentioned. What other features? <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 23:01, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Other features" presumably accounts for the emotional, writing, and "other peq" categories. They're basically "shiny" things, but they are not immediately common to the all-encompassed AS group definition. They could feasibly be knocked down under one roof, but we should try to keep the more important "other features" intact, as some of the information is really quite important. --<a href="../../../k/e/y/User%7EKeyne_c410.html" title="User:Keyne">Keyne</a> 02:36, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You're great at re-organizing and moving (although it's going to whack my wikis), so I concur what whatever everyone else concurs with. I'm not concerned about where everything ends up, just that we try for more clarity for the reader, minimizing the number of different ways of viewing the list of characteristics. Is there any way to lose the word "peculiarities"?

Emotional differences highlights some commonly misunderstood portions of AS' social difficulties and be kept to the fullest reasonable extent, but it could conceivably be merged under a larger subgroup with the current "speach and language" subsection (along with minor influence from writing for information's sake--or, that could go under the "other peq." section..). --<a href="../../../k/e/y/User%7EKeyne_c410.html" title="User:Keyne">Keyne</a> 02:32, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Two small changes</span></h2>
<p>It really isn't appropriate to toss out the phrase "Asperger's Disorder" as though it were a known and universal synonym for AS when referring to the DSM classification. Especially when you also say "This section mainly reflects the views of Attwood, Gillberg, and Wing on the most important characteristics of AS; the DSM-IV criteria represent a slightly different view.".</p>
<p>The DSM equivalents of a lot of well know conditions are not exact synonyms, or undisputed, and when they are it is best to use words like "equivalent" or "corelates" to be exact. In the intro it is better to specify the name change if only for the benefit of anyone who wishes to do a plain text search relating specifically to DSM criteria.</p>
<p>It really isn't appropriate to state that Hans Asperger specified AS as a "personality disorder". In some countries and contexts this error might even be considered pejorative, let alone POV. Under UK and Irish judicial and some psychiatric definitions "personality disorder" is used as a synonym for "criminal psychopath", "psychopathy" in German, only meant "mental disorder" (quite different in definition to a "personality disorder", as far as I am aware there was not any German equivalent for "personality disorder" in 1944), so it is vital to be very careful of the language used around Herr Doktor Asperger...best not to advance any distortion in translation unecessarily. "Disorder" (without misleading wikilinking to "personality disorder") would also be ok, but "condition" seems, of it's nature, to be far more neutral. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 12:30, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think remarks like this "A five-year-old child with this condition may regularly speak in language that could easily have come from a university textbook" should be taken out, as they may lead an lesser educated reader in a dead corner. A university textbook is something that everyone can image just as well as a 5 year old....neurological development forbids something for this to happen. Even a student won`t speak university textbook style. Speaking implies an active process of understanding. This may be meantioned in the paper but should still not be included in wikipedia.

<p>Wikipedia only allows so many links. Without including the directories, we'd be way over that limit, since there are so many sites out there dedicated to AS. I believe what we agreed upon was to link to the directories, and whatever relevant links are NOT listed in those directories can also be listed. We used to only link to just one directory, but that was deemed to biased, so we decided to include as many directories as possible (currently only 4 we've found), and include any good links not in any of those directories. As I said, including the directories limits the inclusion of links in the article since there are so many, more than Wikipedia's recommended limit of 15. We shouldn't make an exception to ANY site in the directories. --<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubhagan_33c0.html" title="User:Dubhagan"><font color="black"><b>Dubh</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/u/b/User_talk%7EDubhagan_8d04.html" title="User talk:Dubhagan"><font color="green"><b>agan</b></font></a> 19:05, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Two simple answers (AFAIK): <a href="../../../w/r/o/Wrong_Planet_5f12.html" title="Wrong Planet">Wrong Planet</a> has its own entry in Wiki.

At one point, I had made a new template, which included *every* See also in the AS and autism articles, so that we'd have them all in one place. Someone objected (can't remember who), so I speedy deleted it. I could re-do it if wanted. But, Wrong Planet has its own link; hence, doesn't need an external link. Links which are already included in Notes, References, or See also don't need to be in External links (I believe the idea being to help conform with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>). On the DMOZ (Wiki missing), AFAIK, DMOZ requires submissions from webmasters. Who is the "webmaster" of a Wiki entry&#160;?

<dd>Fortunately, Wikipedia articles evolve over time, so while what you say is technically true, it is also incorrect, as the evolution of the article has rather directly been the work of the people from the past few months. When others "come back" from wherever, they're obviously quite free to add and help, but until that time it is pretty strong speculation as to their intentions. Let's just see what happens (and by all means, <i>suggest</i> things to work on--and work on them!), and the article <i>will</i> continue to improve, so long as we don't allow OR creep to come back.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Part 1</span></h3>
<p>Is it just a murmur on blogs or may Aspergers and asexuality or at least a milder sex drive have some correlation? An Aspergers search on <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Southern_California_4e4b.html" title="University of Southern California">USC</a>'s home page brings up a science fair project that says the relationship deserves further study: <a href="http://www.usc.edu/CSSF/History/2005/Projects/S0317.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usc.edu/CSSF/History/2005/Projects/S0317.pdf" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. Even if some correlation did exist, that would not be to make a sweeping generalization, but sexual feelings do come from the brain. I think most just think or love differently, maybe using different parts of the brain or are attracted by different things from most. Possibly some Aspies get deterred and lose at least some sexual interest because of social failures and/or alienation. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinutiaman_4942.html" title="User:Minutiaman">Minutiaman</a> 04:34, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>It is common for aspies to have at least a different sexuality. Some low-functioning aspies do not appear to have the capacity for the emotional attachments that tend to lead to relationships involving sex, even with other aspies. Most do not have the social capacity to function in a relationship with a neurotypical, but may function well with a compatible aspie. Many do not take an emotional interest in neurotypicals at all, due to personality-wise and cognitive differences. Few neurotypicals are able or willing to make adjustments on their end, and many aspies are incapable of doing so, at least without diminishing their returns on the relationship below break-even.</dd>
<dd>It is fairly common to have reduced or increased sexual appetites, and there appears to be a significantly above-average inclination towards atypical sexual activities. For example, BDSM has attracted more than one aspie in my social circles, based on the more mentally oriented nature of the activities (contrasted with the more physical nature of regular sexual activities).</dd>
<dd>However, generalisations will miss many individuals. And it should be pointed out that many aspies have a profound capacity for empathy and love, but limited capacity for expressing this in a manner that a neurotypical will understand.</dd>
<dd>I'll briefly state, although this is the wrong section, that this article reflects external analysis and a parental viewpoint to a much greater extent than it reflects the aspies themselves. I'd go so far as to say that this article is POV, but I don't have the time to fix everything that's wrong with it. Having a fiancè and several friends who are aspies, I cannot believe this article is considered "one of the best" produced by the wikipedians. <a href="../../../z/u/i/User%7EZuiram_fd95.html" title="User:Zuiram">Zuiram</a> 08:48, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are definately sexual differences...sometimes asexuality...sometimes gender ambiguity...sometimes other things, for some reason the article has avoided that. Also, in some cases an aversion to children and reproduction that hasn't been mentioned either. These are REALLY important features of AS. Certainly the lack of reproductive drive and asexuality could be related to a similar neurological difference. On the other hand, as far as I can tell a lot of Aspies are unable to get into relationships suitable to losing ones virginity, and, as they say, "what you have never had, you never miss", or at any rate adapt to living without. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 08:44, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anyone not qualified to read and understand the full text of the PubMed and Cochrane articles, should refrain from contributing anything to this article, save for such things as reviews of organizations and other meta-information. What little is known of the etiology of AS, and of the physiological and neurological aberrations associated with it, is frequently fairly complex, and some of it is misrepresented in this article. And, of course, small-population studies are not viable in general, unless extensive information about the participants is available, as there are many subpopulations within the autistic spectrum, and extensive misdiagnosis between the two conditions.</dd>
<dd>For example, the statement that aspies and autistics are interchangeable for purposes of treatment is blatantly false. For one thing, with regards to non-medicinal treatment, autistics tend to be more physical, whereas aspies tend to be more mental. Grouping the two together may seem okay from a parent or "therapist" point of view (fighting etc. will generally not break out), but neither camp is ideally served by this. There are several courses of action that are recommended with autism that will be very detrimental to an aspie, and vice-versa.</dd>
<dd>Medicinal treatment options are to some extent covered in the literature, but there is a lot of shoddy work out there as well. For instance, independant (non-drug-company-sponsored) studies tend to contraindicate SSRIs (aspies frequently (20-40% IIRC) have excessive serotonin levels) and TCAs. Note also that clinical trials indicate a vastly different response profile to several drugs (which is little known, as PDD's exclude you from participation in clinical trials), as well as entirely different placebo thresholds (cf. risperdal trials). An interesting example of this is that aspies are at heightened risk from neuroleptics, something not commonly known (although it is standard practice to teach this in some public medical wards).</dd>
<dd>Much of the real information is going to take some time before it becomes sufficiently "verifiable" ("party line") for Wikipedia, meanwhile being only correct. <a href="../../../z/u/i/User%7EZuiram_fd95.html" title="User:Zuiram">Zuiram</a> 08:48, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Obviously, there is some variance, as Dubhagan pointed out, and Zaraeph mentions some of the range. Personally, I am approaching 20 and may be at a turing point in my sexual experiences, and have been making significant progress for the past frew years. I do have some fear of touching, but they may in part be related to something disturbing that happened to a loved one and the negative stimuli I have gotten back sometimes from misreads and (if I may say so) a politically correct, third-wave feminism-affected society (I live in L.A.) that favors women when in doubt. So naturally my fear of rejection and some maybe irrational fears are magnified, but the teenage years are typically rough, if rewarding too, and I have not experimented enough to reap as many of the benefits. But I definitely have sexual interest, and staunchly disapprove of the "never had, never miss" attitude said above. Perhaps my Asperger's is on the less severe side of the spectrum, and I may be more willing than some to change, even if fighitng and kicking; I cannot thank some of my neurotypical friends enough and I may be in a position to "assimilate" (while staying true to self) and play the social games with the rules better than many Aspies. I did score a 41 when I took the AQ test yesterday though. I thank Sandy for that research, even if its results are not uplifting (but commonly reported): Socially and sexually, Aspies are more likely to be depressed, anxious, and unsuccessful. Higher rates of suicide have resulted. But it is even worse for Auties. Not very heartening for me, but perhaps it should put my stuggles, failures, and successes in better perspective. Almost since <a href="../../../u/c/l/UCLA_052f.html" title="UCLA">UCLA</a> diagnosed me in late 1999, <i><a href="../../../f/l/o/Flowers_for_Algernon_1f08.html" title="Flowers for Algernon">Flowers for Algernon</a></i> has been my favorite story for the cognizance/education v. ignorance battle that concluded ignorance may indeed be bliss (hasn't stopped me from learning more about the condition and the world). What do you think of the Aspergers social guides recommended above for sexual situations and/or just social ones? Perhaps I speak for other Aspies when I say self-help may not go as far in the sexual aspect. And sorry for making this so personal, but the information here would I hope not just help me but other Aspies and people reading this, and may bring up some things to add to the article (this topic <i>REALLY</i> should be in it. It mentions greater realtionship problems, but does not talk about <i>sexuality</i> and internal battles raging in Aspies. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinutiaman_4942.html" title="User:Minutiaman">Minutiaman</a> 18:56, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We actually had a talk about this subject about a month or so ago.

<dd>Four things: 1. Dubhagan, can you be more specific about that conversation (the name or closer to when)? If not, it is probably easy enough to locate. 2. Zeraeph, did that last compliment refer to what <i>I</i> said? If so, thank you. 3. I was thinking that this article may not deserve featured article status, not to the fault of its editors, but to disagreements in the medical, psychiatric, and whatever other communities over this fairly recent but important subject. It is glaringly missing some elements that would make it sufficiently comprehensive, but as Dubhagan and disagreements over where to find related information suggest, this article may best reflect the unresolved nature of the topic by adressing what it can (which it does well) and earning near-featured article status (or whatever it is called). 4. Beyond that they are more likely to struggle with relationships, to what extent is the Aspie sexual life spectrum known - including roughly about what percentage (maybe not that precise, but vague words like "many" mean little) of Aspies are lifelong virgins, or get married (I doubt anyone has documented the health of those marriages)? "Many" obviously fall between, but those were examples and at opposite ends of the spectrum. <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_40-Year-Old_Virgin_b1fe.html" title="The 40-Year-Old Virgin">The 40-Year-Old Virgin</a></i> probably disproportionately describes a minority of Aspies' sexual lives, or something similar, as well. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinutiaman_4942.html" title="User:Minutiaman">Minutiaman</a> 21:04, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It wouldn't be impossible to add in asexuality leanings and whatnot to the article, but they really could perhaps only exist in the non-medical sections, due to lack of significant study to that effect. Regarding Minutiaman's #3 above, of course it can be FA-worthy, even if the field(s) studying it are not complete in its description. It's all about putting together the best possible article that highlights the current and past events (with possible future directions). That the scientific community is lagging behind in certain aspects is worth possibly <i>mentioning</i> (which is why this is not an explicitly medicalized article), but does not prohibit FA status. --<a href="../../../k/e/y/User%7EKeyne_c410.html" title="User:Keyne">Keyne</a> 13:07, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I just wanted to thank you guys for this whole article. This part on sexuality, I don't know how it would be finished, but I urge you to include it in the main article. "Social" of course means "sexual" in part. You can only find a non-professional sex partner in a social circumstance, period. I tell you for the life of me I can't, and I can't understand the sex codes as well, not even the "sex partner" concept apart from the love interest. I'm a very well resolved woman who likes men, but it's just not as simple as that. It all seems to me like a whole different world and nobody seems to understand my situation. The article describes A.S. as best as I could imagine it, and the sexual part is really important to that.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Aspie-Aspie social and sexual relationships</span></h2>
<p>Is there general agreement to whether Aspies benefit from befriend or dating or marrying another Aspie as opposed to a neurotypical person? I see many blessings in Aspergers but personally have had more problematic social relationships with Aspies or near-Aspies than others; I do not like being reminded of the disorder's problems or talking about related issues with them too much. One person would not stop badgering me about not conforming enough in his mind and the other admired me and looked to learn from me a bit too intensely and annoyingly. Obviously in general non-Aspies are more at ease communicating, but I of course would expect Aspies can connect better with people they have much in common with, like Aspies. I imagine Aspies can ease into dating more with another Aspie, but I don't know the effect on the success of the relationship. But problems may remain at the relationship's stability and productivity. Is my question more philsophical than legitimate? My guess is it's a matter of personal preference, but anything else? <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinutiaman_4942.html" title="User:Minutiaman">Minutiaman</a> 04:45, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Think it is a BIG mistake to think of Aspies as a kind of "counter culture" or "subspecies" who relate best to each other, share a common language etc. Aspies relate and can identify with each other's DIFFICULTIES better, and support each other through that, but, in their spare time, they are human beings with diverse and often vastly different belief systems, tastes, interests, personalities. I suspect that, just like anyone else, Aspies benefit from befriending those people they most like and share common interests with an marrying people they love, who love them back, whoever they may be. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 08:51, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What utter rubbish. As an AS "patient", I find this whole "Aspie" "ND pride" stuff utter nonsense. It's yet another pointless exercise in labelling that ignores who people actually are. People with AS vary as much as people without. We're just wired slightly differently. I'd have absolutely no problem dating a non-AS person, although some aren't tolerant of the condition, and I'd do so much more willingly than with someone like Eiyuu Kou, or anyone with AS spouting such separatist/supremacist nonsense. Yes we have problems with relationships that people without AS don't have, but that doesn't mean that we're any more drawn to each other.--Graius 22:57, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am 14 years old and have aspergers. although yes i do find it hard to make friends and yes it will always be hard but i do have a few friends and would consider myself happy. only one of my friends knows i have it and we are just as close. mind you, in primary school the whole year were friends and nobody was excluded, i suppose because my best friend made sure nobody was. when i went to secondary school it changed, us people will aspergers dont like changen and it was hard but i got through it and slowly began to make some friends. i made myself brave to talk to a couple of girls and now we are best friends. at first i wanted to be in the popular crowd but i dont now, there all horrible and will make your life a misery if your in any way diffirent or not 'cool' and im happy with the friends ive got. ive even had a few boyfriends one even for 6 months, so i havent lost hope at all. i love writing stories and i like shopping like other girls and going out. in fact theres no such thing as being normal anyway! My bully, whos bullied me since the middle of year 7 has even had loads of people hating her now and shes mean to everyone now even people who were her friends so she obviously finds it hard keeping them and being nice to them. I was quite happy with this article although i dont excell at maths or music..they are my weakest points.. and you said we didnt have an imagination.. but its not true..as i do!!! i just love making up stories! and imaginating things.. but sometimes in subjects i hate like maths and science i just daydream..oopps but i try not to do that now...i would say i am good at english and history home econoimics (cooking)and drama and rubbish at maths and science and art and ict and music. i want to be a writer when i grow up or actrist, or cook/open restuarant,digging up artifacts would be really interesting too, so ive got lots of options. You say people with AS get paid less than normal people. well i dont really think thats fair, as people try hard, we really do and people should understand that more. paying us less isnt fair at all as this can make us very angry indeed... Anyway i hope i havent bored you to badly. Bye. and thankyou.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Addressing Aspergers: Attitude, Treatment, and Accomodations</span></h2>
<p>This article, especially to be featured, should expand on attitude and treatment and include accomodations beyond the autistic rights movement; I felt like the movement's lobbyists or sympathizers get their hands on the article, given its imbalance of the movement's philosophy versus reasonable accomdations. It needs a section before "Shift in View" that mentions things like self-improvement, assimilation, and accomodatins as things Aspies should undergo or have. For example, what about Individualzied Education Programs, testing accomodations (I have one for my brain's slower processing of some information and possibly my natural? tendency to answer beyond merely satisfying the questions), more on therapy (the article delegates too many of the details of some things to concentrated autism articles, but AS's differences I think warrant more mention here; ideally one day AS will have its own concentrated Wikipedia articles - or does it already?), and job accomodations. I am pretty sure there is a debate as to whether people with Asperger's, certainly austism, qualify under the <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_363b.html" title="Americans with Disabilities Act">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> or whatever else in the U.S. The article's exceptionally long talk pages reveal so many issues yet to be addressed, but again this is largely because there is not enough agreement over them; certainly the article has attracted dedicated editors. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinutiaman_4942.html" title="User:Minutiaman">Minutiaman</a> 01:46, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Aspergers internationally</span></h2>
<p>The article should also mention Aspergers in different countries around the world, such as differences in Western and Eastern socities. Perhaps Aspies in one country benefit from a national law in one country but not another, and of course attitudes vary. I do not know enough about these things and would not want to put what little I might know about one country but leave an imbalance. In fact I don't know enough to even make generalizations or statements I'm confident would be suitable for an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinutiaman_4942.html" title="User:Minutiaman">Minutiaman</a> 01:53, 31 July 2006 (UTC) (sorry for forgetting to tag)</p>

<dd>Definately long overdue to discuss all the issues you raised and incorporate them into the article. I think it's a subject that could eventually branch off into many articles myself. The trouble at present is that the whole article has been "spun" at a clinical perspective that is incomplete, unstable and hotly disputed at the expense of presenting the whole picture. As a result, much of the reality of AS is barely mentioned.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the international aspect, I think if the situation in one or two countries was presented, over time, other editors would be certain to drop by and add other countries. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 05:23, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Z, you surely know that such can be addressed properly, however, they must also be properly sourced. That said, I'm not sure it woudl be such a good idea to start including a breadth of treatment/temperment from various countries across the world. If we started doing such, a lovely slippery slope would begin. Would it not be better to explain the variety of handling, actions/reactions, and acceptance relations, rather than individualized passages on various countries? --<a href="../../../k/e/y/User%7EKeyne_c410.html" title="User:Keyne">Keyne</a> 13:12, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To be honest K, I agree with what you say except that I think it would be valid, useful and quite a lot of fun (remember THAT from the old days?) and interest to start adding any special approaches, attitudes or resources worldwide, and encourage passing editors to do the same...as soon as it got over a few paragraphs it could become a daughter article, and a very worthwhile one too.</dd>

<dd>I'd agree, but I would have to question just how encyclopedic those things would be. I know it's something useful, but documenting detailed treatment/temperment of the various sociopolitical climates isn't something that would typically be done for something this relatively simple. If anything, this sort of approach would be better off in a larger sense for the whole of the ASDs (with appropriate contrasts for the spectrum slider) rather than encompassed in one branch, so to speak. Perhaps in something like the Autistic Culture page (with lesser overtones in primary articles like AS and Aut)? --<a href="../../../k/e/y/User%7EKeyne_c410.html" title="User:Keyne">Keyne</a> 19:51, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now THAT would depend on how big it gets, on which grounds I would be more inclined to try it out as AS specific for a few month after it outgrows the nest. Also while International responses to AS may sometimes be REACTIONS to Autistic culture, they sure as heck aren't any PART of it, if you think about it. As long as information is valid and NPOV surely the more the better? The trick to simplfying, is in how to arrange the tree of heirarchies. That's why I would like to see this article evolve towards being a summary of all aspects of AS with each aspect having it's own article. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 20:14, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see why a complete Aspergers article wouldn't have all three. The gay rights movement, for example, mentions all those things, and even if Aspergers movements are not as widespread or big, over time the information would look good here and start filling in. Aspergers has different waves of thought and at least one well-recognized and named "movement"; and from many things I've read, most on the Austism Spectrum Disorders (1 in 166 in the U.S., I think) are relatively higher or high-functioning, including Aspergers, so the condition may not be quite uncommon. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinutiaman_4942.html" title="User:Minutiaman">Minutiaman</a> 16:03, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I speak for myself that the topic is sensitive to me and it would be in the interest of Aspies and those interested in Aspergers to have as accurate and comprehensive information available to them as possible on the free encyclopedia. It is a topic with with questions left unanswered (too much funding goes to "curing" it and "disorders" like it instead of researching how to cope with it!) and obviously I have not been posting these questions here lately for purely unselfish reasons. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinutiaman_4942.html" title="User:Minutiaman">Minutiaman</a> 18:31, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">How Aspies respond to social anxiety</span></h2>
<p>Because of internal changes in the teenage brain and external environmental change, teenagers may try to relieve stress or conform with alcohol and other drugs, sex, and violence, but what about Aspies? What is their range? It may vary just as much, but I imagine the distribution is different. I would think as a group they (or should I say <i>we</i>) stigmatize those activities but instead internalize our problems and get depressed. Of course, many people in both groups may not have major coping problems, but how the desperate or devastated respond may be more telling. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinutiaman_4942.html" title="User:Minutiaman">Minutiaman</a> 17:08, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you can come up with some studies on this, by all means put something in. Otherwise, anecdotal evidence tends to point towards similar trends in behavior amongst NTs and Aspies, as they're both part of that larger spectrum known as "humans." I beleive most of your question is addressed (regarding primary differences) in the article, however. --<a href="../../../k/e/y/User%7EKeyne_c410.html" title="User:Keyne">Keyne</a> 17:31, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My thought about this is that drinking, drugs, sex and violence are often about social conformity, rather than about personal stress. At least, that's the way that kids get into these things in the first place. Teenagers go out and get drunk together.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Kids with AS are more likely to be loners, whether from choice or not. Other kids are less likely to invite them to go out and get drunk, to go out and pick up members of the opposite sex, to go and bash some rival gang or even to join the group that has a smoke behind the school sports shed.</p>
<p>Kids with AS tend to take rules very literally, and to take meaningful information very seriously. So, if articles have been published to say (for example) that 80% of deaths of young people on the road are connected with alcohol, then your average Aspie would think that anyone who drinks and drives is a fool. And they tend to say "How can anyone be that stupid?" with little or no comprehension that social pressure makes people do stupid things. Social pressure is less significant than common sense. Drinking and driving is stupid, and we Aspies don't do it. I think this applies to other things as well. Aspies are the sort of people who use condoms, bicycle helmets and shopping baskets because of HIV, brain damage and the environment. I know this is all a broad generalisation, but I think perhaps it's easier for NTs to turn to drink and drugs when things get bad, because they get more experience of it socially, when things are not bad.</p>

<p>While I do not doubt the fact that this is indeed what conservative estimates indicate, I think that the conclusion that AS is "more rare than autistic disorder itself" is entirely erroneous. The fact that it is rarely diagnosed does not make it more rare.</p>
<p>Indeed, commonsense would indicate otherwise.</p>
<p>If we accept autism as a spectrum disorder, then the spectrum goes from the least autistic to the most autistic.</p>
<ul>
<li>Those people who are only a little autistic are regarded as a "little odd sometimes" and escape diagnosis.</li>
<li>Those people who are a little more autistic and keep to themselves, study hard, get good grades and become accademics or computer programmers or research assistants escape diagnosis.</li>
<li>Those people who are a little more anti-social and have loud conversations about eletrical insulators with people in the street, sing too loudly in church, forget to use deoderant and take out their dentures on the public bus are regarded as real jerks but generally escape diagnosis.</li>
<li>A nine-year old who listens to "Question time" on the parliamentary broadcasts, ALWAYS carries an umbrella (in Sydney?!), begins every second sentence with "Excuse me, but I think you'll find that you're mistaken..." and cannot pass an automatic cash machine without screaming "Autobank! Autobank! Autobank! Autobank!"...... is not diagnosed as having AS. The diagnosis is "He has a tendency to internalise things! It's the result of being in a single-parent family!</li>

<p>If a child is seriously disruptive in class, then maybe you get the diagnosis, the funding, the teacher's aide, the special program. But not unless.</p>
<p>It is my opinion that that perhaps half my family is on the autistic spectrum. One of us has been diagnosed and has had some appropriate help at school. The rest of us just make the best of things, often coping with depression, social rejection and so on.</p>
<p>The point that I am trying to make here is that there are thousands of people out there who are undiagnosed Aspies.</p>
<p>Now that I know what I know, I look around at the people that I meet and I understand their personal condition so much better. That man who is so crazy about trains, that totally excessive marine biologist, that odd person who analyses tombstone inscriptions, that other person who has twenty photograph albums full of pictures of high-voltage transmission towers, that man who obsessivley collects valves from old radios. All these people are regarded by others as odd, weird, eccentric and so on. They are all adult. None of them has a diagnosis of Apergers, but several are regularly treated for depression.</p>
<p>It must be obvious to anyone who thinks about it, that a mild to medium form of autism is going to bbe far mmore prevalent than the full-on, withdrawn, non-communicative, socially-crippling disorder. The difference is that full-on Autism is comparatively easy to diagnose.</p>
<p>And doctors, until very recently have said "Oh, no, Mother! Your child doesn't have autism! Autism is a SERIOUS condition! You can't have mild autism. There is no such thing!"</p>
<p>Then there are the loving parents of the kid who never shuts up, never sits still, flaps continually, and does an almost non-stop impersonation of Stephen Hawking. They say "There's NOTHING wrong with our little Johnnie."</p>
<p>But kids with Aspergers are very good at recognising other Aspies. You can't tell them that Johnnie hasn't got AS because they know he has.</p>
<p>I overheard the following interraction in a cafe.</p>
<p>Girl, at 120 decibles to a total stranger "That's beer you're drinking! It says beer on the label! Kids aren't allowed to drink beer! Why are you drinking beer?"</p>
<p>Boy, at 120 decibels "Ha! Ha! I know what's the matter with you! You've got Asparagus Syndrome! That's what's the matter with you! Ha! Ha!"</p>
<p>Girl at 200 decibles "Mum! How can that boy be so dumb? He said it's Asparagus Sydrome!"</p>
<p>Boy at 200 decibles "Mum! How come that girl with Asparagus Syndrome says my ginger beer is beer?"</p>

<dd>At the rate it is diagnosed, it is more rare than autistic disorder. The phenotype might not be more rare, because AS is probably missed more often, but the article refers to diagnosed cases. This was even true in the latest study by Fombonne out of Canada. He found a prevalence of 20 in 10,000 for autistic disorder and 10 in 10,000 for AS, if I recall correctly. There are probably cultural shifts in the boundaries between the sub-conditions as time goes by. In any case, it is notable that AS is more rare than autistic disoder, because people would generally assume the opposite is the case. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 15:24, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<p><i>In any case, it is notable that AS is more rare than autistic disoder, because people would generally assume the opposite is the case</i></p>
<p>You are still assuming that Aspergers IS more rare. Let me make the point again.</p>
<p>Regardless of what Fombonne or anyone else said, <i>While I do not doubt the fact that this is indeed what conservative estimates indicate, I think that the conclusion that AS is "more rare than autistic disorder itself" is entirely erroneous. The fact that it is rarely diagnosed does not make it more rare.</i></p>
<p>I am not a person who <i>"would generally assume the opposite is the case"</i>. My opinions are not based on general assumptions from a relatively ignorant standpoint. I have been aware of Asperger's Syndrome for the greater part of 60 years, although not having a name for it until about 1990.</p>
<p>The article is not a place to publish my own opinons. But I am stating them here. I believe that the conclusion drawn from the figures is faulty and should be removed from the article. I would go so far as to say that the notion that people with full-blown Autism are more common than those with Asperger's is ludicrous.</p>
<p>Looking outside the rarified conditions of a clinic, one only has to think about the people that one knows well, to identify a number who are definite Aspie suspects. Then compare it to the number that one knows who are fully Autistic.</p>
<p>I have only known three people with full blown Autism among families that I am friendly with, (aside from the many that I have met professionally). Of the Autistic "friends", in each case one or both of the parents and at least one of the siblings demonstrates the traits of Asperger's Syndrome. But in each case only the family member who is socially non-functional and barely verbal has a diagnosis. The other three or four or more people in the family who are probably in the Autistc Spectrum just battle on with living a life in which they always seem to be out of step. The thing that offends me about the statement that people with Autism are more numerous than those with Asperger's Syndrome is that it confirms my opinions-</p>
<p>1. That there is still no proper recognition that we Aspies have been around in relatively large numbers for a long time.</p>
<p>2. That there <i>is no</i> sudden explosion of this condition, as we would be led by the media to believe.</p>
<p>3. That it is still hard to get recognition and help for kids who are suffering isolation, bullying, teasing and punishment at school because of their condition.</p>
<p>4. That it's much less hard to get help for a severely Autistic child because the condition isn't mistaken for naughtiness, bad parenting or too many jelly-beans.</p>
<p>In other words, Neurodivergent, can we re-state that sentence of yours as-</p>
<p>"In any case, it is notable that AS is more <i>rarely diagnosed</i> than autistic disoder, because people would generally assume <i>AS to be more common</i>" (which is the point that I am trying to make.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>GROSS: Sometimes when I'm preparing an interview, I'll read something about someone, and I'm not sure if they really said that or if it's really true, because it sometimes isn't. Ha ha. So, let me read you something that I read that you had said, and you can tell me if it's true. And if it is true and it's too personal, you can tell me that as well. But I read that when you were 12 you were diagnosed as schizophrenic and that you heard voices in your head and that you had to kind of keep that under control.</p>
<p>AYKROYD: Um, well, it was more of a Tourette's thing than schizophrenia. I was analyzed as a Tourette's and Asperger's [child], which I still have a little bit today. You know, I mean, I grew up being pulled one way by my mother, who was very very strict, and then being relaxed by my father, who was very passive. I had the Tourette's there pretty badly there, and I went to a therapist about it. At 12 years old I was able to have the luxury of sitting down with a therapist and talking through all kinds of things, books and music. She was quite influential in kind of evening me out. ...Of course, now today they just give kids pills, but back then we didn't have the benefit of all this sophisticated medicine. Whether it works or not, I don't know. I think time will tell on that.</p>
<p>It was not so much [schizophrenia]. I think when I said that, I was kind of going to the extreme. It was not so much the schizophrenia part of it, but it was the Tourette's/Asperger's, which can be associated with hallucinogenic voices and that. I still have a little touch of that today. But I've been able to kind of defeat it without pharmaceutical medication. And I just find in my research and reading today that there's a lot of people who have this kind of mild condition, and some of them get over it, and [for] some of them, it spins out where it affects them quite negatively.</p>
<p>GROSS: If you don't mind my asking--</p>
<p>AYKROYD: I don't.</p>
<p>GROSS: --what were some of the symptoms when you were 12, and were these things that you had to fight against to do the kind of acting &amp; writing that you wanted to do, and did they feed that in any way?</p>
<p>AYKROYD: Well, it was mostly physical tics, you know, and nervousness kind of thing, and that kind of thing, you know, like grunting and tics and the classic Tourette's type syndrome, that type of thing. But by the time I was 14 it was allayed and I really haven't had too much occurrence except on the Asperger's side, where I have a fascination with police, and I always have to have a badge with me. ... I have a fascination with law enforcement and the police. My grandfather was a Mountie and that. If I don't have a badge on me, I feel naked.</p>
<p>GROSS: I can't tell if you're kidding or not.</p>
<p>AYKROYD: No, no. It's true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the interview, Aykroyd notes he was 12 when diagnosed which implies this was not a self-diagnosis. I've been unable to track down where Gross read that Aykroyd was diagnosed. I added this interview as the citation in the main article, but the original source of the information, which Gross referenced, would likely be better. -- Hobo Dave 08:15 (GMT), 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Right, but given what "experts" would say, would any (or have any) ever suggested that he might be AS? Personally, the thought never crossed my mind, and I was kind of surprised at the idea. To me, what he describes wouldn't really be sufficient if that's all he has. And who knows what the diagnosis was like when he was 12 - the world of ASD diagnosis was quite different back then... -- <a href="../../../t/d/o/User%7ETdowling_0b42.html" title="User:Tdowling">Tim</a> 12:47, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do the math: the diagnosis of AS didn't even exist when he was a preteen, and the interviewer indicated confusion about whether he was kidding or not. He's a comedian. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 12:52, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The math is definately weird, though it wouldn't be uncommon for someone of that timeframe to be labeled schizophrenic or autistic in AS' place. However, it's still very sketchy. The only thing he mentioned (fascination) isn't so much an AS thing as it is an OCD-esque thing (which I'm aware is quite comorbid w/AS). That said, I don't put much faith in what was said insofar as AS goes; Tourettes? Possible/probable. But then, that's just my opinion, and <i>that</i> is definately OR. It's still very fishy, and I'm not sure if we should include something that isn't a tad more iron-clad. --<a href="../../../k/e/y/User%7EKeyne_c410.html" title="User:Keyne">Keyne</a> 13:01, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've listened to the interview and I don't think he was kidding. But it's unlikely he received a diagnosis of Asperger's or autism at the age of 12. My guess is he got a different diagnosis which he later corrected to Asperger's and Tourette's through his own research. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 14:47, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is some work being done on the work being done on the causes, which is in some ways more interesting than the work on the causes itself. Essentially, some researchers have indicated that an incorrect (or, at least, non-orthogonal) classification complicates research with regards to causes. Grouping AS, Autism and AD[H]D together as a single condition with two comorbidities: one leading to autistic features, the other leading to hyperactivity, with the rest of the differences being attributed to personality differences that would be variant-normal within the new condition.

Other things like learning disabilities / intense focusing are on the ability-disability axis. Yet other axis include differences in non-verbal communications, which is the key in Tourette and ASDs. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 14:43, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For me, when I was getting diagnosed with this last year, I always, always heard it called "Asperger's Syndrome", both by the people who were diagnosing me, and some of the older people I knew. I only started referring to it as "Asperger syndrome" when I actually typed the former into Wikipedia, and got redirected to the latter. I figured that this place was probably more right than the other people I knew, but basically what I'm trying to say is I had never heard of "Asperger syndrome" before here. Perhaps it is something to do with countries? I live in England, personally. Maybe it is more known as Asperger's Syndrome over here, and Asperger syndrome in the US? Or maybe it's just in the North West of England.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My book, "Asperger's Syndrome in Young Children", is cited in your article. Many of my patients' parents have told me that it might be helpful for new parents and clinicians to be able to link to my professional website, where I discuss the disorder in young children and a treatment model. I'm NOT advertising for new patients. This would be a way to educate people about a therapeutic program and resources. If you think this would be appropriate, my website is:</p>

<dd>I think it should not be linked. There is already too much of the views of parents and professionals expressed in the article, and too little from adult autistics. In fact, in the last round of peer-review, most of the "professional" material were maintained, and too much of the autistic-community views vanished. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 10:18, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I couldn't agree more. Most the aspies I know or have talked to, report having virtually been ignored in favour of their parent's interests. Granted, it can be a challenge to raise an aspie child, and some support should be offered to the parents, but not like it is currently working, with the professionals forgetting who the patient is.</dd>
<dd>Also, as you said, there is a very wide gap between the "professionals" and the aspie community itself. Many would argue that the majority of the associated disability is actually just the friction resulting from interactions between strongly individualistic and idiosyncratic people and a highly conformant mainstream being passed off as a disease.</dd>
<dd>For instance, the B2 criterion ("apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals") does not reflect the fact that a very large problem for aspies is exactly that neurotypicals have such an intricate set of <b>specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals</b>, colloquially referred to as "social interactions", that the aspies have great difficulty in understanding. And, unless there is some sort of OCD comorbidity, few aspies' routines and rituals are nonfunctional <b>to them</b>, in my experience. The majority of the exceptions, I think, can be accounted for as "habits", of which neurotypicals also tend to have more than a few.</dd>
<dd>If this article is to maintain a balanced and comprehensive view, it needs to present both sides of the issue: aspies as viewed by neurotypicals, and aspies as viewed by aspies. <a href="../../../z/u/i/User%7EZuiram_fd95.html" title="User:Zuiram">Zuiram</a> 09:55, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As an Aspie, I think my "non functional rituals" are distinct from habits. I also think "Social Interaction" is a functional ritual, albeit one that is very challenging for me. On the other hand, many things come much easier to me than to NTs - I would NOT want to be "cured", but I do appreciate having what I consider the negatives of Aspergers to be "fixed".<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 4.156.42.106 (<a href="../../../4/2E/1/User_talk%7E4.156.42.106.html" title="User talk:4.156.42.106">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_4.156.42.106_9fe8.html" title="Special:Contributions/4.156.42.106">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>"Less common" or the like has very little to do with the subject of perseverations. Anyone can like anything, but the intense interest is what is setting-apart in reference to the difference between "normal" interest and perseverant interest. For instance, a child might like dinosaurs, as mentioned; however, does that child also know all of their scientific names, bone structures, feeding habits, and so forth?

But he didn't speak until he was about five because he was worried that he might do it badly, and sound stupid. The problem was, when he was two he had seen a tractor with a particular sort of engine at the Sydney Royal Easter Show and he wanted to know how the thing worked. Whe he was five, a neighbour bought one. His curiosity got the better of his inhibition and he said to his neighbour "Do you mind telling me how that thing works?"

In psychology terms way back then, "psychopathy" didn't mean "psycho" like people use it today. It was just another way of saying that something weird was going on in the brain.

<dd>I suppose this is unfounded (hence it's just here as a comment), but something I've noticed is that some of us apparently don't know what emotions are, specifically. I'm sure they (and you) still feel them, but it's difficult for some to identify what the actual process is and associate that process with a word like "guilt" or "happiness". -ADoS <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.192.64.235_e564.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.192.64.235">71.192.64.235</a> (talk) 04:04, 10 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>I know that I have no concept of the idea of beauty (partly because my facial recognition skills are sub-par) but the suggestion that Aspergers people cannot feel emotions is incorrect. Aspergers people can be very affectionate, because we don't really think about another person having a negative reaction before we, eg, hug them in public. That's lack of empathy for you. THAT'S where Aspergers people traditionally fall down, not in the emotional department. 86.17.163.37 00:05, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can someone please rephrase that section because its tone of writing will insult people on wikipedia who has AS.

<dl>
<dd>Echoing agreement with the below: Pointing out teacher's perceptions (and other authority figures, however misguided they may be) is a rather essential point regarding AS' realities. It isn't intended to be insulting, but more often than not, such examples are the norm (regardless of the AS' individual's intentions). Explanation within the article as such goes to show that said examples aren't accurate, and such disclosure if very important and relevant. To that end, it is both useful and needed within the context of the article. --<a href="../../../k/e/y/User%7EKeyne_c410.html" title="User:Keyne">Keyne</a> 18:44, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have of late actually added quite a lot to the Social Impact section myself. I added it in the knowledge that it can be reality for people with AS, and that the opinions people may have of people with AS are reality. I have AS myself, and if anything I added it to raise awareness of the reality of how hard life can be for an Aspie. Feel free to tweak some of the working, and if it helps I'm going to add a preamble basically to say not all the possibilities in the Social Impact section will happen for ALL Aspies.</dd>

<p>Another couple of suggestions while I think about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think perhaps Social Impact for people with Asperger Syndrome deserves its own page (in turn the section in the main Asperger article could be shortened). This is because I feel strongly about the awareness side of things.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Whether it gets its own page or not, more about <i>positive</i> social impacts, as Asperger's is not just a disabling condition. It's also enbaling in many ways.</li>

<dd>To be honest, as defined, AS is technically all about social impacts (to simplify: defecits--yes, I know it's much more than that), so I would chime in that any such inclusions should probably work into this article, rather than split the article into less sensical subsections (of itself). --<a href="../../../k/e/y/User%7EKeyne_c410.html" title="User:Keyne">Keyne</a> 18:44, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think so. There might very well be a small correlation between premature birth and AS as well as with ADHD, but I doubt this have any causative effect. More likely the other way around.

<p>Recent changes create the impression using a small number of references that the existance of the condition known as AS is a matter of serious debate in the mental health community. Dr. Szatmari is a well known expert in the feild but he does not speak for the field. Among mental health professionals there is little doubt the condition exists. The question is whether it should be considered a disorder or lauded as neurodiversity. Of course the same is said of all autistic spectrum disorders and even of autism itself. Dr. Szatmari himself it might be added DOES believe the condition exists and has in fact prodcued a screening criteria. — <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalerin_2c97.html" title="User:Falerin">Falerin</a><sup>&lt;<a href="../../../f/a/l/User_talk%7EFalerin_31b4.html" title="User talk:Falerin"><b>talk</b></a>&gt;,&lt;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Falerin_21b6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Falerin"><b>contrib</b></a>&gt;</sup> 12:49, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Malice and Asperger Syndrome" by Digby Tantam he is a professor at the university of sheffield. <a href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/scharr/sections/mh/cscr/staff/dt.html" class="external free" title="http://www.shef.ac.uk/scharr/sections/mh/cscr/staff/dt.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shef.ac.uk/scharr/sections/mh/cscr/staff/dt.html</a></p>
<p>He appears to suggest that there is a subset of aspergers who behave markedly different from others with the syndrome. They appear to lack the "obvious eccentricity and clumsiness" that is typical of those with aspergers. This subset (which, to differentiate from "normal" AS he labels TFAS, which just stands for This Form of Asperger's Syndrome) appear to commit acts that appear to be extremely malicious and without provocation. For example....</p>
<p>"Amanda lived in a small town close to a large Army base. Whenever she saw a soldier she would walk up to him and make a Nazi salute, shouting "Sieg Heil!"." and</p>
<p>" A young man with Asperger syndrome rang his favourite Aunt to say that her husband had been killed in a road traffic accident on his way home from work. The report was a complete fabrication as became apparent an hour later when his Uncle arrived home."</p>
<p>The worst case appears to be this:</p>
<p>" Hugo is fifteen. He has been barred from school/His mother works, and is unsure what Hugo does during the day. Sometimes she comes home to find things broken. Hugo will not tell her what has happened./Hugo is often threatening to his mother, and she is quite frightened of him./He is particularly disturbed if there is any alteration in the arrangements at home, and insists that his mother tells him of when she will leave the house, when she will return, and when the evening meal will be ready. His older brother avoids Hugo because Hugo has deliberately broken belongings of the brother in the past./She is aware that Hugo's self-care needs constant monitoring. He has trouble with change and avoids shopping; he cannot cook without getting mixed up; he cannot keep track of money; and he needs to be prompted about shaving and bathing."</p>

Is the heading "<a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_culture.html" title="Autistic culture">autistic culture</a>" generally accepted to be less rigorous than science based resources? Is there research behind the <i>Wired</i> article "The Geek Syndrome" <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers.html" class="external text" title="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers.html" rel="nofollow">The Geek Syndrome</a>? I have looked and not found any cited and little mentioned. Also, the article contains the cited information only in the article's subtitle, which I see as simply a journalistic hook conjectured just to get the reader to read further. I mean, this might be OK if cultural references are the only criteria for verifiability here. But a further read of the article makes no further claim nor any argument for or against the claim of this lead-in subtitle. The article is quite decent as a short expository of the newly emerging awareness of AS but doesn't reach the level, to me, of verifiable with regard to the information paraphrased into the wiki article.<a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearpa_6be0.html" title="User:Bearpa">Bearpa</a> 20:27, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Antisocial?</span></h2>
<p>This page states that "antisocial" tendencies are a core feature. Now, it may be a language barrier issue, though that doesn't explain why <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisocial.html" title="Antisocial">antisocial</a> redirects to antisocial personality disorder, but APD "light" is what I read the word antisocial as meaning, which is very definitely not a core feature according to the people I've talked to, and I would remove it as vandalism if the rest of the article wasn't so uninsightful about the condition. 8 years living with one, meeting several, talking to the leading expert on it in my country (20+ years of research) and experiences from support groups does not support the meaning you get by internally linking the words.</p>
<p>Could someone please add an inline source to that statement if this actually means what I think it does, or clarify it if it means something else? <a href="../../../z/u/i/User%7EZuiram_fd95.html" title="User:Zuiram">Zuiram</a> 23:39, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Not life-threatening?</span></h2>
<p>I agree that the condition itself is not life-threatening, but the suicide rates are above baseline, ranging from 20% to 60% depending on the source and the timespan of the study. The 20% figure was from a childhood-to-adulthood study, while the 60% figure was a lifetime prevalence estimate (ISTR the CDC was the source). Does anyone have some good sources we could cite here to clarify? <a href="../../../z/u/i/User%7EZuiram_fd95.html" title="User:Zuiram">Zuiram</a> 23:39, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Matter of opinion</span></h3>
<p>Do you have any references to the numbers you were just quoting- they seem inordinately high! I have no problem believing that Aspies have higher suicide rates but those rates are astronomical! I and my son both have AS and neither of us is going off the deep end very soon...&#160;:-) Alex Jackl 07:18, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey, I'm sure Zuiram can and will give a better accounting for these stats. This is something I know I saw mentioned in some of the guidelines --statistics. I'm of course not certain, but the references are probably to the rate of increase from the baseline. In other words (and this, you'll see, is why we should all use caution and diligence when using statistical derivations), if the rate of suicide is 5 per 1000, then a 20% increase translates to 6 per 1000 (5+20% of itself, the rate, or 5+1=6). Likewise, a 60% lifetime rate increase if the lifetime rate is, say 20 per 1000, would be 32 per 1000, that is, 20+(60% of 20), which is 20+12=32. Statistics can confuse. They can confuse unwittingly by their undisciplined use, but far worse is the confusion caused by those who wish to deceive. The hard part is figuring out the difference before damage is done. I'm sure this was not the intention here: in fact the author may not have understood the difference, or, more likely, that others would misunderstand the distinction.<a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearpa_6be0.html" title="User:Bearpa">Bearpa</a> 22:20, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
