<p>With each year-long residency Teaching Matters can provide a school with sustained, context-specific and job-enabled professional development.</p>
<p>Our consistent and ongoing presence in a school enables us to institute a customized apprenticeship model, which starts with modeling at the beginning of the residency period and gradually shifts to a scaffolded and co-teaching approach. By the end of the residency period, the scaffolding fades and the classroom teacher is put in the driver’s seat. In addition to being a consistent school-based resource, our professional developer can help structure time for reflection and dissemination of best practice throughout the school.</p>
<p>A core tenet of the Residency program is that the principal and the school administration are the "thought leaders" of the building and that the Teaching Matters resident is an extension of that group. Working in conjunction with school leaders, the resident assists in the creation of a strategic professional development plan tied to the vision of the principal and customized to the school's needs. This plan is later implemented through the delivery of workshops and direct in-classroom support for the teacher (planning, modeling, supporting the teacher, etc.)</p>
<p>Residents will seek numerous ways to enhance curriculum in the school. The will coordinate activities with coaches, conduct teacher study groups, work side-by-side with teachers to develop and implement lessons.</p>
<p>A resident becomes an integral part of the school community and seeks to be embedded within the culture of the school.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>• , etc.) • provides customized work • Keep exposing us to new tools • proposes project ideas for student independent work in math, science, and social studies • supports individual curriculum • assists in integrating technology into lesson plans • teaching of the different programs to enhance the curriculum. • Instructional design and curriculum development</p>
<p><br />
•A residency supports the following beliefs: Communication Consistency Cost effectiveness - Creativity Connection to the school’s goals Concrete results Customized onsite PD for the school</p>

<p>School Year start • Introduction to staff • Contacting staff and sending them a copy of the calendar, and highlighting when you will be working with them. • Ideally, the principal or AP would come for an initial meeting at Teaching Matters to be introduced to a menu of project ideas and options and would participate in individualized planning. A proposal with tangible, attainable goals would be crafted (including a potential pacing calendar) and then the resident would begin in a school. If the school opted in, a baseline assessment would be performed by an outside evaluator (with Teaching Matters absorbing costs).</p>
<p>MOVE TOWARD EMPOWERMENT:</p>
<p>Just about all of the PDs doing Residencies in the fall are participating in schools that will be part of the empowerment zones. PDs had different impressions of schools entering the empowerment zones:</p>
<p>• A weight has been lifted off the school – opportunity to get away from the regional structure • A new start for the school • Budgetary opportunities to do new things • Principal is able to put forth their vision • Great opportunity for a new principal that is ready, yet some see the value of having support from the region (LISes, budgetary assistance, etc.)</p>
<p>==MISCELLANEOUS NOTES:</p>
<p>The PD that the school asked for • Overall leaves a strong tech. integration environment with the school • Availability and accessibility of PDs – opportunity for school to make requests • Approval of calendar and posted in a residency website - where projects can be uploaded easily for follow-up meetings with other residents and administration. • • Principals should complete both a mid and end year evaluation of the resident. • Multiple opportunities for TMI to connect back to the school</p>
