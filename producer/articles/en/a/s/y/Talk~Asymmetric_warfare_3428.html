<p>Having read the article as well as the talk below, it strikes me there is an inconsistency in the article. Quoting from it:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Asymmetric warfare is not synonymous with <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a>. Rather, terrorism is sometimes used as a tactic by the weaker side in an asymmetric conflict. ... In the classic rules of war ... asymmetric warfare is completely moral in and of itself, all other rules of war being obeyed. This entails: (*) Non combatants cannot be attacked (thus <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> is outlawed); (*) The war is a properly declared war, with an accountable authority on both sides who can also put an end to the war.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Hence, the final section -the one on Al-Qaeda- seems grossly misplaced and an example contradicting to the definition of the subject matter. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikademus_7048.html" title="User:Mikademus">Mikademus</a> 10:56, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have edited the Al-Qaeda section. It was terribly written anyway, and, because of the nature of Al-Qaeda and similar groups, it is entirely opinion whether or not they were responsible for any given act of terrorism. I did wonder if this section ought to simply be deleted but, on further consideration, I think it makes a useful point about how conventional warfare, asymmetric warfare and terrorism seem to be melding together in the modern world. Hopefully this is clearer and less opinionated. I also added a section addressing the above concern somewhat. Josh Bayes 01:46, 31.03.06</p>

<p>The original version of this page appears to have been one of 24's rants. I've trimmed down the more obvious bias and nonsense, but like much of 24's stuff, there is some good material too.</p>

<p>Clearly we need to bridge this topic. C-a-r-e-f-u-l-l-y-!&#160;;) Specifically, where is the line drawn? When does carpet bombing become war crime or state terrorism? When does a pipe bomb go from a valid weapon against a legitimate enemy to a criminal act of terror against civilians? I think we need to clarify these things as best we can, as this info is sorely needed these days. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 09:46, 2 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To approach the topic clearly, I think we need to separate out rhetorical positions from substantive ones. "State terrorism" is used as a counterpoint to "terrorism" (i.e., I do it, but you do it, so it's OK). When a state actor is involved in a legitimate war, the question is whether the action violates the laws of war or not. To answer your specific questions, carpet bombing becomes a war crime if it exceeds military necessity (wanton destruction) or targets a civilian population; you answered your own question on the pipe bomb--the difference is legitimate enemy vs. civilians <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> 10:53, 2 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems to me the distinction being made between asymmetric warfare and terrorism by Sam Spade is entirely relative. Many 'terrorist' groups have causes just as worthy as any fought by the states they oppose, however, since they are independant of any particular nation they will be labelled as terrorists by those they oppose no matter how 'fair' they fight. Why is what happened in London so much worse than what happened with the 'shock and awe' campaign.</p>

<p>I'm fretting over the article <a href="../../../a/s/y/Asymmetric_warfare.html" title="Asymmetric warfare">Asymmetric warfare</a>. The original author seems to be making a sincere effort to put forward what he/she <i>thinks</i> the subject is about, but it amounts to an extensive POV, mixing incomparable elements, personal musings and attempting to reach a conclusion.</p>
<p>I know something about the subject, having taught related subjects in the US Army, and the subject is worthy of discussion, but I'm not comfortable essentially throwing out someone else's work and writing the article new.</p>
<p>This is not the only such article. I'm tempted to simply leave them alone, but it makes wikipedia very un-encyclopedic, if someone were actually researching a subject.</p>
<p>Opinions? About this and the issue of near totally POV articles in general? <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> 14:46, 29 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are quite welcome to completely re-write articles if you want <i>see</i> <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">Wikipedia:be bold in updating pages</a> If you think the present article is beyond salvage. I have done on occasions and I have also had some of my articles completely re-written by other people, although it might be better to try to integrate changes with the existing text <a href="../../../g/-/m/User%7EG-Man_797a.html" title="User:G-Man">G-Man</a> 14:54, 29 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In this case, if you know that this (really long) article is riddled with POV and since it isn't the focus of edit wars and you wont be upsetting a delicate balance, I suggest that you can be quite radical. If you're willing to do the work this involves, I suggest that you write a good solid stub from scratch and replace the current article. If the current article contains anything useful then copy it to the talk page first, or summarise the key points it makes which should still be included (albeit it correctly flagged as a certain POV). Then build on the stub, reintergrating anything you want to keep into the new article, expand it and add balance where appropriate. If you document all these stages on the talk page, you may even encourage other knowledgeable people to join you in creating a much better article. &#160;:) This might be too radical an approach for articles which have escalated into an edit war, in which case you might propose completely rewriting the article on the talk page, and solicit a lot more opinions in order to reach a consensus. <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabiform_a7bf.html" title="User:Fabiform">fabiform</a> | <a href="../../../f/a/b/User_talk%7EFabiform_a651.html" title="User talk:Fabiform">talk</a> 15:00, 29 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I hardly think so, as these are what I consider to be <i>defining examples</i> of the concept. What could be more asymmetrical that two attackers in a $2000 boat with a couple of thousand dollars worth of explosive doing the following, here using the Cole attack as an example:
<dl>
<dd>1). Almost sinking a <strike>capital</strike> warship costing many hundreds of millions of dollars. A slightly different attack point would have flooded two engine rooms, not one, and would have ensured the sinking of this ship, creating much more damage and expense of both recovery and rehabilitation.</dd>
<dd>2) Exchanging two lives for 17, or two casualties for 56, considered a highly favorable kill ratio in any conventional warfare.</dd>
<dd>3.) Causing great damage to the reputation of a world superpower, demonstrating that it is not immune from attack.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Similar considerations apply to Khobar towers, and even more so with 9/11, with a three hundred thousand dollar project cost yielding perhaps up to ten billion dollars in direct and indirect damage, a damage/expense effectiveness ratio of thirty thousand to one. <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeonard_G._0170.html" title="User:Leonard G.">Leonard G.</a> 02:39, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<dd>The attacks on Khobar Towers and the USS Cole cannot be considered terrorism, because they were not civilian targets. Terrorism, by definition, is violent surprise attack on civilian targets in an effort to sway public opinion through fear and intimidation. Khobar Towers was housing U.S. Air Force personnel at the time it was attacked. The USS Cole was a U.S. Navy vessel. The very nature of the targets attacked in these cases precludes defining said attacks as terrorism.</dd>

<p>The theory that longbows were largely ineffective at the Battle of Agincourt is far from being conclusively proven. The time frame is not a prehistoric period; short of definitive contradictory evidence (which, for all intents and purposes, will never arise, since the battle cannot be exactly reproduced), there is no reason to assume that the historical record of the last 600 years is incorrect based simply on a test made for entertaining television.</p>
<p>The advantage of high ground would be meaningless without ranged weapons capable of slowing an advance; if arrows from the longbow were unable to peirce their armor, the French would have quickly closed the gap, and all the English could have done is wait for them. In reality, it is much easier to make a flawless steel arrowhead than it is to make flawless steel armor plating. Even today, with our technology, very few portable armor systems could stop a direct shot from a steel-tipped longbow arrow.</p>
<p>The fact is, people are always more likely to readily accept theories that are completely contradictory to tradition or even common sense. Ironically, a statement tends to have a ring of truth to it when it opposes everything we already know. We assume that scholars must know something we don't. But if we push aside the theories, and look only at the facts, we see two things:</p>
<p>1. The English WERE outnumbered, by at least 3-2. This is not contested by archaeological evidence. If that doesn't sound like a lot, I suggest bringing 8,000 men to fight 12,000 men hand-to-hand, and see who has the advantage. 4,000 men is a big difference, and very difficult to overcome on an open field without archers.</p>
<p>2. The English DID win. As I said, the shape of the battlefield is not an advantage without effective ranged weapons. By taking advantage of superior technology, the English were able to exploit the terrain to win the battle.</p>
<p>The theory that archers played a minor role at Agincourt should be discussed on the page for the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Agincourt_8fce.html" title="Battle of Agincourt">Battle of Agincourt</a>, not here. In the context of asymmetric warfare, Agincourt remains a classic example of exploiting certain advantages to overcome larger numbers.

<dd>They were resisting an invasion and occupation. "Insurgency" may be usable in this context, but "resistance" is more appropriate, IMO, and less ambiguous. The use of the term "resistance" clarifies the status of both the invaders and the indigenous fighters, whereas "insurgency" leaves the door open for the notion that an occupation force may be a legitimate government. Do you assert that "resistance" is <i>less</i> appropriate than "insurgency?"</dd>

<dd>I read the passage to which you referred, and it seems confusing. Does this mean to imply that simply by the fact of military occupation one gains legitimate title to territory? Were the Nazis, thereby, the legitimate authority in occupied France?

<dd>No it does not rest on justice it rests on international treaty obligations. If a beligerent power occupies territory they have a duty under international law to uphold local laws and customs.

<dd>Given the above I do assert that "resistance" is <i>less</i> appropriate than "insurgency" because resistance has connontations of WWII and the Maquis to most English speakers which the word Insergency does not.

<dd>I continue to disagree. The use of the term "resistance" is entirely appropriate <i>because</i> it has connotations of WWII and the Maquis. It is entirely legitimate to resist invasion and occupation, as the Iraqis are doing, as long as one does not descend into terrorism (i.e. by targeting civilians or acting with wanton disregard for the safety thereof). Furthermore, if "(n)ot all insurgencies are popular resistance movements, but all resistance movements are insurgencies," then it would be appropriate to use the <i>more</i> precise term "resistance" rather than the broader term "insurgency."</dd>

<dd>Resistance has connotations which insurgents does not and is therefore a POV. BTW under law it is just s much a crime to kill a soldier as a civilian if the person doing the killing is not a <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawful_combatant.html" title="Lawful combatant">lawful combatant</a>. Once Bagdad was occupied and the Iraqi army had been told to go home, it is debatable if the the insergets are lawful combatants. I don't want to debate this here becasue there are other articles where this is covered in detail. But because there is a debate the term Insergent is more appropriate because it carries less POV. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 08:59, 2 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What inappropriate connotation does "resistance" carry that "insurgent" does not?
<dl>
<dd>Because of the WWII connotations resistance carries an assumption of legitimate resistance. IMO an insergency is neutral it does not imply either legitimate or illegitimate. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>How does a successful occupation render resistance unlawful, as you imply in your third sentence?
<dl>
<dd>It is not the success or otherwise of the occupation but the legal reasons for doing it. For example the Kosovo occupation (<a href="../../../k/f/o/KFOR_d683.html" title="KFOR">KFOR</a>) by NATO was a UN sanctioned occupation of part of Serbia, if any one had fought against that occupation then the resistance would be unlawful even if the methods they used were within the law of war. But to give another example: The Boers in the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Boer_War_db66.html" title="Second Boer War">Second Boer War</a> were in the last stages fighting a guerrilla war they were still entitled to be treated as lawful combatants because they were carrying their guns openly and still had a recognised chain of command to a government in exile. If that government had been captured in Petoria when the city fell and forced to sign a surrender document, then any Boer commandos who had continued to resist would probably have been deemed to have been unlawful combatants because they would not have been in the armed forces of a party to the conflict and would not have been in a reconisable chain of command. (Which BTW is one of the reasons for the <a href="../../../p/i/r/PIRA_a800.html" title="PIRA">PIRA</a> having an <a href="../../../i/r/a/IRA_Army_Council_9017.html" title="IRA Army Council">Army Council</a> as they argued that their volunteers were in a military chain of command as legitimate as that of the British).

<dd>I read the "<a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawful_combatant.html" title="Lawful combatant">lawful combatant</a>" article, and I find it disturbing. The <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Resistance_798c.html" title="French Resistance">French Resistance</a> during WWII, for example, would seem to have not been "lawful combatants" under this description. The article implies that individual citizens of an occupied country may not legitimately take action against a hostile occupation. If that is, in fact, part of international law, I find it highly disturbing, and must wonder at the motivation of those writing/signing that particular section of the law.</dd>

<p>To resist an occupation is not illegal indeed the Fourth Geneva Convention gives protection to the civilian population against an occupying army as does the earlier <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hague_Conventions_%281899_and_1907%29_6818.html" title="Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)">1907 IV Hague Convention</a>. But if resistance involves armed resistance then there laws of war which have to be observed if the insurgent is to be a lawful combatant. If the insurgent uses methods which are not lawful for combatants, then when captured and after they have been in front of a competent tribunal, they do not have the protection of being POWs and can be tried as a civilian for committing a murder if they kill a soldier belonging to the occupying force. If on the other hand they are lawful combatants then killing a soldier is not an unlawful act and they can not be found guilty of murder. Many countries including the UK (but not the US) have signed up to the additional protocols to the Geneva Conventions which for international conflicts is <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protocol_I_d887.html" title="Protocol I">Protocol I</a>. It is worth reading <a href="http://www.law.qub.ac.uk/humanrts/treaties/texts/uk645.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.law.qub.ac.uk/humanrts/treaties/texts/uk645.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> which is footnote 2 the Wikipedia "Protocol I" article as it expands on what the British think Article 44 means.</p>
<p>So to reiterate I think insurgency is a better word to use than resistance <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 00:00, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Rarely throughout history have equally matched opponents waged war upon each other. With the exceptional miscalculation that plunges the world into chaos, most polities and non-state actors behave like children and pick fights with those they assume cannot effectively fight back. Therefore, theoretically, a weaker party should relent to the the will of the stronger and the world would settle into a hierarchy with a cleary delineated pecking order. Unfortunately to the chagrin of many an economist, man is not a rational creature and fights even when he cannot possibly hope to win: Herat, the Alamo, la Hacienda Camarón, the Warsaw Ghetto, Berlin, Iwo Jima, Tora Bora, Fallujah. History is littered with such names.</dd>

<p>There is an aspect of asymmetric warfare that should be linked to Total War. Asymmetric warfare makes use of all available networks - political, economic, social and military. As a consequence, the line between civilian and military targets has blurred. At the same time, the exponential increase in the use of non-conventional troops to combat/respond to asymmetric threats has similarly made the distinction between civilian and military disappear.--Milbuff101 15:39, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Here are a few issues I think should be covered in this article.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Types of Asymmetrical warfare</b> "Guerrilla warfare can be classified into two main categories: urban guerrilla warfare and rural guerrilla warfare." I think this is incorrect, or at least a confusion.</p>
<p>The Urban and Rural breakdown, which is tied to the terrain (often called "difficult terrain" by scholars) isn't a breakdown at all really. I think that the territorial breakdown of this type of war is irrelavant, because the use of urban landscape still utilizes the same principles as rural landscape. Both are "difficult" in their own ways. Rural based on the geological layout (desert, mountain, jungle etc.), and Urban based on architectural and public support to hide their where-abouts. As well, so-called "rural guerilla's" still require outside (read:population) support for their supplies. Both rely on a means of supplying themselves and escaping during hit and run tactics, and so neither is very different. I think the more appropriate breakdown is this:</p>
<p>Asymmetric warfare can also be broken down into two other types of warfare: Ideological and Territorial. Often the two mix as well, with groups beginning with a territorial motivation and using it to promote a ideological/political shift, or vice-versa.</p>
<p><b>Territorial</b> is often an uprising to fend off a foreign or precieved foreign power. It often involves the natives of one country against the army of another. This is a replacement for conventional warfare. The 2nd Boer war is an example of this type of asymmetic war.</p>
<p>The <b>Ideological</b> form is often a form of civil war, where the fight is against the government of the insurgents' own country. China's revolution is a perfect example of this.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Shift to Conventional Warfare</b> Another issue I wish to see addressed is the shift that often occures to bring about conventional warfare. This is almost always neccessary for a geurilla force, and is what often causes the confusion about Vietnam. NOTE: Vietnam is only an asymmetrical war Pre-United States involvement. Once the battles began it became a conventional war, with armies. This is mentioned in the Tactical Relevance secion, and is misleading.</p>
<p>Asymmetrical refers not only to the superior numbers, but the tactics mainly. Asymmetical wars often become conventional wars as they grow in support and numbers. Asym. war is typified by its tactics, which are only useful given the conditions of smaller numbers and available difficult terrain. Larger numbers cannot utilise tactics which take advantage of the weaknesses of conventional armies (ie: their size and relative immobility), and so take on the tactics of conventional armies.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Counter-Insurgency</b> Some mention of the tactics for counter-insurgency might be benificial.</p>
<p>--Andrew winter 20:22, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In fact, the more I look at it, the more I wonder whether this should be merged in some way with the Guerillia Warfare article. Since that's what this article has ended up talking about anyways. Asymmetrical war is the circumstance, guerillia war is the tactics. Can anyone think of an Asymmetrical war that was NOT a Guerilla war? --Andrew winter 21:25, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Charles Foley ideas "Strategic Assault Corps" published 1954 (See the section <a href="#Commandos" title="">#Commandos</a> higher up this talk page), incorporated ideas from the use of Commandos, Chindits and the particularly those of the SAS during World War II. He write much of the essay as a question and answer exercise. For example:
<dl>
<dd><i>How would the Corps differ from the Commandos?</i> Enormously, and the difference must be kept clear from the start. The merging of the Commandos into the Royal Marines acknowledged that their rôle is tactical: to provide the spearhead of conventional attack on enemy coastlines. They have their place of honour in the forefront of such landings, but strategic targets are outside their scope. Strategic assault troops, however, must be reserved for deep thrusts far behind the enemy lines; their training structure and character would be wasted if used for jabbing at tactical objectives.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Later in the same essay he goes on to say:
<dl>
<dd>Nearer to the battle zone, shattering blows can be struck. Bridges, railways and tunnels suddenly blow up, signal and power lines go dead. With his plans in disarray the enemy is forced to squander forces on defensive precautions against an unknown, and thus conform his behaviour to our intentions. And then in widening circles, begin the kidnapping and seduction of enemy officers. Not only will the opposing leader have to double the guards on every battlement, but even in the council chamber (he had better scrutinise them frequently to make sure they are his men) while keeping a sharp eye on the loyalty of his chief lieutenants. ...the supreme aim of Strategic Assault Corps would be to intervene <i>before</i> the fatal order can be given, and every war-maker will know it. Even as he plots the hour of attack, he will be haunted by the dread of assassination.</dd>

<p>Nice. I think then that the use of tactics used in Guerilla warfare should be highlighted, but the term should not used interchangably with assymetrical warfare. These tactics are used effectivly in this type of warfare, but the circumstances are not always the same. As in the above example, the tactics of terrain use, and targetting of lines of comm and supply are common btw the two. But Guerilla warfare is a result of circumstance, while Asymmetrical warfare is sometimes a tactical choice as in your example? --Andrewwinter 14:56, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The definition at the beginning of the article doesn't really explain the topic well to people unfamiliar with the idea of asymmetric warfare. Right now it reads as follows:</p>
<p>"Asymmetric warfare describes the potential for an optimal interaction between the respective strengths and weaknessess of two belligerents"</p>
<p>I would like to change it to something like this:</p>
<p>"Asymmetric warfare describes a conflict between two entities of unequal size, in which the smaller entity may use unorthodox means to attack its larger opponent."</p>
<p>How does this sound? Shall I replace this sentence? <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGary2863_236b.html" title="User:Gary2863">Gary</a> 17:02, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Slight Alteration to proposed definition</b></p>
<p>I like your definition much better, but the "smaller entity" might not necessarily be the side at the disadvantage? I.e., 139 British Infantry Vs. 4,000 Zulu Warriors. Size considered alone would say the British are at an obvious disadvantage, however once all factors are considered (Better weapons, tactics, defending a fortification) the size issue is not as important. There are other factors and to say this form of warfare is simply related to a smaller entity fighting a bigger entity would be misleading. A larger entity that finds itself outperformed by a smaller entity may still make use of asymmetrical tactics.</p>
<p>How about this: "Asymmetric warfare describes conflict between two entities of unequal capability, in which the more disadvantaged entity may use unorthodox means to attack, or defend itself from, its larger opponent."</p>

<p>The parties do not have to be of differing strengths for "Asymmetric warfare" to exist. It may not be a strategic necessity (although it usually is), but a tactical decision, e.g. the development of the SAS in World War II. Or as the example in the article mentions, the result of strategic choices which result in a standoff as happened between the UK and France in the Napoleonic wars. But see the next paragraph I an not sure that the UK France stand off is an example of "Asymmetric warfare" but rather an asymmetric war.</p>
<p>IMHO "Asymmetric warfare" exists when one or both parties use methods of warfare against the other which fall outside the widely accepted military doctrines of conventional warfare at the time the conflict takes place. As the methods used by the British and the Zulus fell within accepted military doctrines of the time, that war an asymmetric war, but not "Asymmetric warfare". --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 10:48, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Phillip, I think you're correct in your definition of terms here. The war may be one-sided without asymmetic warfare being used. The wording of the definition should reflect that.</p>
<p>"Asymmetric warfare is a term used to describe a military conflict between two unequal parties, where the weaker uses unorthodox means of warfare against the stronger." This is close, but I think it needs to be pointed out that the two parties are neither neccessarily weaker or stronger, just different. One party would be weaker IF it used conventional tactics. But it doesn't, and the tactics used often places it on equal, if not stronger footing than the conventional army.</p>
<p>Thus, terms like stronger and weaker don't apply directly, unless we're talking about a conventional situation. The tactics are based on numbers and size as well as technological and strategic strength and so the definitions should be as well. Maybe "of unequal conventional military strength"</p>
<p>"Asymmetric warfare is a term used to describe a military conflict between two forces of unequal conventional military strength, where the weaker army uses unorthodox means of warfare against the conventionally stronger to take advantage of relative strengths and weaknesses attributable to each force's relative size and strength compared to one another." --Andrewwinter 14:43, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Using asymmetric tactics, adversaries attempt to exploit their ability to hide in plain sight and attack U.S. forces in ways that are unconventional, unexpected and that turn the U.S. Army's own operating techniques against itself. Examples of these vulnerabilities are readily apparent. The reliance on vehicle road movement creates many opportunities for roadside bombs, for instance. Attempting to avoid such insurgent tactics by ferrying troops via helicopter between bases creates alternate opportunities for attacks on aircraft. Consolidating soldier services in one location, like a large dining facility, enhances physical security but also presents unique target opportunities.</dd>

<p>/The U.S Dept of defense did studies of assymetric warfare in the 80's where the result of the study on to the full extent of an assymetric joint attack would be. The results were that; planes filled with fuel containers hitting strategic sites, poisoning of water supply system, placing of biological agents in large companies enviromental system, attack of power supply system, destruction of bridges and destruction of dams limiting movement and recuparation, snipers and bombers suppressing policing and recuparation efforts.</p>
<p>Its amazing how the Washington sniper, 9/11 attacks, Anthrax attack, power blackouts in New York, Flooding of new orleans all happen in such a short time similar to the study but not the same at all.</p>
<p>The military response to the attack of such a force which might not be commanded by its goverment could also see a continouation of assymetric warfare in a built up area, high population density, where building searches or hunts for the militants they would blow buildings, shoot anti-tank or fragmentation devices into buildings also employ snipers. Cause a high casaualty rate of soldeirs and civilians to an enemy who seem not to deserve the response or have an ability to withstand their "enemy". Tactictal aproach and movement and skills minimising loss not employed by soldiers could see a high attrition rate of their soldiers against a military insignificant enemy compared to the militaries history in full conventional warfare.</p>
<p>Israel war against Hezbollah in the 2006 conflict by the Israeli military using semi-unconventional tactics shows still their limitations in engaging in this type of warfare.</p>
<p>Studies show change in warfare is usualy never respected untill late and every now and thern a new form or wave of assymetric warfare occurs it either wins in a short space of time or it happens gradualy and solutions are implemented in time untill the cycle begins again. I believe were now more tharn halfway into our cycle. DGIJTM.</p>

<p>What is this? <i>As with other military jargon, "asymmetric warfare" is a <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subjectivity.html" title="Subjectivity">subjective</a> term to refer to <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violence.html" title="Violence">violence</a> conducted by a familiar military force under the auspices of familiar goals and priorities.</i></p>
<p>That is no good. I'm scrapping it. This is neither Jargon, nor subjective, but rather a definable term. This intro includes nothing to do with unequal strength, which is key to the topic. --Andrewwinter 17:10, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Why is strength key to the article? Asymmetric warfare has more to do with the tactics used than the strength of the combatants. In most cases there is a difference in strength, but it's not definitionally part of asymmetric warfare. Nazi Germany engaged in asymmetric warfare on a massive scale, but not out of a sense of weakness. The same can be said of the USSR in WWII.</p>

<dd>IMHO it tries too much to focus on insurgency-type actions. Also, it should point out the disparity in forces and/or objectives isn't necessarily based on size. One side with overwhelming naval force (e.g. Britain) would be in an asymmetric condition with someone with land and air assets (e.g. Argentina)in the Falklands war. Assets affect tactics. An asymmetric condition exists when force, tactics, or objectives are not give and take. Insurgency actions are fish in a barrel, as in numbers versus firepower. <a href="../../../p/j/v/User%7EPjvolk66_c8f2.html" title="User:Pjvolk66">Pjvolk66</a> 04:09, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree that the section on Israel/Palestine is biased towards the Israeli point of view. By construting Israeli settlements on Palestinian land, Israel is in violation of Article 49, paragraph 6 of the Fourth Geneva Convention which prohibit the occupying power from transfering its own civilians to occupied territory. This is not disputed by the UN or the international community. In addition, Israel is in violation of UN resolution 242, the 2002 UN , on Torture, as well as other well documented human rights abuses. To not mention these at all and to just point the finger at the Palestinians for violating international law does a great disservice to this article and makes it have a very biased POV. I believe wikipedia can rise above the massive POV of the U.S. media which refuses to criticize Israel for any reason whatsoever. We need more people to look at this article and to stop reverting it to an Israeli/American POV. Picassorock 16:38, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would like someone to explain to me exactly what constitutes "Palestinian Land." The land of Palestine was never ruled by a sovereign group of self-described "palestinians." It had been conquered dozens of times in the past by the caananites, the persians, the romans, the byzantines, the crusaders, the mamluks, the ottomans, the british, and many others... see: <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Palestine_6849.html" title="History of Palestine">History of Palestine</a> During the formation of Israel, the zionists actually bought most of the land from the palestinians and worked together with them on communal farming projects and other such noble endeavors. The way I see it is that Israel has as much of a right to their land as anyone ever did, their only problem is that because of the constant attacks against them, and especially the Six Day War, they were forced to become quite militaristic and this has negative consequences for the Palestinians. But the terrorists who continue to provoke Israel and fire hundreds of rockets are certainly not helping matters. Imagine if someone fired hundreds of rockets at the United States, what consequences would there be for the perpetrators. I am actually impressed with the restraint and commitment to peace that Israel has shown.</p>

This should and can be highlighted in this reference to the conflict while maintaining an unbaised viewpoint.

<p>The article gives the dubious example of Hannibal as an example of "Asymmetric" warfare. Quote: <i>Hannibal attacked Roman forces on the Italian peninsula with a small military force, bolstered by loose alliances. He successfully used raids and threats to survive a Roman force that at times consisted of as many as 23 Legions,..</i></p>
<p>This is plain misleading. Hannibal tackled Rome with a conventional army of veterans battle hardened from decades of service in Spain, along with thousands of Gallic allies. His greatest victories and major impact was not raids and skirmishes, but full scale battle- mostly notable one of the greatest victories of all time that saw around 50,000 Romans dead, and further victories at the Trebia, Lake Trasmeine, and other place. Did he raid and skirmish? Of course- all armies of the time did that including the Romans. Raiding, skirmishing, aand screening of a main force is nothing new and is still standard military procedure today in conventional armies. The example of Hannibal used is both inaccurate and misleading.</p>
<p>As for David and Goliath, this was a standard contest of champions, typically used in ancient times, either as a prelude to the main battle or as a proxy for battle. To consider this an "example" of "asymmetric" warfare borders on incoherence.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I can agree with these points. The David and Goliath examples are very misleading, as David at no point utilized any tactics associated with Assymetrical warfare. However, the article does not refer to this contest as an example of Assymetrical Warfare, rather "the inspiration for the triumph of the weak and the oppressed over the strong and the mighty" Contest of Champions could indeed be considered conventional for the time period. Maybe a mention that this is NOT an example, but an inspiration, is required. I will add this.</dd>
