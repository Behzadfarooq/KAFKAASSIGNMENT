Kai's Power Tools are a set of digital image editing software created by Kai Krauss.A part of which were available asPlugIns for <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adobe.html" title="Adobe">Adobe</a><a href="../../../p/h/o/Photoshop.html" title="Photoshop">Photoshopand</a><a href="../../../c/o/r/Corel.html" title="Corel">Corel</a> <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photopaint.html" title="Photopaint">Photopaint</a>.With the closure of parent company Metacreations,many of the KPT are now owned by Corel Corporation and have been released along with other (former) metacreations products like <a href="../../../b/r/y/Bryce_%28software%29.html" title="Bryce (software)">Bryce</a>,<a href="../../../c/o/r/Corel_Painter_1af7.html" title="Corel Painter">Corel Painter</a>,<a href="../../../p/o/s/Poser_%28software%29.html" title="Poser (software)">Poser (software)</a>,and <a href="../../../v/e/c/Vector.html" title="Vector">Vector</a> Effects(<a href="../../../v/e/c/Vector_graphics.html" title="Vector graphics">Vector graphicssoftware</a>).There are various versions of Kai PowerTools namely KPT "3" ,"5","6","X"( features include a compilation of different filters)and "Convolver",which is a maths formula based <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filter.html" title="Filter">filterand</a> the level of precision and varying effects can be achieved by using numerical values of colour,<a href="../../../t/i/n/Tint.html" title="Tint">tint</a>,<a href="../../../h/u/e/Hue.html" title="Hue">hue</a>,<a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturation.html" title="Saturation">saturation</a>,<a href="../../../c/o/n/Contrast.html" title="Contrast">contrast</a>,<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brightness.html" title="Brightness">brightness</a>,luminousity,<a href="../../../p/o/s/Posterize.html" title="Posterize">posterize</a> etc.The programme interface features a reward based function in which a bonus function is revealed as the user advances towards more complex aspects of the tool.The <b>Kai Power Tools 6</b> features Lens Flare effect for precisely managing the type of glow, halo, streaks and reflection.In fact the sheer number of options in KPT 6 can be a problem as it makes it difficult to quickly set up the effect desired.In most cases though one can work around this by choosing an effect from the library of presets and then interactively positioning the flare in the preview.The <b>KPT Projector</b> takes the current image or selection and offers a number of interactive perspective warp effects. To a large extent, with its draggable distortion handles and its moving, scaling and rotating options, this simply duplicates <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adobe_Photoshop_5466.html" title="Adobe Photoshop">Adobe Photoshop</a><i>Distort filter</i> capabilities. What's completely different is the ability to rotate the bitmap image in 3D space and to tile the results if desired.It can also animate the distortions by dragging keyframes from the preview window into an <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animation.html" title="Animation">animation</a> palette. KPT 6 will then preview the animation and output it to various sizes in <a href="../../../a/v/i/Avi.html" title="Avi">avi</a> or <a href="../../../m/o/v/Mov.html" title="Mov">mov</a> format.This animation capability is even more useful with the <b>KPT Turbulence</b> filter. This is another distortion filter, but one that treats the image as if it was completely liquid.The preview panel shows the animation in real time.To produce a single frame freeform liquid distortion <b>KPT Goo</b> filter is used (Available both with KPT 6 and the standalone version ). It works by effectively turning a bitmap image into a liquid that can be interactively smeared, smudged, twirled and pinched with the range of tools on offer. The obvious use is to distort photographic portraits into caricatures. <a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Kpt6goofx.jpg">Image:Kpt6goofx.jpg</a> <b>KPT Reaction</b> featured in KPT 6 produces textures using a new engine in the form of "Reaction Seed". This takes a reaction "seed" and turns it into a seamlessly tiling pattern based on a reaction diffusion process.It offers random noise, regular dots or reticulated "<b>voronoi</b>" patterns or the bitmap image itself as the seede. <b>KPT Materializer</b>, can create advanced surface textures based on "bump maps" that define troughs and peaks.It can use any external image for the basis of the bump map or the user can pick out the hue, saturation, luminance or red, green or blue channel of the current image.It can then be offset, scale and rotate the texture map, control its lighting and even blend in a reflection map. The filter can be used for anything from providing an oil-painting feel to an entire image to giving the illusion of depth to a selection.Also producing the impression of depth is the <b>KPT Gel</b> filter which uses various paint tools to synthesize photo-realistic 3D materials such as metals, liquids or plastics. Gel painting is very different to traditional 2D painting as the brush strokes pool together when they touch and refract the underlying image.It can also manipulate 3D paint (once it has been added) by twirling, pinching and carving it.The opposite is true of the Equalizer filter which is used for applying variations on the most important of all effects, sharpening. The filter has three modes. The first, Equalizer, looks and works rather like the graphic equalizer on a hi-fi enabling adjustment of the level of pixel contrast within nine bands of different visual frequencies. The second, Contrast Sharpen, allows to increase the contrast between light and dark areas in an image. The third, Bounded Sharpen can sharpen an image without the oversharpening that produces distracting halo effects. The effect comes into its own when pulling out the detail in an image softened by resizing. The final two plug-ins work very differently to the main filters and each has its own very different interface. <b>KPT SceneBuilder</b> is used for producing photorealistic <a href="../../../3/d/_/3D_76aa.html" title="3D">3D</a> scenes by importing and rendering 3d Studio MAX files. The main image window offers three tabs for editing in 2D and 3D mode and for setting up your object's final texture. In many ways the filter is the most impressive of all, acting as a standalone <a href="../../../3/d/_/3D_modeler_731c.html" title="3D modeler">3D modeler</a>, and providing control over everything from transparency, reflection, refraction, bump mapping through to multiple light sources and so on, with no ability to create or edit objects. The final filter, <b>KPT SkyEffects</b>, also has its roots in Metacreations' experience with 3D programs such as <a href="../../../b/r/y/Bryce_%28software%29.html" title="Bryce (software)">Bryce</a> and RayDream, and is designed to simulate the interaction between the light from the sun or moon with no less than six atmospheric layers of haze, fog and cloud. In many ways the filter is typical of the KPT 6 collection as a whole. At times the interface is inspired, offering the ability to create beautiful reddening sunsets simply by interactively dragging the sun toward the horizon,producing stunningly realistic sunsets and moonscapes.</p>

<p>The release of <a href="../../../w/o/r/Works.html" title="Works">Works</a> in 1983 would have been an entirely insignificant occurrence, if not for the inclusion of one new composition in this collection of otherwise previously released songs."Embryo" was actually recorded by Pink Floyd during the sessions for 1969's "<a href="../../../u/m/m/Ummagumma.html" title="Ummagumma">Ummagumma</a>" album. However, since the song was recorded by the group, and thus didn't fit into the album's concept of providing time for each band member to do his own thing for a half of an album side, its release was put on hold.The song would eventually be issued in 1970, as part of "Picnic," a sampler compiled by the Harvest label, even though Roger Waters, the number's author, says that the song was never truly finished. Its inclusion on the "Works" album some 13 years later surely made it available to a wider audience, and boosted sales for the album. See :<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pink_Floyd#WikiProject_Album_format" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pink_Floyd#WikiProject_Album_format" rel="nofollow">Works By Pink Floyd</a></p>

<p><b>Roger Waters</b>:i'm currently working on <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Waters_9cbf.html" title="Roger Waters">Roger Waters</a> solo performances.Roger admitted that though he didn't use music from his <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pink_Floyd_f331.html" title="Pink Floyd">Pink Floyd</a> days or from his solo career as a basis for his writing, he did use those experiences and those concepts to guide him, and in particularly from his experiences working on "The Wall." He said in creating <a href="../../../c/a/_/Ca_Ira_0d36.html" title="Ca Ira">Ca Ira</a>, "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wall_cd64.html" title="The Wall">The Wall</a>" had influenced him because of the concepts of war, loss, alienation and the need for empathy and also because he was always ever mindful that this would be a live production. He explained that the idea for "The Wall" grew out of a drawing (that he still has) of a stage with a wall across it. The concept and the music, grew from that visual idea. Interestingly, Ca Ira grew out of Ettienes's wife's visuals and the idea that these characters would come alive in a live performance at some point. Roger did note that the Ca Ira piece; "My Dear Cousin Bourbon of Spain," was derived from the song; "Moment of Clarity 5:11 am," from the album The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking. He said many people don't notice the melody at first, but it is vaguely familiar to the trained ear of a Roger Waters fan. Roger talked a lot about about the concept of the album and the history of the story. He often referred to the parallels in current history, and stated that he refuses to allow himself to become cynical to the fact that things might change. He said that things (referring to the War today in Iraq, and those in the 20th century) really haven't changed that much since war in the 1700's. "Its still about loss of loved ones, loss of innocence and the loss of empathy..." but he said he thinks that there is still hope to make things change, hence the concept of Ca Ira "There Is Hope.

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Abyss creature breaksthrough.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then you can use {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, please read <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other media, please check that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Asydwaters_438c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Asydwaters">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>.
