<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/d/ASDA_86af.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The present ASDA Stores Limited was founded by Laura Beth Murray as Associated Dairies &amp; Farm Stores Ltd in 1949. However the formation of the ASDA name occurred in 1965 with the merger of the Asquith chain of three supermarkets and Associated Dairies; ASDA is an abbreviation of <b>AS</b>quith and <b>DA</b>iries.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>For a short time in the 1980s Asda Stores Ltd was a subsidiary of ASDA-MFI plc following a merger between the two companies. Other companies in the group were Associated Dairies Ltd, the furniture retailer <a href="../../../m/f/i/MFI_Retail_e0ca.html" title="MFI Retail">MFI</a> and Allied Carpets. After the sale of MFI and Allied Carpets the company name changed to ASDA Group plc. The dairy division was sold to <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Foods_811d.html" title="Northern Foods">Northern Foods</a> plc, meaning that ASDA today has no connection with the firm its name was derived from.</p>
<p>The company went through a troubled period in the early 1990s, but was then revived under the leadership of <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archie_Norman_b034.html" title="Archie Norman">Archie Norman</a>, who later became a front bench <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative</a> <a href="../../../m/e/m/Member_of_Parliament_22d1.html" title="Member of Parliament">MP</a>. He was chairman of the company during the period 1996–99.</p>
<p>ASDA, which then owned 229 stores, was purchased by <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wal-Mart_0d83.html" title="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a> of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_26.html" title="July 26">July 26</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>.</p>
<p>Since the takeover ASDA has continued to maintain its headquarters at the then newly opened "ASDA House". ASDA House was one of the first of the new large office blocks to open as part of the redevelopment of the huge area south of the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Aire_3ff6.html" title="River Aire">River Aire</a> from the city centre of <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds.html" title="Leeds">Leeds</a>, in the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holbeck.html" title="Holbeck">Holbeck</a> district, <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Yorkshire_4693.html" title="West Yorkshire">West Yorkshire</a>.</p>
<p>In 2005, amid reported concerns within Wal-Mart about a slight slippage in market share, partially due to a resurgent <a href="../../../s/a/i/Sainsbury%27s.html" title="Sainsbury's">Sainsbury's</a>, ASDA's chief executive, Tony de Nunzio, was replaced by Andy Bond. In the same year, Asda expanded into <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> by purchasing 12 <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safeway_%28UK%29_ba64.html" title="Safeway (UK)">Safeway</a> stores from <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morrisons.html" title="Morrisons">Wm Morrison Supermarkets plc</a>.</p>

<p>Following the takeover by Wal-Mart, several "<a href="../../../a/s/d/ASDA_Wal-Mart_Supercentre_cd21.html" title="ASDA Wal-Mart Supercentre">Asda–Wal*Mart Supercentres</a>" have been opened, creating some of the largest <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypermarket.html" title="Hypermarket">hypermarkets</a> in the United Kingdom. The first of these stores opened at <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patchway.html" title="Patchway">Patchway</a>, near <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol.html" title="Bristol">Bristol</a>, in August 2000. At first, it was criticised for its scale and condemned as an eyesore. In November 2004 a refurbishment of the <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypermarket.html" title="Hypermarket">hypermarket</a> was completed, addressing some of the complaints.</p>
<p>In October 2004 ASDA launched a new format called 'Asda Living'. This is the company's first 'general merchandise' store, containing all its non-food ranges including clothing, home electronics, toys, homewares, health and beauty products. The first store with this format opened in <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walsall.html" title="Walsall">Walsall</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Midlands_%28county%29_3cb5.html" title="West Midlands (county)">West Midlands</a>, and at the time of writing has been followed by six further stores in Cortonwood (<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnsley.html" title="Barnsley">Barnsley</a>), Altrincham, Byker (Newcastle-upon-Tyne), Thurrock, <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essex.html" title="Essex">Essex</a>, <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> and Leeds Crown Point. <a href="../../../t/e/s/Tesco.html" title="Tesco">Tesco</a> is also trialling a similar format, "Homeplus", in Denton, Greater Manchester. Asda has also opened a number of stores containing its George range only in several city centres.</p>
<p>In April 2006, ASDA launched a new format called <i>ASDA Essentials</i> in a former <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermarket_cooperative.html" title="Supermarket cooperative">Co-op</a> store in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northampton.html" title="Northampton">Northampton</a>, followed by another in Pontefract a month later. This was modelled on the French <a href="http://www.leader-price-int.com/anglais/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.leader-price-int.com/anglais/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Leaderprice</a> chain, with a smaller floorplate than ASDA's mainstream stores. <i>Essentials</i> focuses primarily on own-brand products, only stocking branded items that are perceived to be at the "core" of a family's weekly shop. This style of retailing is an attempt to addreess competition from discount supermarkets such as <a href="../../../a/l/d/Aldi.html" title="Aldi">Aldi</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/d/Lidl.html" title="Lidl">Lidl</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netto.html" title="Netto">Netto</a>. On 6 December 2006 <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a> newspaper reported that further planned store openings were under review following poor sales in the existing outlets. It was also revealed that the range of branded products has been expanded.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> In early January 2007 it was announced that the initial trial Essentials store would close within a month after only 10 months of trading<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In 2004, the George clothing brand <i>(see below)</i> was extended to a number of standalone George stores on the high street. The George label is named after <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Davies_%28retailer%29_4193.html" title="George Davies (retailer)">George Davies</a>, founder of <a href="../../../n/e/x/Next_%28retailer%29.html" title="Next (retailer)">Next</a>, who went on to set up the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Per_Una_2c77.html" title="Per Una">Per Una</a> clothing business for <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marks_%26_Spencer_2ad4.html" title="Marks &amp; Spencer">Marks &amp; Spencer</a>.</p>
<p>In February 2007, ASDA announced that it will create 8,000 new jobs by building a minimum of 18 new supermarkets across the UK this year. In addition, it is to carry out major extensions and improvements to 15 of its stores and to roll out its successful non-food format 'ASDA Living' to a further 10 sites over the next 12 months. Four thousand new jobs will be created through its new store programme and another 2,000 jobs through the company's new seasonal plus scheme at its 334 UK stores. Finally, a further 200 jobs will be generated through the growth of organic products.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/d/ASDA_86af.html" title="Edit section: Market share">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Market share</span></h2>
<p>As of February 2007, <a href="../../../t/e/s/Tesco.html" title="Tesco">Tesco</a> has 31.4% of the <a href="../../../t/n/s/TNS_Superpanel_48c9.html" title="TNS Superpanel">UK grocery market</a> while ASDA's share is 16.8%, followed by Sainsbury's at 16.5%, and Morrisons at 11.0%.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is widely expected, as predicted by former ASDA boss Tony de Nunzio in 2006, that Sainsbury's will reclaim second place at some point in the short to medium term, but this has not happened as yet.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/s/d/ASDA_86af.html" title="Edit section: Marketing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Marketing</span></h2>
<p>ASDA is known for two famous marketing campaigns. In the "ASDA price" campaign, customers tap their trouser pocket twice, producing a 'chinking' sound as the coins that ASDA's low prices have supposedly left in their pockets knock together. In the late 1980s, prior to the reintroduction of the tap pocket campaign, advertising for ASDA had featured the <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairground_Attraction_15f6.html" title="Fairground Attraction">Fairground Attraction</a> song <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perfect_%28Fairground_Attraction_song%29_6b5e.html" title="Perfect (Fairground Attraction song)">Perfect</a>. In 2004, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharon_Osbourne_24d5.html" title="Sharon Osbourne">Sharon Osbourne</a> was selected to be part of a new marketing campaign by ASDA; her last advert was aired in August 2005. In the smiley face "rollback" campaign, also used in Wal-Mart advertisements, a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer-generated_imagery.html" title="Computer-generated imagery">CGI</a> smiley face bounces from price tag to price tag, knocking them down as customers watch. The focus of these campaigns is to portray ASDA as the most affordable supermarket in the country, a claim that is challenged by competitors, especially <a href="../../../t/e/s/Tesco.html" title="Tesco">Tesco</a>. Currently in ASDA advertising is a theme featuring singing children and the previous tap of the trouser pocket advertising was reduced to a double-tap on a stylised 'A', still producing the 'chinking' sound. This has included an advert during the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_FIFA_World_Cup_25dc.html" title="2006 FIFA World Cup">2006 FIFA World Cup</a> featuring the <a href="../../../e/n/g/England_national_football_team.html" title="England national football team">England</a> footballer <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Owen_bd93.html" title="Michael Owen">Michael Owen</a> in an advert with the children singing <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vindaloo_%28song%29.html" title="Vindaloo (song)">Vindaloo</a>.</p>
<p>ASDA has been winner of the Grocer Magazine "Lowest Price Supermarket" Award for the past 9 years, and uses this to promote itself across the UK. In August 2005, rival supermarket chain <a href="../../../t/e/s/Tesco.html" title="Tesco">Tesco</a> challenged ASDA's ability to use the claim that it was the cheapest supermarket in the country, by complaining to the <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advertising_Standards_Agency_860b.html" title="Advertising Standards Agency">Advertising Standards Agency</a>. The ASA upheld the complaint<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> and ordered ASDA to stop using it, citing that the Grocer Magazine survey was based on limited and unrepresentative evidence as it examined the price of just 33 products, and that the survey did not study low-cost supermarkets such as <a href="../../../a/l/d/Aldi.html" title="Aldi">Aldi</a>. As a result ASDA no longer cites itself as "Officially Britain's lowest priced supermarket", instead using "Winner: Britain's lowest price supermarket award".</p>
<p>ASDA has attempted to trademark the word <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chav.html" title="Chav">chav</a> for a new line of confectionery. ASDA spokeswoman Rebecca Liburd said: "With slogans from characters in shows such as Little Britain and the Catherine Tate Show providing us with more and more contemporary slang, our Whatever sweets — now nicknamed chav hearts — have become very popular with kids and grown-ups alike. We thought we needed to give them some respect and have decided to trademark our sweets."</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, the company was criticised by some of its employees for the treatment their fellow workers received in both stores and depots across the country<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>.</p>
<p>On "double discount day" in December <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, ASDA temporarily increased the staff discount to 20%, but excluded alcoholic drinks from the extra discount for reasons of "operational profit protection". The <a href="../../../g/m/b/GMB_Union_255a.html" title="GMB Union">GMB Union</a> attempted to get <a href="../../../t/e/s/Tesco.html" title="Tesco">Tesco</a> to offer a similar discount to ASDA staff as a <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publicity_stunt.html" title="Publicity stunt">publicity stunt</a>, and ASDA subsequently included these products in the extra discount, but with a maximum spend of £100, down from £250 in the years before the alterations. While the reinstatement of the discount was intended to be a <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publicity_stunt.html" title="Publicity stunt">publicity stunt</a> that improved colleague relations, it resulted in further bitter feelings. This was due to the fact that in the years previously, music <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albums.html" title="Albums">albums</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/n/Single_%28music%29.html" title="Single (music)">singles</a>, <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVDs</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/d/Videos.html" title="Videos">videos</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/d/Videogames.html" title="Videogames">videogames</a> had been included in the discount day, but were not reinstated with the rest of the discount after ASDA backed down.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>From 2006 ASDA no longer requires job applicants to provide their date of birth, exceeding government anti-discrimination requirements.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>In August 2005, the manager of the <a href="../../../w/a/k/Wakefield.html" title="Wakefield">Wakefield</a> depot read out what were called "foreign-sounding" names over the public address system ordering them to report immediately to the manager's office. The workers, who were all Muslims, were ordered to produce evidence that they were not illegal immigrants. At least one was threatened with the sack unless he produced his passport the next day. The highly public initiative by management, which came within weeks of the <a href="../../../7/_/j/7_July_2005_London_bombings_2280.html" title="7 July 2005 London bombings">7 July</a> bombings in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, was followed by a spate of graffiti at the depot in Wakefield expressing hatred and contempt for Muslims and their religion.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>In February 2006, Asda was fined £850,000 for offering employees of a newly taken over distribution depot a pay rise to give up union rights. An employment tribunal found the American-owned supermarket chain guilty of promising 340 distribution staff a 10 per cent pay rise to give up the collective agreement negotiated by the GMB union – an act which is illegal under <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_Union_and_Labour_Relations_%28Consolidation%29_Act_1992_f9b8.html" title="Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992">1992 labour relations law</a>.

<p>ASDA launched its <a href="../../../o/n/l/Online_shop.html" title="Online shop">online retailer service</a> in 1998, but from the start had over-estimated demand. It began with a dedicated depot based in <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croydon.html" title="Croydon">Croydon</a>, South London, but this was closed with a number of <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redundancy_%28law%29.html" title="Redundancy (law)">redundancies</a> shortly after as sales were lower than expected. It continued the online service, but emulated the Tesco store-based model instead.</p>
<p>Since the roll-out of the grocery delivery operation ASDA has moved into non-food online retailing. Current categories include entertainment, contact lenses, furniture, travel, electricals, gifts, mobile phones and flowers, with more categories being launched each year.</p>
<p>In May 2004 it announced a major expansion of the service which will increase coverage from 30% of the UK population to 35%. <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Grocer_980a.html" title="The Grocer">The Grocer</a></i> magazine reported a turnaround in the fortunes of ASDA's home shopping service under new head of Home Shopping, Richard Ramsden.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> More recently, ASDA stepped up its commitment to home shopping, focusing on full UK coverage by the end of 2007. Andy Bond highlighted that ASDA will be recruiting up to 1,800 new staff to bolster its operations and focus on competing with Tesco in the online arena.</p>
<p>In January 2007, ASDA lauched <i><a href="http://www.asda-electricals.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.asda-electricals.co.uk" rel="nofollow">www.asda-electricals.co.uk</a></i>. This new venture is part of its online business, with more than 3,000 domestic and home electrical products. ASDA's long term ambition to capture 5% of the £1.9bn market by 2012. Recently, the company sold its Durabrand 1005 DVD player for only 9GBP, the UK's lowest priced DVD player, which sold out in just two days from start of the promotion.</p>

ASDA's George brand</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>ASDA has its own range of clothing known as <b>George</b>. This is marketed as quality fashion clothing at affordable prices. Wal-Mart also sells the George brand in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Korea_aa29.html" title="South Korea">South Korea</a>. This George label was named after <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Davies_%28retailer%29_4193.html" title="George Davies (retailer)">George Davies</a>, the founder of <a href="../../../n/e/x/Next_%28retailer%29.html" title="Next (retailer)">Next</a>, who was its original chief designer. He is no longer associated with the brand, although it has aimed to remain true to the high quality, low price business model that he established.</p>
<p>In 2005, ASDA stated that the George range was a £1.75 billion business, including sales from Wal-Mart stores in the US and Germany. Mintel estimate that George is the fourth largest retailer of clothing in the United Kingdom, after <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marks_and_Spencer_8469.html" title="Marks and Spencer">Marks and Spencer</a>, the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arcadia_Group_34af.html" title="Arcadia Group">Arcadia Group</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/x/Next_%28retailer%29.html" title="Next (retailer)">Next</a>.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Staff at ASDA House, its Leeds headquarters, are asked to take part in what is called 'George Day', a non-uniform day when they must wear at least one item of 'George at Asda' clothing.</p>
<p>ASDA is the first supermarket to stock <a href="../../../w/e/d/Wedding_dress.html" title="Wedding dress">wedding dresses</a>. Part of the George line, they cost just £60. Adult bridesmaid dresses ranged between £30 and £35, at launch.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Asda's newest addition to the George range is a pet line selling such things as collars, dog bandanas, gems for pet collars and even dog hair clips.</p>

<p>In 2006, a group of labour rights organisations argued that as part of one of the world's largest companies, ASDA is in a position to influence the fashion industry to ensure higher standards for workers throughout the supply chain. ASDA has signed up to the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) which respects workers rights for freedom of association and a living wage. Implementing this initiative is difficult, however, because the concept of a living wage varies between countries and the buying strategies of a major importer like ASDA have an indirect impact on national minimum wages by obliging governments to set them low enough to stop businesses going elsewhere.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
