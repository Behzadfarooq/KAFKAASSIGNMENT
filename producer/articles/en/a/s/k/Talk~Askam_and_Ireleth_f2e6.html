<p>Ok, I have just completed a fair rewrite, with sources. Now, I plan on taking some photos when I find the time. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 21:27, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks, never had the time to look up all the sources&#160;! Think the merger source might not exist because the length of time over which it took place probably made it unnoteworthy <a href="../../../k/i/j/User%7EKijog_7ce5.html" title="User:Kijog">Kijog</a> 21:29, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Right then, I think that should be removed then. I am gonna head out, armed with a camera, later today, and get some pictures, so showing the 'Welcome to Askam and Ireleth' sign may give a good enough idea of the fact that they are merged. I intend to take the following pictures- two churches, two schools, two road signs ('Welcome to Askam and Ireleth'/'Welcome to Ireleth') panoramic views of the village, the station, the pier, the slag banks, the jubilee fountain, and the brick works. However, if I can't find a bike with tires, I may have to shorten that list slightly. Anything else that would make a good picture? I have lived here all my life, but I don't actually know where the Life Boat station is...<a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 13:20, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The inshore rescue station is on the 'harbour' to the northern side of the slag pier, end of Sharp/Steel Streets. <a href="../../../k/i/j/User%7EKijog_7ce5.html" title="User:Kijog">Kijog</a> 15:12, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Update on the finding a source to prove the merger, Barrow B.C. has an online map resource which includes an <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ministry_of_Defence_3a62.html" title="Ministry of Defence">MoD</a> aerial map from wartime still showing a gap between the two. Still, might be difficult to reference using a single URL <a href="../../../k/i/j/User%7EKijog_7ce5.html" title="User:Kijog">Kijog</a> 10:50, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just don't think it is gonna be easy to find a map from the mid eighties, and a map from the early nineties, to compare and say 'Look, they are separate there, but they are not there!' Also, I reckon that it <i>could</i> count as original research, and that it isn't awfully relevant anyway. Perhaps if we link to Google Maps in the 'External links' section, people will be able to see for themselves how the villages are basically physically one, and the fact that it is a pleasant day today, and it is the weekend, means I can finally go and get some photos. The fact that they share a symbol, share a sign, are the same administratively and are melded on a map should portray the fact that they are basically the same with verifiable information, and no need to mess around with umpteen questionable sources. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 12:01, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The information about there being a Catholic church in the village was removed, despite being sourced, and I have since realised that there is no Catholic church, but that the site I used as a source failed to mention the C of E church. I have contacted the site about the matter. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 15:53, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As far as I can see, the box that has been added is a few degrees off, in terms of which direction is North. A map source would be nice, as it appears to me that <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Ireleth,+England&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=33.29802,59.765625&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=13&amp;ll=54.17389,-3.191528&amp;spn=0.048029,0.173035&amp;om=1" class="external text" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Ireleth,+England&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=33.29802,59.765625&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=13&amp;ll=54.17389,-3.191528&amp;spn=0.048029,0.173035&amp;om=1" rel="nofollow">this</a> disagrees with what is said. Or, at least, it is if 'Up=North', as I have always thought it does.<a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 19:09, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I treated it as the order in which you would find the different villages, as there is no way of expressing the degrees of difference (e.g NNE, NE, NEE etc) between Marton, Lindal, Dalton and so on in such an inforbox. I don't think there is any point in referencing this information, firstly because we have a map reference earlier on in the article and secondly i don't think this infobox is designed to express geographical reality, rather its geography with respect to relevant Wikipedia articles.</p>
<p>On another point, I don't agree with <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar's</a> removal of the railway line infobox, as I think this is information better suited to this page rather than the <a href="../../../a/s/k/Askam_railway_station.html" title="Askam railway station">Askam railway station</a> page. I fear this stub will remain a stub because of a lack of interesting information about what is essentially a countryside railway stop and I would argue the information is better held in this page under a subheading. <a href="../../../k/i/j/User%7EKijog_7ce5.html" title="User:Kijog">Kijog</a> 10:41, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I disagree. I think if the station actually is allowed an article, no doubt someone at WikiProject:Trains or something thinks it is, we should just mention the fact that Askam has a station, and have an even briefer overview of the station than its own article, and link to it. It looks slightly more professional within the article, in my opinion. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 12:03, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I accept your point - we'll just have to add some more info to the railway station article! <a href="../../../k/i/j/User%7EKijog_7ce5.html" title="User:Kijog">Kijog</a> 17:27, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, I have two photos that I will add to it now. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 19:46, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have added the photos, and a little info. There is more that can be said, and it needs to be sourced. I am gonna search for a template for an article on a station, see if I can find an approrpaite WikiProject, and improve the article. (Forgot to add the timestamp to this comment, so here is a later one, just to point out that it was me- <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 23:00, 17 December 2006 (UTC))</p>

<p>Well, I finally got them, and they aren't awful, but it would be better if the weather was a little better. I also have 'Image:Askam and Ireleth-View from cemetary-17.12.06.jpg' and a bunch I didn't bother uploading. Any others that people want I will be happy to get, if you give me some time.

<p>Should we move the public buildings gallery to the bottom, think it makes an unatural break in the text with only politics left at the bottom? Or alternatively move the public buildings section to the bottom of the text? <a href="../../../k/i/j/User%7EKijog_7ce5.html" title="User:Kijog">Kijog</a> 21:53, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The brick works is something that we have completely neglected to mention. I do not have time to confirm this now, but I have heard that it once had the tallest chimney in Britain. That means it may even be worthy of its own article, and certainly deserves a mention here! <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 19:48, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As a fact it sounds pretty trivial for an article on its own, but teh brickworks are a major part of understandthing the towns, I agree. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 20:22, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yeah, that occured to me the other day, think it might struggle to fulfil the claim of tallest chimney though! <a href="../../../k/i/j/User%7EKijog_7ce5.html" title="User:Kijog">Kijog</a> 20:35, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, and a another thing - I think we could incorporate some text on the Askam and Ireleth logo somewhere. As far as I know it was designed by the Parish council a few years ago. A better pic to illustrate it would be the sign on the A595 entering Askam from the Dalton Bypass. (a polite request! I used to live in Ireleth but I'm not around anymore to do any snapping!) <a href="../../../k/i/j/User%7EKijog_7ce5.html" title="User:Kijog">Kijog</a> 21:03, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Three points- firstly, I have been told that it used to be the tallest (over 100 years ago) and that it has had some of the height cut down. Secondly, I was under the impression that the logo was designed by a pupil at Ireleth school- again, not something I have a source for beyond a vague recollection of being told it. Finally, I did get a picture of that sign, but, by the time I got there, it was evening, and the flash made the sign unreadable. I will get a picture of it as soon as I can. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 22:59, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, you learn something new everyday! From what I have had a look at, the brickworks have been around since 1845, so there's nothing to say it wasn't true at the time. The Ireleth pupil designing the logo rings a bell as well, when I get a chance I will try and draw a copy, because it's not the most complex logo in the world! Photo work much appreciated, reckon Askam and Ireleth beats every other article for Cumbria! <a href="../../../k/i/j/User%7EKijog_7ce5.html" title="User:Kijog">Kijog</a> 17:02, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>When I rewrote this, I thought that I might be able to make a <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_articles_eaa4.html" title="Wikipedia:Good articles">good article</a> out of it, and with the amounts of contributions we have had recently, I don't think this article is far from it. I think there are a couple of pictures that we still need to get, and a few pieces of information we still need to get down, but I think it is very in sight. What is everyone's opinion on the matter? <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 21:47, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, why not? I think we need a bit more on the writing side of things (I'm a journalist, I would say that!). It's a little too fact/reference heavy for it to be an easy to read article. In terms of topics needing more coverage: geology/wildlife/brickworks/areas (Mark McLean makes a point somewhere about which came first: The Lots or the station end?)/Demographics (I have some stuff collated about that). The only other thing is suggestions of the correct order of things. Our wildlife/enviroment/politic etc etc has clearly outgrown its space and become a little unwieldy with too many different subsections. Suggestions on a discussion page please! I would go for three overarching sections: History / Environment / Nuts and Bolts (stuff like the politics, demographics, transport but with a more 'encyclopaedic' name!) <a href="../../../k/i/j/User%7EKijog_7ce5.html" title="User:Kijog">Kijog</a> 18:55, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah. Bare in mind that when you put it up as a candidate, someone will review it and if it's not adequate, give you comments on what could be improved and a week to make improvments. Plus there's usually a 2-4 week wait before it gets reviewed, so plenty of time to work on it up till then. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 20:58, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have nominated it. There are a couple of things I want to touch up, but judging from the dates on the other articles in the category, we have ages. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 00:46, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok, I have a few notes about the references. First of all, I reckon that if we add any more, it would look best if we had them in two columns. Secondly, I dislike the way that we have no citations in the opening paragraphs. I only brought these up because it has been said that the article is very citation heavy- I think it looks bad that we have no citations in the opening, when the article is citation heavy. Also, the reshuffle of the intro has removed a few citations that are needed for the infobox. I am gonna have a mess around with these things now. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 22:11, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Point accepted, I tend to operate a write first, reference later policy as it's no always easy to write good English at the same time as doing the fiddly references. I have a good reference lined up for the population and intend to lob in a table as well for good measure. Agree with the two column idea. <a href="../../../k/i/j/User%7EKijog_7ce5.html" title="User:Kijog">Kijog</a> 08:20, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Some notes about the names of the villages have been included in naming, some have been included in the history section. Should they all be moved into one place? Perhaps 'naming' should simply be used for a discussion of whether the villages are seperate, and whether they should be '-in-Furness', where as the history section should have the origin of the names, the historical names and the Ireleth/Kirby-Ireleth confusion? <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 23:47, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would go for the one section option. The -in-Furness question essentially only applies to Ireleth while the separate villages question could be tacked onto the Askam section (as it was second). Good work for nominating the article, if it comes off by my reckoning it would be the only 3rd place in the UK to make that grade. <a href="../../../k/i/j/User%7EKijog_7ce5.html" title="User:Kijog">Kijog</a> 20:36, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Fix footnotes 2/7/22, they're external jumps. Para 2 of lead is long and awkward. See if you can smooth it. Add a latitude/longitude to the infobox or use coor templates. Scan for footnotes, they go AFTER punctuation with no space, you have several more. <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 19:10, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll work on the footnotes in about an hour, I am off for a short while. Kijog/Robdurbar/Anyone else, do you think you could add the long/lat, and sort out the too-long paragraph? <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 19:15, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'm not against para 2 being cleared up, looking back at the word 'whereas' I humbly repent my error&#160;:-), but surely Askam's as the start of the Industrial Revolution could be kept as one of its most important 'claims to fame'? Also, without redesigning the whole 'England place infobox', how do we put in the co-ordinates? I see Shaw and Crompton have reached good article status without. Finally, I don't want to seem to be telling more experienced editors what is right and wrong, but IMHO references should be closest to the statement they support, as some sentences contain more than one piece of information <a href="../../../k/i/j/User%7EKijog_7ce5.html" title="User:Kijog">Kijog</a> 22:37, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I have added the fields to the infobox, however, I have no idea what the longtitude and latitude of Askam and Ireleth actually are. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 22:49, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I stand corrected on the lat/long, having actually bothered to look at Template:Infobox England place! I think the values are 54.1888 (N) and -3.2042 (W) assuming the corner of the A595 by the railway station, which I think is used as the 'centrepoint' of Askam <a href="../../../k/i/j/User%7EKijog_7ce5.html" title="User:Kijog">Kijog</a> 22:57, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The reference thing doesn't mean that refs can't come next to the info, but that if they're next to a piece of punctuation, they come after it (as the fake refs in the next sentence do).

<p>GA Pass: I did some sample edits for you. For more improvement, learn to use the cite templates better and be consistent in ref formatting. Perhaps add culture and education sections.

<p>I'm not sure how we would go about that. The information exists on the maps database of Barrow Borough Council but it appears 'unURLable'. Is there a ruling on 'visual' references? Otherwise, I would say there is no reference needed because they are all real places which still exist, where do you draw the line on 'sky is blue' refs? Apart from that, if it was good enough to pass the Good Article status why remove it now? It adds content, and without getting too much into the metapedians vs exopedians debate, good content makes for good articles, not good references. <a href="../../../k/i/j/User%7EKijog_7ce5.html" title="User:Kijog">Kijog</a> 10:58, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If it exists on a map, you could cite the map, as long as you are not drawinbg any conclusions for it, which would constitute original research. There is a policy about things being obvious, but I can't find it right now, and I doubt this would be covered. Is there an online version of the map, even if it is un-URLable? I can't search right now, I am at school. Basically, I reckon if you do have a map source (whether it is a virtual or hard map) that shows these four roads and the river, dated appropriately, then there would be absolutely no problem. This was the only source that I couldn't sort out with the new information that would be needed for featured. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 15:27, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
