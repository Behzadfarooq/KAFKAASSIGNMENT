<p>Until you write a longer userpage, you might want to consider setting up your userpage as a redirect to your talkpage, by adding <code>#REDIRECT&#160;[[User&#160;talk:Askari&#160;Mark]]</code> to your userpage. It will make things easier for other editors, because they won't have to deal with redlinks to your userpage.</p>

Your signature is pointing not to your user page or talk, but to the user page of the user Name, <a href="../../../n/a/m/User%7EName_cec2.html" title="User:Name">user:Name</a> (by the way, that user has only about 3 edits, and has been blocked indefinetely).

<dd>Thank you for the notice. There was a period during August and through most of September where something happened to my talk page link. If you click on it, it still links to "user:Name". Oddly, though, the occasionaly new talk page I've only worked on since then also sometimes gets referenced to "user:Name", even though my user name appears correctly. I have no idea why. I've gone back and tried to eliminate all of the past mentions of "user:Name", replacing it with my proper name. We'll see how that works. (BTW, you should set up your Talk page; right now you're only linked to your personal page.) Thanks again, Mark.</dd>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I like the wikitable you have designed for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_air_forces.html" title="List of air forces">List of air forces</a>, but if you are going to run multiple countries together in a single table, may I suggest a more significant line separator between nations?</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree and know this is not the only table that could benefit from (say) a slightly thicker border between nations. I reckon the simplest/neatest/most effective method would be to add an appropriate CSS class next to the row dividers (i.e. |- class="<i>rowborderthing</i>") but don't know what "<i>rowborderthing</i>" might be... (...Just tried a quick internet search, but nothing obvious returned...) &#160;I guess I could ask one of the HTML/CSS guys I've passed by here, unless you have another idea...? &#160;Glad you like the wikitable approach, although a little complicated; I hope Lars (<a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecessary_Evil_ef9c.html" title="User:Necessary Evil">Necessary Evil</a>) does as well. Even if something simpler used, I'd say sorting out some kind of alignment/s for the flags/roundels will be a major improvement.

<dl>
<dd>I'm afraid I'm among the HTML-challenged; I only know enough to be dangerous.&#160;:o I tried to see if I could change the style of the border lines between nations to something like the border="2" formula I've used for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_military_aircraft_of_Japan_5dc2.html" title="List of military aircraft of Japan">List of military aircraft of Japan</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_military_aircraft_of_the_Soviet_Union_and_the_CIS_8f48.html" title="List of military aircraft of the Soviet Union and the CIS">List of military aircraft of the Soviet Union and the CIS</a>, but I gave up after an hour of messing around trying to get it to work with the wikitable template. I've browsed around trying to find an example of coding to do that, but without luck. Maybe Lars has an idea??? ... of course, I don't feel so bad since <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">Mets501</a> also had problems. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> | <strong class="selflink">Talk</strong> 21:29, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>...Decided the above was probably more trouble than it was worth (but spawned {{Trb}} and {{<a href="../../../t/a/b/Template%7ETable_3311.html" title="Template:Table">Table</a>}} as a result). Meanwhile, have switched the border colo/urs from silver to darkgrey; how do they look now...? &#160;Yours, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Kernow_9a2b.html" title="User:David Kernow">David</a> <span style="font-size:90%;">(<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Kernow_cdd2.html" title="User talk:David Kernow">talk</a>)</span> 03:07, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I do like the slightly darker outer border. However, {{Trb}} appears to have no effect. I ran the width up to 100px and nothing happened. I don't know why this should be so. Is there something about <b>class="wikitable"</b> that locks out subsequent formatting changes? If so, would creating a <b>class="wikitable-trb"</b> work? <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> | <strong class="selflink">Talk</strong> 22:44, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Damn... looks like this may be a browser problem; {{Trb}} seems to work fine with Firefox, but not with IE (is that what you're using...?) &#160;I'll try looking into it a little and/or asking someone more knowledgeable.

<dd>This is very strange, and I can't think of what is causing it. Perhaps it has something to do with the pipe "|" divider between the two links in your signature.</dd>

<dd>Mark, have a look at your preferences ("my preferences" link at the top of the page). What exactly is in the signature field, and do you have the "raw signature" box checked?</dd>

<dd>Thanks for taking a look, Michael! The change occurred on Nov. 28th, although it's hard to narrow down the time. My last post on the 27th was timestamped at 19:34.

Is it possible that you were using something like {{username}} in your sig field at the time, or that you simply entered incorrectly and didn't notice until later? I've never seen a change in a Wikipedia page that doesn't show up in the history, although I believe there is a way for an admin to revert a vandal and leave its work hidden.&#160;<i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2006-12-01&#160;20:53&#160;Z</small></i></dd>

<dd>No, since I first set it as "User:Askari Mark|Askari Mark", I've only changed it to fix the "User:User" problem. The odd thing to me is that whatever is happening, my signature in old posts gets changed. I would expect the changed signature to start appearing in posts subsequent to whatever caused it. It also appears to take time to propagate. As I began checking my sig in old posts, some that were initially okay I later found to be changed — although none that I had fixed have reverted. My best guess would be that something or someone "resets" my user name code to "user" and the system slowly tries to correct this until I fix my sig. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> | <strong class="selflink">Talk</strong> 21:14, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You wrote... Then the best that can be done is probably to describe it as "what would today be called a form of 'concubinage'", and explain the kind of relationship it was then through a brief description in the text or as a footnote or possibly with a link (if there is a suitable article on Muslim marriage customs). <b>I settle for your suggestion and award you a barnstar for the refreshing logic that was lacking from all parties of that discussion.</b></p>

<p>May I second this Barnstar? It's always wonderful, especially with the pathetic excuse for public discourse that exists in the United States, to see anyone respond to a dispute with thorough research instead of just rhetoric. I gave a Barnstar to <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">Jossi</a> for a similar reason, and I would like to quote here what I said there:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was supremely impressed with the way that you stepped into the talkpage and did a lot of research into the question. I tried to be a voice of reason and moderation, but was simply too lazy/distracted to put in the effort that you did. I don't know you that well, but that one example speaks very highly of your skills as a Wikipedian.</p>

<dd>Thank you very much for your kind words, Karl! I am an analyst by profession and much of my job is basically to cut through wrong, contradictory, and incomplete information to determine the "ground truth" (or as near an approach as is possible). I also have a broad interest in world history. I believe I came across the issue on your talk page, as a matter of fact, and thought I might be able to make a useful and neutral contribution since I have no stake in the article or its subject. As it happens, I made an effort some time back to learn about different and unusual (to me) cultural practices of ancient Middle Eastern societies. That coincided with making friends with a nice couple from the UAE who were open to discussing all sorts of things in a "civilized, Western manner" (they were UK-educated). They even gave me a gift of a copy of what they felt was the best annotated English version of the Qur'an, which I read. So I at least have a passing familiarity with it. Unfortunately, as you noted, the quality of public discourse in the US (and in the Middle East) is rather blunt, insipid and uninformed, so it's rare that I get to exercise it. In any case, I've probably exhausted what I can do for the Safiyya article, as what it needs is well beyond my level of experience and interest ... and I have too many projects which <i>are</i> in line with my interests and more expert knowledge on my to-do list as it is. (BTW, I think you should have kept the Ingoolemo handle.) <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> <small><strong class="selflink">(Talk)</strong></small> 00:02, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As best as I was able to discern, the TCP/IP card went bad and a replacement has been ordered by my "mechanic." During all of this, I also confirmed my suspicion that Microsoft's IE7 is evil. Each successive version of Internet Explorer has been buggier than the last, and even with my RAM maxed out and generous virtual memory, response times significantly worsened when I first downloaded it — and greatly improved after I removed it amidst my travails. IE6 is much better, but I plan to download Firefox after I get my 'puter back. I'm hoping to be back online at home by this weekend and I'll take a look at the "LOAF'ed list then. <i>Happy</i> New Year to you! <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> <small><strong class="selflink">(Talk)</strong></small> 18:36, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have been planning it for a while, actually ... other things have just kept getting in the way. Fortunately, today the kids had to stay home from school due to icy roads, which gave me a long enough block of time to put things together. When I'd originally started reformatting <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_air_forces.html" title="List of air forces">List of air forces</a> into tables, I'd planned next to start working on the obscure air forces since I know more about them than most folks.

<dd>If all they're doing is changing the code to a mirror site, I think it would be nearly impossible to get even one of the articles SP'd without the culprits also engaging in serious vandalism of the text itself. I would advise making a list of the affected articles and keeping a list of the IPs that are making the changes (for future identification of sockpuppets, if need be). Then just wait them out. After a few weeks with no further contesting of their changes, they'll figure their mission is accomplished and go on to something else. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> <small><strong class="selflink">(Talk)</strong></small> 00:21, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey Mark,</p>
<p>Regarding you comments on the proposed update to the WP:AIR categorisation scheme, I want to recap a few things to make sure that I'm set to move ahead with (another) 'formal' request for ratification.</p>
<p>My assessment: your comments 1, 3, and 4 seem to be resolved. (Regarding 4, I think it should be dealt with on a case-by-case basis rather than be spelled out in our cat scheme.) 6 is essentially unresolvable for the moment.</p>
<p>Regarding 5: are you proposing that the page <a href="../../../l/e/a/Learjet.html" title="Learjet">Learjet</a> be moved to Bombardier Learjet, that all Learjet aircraft since '91 have their titles changed from [[Learjet &lt;model&gt;]] to [[Bombardier Learjet &lt;model&gt;]], or both?</p>
<p>Rgarding 2: the definition of special-purpose aircraft, it seemed from WT:AIR that the best course of action was to rename the category Category:Special mission aircraft and use it for miscellaneous ones.</p>
<p>Also, what do you think of my comment that the AC-130 is more of a special mission aircraft than anything else? <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Dickman_bcce.html" title="User:Karl Dickman">Karl&#160;Dickman</a>&#160;<a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarl_Dickman_2fc9.html" title="User talk:Karl Dickman"><sup>talk</sup></a> 09:31, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I believe issues 1 and 3 have been appropriately addressed. WRT issue 4, you're right in that it will have to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, but I would hope you'd include the three naming convention points as the WP:Air preference, so that we'll have fewer cases to deal with in the future. Those three points were
<ol>
<li>the nation of the designer/manufacturer;</li>
<li>if primarily license-manufactured by a foreign customer with little or no domestic use, then that nation; and</li>
<li>if the main original producer is later bought by another company, the name of the former should be used.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If so, this resolves issue 5 as well. (Ditto 6 in the future, if followed.) I was not proposing a rename, but rather raising the issue of consistency. "Learjet" was an American company; if it's now to be listed as a Canadian company, then the proper title is "Bombardier Learjet". According to point #3 of my aircraft article naming convention guideline schema above, the article title would remain "Learjet" (which is what I personally prefer) and categorized as "U.S.". However, if Bombardier Learjet were to introduce a brand new model, we'd have to rethink it as the Canadian TTa producer of Learjet models in its own right.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding issue 2, I'm not sure there really was a consensus. I do prefer having a "Special Missions Aircraft" (or perhaps more accurately, an "Other Special Missions Aircraft") category as a subcategory of "Military aircraft"; I'm not sure whether the "Civilian aircraft" category should have one (which would require Military/Civilian in their names to distinguish them), since most of those would fit just as well under "Experimental aircraft" (if suitably defined).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the AC-130, I have no problem treating it as a "Special mission aircraft" — but then so are all the other "double-letter" variants. Frankly, I still feel uncomfortable lumping attack, COIN and gunship aircraft in with bombers. The latter are strategic and the former are tactical in role. I'd prefer to separate "Attack" back out and include gunships and other COIN aircraft in it. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> <small><strong class="selflink">(Talk)</strong></small> 00:56, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not my bot, but I'm told it will be run once per day. The reason that there are redirects in the list is because they have been either moved, renamed, or redirected to good articles since the page was generated; there were no redirects when the page was created. Deleted articles containing nothing but the protected page template are technically dead-ends, since they contain no links outside of the template. When I update the page next time, I may choose to filter out results which already contain templates, but for the moment it's not a big deal, as there are only a few of them and they can be easily removed. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalad_Days_cbd9.html" title="User:Salad Days">Salad Days</a> 00:33, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Heyo, thanks for the comment! I replied, basically saying that any smaller issues with earlier commands are not really that notable (and individual ones, like the rumors that Shelton didn't want to promote him) are included where sourceable. And as for why he was passed up, there's no source that can possibly give a reason because no reason was ever given. I've included the predominant assumption/rumor, but no <i>reason</i> that can be stated was given. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaxringold_44f9.html" title="User:Staxringold">Staxringold</a> <sub><a href="../../../s/t/a/User_talk%7EStaxringold_cc7c.html" title="User talk:Staxringold">talk</a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left: -16px; margin-right: -16px;"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Staxringold_5836.html" title="Special:Contributions/Staxringold">contribs</a></span></sup> 21:43, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>You're doing good, <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaxringold_44f9.html" title="User:Staxringold">Staxringold</a>, really! I think this may well prove one of the best bios on Wikipedia and it will be mostly to the credit of your hard work! And it's never easy writing outside of one biases — not many people nowadays are good at giving a fair rendering of "the other side's" POV. It's a sad commentary on the quality of modern American public discourse, I'm afraid, that even to for a moment entertain a negative thought about one's candidate is considered, at best, <i>lèse majesté</i> and at worst, simply "handing ammo to the enemy." Because of this, our leaders are portrayed in strictly pale, sophmoric, blasé terms.</p>
<p>It's especially hard to capture someone's "human-ness" in an encyclopedic article. Although it's "original research" (unless you can find a rare source that might provide the same insight), let me share with you a little of what was behind Gen. Clark's issues with the NATO ambassadors. First of all, you have to understand that SACEUR is quite a full-time job; so is running a war. The former is mostly politics, while the latter is beans, bullets and bloodshed. In WWII, Eisenhower took the responsibility for handling the worst of the politics so that his generals could focus on their combat jobs. Wes got both. Yes, he wanted it, but some of the opposition to his appointment was just that. He'd gotten along well with the ambassadorial-level politics as SACEUR, which helped him. However, the way the war was executed <i>politically</i> was horrible. Every day there was a committee to approve the next day's targeting list. The proposed list was submitted according to perceived military need, but the government of each nation contributing forces had a veto. What this meant in practice was that a factory owned (or mostly owned) by, say, a Greek company (especially a notable one) would be vetoed by the Greek representative. Ditto the Italian, French, etc., reps. That gives you an idea of the level of frustration Wes had to deal with on a daily basis. Imagine Gen. Bradley during WWII having to suffer Montgomery, De Gaulle, and the representatives of the Polish, Czech, etc., governments in exile being able to veto the strategic bombing and tactical airstrikes every day. Wes has never suffered fools gladly, so you can imagine how hard it was sometimes resisting the urge to shoot someone. Being hamstrung and straightjacketed is not way to fight a war. Add to that the fact that Wes is one of those people to whom it seems most folks take either a strong liking to or a strong disliking to and few in between, and it's hard to imagine a scenario other than the "perfect storm". Now, isn't that a more interesting insight into the man than his medals? <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> <small><strong class="selflink">(Talk)</strong></small> 21:49, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, Askari Mark. I'm currently trying to bring this article from the near-stub that it was a few days ago to GA status if not FA. I've been reading around about the wikification of years and I don't seem to find any consensus. In some FAs I've found, there are even some places where dates are wikified and other places where they are not. At the moment, my article (which is in its early adolescent stage) has a scattering just like that. I wonder if you could give me a hand in figuring this out. Thanks a lot. <a href="../../../j/h/m/User%7EJHMM13_dfcf.html" title="User:JHMM13">JHMM13</a> (<a href="../../../j/h/m/User_talk%7EJHMM13_2dd8.html" title="User talk:JHMM13">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JHMM13_5487.html" title="Special:Contributions/JHMM13">C</a>) <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" /></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/25px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="15" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" /></a> 01:36, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, <a href="../../../j/h/m/User%7EJHMM13_dfcf.html" title="User:JHMM13">JHMM13</a>! I took a look at your article and it looks like you've got a good start, especially for such a tough subject. Let me first say that the best strategy for developing a GA or FA article is to get know the style guidelines of Wikiprojects whose members would be the most likely to review it — and to help you get there. I would suggest <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_History_f74c.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject History">WikiProject History</a> (<a href="../../../w/p/h/WP%7EWPH_913c.html" title="WP:WPH">WP:WPH</a>) and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Former_countries_d9ca.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Former countries">WikiProject Former countries</a> (<a href="../../../w/p/f/WP%7EWPFC_4e5a.html" title="WP:WPFC">WP:WPFC</a>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding wikilinking dates, at the moment there's some serious debate going on about what dates should or should not be linked, since it sometimes seems to go at cross-purposes. (Cf. <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_9d65.html#Date_preferences_and_Jogersbot.27s_massive_undoing_of_edits" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">this debate</a>, for instance.) Please also note that GA and FA standards have been "tightening up" over the last year, so older articles may not be up to snuff. Here's my advice on the date-linking issue:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Per <a href="../../../d/a/t/WP%7EDATE_3c44.html" title="WP:DATE">WP:DATE</a> as it currently stands, the first priority is to link full dates (e.g., "February 4, 2007") to enable user preferences for how they want the date displayed, as there are several possibilities ("4 February 2007", "2007-02-04", etc.). My example would be coded [[February 4]], [[2007]]. Don't link month/year combinations ("February 2007") or stand-alone dates without the year ("... as of February 4, the ...").</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Although <a href="../../../d/a/t/WP%7EDATE_3c44.html" title="WP:DATE">WP:DATE</a> encourages wikilinking stand-alone years, I see no purpose in it — <i>unless</i> it should tie into a "year in xyz" timeline page. For the time being, I wouldn't suggest adding those. Your article wouldn't be "docked" for it anyway.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Hi Dude,</dd>
<dd>Sorry to bug you again, but I'm getting very furstrated with certain users (especially of <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">Indian</a> origin using wikipedia articles to promote their countries progression agenda. This <a href="../../../4/t/h/4th_generation_jet_fighter.html" title="4th generation jet fighter">4th generation jet fighter</a> article is still being used as a platform to promote <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">Indian</a> "advancement over other nations", especially when it comes to 4.5th and 5th generation aircrafts.</dd>
<dd>For example, <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> has offered <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> to participate in a 5th generation fighter project earlier this year and deal has reportedly been signed. Since then, our <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">Indian</a> editors have taken this opportunity to link this to a near-complete project, the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Russia_%28bordered%29.svg_30d0.html" class="image" title="Flag of Russia"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/3/37/Flag_of_Russia_%28bordered%29.svg/22px-Flag_of_Russia_%28bordered%29.svg.png" alt="Flag of Russia" width="22" height="15" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Russia_%28bordered%29.svg_30d0.html" /></a> <a href="../../../p/a/k/PAK_FA_c4b2.html" title="PAK FA">PAK FA</a>, going as far as calling the <a href="../../../p/a/k/PAK_FA_c4b2.html" title="PAK FA">PAK FA</a> a joint Indo-Russian project.</dd>
<dd>Now, my argumennt is that based on vague news reports, an encyclopedic article must never be edited. <u>India-Russia 5th generation fighter programme may very well be a new project other than the <a href="../../../p/a/k/PAK_FA_c4b2.html" title="PAK FA">PAK FA</a></u>.

<p>Hi, I notice you've tagged a few articles as speedy deletion candidates because they were transwikied. From the text of <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#A5" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#A5</a>, it seems that only articles that have been discussed at an AFD where the outcome was to transwiki may be speedy-deleted after transwikification is complete. In the two cases I noticed (Salibi and Sale/Repurchase agreements), no such discussion had taken place. I just wanted to let you know for future reference.

Per <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>, contested speedy-deletion candidates can still be prodded (or AfD'd if the editor thinks it's a controversial case).

<dd>You're welcome! Just got back from a short trip to Houston with the family. Among other things, my wife, kids, and 79-year-old father-in-law got to see their first rodeo. Tomorrow I return to work to learn what new crises have arisen during my brief absence. I know there are two impending major projects due to start soon, but that doesn't mean there won't be others. I suspect I will continue only to manage a light touch on Wikipedia through the end of the month. Haven't decided what to work on next, but I'm starting to become embarassed over my growing backlog list, so I may have to clear off a couple.

<p>Yes, but we don't use the 48-star American flag just because the aircraft in question happened to be produced during a particular time period.

<dd>I appreciate that (fuss is good), but then I'd also argue that Nazi Germany is a different country from the modern Germany. Moreover, I've found that modern Germans tend to get a bit queasy (at best) over anything that "rehabilitates" stuff from the Nazi era. We regularly get them AfD'ing articles about that era just because they think there's already too many articles about the Nazis already. I can understand that. I still remember the reaction of a German exchange student after watching "Hogan's Heroes" for the first time. Anyhow, keep on contributing and don't be afraid to revert me when I'm wrong.

<dd>And I'd have to say that it is a good thing that modern Germans have a sense of shame regarding the Nazi period. It would be disturbing if they didn't. I kind of figured that was the rationale for the use of the Nazi flag, but I figured, 'be bold' and all. How did said student react to "Hogan's Heroes"? <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKristoferM_cd13.html" title="User:KristoferM">KristoferM</a> 04:19, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He was most distraught and thought it abominable that the show made light of Nazis and joked about them. He felt the Nazis were too evil to be used even as the butt of humor, much less styled as endearing clowns (Sgt. Schultz &amp; Col. Klink). When I pointed out that it was the first popular post-war WWII show in the US which didn't portray all Germans as evil Nazis, well, he just couldn't make that compute. I'm sure it wouldn't surprise you to learn that the German neo-Nazis are mostly from <i>East</i> Germany; as communists, they were told it was the <i>West</i> Germans who were Nazis and responsible for all that evil. Ironically, that's now their mode of rebellion against both East and West.

<dd>Yes, most of it was on a user talk page, but I forget whose. The tail end of it is [[User talk:Askari Mark#deathcamps.orgvs. death-camps.org in <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einsatzgruppen.html" title="Einsatzgruppen">Einsatzgruppen</a>|here]]. You had posted about an edit war over these two sites. The one w/o a hyphen was the original site of a group researching info on the Nazi death camps, but the group suffered a "civil war" over the introduction of some fraudulent material; the one with the hyphen was a mirror of that (but w/o the bad material). A friend of the "fuehrer" of the old group has been going around censoring links to the mirror site. You were wondering which to use and whether it would be necessary to go back and fix all his changes. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> <small><strong class="selflink">(Talk)</strong></small> 19:33, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>First, do not add hidden text or spam as it is considered vandalism; so is altering another editor's posting, as you did here earlier. If you do not understand Wikipedia's rules (or care to follow them), then you should not be posting here.</li>

<p>On a totally unrelated note, I was having a look at your sandbox and I noticed what <i>appears</i> to be an inconsistency regarding the nationality of certain companies. For example, in the case of <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aero_Vodochody_55d8.html" title="Aero Vodochody">Aero Vodochody</a> you note that it is from both <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czechoslovakia.html" title="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> and the <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czech_Republic_12a4.html" title="Czech Republic">Czech Republic</a>. For <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonov.html" title="Antonov">Antonov</a> you note that it is from both the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> and the <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukraine.html" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>. However, in the case of <a href="../../../f/o/c/Focke-Achgelis_f74a.html" title="Focke-Achgelis">Focke-Achgelis</a> you only list <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> as the nationality with the current German flag. However, the company, as you note, went out of business in 1945. Shouldn't the flag shown here be the Nazi flag as it was the official flag of Germany at the time? Same question for companies like <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamburger_Flugzeugbau_3b58.html" title="Hamburger Flugzeugbau">Hamburger Flugzeugbau</a> that did exist post-war and perhaps should have both the Nazi flag and the current German flag. Obviously you aren't done with this article yet, so I know I'm nit-picking at something in-progress, but I'm just wondering.

<dd>No, you're not nitpicking — it's an issue I'm still wrestling with. Originally, I'd intended to only have multiple flags for multinational companies. Then, to give more historical insight, I put in previous national flags. The problem is that for some German companies I was faced with including the German Imperial, Weimar, Nazi, and FRG flags — and almost all of the US companies would need more than one flag as well. (There's also the side issue of Germans getting tired of seeing Nazi flags everywhere.) I may still go back and add Nazi flags for those firms that went extinct at the end of WWII; I haven't decided. Currently, I'm leaning toward including earlier flags only where the former entity "disintegrated": Soviet Union -&gt; Russia, Ukraine, etc.; Czechoslovakia -&gt; Czech Republic and Slovakia; Yugoslavia -&gt; Serbia, etc.; Austro-Hungarian Empire -&gt; its constituents; etc. My overall intent is to provide a reference list that helps a reader back out the historical track of companies' evolving names (at least for companies designing and producing the aircraft found in historical air forces). Any thoughts? <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> <small><strong class="selflink">(Talk)</strong></small> 17:16, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps you can minimize this problem by having two possibilities: original nationality and current nationality. This would help people get an idea for the context in which the company was founded and most likely grew and then the context that it is now in. This obviously becomes important for companies that have existed in the same physical place, but in many different countries. It also allows for a brief visual explanation of a company that might have taken a similar path as Halliburton that is slowly moving its headquarters (and possibly nationality?) overseas. For a company like that, you could say...Original nationality: US. Current nationality: East Timor. The problem I see with this approach, though, is that companies that have always existed in the US might have two American flags causing clutter in the list. I'm sure you could find a way around this, though. Let me know what you think. <font style="background:#b22222;"><b><a href="../../../j/h/m/User%7EJHMM13_dfcf.html" title="User:JHMM13"><font style="color:white;font-size:105%">JHMM13</font></a></b></font> 18:39, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Representing the original and "final" nationality is basically the approach I'm taking at present. The question becomes something like "Is Nazi Germany (or Imperial Germany, etc.) a different country from the modern Germany – at least enough that simply identifying a company as 'German' is insufficient?" Germany can be said to have "swelled and shrunk" repeatedly over the 20th century, and was temporarily split into the BRD and DDR (but effectively under foreign occupation); the USSR was shattered. Anyhow, that's my current thinking and I'm sticking to it ... or not.&#160;:P That's part of why it's still in my sandbox. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> <small><strong class="selflink">(Talk)</strong></small> 01:21, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a German citizen, I can tell you that Germans celebrate their form of "Independence Day" on October 3 which in 1990 was the formal day of unification between East and West (<i>Tag der deutschen Einheit</i> or <i>Day of German Reunification</i>). The concept of Germany being a fully existing country was sort of stunted before this, oddly enough. The West Germans felt the country wasn't complete and I don't believe they had a constitution until after reunification. Naturally this is partially ridiculous as West Germany was, in fact, a country that became officially sovereign in 1949 (I believe on May 5) and East Germany was its own country that celebrated its own <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_der_Republik_%28DDR%29" class="external text" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_der_Republik_%28DDR%29" rel="nofollow">Tag der Republik</a> on October 7. I think in order to be as accurate as possible, you should include the official name and flag of the country in which it was initially founded because separating government switch-ups into collapses and splits and so on is a lot less scientific that it should be, and it's not very easy. East Germany was incorporated into West Germany, but West Germany is now a new country with East Germany called Germany. Whenever it is referred to in the past, it is generally called West Germany. Nazi Germany was called Germany, but it was a separate nation. You shouldn't worry about offending the Germans around here. It's all about getting the facts straight and it's very important to note what government a company was started under in 1937 as opposed to 1967 as opposed to 1997. They were all different countries in the same way that the USSR is not Russia&#160;:-D.

<dd>That aside, I take it that you concur with a "founded-and-ended/current" approach with the flags. To wit, if a German company was founded during the imperial era and still exists, it should feature the imperial and republican flags (but not the Weimar or Nazi), correct? Also, the Weimar flag icon appears identical to the modern flag icon; are they indeed the same? <i>Vielen Dank'!</i> <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> <small><strong class="selflink">(Talk)</strong></small> 17:31, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I hope you have a chance to check it out and I will continue carefully addressing any concern you might have. By the way, regarding your post above, I've emailed my mom who is a born-and-raised German who can really help you out in this field. I'm only a halfy...mostly American, partially German&#160;:-D. My knowledge of the exacts of German history is limited, so I think you deserve the help of someone who really knows what they're talking about. Thanks again, <font style="background:#b22222;"><b><a href="../../../j/h/m/User%7EJHMM13_dfcf.html" title="User:JHMM13"><font style="color:white;font-size:105%">JHMM13</font></a></b></font> 23:14, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Mr. Mark,</p>
<p>I was wanting to start a age on DSI intakes, and i was hoping for your help, especially in reviewing and editing some of the details, especially since, frankly, my aeronautics related knowledge tends to zero. I hope you'd be able to do so. Thanks and cheers. <a href="../../../s/n/i/User%7ESniperz11_5d2d.html" title="User:Sniperz11">Sniperz11</a> 19:38, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.S. The page will be Diverterless Supersonic Inlet. Thanks.</p>

<dd>I can't promise I can provide a <i>whole</i> lot of help as my to-do plate is already rather full, but I'll help where I can. I encourage you to also post an invite at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Aviation_8c9c.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Aviation">WikiProject Aviation</a>, where there are quite a few helpful and knowledgeable types. Are you going to be building it in your sandbox initially? <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskari_Mark_f87e.html" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> <small><strong class="selflink">(Talk)</strong></small> 04:02, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand, Mr. Mark. Any help, though, would be appreciated. I will post at the project group as well. I've created a sandbox on my user page at <a href="../../../s/n/i/User%7ESniperz11_Diverterless_Supersonic_Inlet_d073.html" title="User:Sniperz11/Diverterless Supersonic Inlet">User:Sniperz11/Diverterless Supersonic Inlet</a>. cheers. <a href="../../../s/n/i/User%7ESniperz11_5d2d.html" title="User:Sniperz11">Sniperz11</a> 05:49, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
