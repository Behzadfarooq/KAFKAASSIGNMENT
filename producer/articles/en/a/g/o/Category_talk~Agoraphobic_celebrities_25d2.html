	    <p>This should probably be renamed, it's not just celebrities. Or better yet, have a category on people with anxiety disorder with sections for specific phobias. <a href="../../../g/f/l/User%7EGflores_bda8.html" title="User:Gflores">Gflores</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/f/l/User_talk%7EGflores_1e9f.html" title="User talk:Gflores">Talk</a></sup> 20:36, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

I experience periodic bouts of agoraphobia, my spouse accompanies me most places. I lost my job due to panic and agoraphobia as a small error became compounded by my anxiety and avoidance after a supervisor's criticism. I was hospitalized for a susequent breakdown. I am curious if this is genetic, my mother tells me my maternal grandmother "was a fearful woman who refused to leave her house all her life". As a country reared child, I roamed far and wide without fear. Strange to feel so strange following a brutal early marriage.</p>

<p>--209.215.57.163 00:23, 2 May 2006 (UTC)I am 17 years old and in the 11th grade. However, I am not really attending school because I am too scared to leave my mother. I go once a week or so to turn in work and get more to do at home. This has been a rough year for me. I know that it has been a rough year for everyone too. Several weeks after Katrina hit, I started feeling very depressed for no reason. We were out of power for two weeks and I was one of the better ones in my family at that time. It didn't make any sense. I started feeling very strange and bad thoughts kept on infecting my mind. I felt nausiated to the point that I could barely eat for almost two weeks. After that my mouth would become so dry when I tried to eat that I would have to drink something to make it go down. One night I started shaking so bad that I couldn't easily walk. I don't have sugar problems, but I checked it all the same and it was fine. Not long after that I started having mild panic attacks if I got the least bit nervous. The second time my mom had to check me out of school, she drove me to the doctor's office where I panicked so bad that I started hyperventilating and came close to passing out. I know that some people do this as bad or worse all the time. That's why I'm writing this. After about a month, I found out I had thyroiditis. I have had it on and off all my life. In the first grade my mom had to do volunteer work at the school just so I would go. In the sixth and seventh grade I called her at work at least once every two hours. This story is not about agrophobia persay, but it could be something that could help someone who is misdiagnosed. This year I started seeing a psychologist, and it didn't help why? Because my problem was medical and she would not understand that. Last month I started seeing and herb doctor. One that treats you by your bloodwork and how you feel. She told me about her story. When she was younger, she had similar problems. Turns out, her's was caused because of an autoimmune disorder, and I am not talking about Grave's disease. It's just a little something wrong with her to cause her body to attack itself when she comes in contact with a viral or possibly a bacterial infection. Her's didn't always attack her thyroid. She told me that she ended up in the hospital after all her doctor's told her it was all in her head. Her body went and attacked her knees. The doctors didn't know what it was and they sent her home to die. She didn't. She now takes certain herbs everyday that keep it from happening. She doesn't take any medicine at all. From what I could tell she was perfectly fine last time I saw her. With her help, we found a pattern of autoimmune problems in my family. She also informed me that one of my liver enzymes have been high since the first time I had bloodwork done. Before I first started having trouble in the first grade, I had green eyes. Both my parents' eyes were bluish-green or green. After the first grade they turned brown. As far as I know this usually does not happen. I have been taking herbs for a few weeks and now my eyes are back to green. I am still afraid to go places without my mom, but we can go places where I was scared to go before. I forgot to mention it before, but the herb doctor seemed to think I had an autoimmune disorder too. When I started having problems in the first grade, 5th's disease was going around school. I was probably exposed to it and that is why I got thyroiditis. Nobody thought to check it, but I'm sure I had it then and several other times in my life. I wouldn't want to leave my mom for a pretty long while. I would eventually get over it somehow. I have faith I am on the road to recovery now. I'm not anxious or scared or depressed but a very little bit and that is only sometimes. The herbs I am on are supposed to keep it from coming back and they have already helped me phsycally and mentally. I'm not trying to get anyone to buy herbs, I am really trying to help someone who has probably had several bad years compared to my one. I just saw this and I didn't really think out an outline for it. My mom just came in here and pointed out some stuff I forgot. In the first grade I had a positive ANA and a high sedimentation rate. That is a sign of and autoimmune disorder. It would only show up when my body was attacking or had already attacked my thyroid. I had labs done later and it was gone. The doctors had thought I had lupus, but changed their mind when the ANA and sed-rate was normal. They never looked into what it was. This year before I started getting sick, my little cousin got the cowasaki virus, and so did I. Since I have started taking herbs, my bloodwork has looked better than it has for 10 years. (That was the fist time I had any done) I hope and pray that this information might make its way to someone who can benifit from it. God Bless;-)</p>

<p>Sigmund Freud?? This is news to me, and apparently to Wikipedia as well (<a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigmund_Freud_d2be.html" title="Sigmund Freud">Sigmund Freud</a> makes no mention of this.) Let's have a cite for this, or remove him from this listing. -- 201.78.233.162 19:56, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm very skeptical too, since I've never heard it either. I'm going to remove him <i>until</i> someone produces a citation.</dd>

<p>Sallinger is a famous recluse, but that doesn't necessarilly make him an agoraphobe. I've never heard any reports that he experiences intense fear upon leaving his house--just that he stays in.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, the JD Sallinger article says, "Perhaps the most insightful mythbusting that Ms. Salinger offers describes her father as anything but a recluse or withdrawn. She claims that her father travels often, has friends all over the world, and is a bon vivant in every aspect, except where publicity and celebrity are concerned."</dd>

<dd>I'm going to go ahead and delete him from this list.</dd>
