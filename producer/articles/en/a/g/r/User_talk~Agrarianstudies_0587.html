<p>How can you speak this much harsh words? I was always manly and polite. You proved yourself as an unexperienced wikipedian. Thank god..at last you learned to talk on talk page. Now please try to study how to sign your articles. You and your pushpaka brahmins all are nonsence. Do you think, wikipedia is your personal property. If you want to convey ideas, you can creat your own www as you have once suggested for me. I am not interested in talking much to you. Because you have no consideration of my words. I told you that your introduction is not in a wiky format. Even then you reverted shamelessly. Do anything as you like. No more comments I like. Please make an introspection. Study how to make good articles. Read much books. You are a frog in a waste well. Oh, sorry, You are LITERATE. All others inthe universe are IDIOTS. Forgive the works of this ILLITERATE Insvik. Bye...and probably a bye for ever. Yours <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsvik_b1a0.html" title="User:Insvik">Insvik</a> 12:22, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am tired. When you wanted references, I cited two references. You are not willing even to find it. You are trying to establish your ideas by harsh sentences. You must be aware of the fact that chaturvarnyam is not the caste system. It is only a classificateion. When aryanization took place in southern india,the castes already existed in kerala were naturally grouped in to these four classes. Actually,there were no castes which were grouped into Kshatriyas and Vaisyas. However, later, Kerala Nayers, Maharastrian Marathas and Tamil Maravors accured Kshatriya postion by their economic status. I know, obtaining a Ph. D is not a final word in all these matters. But you are a person who are not even trying to refer those books that I have suggested. I'm sure, You have no understanding on these matters. When the classification occured gradually, eventhough it took over a long time, the ambalavasis community generally considered in the Brahmana varna. Pushpaka Brahmin is the technical name used by them. Even now, they are using the same name. Wiki articles are headed by technical names. So there is no need of changing the title of the article. The redirect link is sufficient. I already told you that I have not much time to talk with you. Eventhough, your rude and harsh character prompted to write such a long message. You took a name as agrarianstudies. I wonder--Do you know the meaning of that word? And you are still remaining as a red link. Please disclose yourself. Being red is not a disqualification for editing this areticle.But let me know what your real status is. Please dont revert to your stupid article. The introduction that you are provided is neither in wiki format nor factual. I hope you will stop editing this way. However,historical changes are acceptable. Please make your comments on my talk page. Dont use the discussion page for your stupid arguments. Please. <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsvik_b1a0.html" title="User:Insvik">Insvik</a> 12:36, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems that your edits on Pushpaka brahmins are driven by a psychic factor rather than real facts. What is the position of them in kerala community? You may or may not be aware of that, but now your harsh statements prove that you are interested in establishing your own ideas. Eventhough you put them in Sudra category, nothing to lost for me. And really, it is the real position of them in modern society. I have not much time and money for continuous monitoring of suchpages. There are too many neo or old wikipedians(?) like you. You are throwing blind folded. And the introductory paragraph, that you have edited so proudly..What to say.. only laughable. For a non-keralite, how does it feel? Is it a good introduction. Please make a review. How can one, who doesnt know about kerala society, understand such a paragraph. It starts with a vague statement, rather a clear introduction of what does it really mean. you may be new in wikipedia. Better go through wikipedia policies and terms first. This is not a place for edit war. So I left that page for its fate. You do anything you like. But the things are not going to change. If you wish, you can post messages to my talk page. Thank you. <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsvik_b1a0.html" title="User:Insvik">Insvik</a> 10:39, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The whole things sounds that you are a Nambiar. Dear Nambiar what is your problem? <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsvik_b1a0.html" title="User:Insvik">Insvik</a> 11:00, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Agrarianstudies.....please explain to me what part of the Nambiar article you find to be "loopy fantasy" and why you continually cut down the article about nayar nambiars to a few sentences. <a href="../../../k/s/h/User%7EKshatriya_knight_5d1e.html" title="User:Kshatriya knight">Kshatriya knight</a> 22:11, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I accept the fact that I dont know much more about Kerala caste system. But this doesen't meen that I dont know any thing and you know everything. I am actually a student of Kerala history and sociology. A person living in the 21st century. So I am not arguing that I know everything.</p>
<p>All the sentences I have given about the status of Nairs, Marathas etc. are not mine. They are from standard references. I am not getting what is your intention. I think you donot like the word semi-Brahmin. This may be the problem. I am here suggesting a few books for you. I cant bring it to your hands, but if you really want to know about kerala history, you can find it from standard libraries. Please go through these books. Let this article as such till our discussion reaches a conclusion. Because I cant bear providing false statements to REAL students. Now I am suggesting four books. I hope you will read this and then make the comments.</p>
<p>1. Society in Medieval Malabar by K.S. Mathew. 2. Caste, Nationality and Communism in South India. Dilip Menon 3. Caste in Southern Inida by Saenart. 4. Indian caste system: A Study by Hayavadana.</p>
<p>Eventhough I suggested these books, I am sure that you will repeat the stupid sentence "STILL NO REFERENCES CITED". I dont know what you actually mean by a references. I think these books are not written for any particular intention. In most of the books about Old kerala society, it can be found that the castes mentioned in Ambalavasis are classified as "antarala brahmins". In some books the term used is simply antralars (intermediaries). It is also clearly stated that "In the caste Structure of Kerala, the ANTARALA BRAHMINS like Varriers, Chakyars,..., came below the Namboothiris and above Nairs.</p>
<p>I am sure that you will have arguments without any studies. I will admit it..But, please...put it in my talk page. Not here. This is not the place for personal debates. This is a place for general debates. And finally, I have to say one thing, Your article after editing is not in general wikiformat. First go through the tutorials. And also see the standard pages of wikipedia.</p>

<p>You had prove yourself as an unexperienced wikipedian. I have given too many suggestions. You are sayiny, all these are fictious books. I have to do nothing expect laughing. I have much more references. But you dont desreve it. No more discussion with you. Let us continue this reversion war. That may be better. If you are furthr interested, go for studies on Kerala society. I told you about the term antarala. It is clearly classed in between Nambutirs and Nairs. Not below nair. You are a filled bottle. Nothing can be poured into your mind. You are not willing to study one more book. I assume you are an ORTHODOX NAIR. Any way no more discussion with you. Because you dont like it. I think reversion is your hobby. Anyway your article is not acceptable. Its introductory paragraph is not in wiki format. It starts with some Bullets and wide gaps etc. See other pages. Then edit. If you want to know any other thing, only comment on my talk page or post me a message. The Insvik link will help you.

<p>Hellow. I was sure that one day you will do this. Anyway the article title must be the technical name. Not common name. See wikipolicies. Dont make such redirect conflict. If you have gone a search for Ambalavasi, then you may have find the difficulties. Your editing made conflicts in too many links. So I reverted it. Please, dont make such redirections. If you want, you have to find out all the links and then change all of them. <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsvik_b1a0.html" title="User:Insvik">Insvik</a> 11:50, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am an ambalavasi. You have done a great work with the Pushpaka Brahmin Article. But your conclusions are not acceptable. The origin title can be changed to myth. But it is not to be removed. The links that you have changed affected too many pages that link to the page Pushpaka Brahmins. Dont make such changes without discussion. It is also found that you are continuously editing this article without any creative movement. It will be better to discuss changing the tile on the discussion page. I have made too many changes in different pages relating to ambalavasis. The references are given in my User page. If you read Malabar Manual of Logan, your doubts will get cleared. And it is found that you have made too many citation needed links. These are the rituals practiced by Pushpakas. You may not be aware of it. It will be better, if you consult some authority. In my knowledge, all the rituals mentioned thetre are true. Once more reminding you that dont attempt to change the title of this article. If you want you can create your own article discussing about the status about ambalavasis.</p>
