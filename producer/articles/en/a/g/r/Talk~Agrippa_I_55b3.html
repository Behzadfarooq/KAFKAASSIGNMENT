<p>Perhaps the "angel" mentions and other Bible related mythological titbits could go in a separate section?

<dl>
<dd>Yes. More reliable histories (e.g. Josephus) should surely take precedence over religious legends, especially as this is an article about Agrippa, not Peter. The release of the early churchman "by an angel" is not history.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The article does not claim the angel is historical, the article claims that <i>Acts of the Apostles</i> mentions an angel. Which is true and easily verified. <a href="../../../g/d/r/User_talk%7EGdr_e2ab.html" title="User talk:Gdr">Gdr</a> 17:41, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

But which Aristobulus? The one linked in the article cannot be right. <i>That</i> Aristobulus, according to his Wikipedia article, died in 103 BC. How can he have fathered Agrippa I who was born in 10 BC? <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristobulus_II_b023.html" title="Aristobulus II">Aristobulus II</a> died in 50 BC and <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristobulus_III_e13e.html" title="Aristobulus III">Aristobulus III</a> in 35 BC, so they're both out. The other Aristobuli in the <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristobulus_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Aristobulus (disambiguation)">Aristobulus (disambiguation)</a> page are not possible candidates either.

<dd>See <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herod_the_Great_8163.html#Marriages_and_Children" title="Herod the Great">Herod the Great#Marriages and Children</a>. Aristobulus was a son of Herod the Great by his wife <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariamne_%28second_wife_of_Herod%29_03ce.html" title="Mariamne (second wife of Herod)">Mariamne</a> (the first of that name). Our article <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berenice_%28daughter_of_Salome%29_2a93.html" title="Berenice (daughter of Salome)">Berenice (daughter of Salome)</a> confirms this: "She married her cousin Aristobulus, who was assassinated in 6 BC; she was accused of complicity in his murder. By Aristobulus she was the mother of Herod Agrippa I." It's tough sorting out the many people with the same name in the Herodian dynasty.

<p>Yes, it is the Aristobulos IV in the JVL that is the father of Agrippa I. I will alter the article to remove the wiki link to the incorrect Aristobulos.

<dd>If you're going to go round changing era names on spurious grounds, at least get it right! Change [[10 BC]] to [[10 BCE]] not [[10]] BCE which mistakenly links to a date twenty years later. And CE goes after the date, not before like AD, so AD [[44]] must be changed to [[44]] CE.

<p>They are not spurious grounds. I began to change "Anno Domini" to "Common Era" etc when I noticed it was being done routinely on all sorts of articles, and I agreed with the reasoning. "In the Year of our Lord" and "Before Christ" are overtly Christian and religious and "Common Era" designations are neutral. Moreover, I find your post here on my Talk page to be straange. Why couldn't you say your peace in the actual <a href="../../../a/g/r/Talk%7EAgrippa_I_55b3.html#Anno_Domini_vs._Common_Era" title="Talk:Agrippa I">article Talk section</a> I started deliberately to discuss this matter?

<p>If they are both acceptable, and I fixed the date-link typo, and moreover I have explained to you why I find Christian references to be less than neutral, especially in a biography of a Jewish king, then why is it OK for <b>you</b> edit war and revert? --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 18:56, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Since both eras are acceptable, why did you change it? And if BC/AD is less than neutral for a Jewish king, how is BCE/CE any more acceptable? Agrippa himself would probably have used <a href="../../../s/e/l/Seleucid_era.html" title="Seleucid era">Seleucid era</a> dating. <a href="../../../g/d/r/User_talk%7EGdr_e2ab.html" title="User talk:Gdr">Gdr</a> 20:16, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I explained why I changed it. It is more neutral. BCE/CE is more acceptable in <i>any</i> instance, in my opinion, and in the context of a Jewish biography doubly so. "In The Year of <b>Our Lord</b>" has obvious objectionable connotations. As for Selucid dates, they are not included in the Manual of Style as an acceptable modern date-reference system.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 10:28, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're confusing origin of a term with its present utility. Of course BC/AD has its orgin in Christianity (as does BCE/CE). But now they are just names for eras. The same for Seleucid era dating: to Jews the Seleucids were anathema, having profaned the Temple and attempted to destroy the Jewish faith. But that didn't stop Jewish historians from using the system. <a href="../../../g/d/r/User_talk%7EGdr_e2ab.html" title="User talk:Gdr">Gdr</a> 13:29, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am not confusing origin with present utility. The very fact that Common Era naming has been introduced and gained acceptance in international scholarly application (as well as in Wikipedia) despite being much more recent then BC/AD, is testament to the very real modern need for religious-neutrality in naming conventions. No one is obfuscating that year zero is the birth of Jesus, only that Jesus is not "everyone's lord". As for Seleucid naming, it is all moot, as neither of us are advocating the use of this system. Nevertheless, the Romans subjugated countless nations, and most of them adopted Roman calendars and other customs. It has nothing to do with ideology, only expediency. As civilization progresses and we are no longer under the hegemony of a world-wide empire or the rule of the Church, we have leisure to modify our terminology for neutrality. That is all the Common Era is about: neutrality. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 22:19, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>But surely no-one is so stupid as to think that "AD" indicates any kind of advocacy or acceptance of Christianity? It's just a conventional name for a count of years. <a href="../../../g/d/r/User_talk%7EGdr_e2ab.html" title="User talk:Gdr">Gdr</a> 00:02, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>If no one had any objection to AD, the Common Era would never have been introduced. Different people have different opinions on what "In the Year of our Lord" advocates or does not advocate. If you think people are "stupid" for objecting to a perceived "advocacy or acceptance" then that is your own opinion. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 12:13, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is childish and stupid. There are centuries of historical scholarly precedence to the AD/BC convention. Indeed, it even describes the very nature of the dating system it accompanies! –Something that the “common era” convention seems to overlook in a show of typical moronic PC cosmetics. All intelligent people have a duty rise above such aesthetic, anti-intellectual obfuscating nonsense. If you use the Georgian dating system then use the correct associated terminology. There are other existing dating systems from non-Christian cultures which could also be used in accompaniment if that is your wish. The use of CE/BCE does NOT remove the Christian connotations or associations, it merely muddies the waters.<a href="../../../o/z/o/User%7EOzoneocean_1673.html" title="User:Ozoneocean">OzoneO</a> 23:44, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The previous version of this article muddled together accounts from Josephus and Acts 12 regarding the last year of Agrippa's rule, to a rather confusing degree. I've separated them out here into separate sections, as Josephus and the author of Acts have very different points to make about Agrippa's death. Lest a certain someone be inclined to revert the edits, let me point out that the implication of of the previous version -- that a "zealous Jewish king would automatically want to imprison and execute Chrisitan apostles -- is anti-semitic and not supported by primary sources. If that wording returns I <b>will</b> call for a bias tag and moderator intervention. --jberkus <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_63.195.55.98_bea4.html" title="Special:Contributions/63.195.55.98">63.195.55.98</a> (talk) 06:36, 24 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
