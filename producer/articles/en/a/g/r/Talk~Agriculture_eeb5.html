<p>This page and that of <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agriculture.html" title="Agriculture">Agriculture</a> should be coordinated. As to how, i have no idea: The finer points of the English language escape me here&#160;:-) Perhaps a merge and a redirect? --Anders T?rlind</p>
<hr />
<p>I think they should be merged. <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agriculture.html" title="Agriculture">Agriculture</a> says: "Kinds of agriculture include farming, which is raising crops for harvest, and [animal husbandry]?."</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/a/r/Farming.html" title="Farming">Farming</a> says: "Farming is the process of producing food by cultivation of certain plants and the raising of domesticated animals. See also agriculture."</p>
<p>Really I think the two are more or less synonymous. <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_husbandry.html" title="Animal husbandry">Animal husbandry</a> and raising crops are part of both. -- hagedis</p>
<hr />
<p>Both the Unesco Thesaurus and Library of Congress subject headings have "Farming: <i>use</i> Agriculture".</p>
<p>I think agriculture is the best term for both the economic sector (usually taken to include animal husbandry), and the practice of producing crops (though here, we often differentiate between "agricultural" and "pastoral" populations and activities, so livestock may sometimes be excluded). The article(s) could refer to such nuances, with links or redirects from/to "Animal husbandry", "Livestock production" or whatever is preferred.</p>
<p>Farming to me suggests a particular form of organisation, usually involving commercial production by a private operator engaged directly on the holding, hence distinct from estate, plantation or communal cultivation (the word itself originates around the 12th century with the leasing of western European estate lands, as in "to farm out" an enterprise). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Parker_bf5d.html" title="User:David Parker">David Parker</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>The current articles were basically discussing the same thing, so I've combined them into Agriculture, with Farming a redirect. If there are any subtle separate meanings they can be fixed up later.</dd>

<p>It would be wonderful to see <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agriculture.html" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>, <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agricultural_policy.html" title="Agricultural policy">agricultural policy</a>, <a href="../../../f/u/t/Futures_contract.html" title="Futures contract">futures contract</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodity_markets.html" title="Commodity markets">commodity markets</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax%2C_tariff_and_trade.html" title="Tax, tariff and trade">tax, tariff and trade</a> all rationally related in some way, so that one could figure out in the first paragraph or so what one should be reading. At present <a href="../../../f/u/t/Futures_contract.html" title="Futures contract">futures contract</a> seems to be the trader's view, <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agriculture.html" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a> the statistician's view, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodity_markets.html" title="Commodity markets">commodity markets</a> the economist's view, <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax%2C_tariff_and_trade.html" title="Tax, tariff and trade">tax, tariff and trade</a> the policy-maker's view, and <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agricultural_policy.html" title="Agricultural policy">agricultural policy</a> the politician's view!

<dl>
<dd>Agreed. todo</dd>

<hr />
<p>As a farmer (and at the same time a practitioner of agriculture), I'd say there's definitely not a whole lot of difference between the two politically. However, animal husbandry (which is farming) might not exactly be agriculture (at least etymologically: agros means field). I just started a new project on horticulture (which is closely related to agriculture, but not usually to animal husbandry... see the problem?), and it would be nice to see one on agriculture as well. I would certainly participate in any case. Also, on the main list of projects page I made a new subcategory to science (applied science), under which I put horticulture. Agriculture would probably go there too (following the old praxis vs. theoria Aristotelian thing.) <a href="../../../s/b/_/User%7ESB_Johnny_4962.html" title="User:SB Johnny">SB Johnny</a> 15:02, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Concerning the word "corn" - Maize is called corn in the U.S., but I thought that "corn" in the U.K. means grains in general, primarily, but not only, wheat. Somebody who speaks the Queen's English please verify!&#160;:-) -- <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarj_Tiefert_437d.html" title="User:Marj Tiefert">Marj Tiefert</a> 13:45 Sep 3, 2002 (PDT)</p>
<p>I fear you will probably not consider my input acceptable, but when I talk to british people, the word "corn" refers "only" to grain. However, it is about two different types of crops&#160;: wheat and oats. Of course oats is not much used anymore. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">user:anthere</a></p>
<p>There's a nice story my father in law told me about Corn and Paris liberation by americans. People in Paris were rather hungry. They needed bread badly. At that time, our bread was made from wheat, sometimes from rye. When american people came to Paris, they asked how they could help us in terms of food. Some administrative employee said we needed corn to make bread (we still learn british english...)...We ended up with loads of maize, that basically nobody knew how to cook.</p>

<p>hold on&#160;! Year reference is required for such information. Where does that come from&#160;? In particular, rice production numbers are somehow wrong if what "production" is is not described. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">User:Anthere</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Data is from the US government website <a href="http://www.fas.usda.gov/currwmt.html" class="external free" title="http://www.fas.usda.gov/currwmt.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fas.usda.gov/currwmt.html</a>, listed at bottom of article. I checked some of the figures from the included Excel tables, but I must admit rice looked low to me too. It's probably commercial production, since otherwise rice grown in India and China would surely make it top crop. I don't really know much about this topic, but I said to <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKat_9c8a.html" title="User:Kat">Kat</a> that I would put in some world figures, having moved her US data to a subsiduary article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I second you in the idea of creating an agriculture in the United States of America as I suggested to her (I decided to call people "her" as long as I don't know about their gender:-)) on her talk page. This article should stay as general as possible.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>About the year reference. It is very important to put it in the article, not to expect readers to go at the external links to try to find that very precious information. Production rates and trade rates change a lot over time. And these figures (probably years 2000 or 2001 or 2002) will mean very little in 2010 perhaps. If year is added, editors will feel like keeping up to date also. But as such, it is not good. Please add the year.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for gross figures, it should be mentionned what are defined exactly in the count. Rice as given here is giving (er, I am not sure it is the right way to say it) is milling rice.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Here are what I find are the most important points</dd>
<dd>the three most important cereals crops are wheat, corn and rice. All three are produced in rather equivalent tonnage. Wheat and corn around 600 millions tons, rice slightly below, around 550 millions tons in years 1998-2002. Until a couple of years ago, wheat was over corn. Wheat is predominant in europe, canada, russia, northern china, corn in americas and rice in south asia. Very roughly. But the volumes of the three <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cereal.html" title="Cereal">cereal</a> are quite similar.</dd>
<dd>However, the amount of rice is often underestimated because some give the milled rice production (rather than the paddy production) - in particular developped countries. The milled rice is about 60-70 % of total rice. Now, if we consider the goal of agriculture is first to feed the world, and for readers to understand which are the major cereals feeding the world, the paddy rice production must be given, or both amounts must be given</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>third important point. Corn and wheat are both delocated crops, with huge amounts being traded. There are a small bunch of countries producing most of these two cereals, and trading it to other countries. Rice situation is quite different, most production is directly consummed. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">User:anthere</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Probably better as a table anyway, but I'm one of the few HTML illerates, Apologies.</dd>
</dl>
<p><a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">jimfbleak</a> 12:53 12 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No pb, my browser is allergic to table. It breaks the &lt; and &gt; ant</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>I believe the data is plausable, and of course the U.S. government is an unimpeachable source on any topic&#160;:-) &gt;not&lt;.</p>
<dl>
<dd>plausable yes. Just as I could say the population in the US is 1 millions people&#160;:-) It was plausable one day, but which year was it&#160;:-))))</dd>
<dd>I would recommand also using FAO data. There are presented in more international recommandations.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Most of the worldwide production of corn is fed to animals.</p>
<dl>
<dd>yup</dd>
</dl>
<p>Most of the U.S. production of rice is made into tasteless beer.</p>
<dl>
<dd>buy belgium beer made with honest barley&#160;:-)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The rest of the world eats rice and makes beer out of barley.</p>
<dl>
<dd>that's the best way.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In "Diet for a small planet," that onetime manifesto for the vegetarian movement, it is asserted that feeding grain to meat animals is an inefficient way to utilize the grain, compared to feeding grain to people. This is true, in that several pounds of corn (maize) must be fed to a steer for one pound of gain. The ratios are better for poultry and hogs but the principle is the same.</p>
<p>The point being, a great deal of corn is grown and fed to livestock, and it is quite plausable that the corn consumption exceeds rice consumption for this reason.</p>
<dl>
<dd>also true. The answer is precisely that the data given above is the milling rice, not the paddy rice.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, corn yields more tonnage per acre than rice, even in the U.S., and U.S. yields of everything are higher than yields in China.</p>
<dl>
<dd>uh&#160;? The average yield for wheat in the world is 25 qx/ha. My country average is nearly 90 qx/ha. And some farmers in the north are over 110 qx/ha...<a href="../../../m/o/n/Monoculture.html" title="Monoculture">monoculture</a> or rotation with potatoes.</dd>
</dl>
<p>And, all kidding aside, I tend to believe that the USDA production estimates are accurate. They are publicly vetted in the trading pits (c.f. <a href="../../../f/u/t/Futures_contract.html" title="Futures contract">futures_contract</a>), and the traders raise the hue and cry if they are off by more than a percentage point (sometimes less).</p>
<dl>
<dd>yes; but not all what is produced is traded</dd>

<p>Reviewing the information accompanying the data on the USDA web site, I believe that they do intend for the figures to include the small, family production of rice (and other grains for that matter) typical of subsistence farms. If you look at the USDA data by country, you see that China is a major producer and the numbers seem to make sense.</p>
<dl>
<dd>on the spot info on rice is 592,8 millions tonnes in 2001 (397.2 milled) and 568,5 millions tons in 1996 (381.1 milled)</dd>

<dd>I think the figures would belong to a nice article on <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cereal.html" title="Cereal">cereal</a>. Ant</dd>

<dd>Take your time. By the way, does someone have some better worldwide statistics to work from? I suppose I started this whole mess by adding the U.S. ones originally, which I did mainly by way of demonstrating the relative importance of the different grain crops; particularly, the role of corn, soybeans, and hay as the major crops. I know that's not true worldwide (because of rice), but we should be able to tell some sort of similar story so that the reader understands which crops are the major ones.</dd>

<dd>I originally moved most of the US stuff from agriculture to make it more global, but I left the history bit in because it seemed that the development of farming in N. Am was of global importance. As I said, I've no expertise in this area, but I think it's an arguable case. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">jimfbleak</a> 06:11 13 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes. I think it is arguable&#160;:-). I think similarly, the development of farming in Europe is of global importance (I presume the "global" mostly refer to trade issues, as well as food security and food safety). Australia and Russia are also having global importance in terms of trade. My country is also producing about half of european food&#160;:-)</p>
<p>Let's see...then we need to define what is important in ag history, in the scope of understanding where it stands now.</p>
<p>First the beginning of ag, as it is a major set point in devpt of human civilization.</p>
<p>Perhaps, the different major crops being used in the past, where do they come from (eg, corn from mexican area, wheat in fertile crescent...). The first tools and progress (sickle&#160;?). Development of new techniques (rotation, breeding), related to each civilization (perhaps the wheel). Then, how ag progress could support growing population. Local trade first, followed by worldwide trade, due to transport progress. Modern progress. This is roughly underlined, but should be more detailed.</p>
<p>Along those lines, current soyabean american production is important, as it gives a handle to the USA to impose GM stuff over the world, and it imposes trading rules and commercial pressure. Soya trade is definitly of global importance.</p>
<p>But <i>In the United States, farms spread from the colonies westward along with the settlers. In cooler regions, wheat was the crop of choice when lands were newly settled, leading to a "wheat frontier" that moved westward over the course of years. After the "wheat frontier" had passed through an area, more diversified farms including dairy cattle generally took its place. Warmer regions saw plantings of cotton and herds of beef cattle.</i> is globally of no interest.</p>

<hr />
<p>In the interest of moving beyond the statistics issue, I have restored the world production figures with a note on the difference between reporting methods for rice.</p>
<p>Anthere, to your point, the food value of a ton of grain varies widely depending on the commodity. I do not have the caloric content figures in front of me, but I believe that #2 yellow corn has somewhat higher caloric content than milled rice because of its greater fat content. Soybeans are higher still.</p>
<dl>
<dd>caloric content is not the only way to figure the quality of food. It is interesting to distinguish products either for the glucidic input (mostly cereals), oil content (such as soya, rape, sunflower) and protein content (soya, lentils, peas). If one only value the product by its caloric content, one is heading for trouble in the setting of a diet&#160;:-) Yes, soybeans are amazing food, but mostly because of their richness both in oil and protein.</dd>
<dd>but what is the point in relation with the statistics&#160;?</dd>
</dl>
<p>You can pick apart the figures and so on in many ways but the point is that the milled rice figures are probably more directly comparable to corn and wheat than the paddy rice.</p>
<dl>
<dd>perhaps so. But not mentionning the difference result in a rather inaccurate information. If mentionned, this is fine.</dd>
</dl>
<p>By the way, I believe that the USDA estimates for rice are estimates of the total production, not the output of the milling operations. I believe they apply a standard multiplier to the paddy rice that is not commercially milled to arrive at the figure.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think so. Otherwise, their information is just not coherent with the FAO. And not coherent with several other countries data. They may apply a multiplier of some sort, but the final data is not fitting with the info I have for total production. Would you have any other sources of data than the USDA perhaps&#160;? Or is there a place somewhere the USDA state precisely which definition they are giving for rice&#160;? <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">User:anthere</a></dd>

<p>How is it not coherent? The FAO and USDA values are within 1% for 2001, which is the link you supplied. I didn't search for 2002 values at FAO; apparently world production dropped considerably. The 2002 value is the one used in our page. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKat_9c8a.html" title="User:Kat">Kat</a> 18:52 13 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>yes. That is what I meant. The FAO data given for milled rice is nearly identical with the one given by the USDA. Hence, the number given by the USDA really is the milled data. With 'no multiplier'. 2002 data on the page is perfectly accurate. It appears USA is giving only milled data; In my country, we give paddy data mostly. Hence, the necessity to be clear about what is described. That's all. Lucky enough we are all using tons&#160;:-) ant</dd>

<p>I added metric equivalents for the bushels/acre figures, but gave up on the q/ha figures. Firstly, I didn't know if they were US quintals (100 lb) or "metric quintals" (100 kg), and secondly I was confused by the words "q/ha (or t/ha)". Was the writer unsure about which units these figures are measured in? -- <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHeron_606a.html" title="User:Heron">Heron</a></p>
<p>Oh Jesus&#160;! Misnumbering. Of course&#160;! 10 qx/ha is 1 T/ha. Big mistake&#160;:-(. Okay, I am sure of my values in qx/ha, but the ones in T/ha have to be divided by 10. A q is a quintal (=100 kg) while a T is a ton (=1000 kg). Ha is hectares (that is 100m on 100 m). When I work with british people, we use q/ha. But I know they also use T/ha. So I dunno which one would be best. Please someone decide what is best. In all cases, bushels per acres is undecipherable for me&#160;:-) <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">User:anthere</a></p>
<p>Sadly, most North American readers know nothing else. The conversion varies by crop. I believe a standard bushel of #2 corn or soybeans is 54 pounds, while with oats it's 32 pounds. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKat_9c8a.html" title="User:Kat">Kat</a> 14:59 16 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are confusing two different things. Yes, as a quality factor, you may need a minimum "test weight" (<a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulk_density.html" title="Bulk density">bulk density</a>) for a particular sample of at least 54 lb/bu to get a Number 2 grade. However, whether you have #2 corn, or #1 corn with a test weight of 58 lb/bu, or some much lower grade and much lower "test weight", a bushel of corn in the marketplace is always 56 lb. Those are the units used on the commodities market, or at the local grain elevator. Those bushels are not units of volume; they are units of mass, the size of which depends on the commodity being measured. OTOH, in those test weights discussed earlier in units of lb/bu, those bushels in the denominator do, of course, remain the units of volume.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>BTW, for most commodities, the mass bushels are the same in Canada as they are in the United States, even though the volume bushels are 3.2% larger in Canada. Oats is the only exception I know of, with the bushels being 32 lb in the U.S. and 34 lb in Canada. In either place, however, to have good, highest grade oats you need a test weight of at least 38 lb/bu. So let's suppose I have 20672 lb of oats, with a test weight of 38 lb/bu (that's the U.S. or Winchester bushel in the denominator, even in Canada). We'll assume that they are perfectly clean, so we don't need to worry about dockage or any other deductions. That means that these oats occupy a volume of 20672/38 = 544 U.S. volume bushels, which is about 527 imperial volume bushels. But when I sell this in the United States, what I'd get paid for is 20672/32 = 646 bushels. But if I sold it in Canada, I'd get paid for 20672/34 = 608 bushels. Does all of this make any sense to you? (The price paid per bushel, of course, also varies with a number of different grading factors, so I wouldn't get paid as much for the same number of bushels of #2 corn and #1 corn.) <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 02:01, 15 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yup. American compute by volumes, and most others by weight. It is even worse than conversion by crop. I understood you used a quite small number of varieties for crops such as wheat. Around 200 varieties are available in France for cropping. The 1000 kernels weight varying from simple to double. Since we compute by weight, there is no pb for us, but when we translate in bushels, we have to know the volume/weight ratio for each variety.</p>
<p>I have some doubts that the average yield for corn is up from 40 bu/acres (25 qx/ha) to 150 bu/acres (94 qx/ha). Unless this value is for the US of course. This value is quite similar to our own yields. However, there are numerous countries where it must be very much lower. Is this value worldwide or US only&#160;? anthere</p>
<dl>
<dd>In the US, though the term bushel is used, the unit of trade is weight not volume, with various discounts and adjustments for test weight. So although bushel is traditionally a volumetric measure, when corn is sold, they weigh it and divide by 54 pounds (I believe) to arrive at bushels. Then they measure the density of the corn, which is quoted as test weight. Test weight is the weight of a bushel (by volume), with higher figures indicating higher quality. Sound confusing? It is. Different weights are used for various grains, with 32 used for oats.</dd>

<dd>Heron. I am not living in the past. I am alive *now*. And have already been living for a while&#160;:-) And I *assure* you that 1 quintal is definitly a 100 kg, and has been such for quite a long time. France has been using metrics for quite a while, and I am quite abashed when you say we are using non metric while US is using metrics. Please&#160;! Anyway, I know nothing else than metrics, the EU agricultural legislation is in metrics. So everything I write on the topic is in metrics.

<p>While there is not complete unanimity, there would appear to be a consensus that timber and pulpwood production, while closely related to agriculture, are not a part of it. A similar situation prevails with the cultivation of fish, and with the production of ornamental plants, and with the breeding of companion animals such as dogs and cats.</p>

<p>JDGs comments aren't quite right. Sumerian agriculture differences mainly in terms of scale rather than in form. Neolithic agriculture was sustained and systematic, with conscious selection of plant traits (Neolithic peoples were not any less clever/attuned to plant behaviour than the Sumerians). Neolithic people survived in the Near East and Europe for some 3,000 years on their agricultural technologies (which included ploughing). For more info see: Boggard, A. 2004.

<dd>I see that no one has responded to your comprehensive compilation of links until now. My reaction to the links is that while some are directly related (i.e., Nutrient management, Intensive farming and Arable Land), most are only weakly related. For example to work in the fact that farmers use computers only says that they are no different than anyone else. Unremarkable, IMHO. As Chief Seattle is reported to have said: "All things are connected." The backlinks could be worked in where they highlight important apects of agriculture (if I understand correctly what you are proposing). <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunray_969d.html" title="User:Sunray">Sunray</a> 17:18, 2005 Jun 17 (UTC)</dd>

<p>that more than 65% of people farm as their primarily source of income seems unbelievable. what is the source of this info i wonder. i also wonder if the writer of this didn t mean that farming is the most prevalent source of income among forms of economic activity. at any rate i have taken the liberty of changing the statement to a more defendable one than more than 50% of people farm as their main source of money. matthew</p>

<dd>I can help with the subject matter, but I don't know much about the mechanics of categories in Wikipedia. Could you describe what needs to be done? <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunray_969d.html" title="User:Sunray">Sunray</a> 16:34, July 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, Sunray, thanks for your offer. I started to do it, but that didn't go over well. All you need to do is:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>See if the article is in any appropriate categories.</li>
<li>If so, especially if those are a subcat of "Agriculture", delete the agriculture category.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>I might ought to warn you that when I started doing this someone didn't like it. See this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Maurreen#Loose_cannon.3F" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Maurreen#Loose_cannon.3F" rel="nofollow">note</a>.
<dl>
<dd>Also, is there a better name for "Plant farming"? I made that subcat, and it's listed at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2005_July_25#Category:Plant_farming" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2005_July_25#Category:Plant_farming" rel="nofollow">CFD</a>.</dd>
<dd>And the number of articles in the main cat is down to about 120. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaurreen_1d2b.html" title="User:Maurreen">Maurreen</a> 17:02, 25 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Plant farming? It depends what is meant. I don't think it is a good category. Horticulture is a general term for cultivation of plants though it often has the connotation of small scale. Crop management or field crop management are often used in agriculture. Vegetable farming or growing is more specific. Perhaps we should consider what articles would go in this subcategory or subcategories. <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunray_969d.html" title="User:Sunray">Sunray</a> 17:34, July 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps the reason some people didn't like it is that doing this job takes a little common sense. For example, just because it is in a subcategory doesn't automatically mean it should not be in the parent category. Or in a different subcategory of the same category (one which might also have other categories above it). Sometimes, for example, a term will have a specific meaning or special importance within one subcategory, yet it has a slightly different meaning or applicability in agriculture in general.</dd>
<dd>BTW, even the 170 articles you started is a nice size for a category; small enough to fit on one page with some room for expansion. Now that it is down under 120 articles, there is no urgency in depopulating the parent category; by all means continue to put those which apply to only one or two existing subcategories into those categories, but take time to consider both the need for them and good names for them before adding new categories. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 18:17, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

There were far to many things in the cat, that were well described by a descriptive subcategory. I recategorised lots. [User:Pollinator]] seems to be revernting them all for no apparent reason. I CFD'd plant farming since it is a bad term for something covered by both cat:horticulture and cat:crops.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 04:31, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I quote Gene's wise words: <i>just because it is in a subcategory doesn't automatically mean it should not be in the parent category. Or in a different subcategory of the same category (one which might also have other categories above it). Sometimes, for example, a term will have a specific meaning or special importance within one subcategory, yet it has a slightly different meaning or applicability in agriculture in general.</i> Furthermore, once you remove something from a category, it becomes hard to find; it vanishes from the page history. The agriculture category is our master index of the subject. Since I do not have the time to cut and paste the category back in, I will continue to revert all your deletions which are actually better characterized as "for no apparent reason," since you neglected to discuss this before starting your campaign. If you want to add, be my guest; if you delete, you are destroying other people's work. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPollinator_822e.html" title="User:Pollinator">Pollinator</a> 04:58, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Saying that all of them in the subcategories belong in the parent category is even sillier than saying that none of them should be in the parent category.

<p>To become a really excellent article we need a Livestock section equivalent in detail to current Section 3 (Crops). We give lip-service to the idea that animal husbandry is co-equal with crop farming in Agriculture, but the article has about a 10-1 crops-to-livestock imbalance.

<p>I am only new to this Wikki Stuff, and hope not to offend anyone. The Yeild increase's stated in the extract(A) below may be reasonably accurate,(no citation). The last sentence states that the increase in yield is due to genetic improvements. I had recently read a reputable article about the subject that states 68% worldwide is due to crop management.I have provided the extract(B) below, along with a link to the article. I would like to remove "primarily due to improvements in genetics." If there is any evidence to that proves it is due mainly to genetics please provide it to this forum. Is there any objection to removing this statement in the next week or so?</p>
<p>Extract(A) For example, average yields of corn (maize) in the USA have increased from around 2.5 tons per hectare (40 bushels per acre) in 1900 to about 9.4 t/ha (150 bushels per acre) in 2001, primarily due to improvements in genetics.</p>
<p>Extract(B) "The proportion of the yield increase that can be attributed to crop management ranges from 47 to 83 per cent worldwide, with an average of 68 per cent," he says.</p>

<p>with new modern technic agriculture have developed some revolution like green revolution who have change the way to plant and cultivated and still world of agriculture try fullfill human foods need. But with certain change of climate and shortage of clear water, the way to cultivation would change too. In near future when human would use the sea surface area to growing wheat and rice and other plantation to fullfill human foods. When human begin looking seeds and plants who able grow and adpet in high salt water (maybe they would able isolated the gene from beach forests plant). The agriculture would move not to depend on climate or rain water or clear water to cultivate. Maybe It would begin in equator(sea around equator area) line, Maybe they would plant near the beach first and evantualy going plantation in middle sea, so marine agriculture would change rapidly to the future needs, not so like now who only seaweed and seagrass cultivated and harvesting<a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaimond_5428.html" title="User:Daimond">Daimond</a> 12:32, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
