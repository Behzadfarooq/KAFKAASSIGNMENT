	    <p>The <b>Agriculture in Russia</b> is struggling to rebuild as it transforms itself from a command economy to a more market-oriented system. Following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, large State farms had to contend with the sudden loss of heavy government subsidies. Livestock inventories declined, pulling down demand for feed grains, and the area planted to grains dropped by 25 percent in less than ten years. The use of mineral fertilizer and other costly inputs plummeted, driving yields downward. Most farms could no longer afford to purchase new machinery and other Capital Investments. After about ten years of decline, Russian agriculture began to show signs of modest improvement. As in Ukraine, the transition to a more market-oriented system has introduced the element of fiscal responsibility, which has resulted in increased efficiency as farmers try to maintain productivity while struggling with resource constraints. Official data indicate a rebound in Russian grain yield in recent years, and although the bumper harvests of 2001, 2003, and 2004 are due in large part to favorable weather, most analysts agree that the gradual improvement will continue.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/r/Agriculture_in_Russia_3f2c.html" title="Edit section: Private farms">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Private farms</span></h2>
<p>In 2003, private farms accounted for 14.4 percent of Russia's total grain production (up from 6.8 percent in 1995), 21.8 (10.9) percent of sunflowerseed, and 10.1 (4.0) percent of sugar beets. Private household plots, with a maximum size of 2 hectares (5 acres), produce an astonishing 93 percent of the country's potatoes and 80 percent of the vegetables, either for personal consumption or for sale at local markets. Only about 1 percent of grains, oilseeds, and sugar beets (???). Another problem is that rural infrastructure which would provide processing and business services is not in place while tax rates are high. Families which strike out on their own also lose the services provided by the TOO.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/r/Agriculture_in_Russia_3f2c.html" title="Edit section: Private plots">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Private plots</span></h2>
<p>The role of household plots has grown with production increasing from 32% of production in 1992 to 57% in 1998. Both production and sales, measured in weighted kilograms a standardized measure for the purpose of statistical comparison across product type, have increased to an average 8,765 weighted kg production in 1999 with 4,463 weighted kg in sales. Rented land has increased to an average of 4,000 square metres in 1999. Average adjusted income for rural Russian households has tripled between 1997 and 1999 to 1,524.7 rubles per month; while, considering both money and nonmonetary income, the percentage of rural households living in poverty has decreased from 28.9% in 1997 to 17.1% in 1999. Households produced 56.6% of the meat and 48.2% of the dairy products in 1998.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/r/Agriculture_in_Russia_3f2c.html" title="Edit section: Planting and Harvest Dates">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Planting and Harvest Dates</span></h2>
<p>The winter-crop planting season stretches over nearly three months. The sowing campaign begins in August in the north and advances southward, concluding in late October in the Southern district. Spring grain planting in European Russia usually begins in April and progresses from south to north. The "summer" crops--chiefly corn and sunflowers--are last to be sown, and planting is approaching completion by late May or early June. The harvest of the small grains (chiefly wheat and barley) moves from south to north and begins in late June in extreme southern Russia. Harvest operations are in full swing by early July and largely finished by mid-to-late August. Corn and sunflower harvest begins in September and continues through October. (View regional crop calendars.)</p>
<p>In the spring wheat region, planting typically begins in May. Oats are sown first, followed by wheat, then barley. Planting is concluded by June. Spring wheat advances through the reproductive stage during mid-July, when temperatures climb to their highest levels and grains are most vulnerable to heat stress. Grain harvest begins in late August and continues through October. It is not unusual for a significant portion of the Russian grain crop--millions of hectares in some years--to remain unharvested, due chiefly to unfavorable weather during the harvest campaign. In an average year, 10 percent of the area planted to spring wheat is abandoned compared to 97 percent of the country's winter wheat area.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/r/Agriculture_in_Russia_3f2c.html" title="Edit section: Farms Credit">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Farms Credit</span></h2>
<p>There has been improvement in the agricultural credit situation in Russia over the past five years – for some farms, at least – due largely to subsidies from the federal government. The <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priority_national_projects_of_Russia_7fc2.html" title="Priority national projects of Russia">national project</a> for agriculture has given impetus to the growth of small farms. During 2006, 36,000,000,000 rubles in credit were given to more than 100,000 recipients (as compared to 3.4 billion rubles in credit to 2500 borrowers in 2005). Traditional farms and personal plots play an important role in the sector, providing more than 87 percent of all production.</p>
<p>The State offers in-kind credits, whereby seed, fertilizer, and other inputs are provided in exchange for grain harvested at the end of the season, though the use of in-kind credit is reportedly decreasing. The government also provides subsidies for the purchase of plant-protection chemicals and fertilizers, and subsidizes two-thirds of the interest rate on loans from commercial banks, which provide the majority of farm credit. Banks remain cautious and insist on certain farm management practices and minimum levels of input use before granting loans (a policy which, according to some observers, has had a significant positive effect on overall efficiency in the agricultural sector), but banks’ confidence is boosted by increasingly reliable guarantees from regional administrations who see stability of food production as a high priority. Banks recognize the inherent risk in agricultural financing, but also see agriculture as less risky than other industries and are generally willing to lend money to solvent, well-managed farms.</p>
<p>Over fifty percent of Russia’s farms, however, are already saddled with considerable debt, due in part to the disparity between grain prices and production costs, and few farms are able to offer sufficient collateral to secure a loan. As a result, many farms are forced to rely on outside investors to guarantee loans. These investors, frequently referred to as holding companies, typically are large, cash-rich, traditionally non-agricultural companies that became involved in agriculture over the past five years. Some viewed crop production as a potentially highly profitable venture, and others were working to guarantee raw materials for vertically-integrated food-processing operations. Holding companies possess assets that satisfy banks’ demand for collateral, and a farm that receives a commercial loan with the help of a holding company is still eligible for the federal interest subsidy. Many holding companies, particularly those who were attracted to agriculture by the high grain prices during 2000, have lost interest in crop production following two years of low prices and are bailing out. Investments in crop production don’t pay off quickly, in contrast to investments in trade. Although some holding companies remain comfortable with the variable profitability of agriculture and will continue to work with farms, several prominent commodity analysts feel that the overall involvement of big companies in agriculture is declining.</p>
<p>This means that current prospects for significant, long-term investment in agriculture – particularly the purchase of agricultural machinery and grain-storage facilities – are somewhat dim. Land reform has been evolving in Russia since the basic right to own farmland was established in 1993, but "landowners" are still unable to use land as collateral in securing a loan. The situation, however, is not one that can be resolved quickly or easily through legislation alone. There is no mechanism currently in place to enable banks to evaluate the value of land based on its productivity before issuing loans, and banks likely would be reluctant to use land as collateral regardless of legislation. Furthermore, there are restrictions against non-agricultural use of land that is currently used for agriculture: if land is used for other purposes, the owner loses the title to the land. This imposes a limit on the land’s "re-sellability," and, in turn, its value. Most observers believe that the use of land as collateral is years away.</p>
