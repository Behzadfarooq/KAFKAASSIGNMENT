<p>I suggested the merger, because the city has not ever been deserted by its inhabitants since its foundation in the 6th century BC so there is continuity. We can incorporate what useful information exists in the stub <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agrigentum.html" title="Agrigentum">Agrigentum</a> into the article <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agrigento.html" title="Agrigento">Agrigento</a>, in the section dealing with the history of the city.

<dd>Your reasoning is sound, I am just wondering whether it is ever worthwhile retaining a short article on an historic name, in the sense that the name itself may be of historic significance and have sufficient info of interest pertaining to it. I am aware that many Sicilian towns have undergone name changes because of the various conquests, and some of those names may be of such historic interest that they may warrant an article in their own right. On this occasion, that is not necessarily the case, Agrigentum and Agrigento are basically the same word. However, a case might be made that the original Greek name <a href="../../../a/k/r/Akragas.html" title="Akragas">Akragas</a> may have sufficient interest and information to warrant a separate article (I don't really know the origin of the Greek word, so I am not in a position to make the argument - I simply throw it up as a possibility). That is before we even get to the Arabic inspired Sicilian name: <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girgenti.html" title="Girgenti">Girgenti</a>. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 23:58, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also I note that the article says that Agrigento stands on the exact spot that Agrigentum stood - I'm personally not sure one way or the other - but I do know that one of Agrigento's main historical sites, the Valley of the Temples, is certainly a few miles out of town - which makes me wonder whether they do in fact occupy identical locations (but if not, certainly very close). Once again, I am neutral to the idea, and simply hope that these matters are fully considered before we make the move. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 00:03, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I appreciate your cautiousness. After all, what we are considering is relevant to many other cities in Sicily which have separate articles under their historic names. I tried to do a bit of research since yesterday, here is what I found:
<ul>
<li>The names <i>Agrigentum</i>, <i>Girgenti</i> and <i>Agrigento</i> are cognate and are derived from the (original) name <i>Akragas</i>. The <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stem_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Stem (linguistics)">stem</a> in <i>Akragas</i> is <i>akragant-</i>. In the nominative case <i>akragant-</i> + the ending <i>-s</i> becomes <i>akragas</i> (due to the ancient Greek <a href="../../../e/u/p/Euphony.html" title="Euphony">euphonic</a> rules). However, in the genitive, dative and accusative cases, the <i>"nt"</i> remains intact (akragantos/akraganti/akraganta respectively). Clearly, the consonants survived the centuries better than the (more malleable) vowels. However, there is no obvious etymology for the name, and I have not managed to find anything on that.</li>
<li>The Valley of the Temples is indeed a couple of kilometres to the SE of the city center (<a href="http://www.alder-digital.de/earth.php?long=13.583333&amp;lat=37.316667" class="external text" title="http://www.alder-digital.de/earth.php?long=13.583333&amp;lat=37.316667" rel="nofollow">Google Earth link</a>). Despite the size of the city in antiquity, such a distance is not trivial, as you already pointed out. Through some quick googling I found the following relevant information on <a href="http://www.sicilybella.com/about_agrigento.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sicilybella.com/about_agrigento.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> commercial site: <i>"...it sharply declined until, in 829, it was taken by the Arabs, who destroyed the town only to rebuild it on a higher site."</i> If that is true, then it is easy to find a proper historical source for that (just give me a couple of days).</li>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Should this temporal discontinuity (I don't know how long it took the Arabs to reestablish the city) and relocation (a couple of kilometers) be considered important enough so that there is a need to distinguish between two cities?
<ol>
<li>The ancient one, known under the names Akragas (Ancient and Modern Greek) and Agrigento (Latin) until 829</li>
<li>The newer one, known as Girgenti (Arabic and Modern Sicilian) and Agrigento (Italian).</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I am not sure what the answer is but it is important for deciding whether to proceed with the merger or not. And then we should also aim for consistency in the case of other Sicilian cities with separate articles under their historical names. Either we merge them all or none or only those that have historical continuity.</dd>

<li><b>Support</b> - thinking it through, I think the key questions you have asked above are spot on, and I am sort of coming round to the view that we are pretty much talking about the same place existing with the same name since its inception. If there isn't too much to say about the origin of the historic name, it doesn't make sense to retain it as its own page. Also, there seems to be an inconsistency in that <a href="../../../a/k/r/Akragas.html" title="Akragas">Akragas</a> redirects to <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agrigentum.html" title="Agrigentum">Agrigentum</a> - if anything, it should be the other way round. Better still, have all the various versions redirect to <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agrigento.html" title="Agrigento">Agrigento</a>. Lastly, re Semioli's point below, it is a fair enough view. I would support that approach where there is a major disconnect between the ancient and modern cities in terms of either time or geography. As an example, <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troy.html" title="Troy">Troy</a> is a lengthy article, and the modern day town in Turkey has a separate article altogether - that seems reasonable in that set of circumstances, i.e. that Troy basically ceased to exist for many centuries once it was destroyed (I think). <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPippu_d%27angelo_0c40.html" title="User:Pippu d'angelo">ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑</a> - <a href="../../../../scn/p/i/p/User_talk%7EPippu_d%27Angelo_27df.html" class="extiw" title="scn:User_talk:Pippu_d'Angelo"><small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small></a> 09:07, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Oppose</b> Both articles have a reason to exist, one referring to the ancient city, and one to the modern one.--<a href="../../../s/e/m/User%7ESemioli_3e76.html" title="User:Semioli">Semioli</a> 16:30, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Support - but</b> As the articles are know, I would support merging Agrigentum into Agrigento. Especially, most of the article Agrigento is also dedicated to the ancient town and buildings and not to the modern town so that a separation seems not to be justified.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I can also see Semiolis point for having two articles, but I would prefer the original name "Akragas" for the article on the ancient town and "Agrigentum" as a redirect thereto. Akragas was the ancient city founded by the Greek. It was destroyed in 406 B.C. but refounded by the Greek in the 4th century B.C. based on the ancient plan of the town, and the temples were restored. So there is a continuity. In 210 B.C. Akragas became a Roman "civitas" under the name of Agrigentum. (Continuity again, but now longer the importance of the classic greek time). In the 8th century, the ancient town had dwindled to a little village. Due to beginning raids by the Arabs, the inhabitants retreated to the hill in the north which formerly served as the Akropolis of Akrageas and where the first temples of Akragas had been built (discontinuity). After conquering the village, the Arabs founed a new city on this hill which delveloped to the modern Agrigento. So there are two characteristic times and locations: 6th century B.C. to 8th century: ancient town on the cliff; 9th century til now: town on the hill north of the cliff.</p>
<p>In the German Wikipedia, we treated the subject as follows: the article <a href="../../../../de/a/g/r/Agrigent.html" class="extiw" title="de:Agrigent">de:Agrigent</a> (German name of Agrigento) only tells about the modern town and its history beginning with the Arabs, and then we have an article <a href="../../../../de/a/r/c/Arch%C3%A4ologische_St%C3%A4tten_von_Agrigent_cb3f.html" class="extiw" title="de:Archäologische_Stätten_von_Agrigent">de:Archäologische Stätten von Agrigent</a> (Archeological sites of Agrigento) with redirects from Akragas and Agrigentum which describes the history and remains of the ancient city which now are a Unesco world heritage.</p>
<p>If a separation is regarded as best solution, this might also be a possible solution for the English Wikipedia. At least, the Article Agrigento should then be cleared from anything (but a short reference) which describes the ancient city and only refer to the history, economy and sights of the town on the hill. --<a href="../../../b/j/s/User%7EBjs-en_3367.html" title="User:Bjs-en">Bjs-en</a> 20:26, 7 August 2006 (UTC) (=<a href="../../../../de/b/j/s/Benutzer%7EBjs_114d.html" class="extiw" title="de:Benutzer:Bjs">de:Benutzer:Bjs</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>That's a well made out case, and I would support a restructuring along those lines because I could certainly see a significant article being developed around the ancient Akragas/Agrigentum.
