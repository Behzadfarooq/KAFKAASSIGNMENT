<p>Someone put "Farm subsidies have the effect increasing production and therefore lowering the price of food" probably in response to "Someone with some background in economics really needs to expand on the benefits of subsidizing agriculture". This really is desperately clutching at straws! The price of food PER UNIT BOUGHT likely does, but to deduce further (i.e. state that the savings per unit are greater than the cost of extra needless produce) is, at the very least, not encyclopedic! This then makes the rest of paragraph (though factual and interesting) redundant in this section. Therefore, I propose removing it all. 09:55 GMT - Chris 31 January 2007</p>
<dl>
<dd>The section must somewhere say that subsidization lowers the price of food as this is the most obvious benefit for consumers. I understand you rationale, but the article never said that the savings were greater than the extra costs. It simply stated a benefit of subsidization. If you would like to add an addendum note to the section so that there is no longer an implication, then by all means do. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarhol13_392b.html" title="User:Warhol13">Warhol13</a> 13:55, 18 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I feel it is very dubious to include this "benefit". Since you have reinstated the paragraph I have added
<blockquote>
<p>Economists strongly rebute the benefits of reduced retail prices derived from subsidising over-production. If the government were to subsidise car manufacturers to produce more cars then this would indeed lower the showroom price but it would be the consumer's own money collected through tax that would be used to fund the over-production. It would be impossible for the lower retail costs to outweigh the addition production costs otherwise the manufacturers could simply implement this technique themselves.</p>

<p>I added an NPOV tag so that hopefully, we can get this article to be more neutral. There are several benefits to ag subsidies that aren't even discussed. It's heavily biased against them. --<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckeyes1186_0fe1.html" title="User:Buckeyes1186">buckeyes1186</a> 05:12, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I added three benefits and I think the article as it is now does a good job o explaining the two sides.

<p>This article is VERY non-neutral. Someone with some background in economics really needs to expand on the benefits of subsidizing agriculture. Currently there is just a basic amount of statistics on it followed by a large block of criticisms.</p>
<p>The reason there is so little mention of benefits is that they are few and far between. Farm subsidies are good for farmers and bad for everyone else, and economic theory shows that the bad should greatly outweigh the good.</p>
<p>The whole page is riddled with errors and inconsistencies starting from the first phrase and continuing to the para immediately above. Subsidies can be from other sources than just government spending. Farm subsidies are not necessarily good for farmers nor bad for everyone else. Farmers may not even benefit from some subsidies (for example where subsidy is capitalised into land values, benefiting land owners (as opposed to farmers - roughly half of farmers own the land they farm in both the U.S. and the EU).</p>
<dl>
<dd>This article completely fails to mention the primary method of agricultural subsidy. That is, price support by means of the federal government purchasing commodities in the market in order to increase demand and push up the price. Not only is this far, far more expensive than simply making payments to farmers, it prevents developing economies from advancing by effectively blocking the import of agricultural goods. My wording on this is not great, so I haven't updated this article yet.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Of course, the article should be NPOV. However, the economic costs and benefits of farm subsidies are widely known and mostly agreed upon by economists. If the objective of this article is to discuss facts, the "Criticisms" section should be much more detailed and likely more "negative" than it is.<a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardmking_2900.html" title="User:Edwardmking">Edwardmking</a> 20:49, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This entire article needs to be re-written. There is little neutral point of view. Under benefits, it states that subsidies are unnecessary because they ensure a livable wage for farmers. This is obviously not neutral and "livable wage" is an ambiguous phrase. It also states that demand for food is inelastic which is ambiguous, as elasticity changes depending on short and long run. There is a solid argument that the obesity problem is the result of much cheaper food (i.e. people are eating more because food is cheaper). The article also states that farms are "too" efficient and produce more food than can be eaten. However, the main for of agricultural subsidy (and the most damaging) are price supports. The whole point of a price support is that it encourages production by guaranteeing an artificially high price. If the price were allowed to fall to its market equilibrium, less farmers would find it profitable enough to farm and so production would likely fall. The article states simultaneously that there is over-production and that production needs to be encouraged. Please see the article on <a href="../../../p/r/i/Price_support.html" title="Price support">price support</a> for a better idea on the effects of these subsidies.<a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardmking_2900.html" title="User:Edwardmking">Edwardmking</a> 20:44, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
