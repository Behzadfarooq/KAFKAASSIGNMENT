<dd>I think the structure of the article is a lot better now... it has room for expansion in ag policy areas. There is still a lot of need for cleanup... some of the sections are long and rambling...

<p>The opposition section reads like a political pamphlet, even employing the first person. While I am no expert in this particular field of economics, I would be happy to give that section a more dispassionate voice. Any objections? For the sake of transparency, I should note that my personal bias is against farm subsidies, but I came to this page looking for a strong argument in their favor.</p>
<p>-Jarrett</p>
<p>Follow-up: Thank you, Orzetto. Your edit is definitely an improvement. I'm curious if anyone can add more to the pro section. I've heard the argument that subsidies can help avert crises along the lines of the '29 crash. I don't know how widely such theories are supported in academia, but since they seem to be floating around, I'd like to see someone treat them in the article. I'll try to do some research on the topic elsewhere. If I can find anything substantial, I might write something up.</p>
<p><br />
-Jarrett</p>
<p>Good edit. However, I don't know of any green economists who argue that local production of organic produce by families should be taxed or regulated at all, so the phrase "Some green economists" should probably read "Most green economists". Maybe these qualifications should probably just be spelled out...</p>
<p>Good point about agribusiness being the beneficiary of lax import / free trade rules. Link to <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_farm.html" title="Family farm">family farm</a> may be in order. Rules for rural land ownership typically affect both agricultral policy and family farms, perhaps that should be in an article on <a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_reform.html" title="Land reform">land reform</a>, which some economists (e.g. de Soto, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Stiglitz_b30e.html" title="Joseph Stiglitz">Joseph Stiglitz</a>) see as essential.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immigration_policy.html" title="Immigration policy">immigration policy</a> in some developed nations has exceptions specifically to enable <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agricultural_policy.html" title="Agricultural policy">agricultural policy</a>, e.g. migrant farm workers in Canada and the US. That should probably be mentioned.</p>
<p>Removed this. The United States has almost ended farm subsidies several times. It's back in, but it's far from clear that they will continue for the forseenable future. Also, the "since" clause is NPOV. Opponents to agricultural policy would argue that it will continue as long as there are rural voters.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Since agricultural produce is mostly traded and entirely priced on <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodity_markets.html" title="Commodity markets">commodity markets</a>, but presents special <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biosafety.html" title="Biosafety">biosafety</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biosecurity.html" title="Biosecurity">biosecurity</a> risks, not to mention being produced typically by the poorest segments of the population in <a href="../../../d/e/v/Developing_nations.html" title="Developing nations">developing nations</a>, some such policy measures favoring local production and higher consumer prices to subsidize these larger goals will remain in place for the forseeable future.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You seem to be confusing 'agricultural policy' as a concept with the specific agricultural policy concept in place inthe US. If the US has a policy of zoning land for agricultural use or supporting loans to family farmers, then it has an agricultural policy, although it may not support that with outright cash subsidy.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The United States doesn't have any national policy of zoning agricultural land nor any national policy of supporting loans to family farmers. There are some cities which do have agricultural zoning ordinances, but given that they are local regulations which are neither coordinated nor universal, it's hard to term those "policy."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, the 'since' clause, if you read this, implies only that 'since' (a) food is traded on commodity markets (b) food presents special biosafety and biosecurity concerns (c) it is raised by poor people in developing nations, 'then' (z) it is hopelessly political and subsidies will continue. I don't see that as controversial, but if you do, then changing "will" to "will probably" or "subsidize" to "reflect" will NPOV the statement very nicely. Or else, you could add (d) rural voters have much power in democracies</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The problem with this is that even the *probably* is subject to question within the United States. There are major consitutencies for agricultural subsdies but there are also major constituetncies against it.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If your position is that the NPOV is that (a), (b), (c) are disputable or don't matter politically, or that (d) is the deciding issue necessarily, I don't agree. Accordingly I can't see why you'd say the 'since' is not NPOV.</dd>

<dd>"Since" implies that a) b) c) are true. If you want to change them to "assuming that", that is a bit better.</dd>

<p>A more substantive edit now includes all of the above points by both sides. Disputed claims were eliminated or put in context that makes them clearer. There is a lot to say on this issue. It probably won't be right on one pass. Thanks for helping.</p>

<p>I think developing countries should <a href="http://ashishniti.blogspot.com/2004/07/poorer-countries-should-take-advantage.html" class="external text" title="http://ashishniti.blogspot.com/2004/07/poorer-countries-should-take-advantage.html" rel="nofollow">take advantage of farm subsidies</a> instead of opposing them. In fact, cheaper farm imports and resources freed that were previously employed in farming can combine to produce powerful advantage. The savings from the above two factors can be good enough to move away from farm jobs. See my blog entry for more details.</p>

<p>whats this about a US rice farmer getting 1000000 over 5 years? 200,000 a year. each? I find that extraordinarily hard to believe. Also gdp of spain is 800 billion dollars according to world bank and EU budge agricultural subsidy is 40 billion euro. I dont know how much canadian cows are subsidised or how much milk cartons cost.

Agreed, another part of agricultural policy is Phytosanitary regulations, these can greatly restrict the import of developing world produce to developed markets. Similarly, there should be more differentiation between the different types of trade barrier, for example quotas that link output to level of subsidy. Furthermore, more elabloration needs to occur on how subsides hurt the environment because the link production with funding. The price of land is pushed artifically high and many farmers/farm conglomerates use nonarable land to grow their crops.</p>

<p>There is a huge section titled subsidy and tiny ones headed price control and import barriers. Maybe no one knows much about these last two, but at least some of the polemic under subsidies ought to be spread about.<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 22:22, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have a problem with suggested section headings arguments for.. and arguments against. While I am reasonably happy that the 'arguments against' are in fact what it says, I am not happy at describing the section 'arguments for' as such.</p>
<p>A number of things listed are aims and objectives which governments seek to carry out. To say that a certain aim is sought, is not to say that this aim is good. Saying that these are 'arguments for' implies that things in this section explain why agricultural policy is good. Economists might (and do) argue that self-sufficiency in food is an illusive aim and in practice does not confer a benefit. Well, the 'against' section makes this point about whether the policy really works. But the 'for' section is not exactly constructed to say why policies are good. Rather it goes through a list of the sorts of things which make up agricultural policy, good and bad. It does suggest that certain governments consider these aims desireable, but a neutral observer might not. Some of the policies indeed are contradictory...protected markets are likely to lead to expensive food. So inherently, what one government thinks is good, another thinks is bad.</p>
<p>So conceptually I see the sections as first one listing policies and reasoning for them, second containing criticisms. It may be that this scheme leaves an opening for a third section, but I don't see there is enough material to put in it. Rather there should be a rounded discussion in both sections so that all points are covered.<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 01:08, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Agricultural policy has a very long history. A lot of subsidies continue because lobbying groups have developed to maintain a subsidy that was implemented a long time ago to address a problem that no longer exists. This makes it kind of difficult to write an "argument for" section... We can speculate, I suppose, that subsidies to rice, cotton, and sugar originated after the civil war to buy political support from the southern states where these crops are grown. Is "bribing southern states not to secede" a legitimate "argument for"?</p>
<p>Don't give short shrift to the "food self sufficiency" argument. World war II wasn't all that long ago and long before there were weapons of mass destruction, cutting off a country's food supply was considered an extremely efficient means of killing off large amounts of your opponent's population. Millions of people in Russia starved to death.</p>
<p>Another self sufficiency argument: Look at North Korea, and how food aid is being used as a political tool to put external pressure on the North Korean regime. If you become reliant on food imports you make yourself vulnerable to foreign government manipulation of your food supply for political reasons. The United States tried this on the USSR in the seventies with the grain embargo, although it failed miserably (USSR just imported wheat from other sources).</p>
<p>I wouldn't be surprised if basically all countries that use "self sufficiency" as an argument have been invaded in the last century.</p>

<p>An important, but almost universally overlooked, result of US subsidies is that most developing countries actually benefit, on aggregate. As section 3.1 points out, developing countries are importing cheap food from developed coutries. Consequently, most of the population is consuming <i>cheaper</i> food than if there were no US subsidies. Of course there are still distributional issues. If you care more about the rural poor than the urban poor, the argument against subsidies stands. But <i>on aggregate</i>, for a vast majority of developing coutries, the gains from cheap food outweigh the loss to displaced farmers. In other words, the beneficiaries (presumably urban households) could theoretically compensate the losers (presumably rural households, but not necessarily) and still come out a head. There has been serious research on this subject. I can point out the working papers by various economists (NBER, UMD) if necessary.</p>

<p>This article still reads too much like an arguement against certain policy than a presentation of what the topic. The facts are too selective and small scale. I don't know anything about this particular topic and don't have much of an opinion which is why I turned to it. I didn't feel like I was reading an economics text book on what agricultural policy is and the methods employed by governments but the negative effects of certain policies and what some alternatives may be most fo which I see at the green festival every year in S.F. (that right there gives away my political views). So while I may support most of the suggested policies I don't feel like I learned anything in this article and therefore it is in no way up to the standards or objectives of WIkipedia. Most of the alternatives need to be presented in a separate article say "alternatives to modern agricultural policy" with a hotlink and a short blurb on how current/modern policy is disputed. Which brings me to the final point. This article lacks hotlinks and does not try to extend to the reader how "agricultural policy" fits into the larger structure of general economics and wikipedia's economics category. It needs to quote specific economic theory, arguements/counterarguements so that the reader may learn the economics of agricultural policy, which is what this article should be all about. Sry if this came off as a rant in any way. 3/9/2007</p>
