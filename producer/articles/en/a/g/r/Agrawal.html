<p>King <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agrasen.html" title="Agrasen">Agrasen</a> had set out to travel all over India to look for a suitable site to establish his new kingdom. At one place, he found a few tiger cubs and wolf cubs playing together. This indicated to Agrasen and Madhavi, his wife, that this was a 'veerbhoomi' (the Land of the Brave). They decided to establish their capital city at that place. Thus Agroha came into being, about 51 years before the Mahabharata war, near present day Hissar in Haryana. Under the leadership of Maharaja Agrasen, Agroha became very prosperous. It continued to grow in later years and legend has it that a hundred thousand traders lived in the city in its heydays. An insolvent community man as well as an immigrant wishing to settle in the city would be given a rupee and a brick by each inhabitant of the city. Thus, he would have a hundred thousand bricks to build a house for himself, and a hundred thousand rupees to start a new business.</p>
<p>The name Agrewal, Agrawal, Agarwal, Agarwala, Aggarwal (and various other English spellings) is derived from the word <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agroha.html" title="Agroha">Agroha</a> (Sanskrit Agrotaka), the original center of the Agarwals, which is near <a href="../../../h/i/s/Hissar.html" title="Hissar">Hissar</a> in <a href="../../../h/a/r/Haryana.html" title="Haryana">Haryana</a>.

From Emperor Agrasen arose the Agarwal people. Maharaj Agrasen had fathered 18 children. From these eighteen children started the eighteen gotras of the Agrawals. The Emperor was an icon of non-violence, messenger of peace, an embodiment of Sacrifice, Compassion, Prosperity and a True Socialist. Emperor Agrasen was born to King Ballabh of Pratapnagar. He was the eldest son. According to the Mahalakshmi Vrath, the age then was the last stages of Dvaapar Yug. According to current calendar the birth of Maharaj Agrasen took place about 5185 years ago. King Ballabh was a Suryavamshi (lineage from the Sun). Even when he was very young, Prince Agrasen was very well known for his compassion. He never discriminated against anyone and the subjects were very pleased with the way he conducted himself.</p>
<p>According to Vachanakosha of Bulakhichand (1680AD), Agar Rishi married a naga-kanya and had 18 children <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/r/Agrawal.html" title="Edit section: Mythology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mythology</span></h2>
<p>Agarwals are the sons of Maharaja Agrasen, who was the Suryavanshi, or Solar Race, king. Agrasen was blessed by the goddess Mahalakshmi, and suggested that he take up the Vaishya tradition of business for the sake of the prosperity of his people. She then asked him to found a new kingdom, and promised that she would bless his descendants with prosperity and wealth that can be use for good deeds.</p>
<p>When Agrasen became a young man, he attended the Swayamvara of the daughter of the King Nagaraj; Princess Madhavi. Many kings from around the world attended, including Indra, the King of the Devas. In the Swayamvara, Princess Madhavi selected Prince Agrasen by putting the garland on him. This marriage caused a coming together of two different family cultures; Prince Agrasen was a Suryavanshi and Princess Madhavi was a Naagavanshi.<br /></p>
<p>Indra had been smitten by the beauty of Princess Madhavi and had planned to get married to her. However, now that he was unable to marry her, he became very jealous and angry with Agrasen. To attain revenge against Agrasen, Indra made sure that Pratap Nagar did not receive any rainfall. As a result, a frightening famine struck the Pratap Nagar kingdom.<br /></p>
<p>Emperor Agrasen then waged war against Indra, a dharamyud, whereupon his army vanquished Indra's forces and put them to flight. Faced with this situation, Indra approached Narada (the celestial sage) for mediation between himself and Emperor Agrasen. Narada then mediated a peace between them.<br /></p>
<p>Agrasen started a severe penance to propitiate Lord Shiva in the city of Kashi. Pleased with the penance of Agrasen, Lord Shiva appeared and advised him to propitiate Goddess Mahalakshmi. Maharaj Agrasen again started meditating on Goddess Mahalakshmi, who appeared before him. Goddess Mahalakshmi then blessed Agrasen and suggested that he take up the Vaishya tradition of business for the sake of prosperity of his people. She then asked him to found a new kingdom, and promised that she would bless his descendants with prosperity.</p>
<p><b>Birth Of Agroha city</b>-</p>
<p>With the blessings of Goddess Mahalakhmi, King Agrasen travelled all over India with the Queen to select a place for a new kingdom. At one point during his travels, he found a few tiger cubs and wolfs cubs playing together. To King Agrasen and Queen Madhavi, this was an auspicious indication that the area was Veerabhoomi (land of the brave) and they decided to found their new kingdom at that location named Agroha.<br /></p>
<p>Agroha became prosperous as agriculture and trade flourished. Maharaj Agrasen performed many Yagnas (sacrifices) for the prosperity of his people. In those days, performing a yagna was a symbol of prosperity. During one such yagna, Maharaj Agrasen noticed that a horse that had been brought to be sacrificed was trying hard to get away from the sacrificial altar. Seeing this Maharaj Agrasen was filled with pity and then thought as to what prosperity can be achieved by sacrificing mute animals.<br /></p>
<p>The idea of Ahimsa grabbed Maharaj Agrasen's mind. The King then discussed it with his ministers. The ministers then said if Maharaj Agrasen turned towards Ahimsa, the neighbouring kingdoms might consider it a sign of weakness and feel brave enough to attack Agroha. At this, Maharaj Agrasen mentioned that putting an end to violence and injustice does not mean weakness. He then proclaimed that there should be no violence and killing of animals in his kingdom.<br /></p>
<p>Maharaj Agrasen proceeded to conduct 18 Maha Yagnas. He then divided his kingdom among his 18 children, and established the 18 Gotras after the gurus of each of his children. These same 18 Gotras today are like the eighteen chapters of the Bhagavadgita; even though they are different from each other, they are still related to each other to form the whole. Under this arrangement, Agroha prospered very well and flourished.<br /></p>
<p>In the latter part of his life, Maharaj Agrasen nominated his eldest son Vibhu to the throne and took up the Vanaprasth Ashram. The prosperity of Agroha caused jealousy in many of the neighbouring kingdoms, and they frequently attacked it. Because of these aggressions, Agroha had to face numerous problems.<br /></p>
<p>In due course, the strength of Agroha was sapped. A huge fire engulfed the city of Agroha. Because of the fire, the citizens of the city fled and dispersed into various areas of Bharat. Today, these same people are known as Aggarwals and still have the same 18 Gotras that was given to them from their gurus and carry on the fame of Maharaj Agrasen. As per Maharaj Agrasen's guidance the Aggarwals are in the forefront of social service.</p>
