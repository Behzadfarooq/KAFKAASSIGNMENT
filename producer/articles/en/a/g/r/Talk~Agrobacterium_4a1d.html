	    <p>Agrobacterium is a genus of gram negative bacteria. A. tumefaciens is the most studied species; it causes crown gall, a plant disease, so called because infected plants have large swellings or galls at the crown of the plant, usually at or just below soil level. The disease is caused by transfer of DNA from bacterium to a plant cell, which then growws and divides out of control. If the genes that induce uncontrolled cell growth are removed, A. tumefaciens can be used in the genetic engineering of plants. Many of the GM crops grown today were constructed using A. tumefaciens as a vector for foreign DNA.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is information from the former <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plant_improvement.html" title="Plant improvement">plant improvement</a> article it is here to be used for writing the section on Agrobacterium in biotechnology. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 02:00, 12 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Recombinat DNA</p>
<p>[[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]] Him to. [tumefaciens] is a Gram-negative aerobic bacterium that induces tumors in the zone of infection, known with the name of Gall Of the Collar, that is of the part of border between stem and roots. The infected cells acquire the ownership to grow in way not regulated, and they maintain her/it even if the bacterium is not more present; I am therefore real cells [tumorali] whose [genoma] has been however integrated with extraneous portions.</p>
<p>Damaged cells of a plant (for [es]. from a lesion) they free factors that activate in the bacterium the geniuses [vir], of the virulence, located in the [PLASMIDE] Ti, [tumor inducing]. Proteins will be synthesized with function of factors of transcript.</p>
<p>Plasmids are molecules of circular DNA [extracromosomico] not tightly necessary to the bacterias, but that they bring advantages. They confer antibiotic resistance, [patogenicità], ability to metabolize in nourishing unusual substances, etc... they are transmissible is vertically from a bacterium to his/her/their progeny, that horizontally from bacterium bacterium. In genetic engineering as vectors are used for the transport of DNA.</p>
<p>This plasmid also contains a segment denominated T-DNA, carrying genes for the synthesis of [OPINE], of enzymes that degrade the [opine] and of [fitormoni], among which the [auxina].</p>
<p>Segment of the [plasmide] Ti</p>
<hr />
<p>|Genes |Left | T-DNA |Right | | | |--------------------------| | |Vir |Border | Opine | Enzymes | Ormons |Border |</p>
<hr />
<p>The synthesis of [opine] happens thanks to some enzymes codified by the T-DNA which you/they bring to the modification of certain amino acids that only the bacterium [infettante] is able to metabolize as source of carbon and nitrogen.</p>
<p>The T-DNA following the production of the [TFs] (factors of transcript) of the virulence, [escisso] comes awry to the height of the two Sequences [BORDER] and to valley of the same T-DNA, that passes as single filament in the vegetable cell in a trial similar to the bacterial conjugation. The [plasmide] is sheltered for [replicazione] of the DNA. Once inside the cell, the T-DNA has to enter the nucleus and to integrate himself/herself/themselves with the cellular DNA in a casual site, usually in multiple copies. This overturns the metabolism of the cell putting her/it to the service of his sophisticated parasitic genetic. The induced vegetable hormones are the cause of the growth not regulated.</p>
<p>Recapitulating, the process of infection is composed of:</p>
<p>[Chemotassi] and initial bond of the bacterium to the site of the lesion; development of a solid anchorage; beginning of the [escissione] of the T-DNA and his/her parceling with proteins; construction of the channel [transmenbrana]; migration of the T-DNA in the vegetable cell; migration of the T-DNA in the nucleus, integration and transcript. [edit] [Rhizogenes] A. [Rhizogenes] exists, also another [Gram] negative that contains to the place of the [plasmide] You the [PLASMIDE] RI, [root inducing]. With the same procedure it drives the cells in which it is integrated to differentiate him in roots, said [HAIRY ROOTS], hairy roots, also in which [opine] are produced. From roots [hairy root] induced by the bacterium has been possible to get, directly or more often by crop of fabrics, whole plants containing [transgeniche] the T-DNA [trasformante]. The analysis [fenotipica] of these individuals has put in evidence a series of modifications characteristic said Phenotype [HAIRY ROOT]. Even though with some differences among the studied kinds, the plants [transgeniches] introduce a more intense green color in the leaves, a smaller height for shortening of the [internodis], loss of the dominance [apicale] with greater development of the gems [ascellari], leaf shriveling, one accented[rizogenesi] with partial loss of the radical [geotropismo] 2.1, a reduction of the fertility and the production of seed, and in kind [bi] - and [poliennali] a reduction of the period of life. All of this would not do certain to think to a possible use of a group of geniuses able to instigate so negative alterations of the plant. The T-DNA of A. [rhizogenes], of which the sequence is known [nucleotidica], is composed of 18 [OPEN READING FRAMES] ([ORFs]), that is presumably of 18 different functions [geniche], the dissection of which and their transfer in plant has allowed to ascertain that the phenotype [hairy root] can be induced moving only to the plant three of the 18 present geniuses in the T-DNA, particularly [ORF] 10, 11, 12 (according to a genetic definition [rol] Á., [B], [C], where [rol] is for [root locus]) and that the intensity of the modifications is function both some number of copies of the fragment of T-DNA foresees is of the level of expression of the geniuses themselves.</p>
<p>[edit] method of the [cointegrazione] Seen the premises him it is therefore well thought to exploit these knowledges to introduce an useful character in a plant. This method has been developed for avoiding the in partnership problems to the manipulation of fragments of DNA as great as the [plasmide] You. The T-DNA has been cloned in a standard vector of E. coli together with the gene [NPT2] (for the resistance to the [kanamicina]), to the gene [pBR322] (for the resistance to the [ampicillina]) and to the gene of interest. The result is an integrative said [plasmide].</p>
<p>Operations are simple of you ransom-sew you effect with him enzymes of restriction you adapt, that is that they separate the I fragment smaller possible without touching the useful gene.</p>
<p>Integrative plasmid</p>
<pre>
             --------------------------------              
             |       |      |      |        |              
</pre>
<hr />
<p>| T-DNA | gene | NPT2 | pBR322 |--------------</p>
<p>| | | | | | | | -------------------------------- | | |</p>
<hr />
<p>You transforms the [plasmide] (what in test-tube is) in E. coli and they are selected the bacterias transformed with the [ampicillina] (and here it comes us profit the marker that gives the resistance to the [ampicillina], [pBR322]). they put on these to contact with intact [Agrobacteria], and, under proper conditions for the conjugation, the recombinant [plasmide] moves to [Agrobacterium], that will now have his You normal and the integrative [plasmide]. Both have the fragment T-DNA, whose sequences can interact for giving homologous recombination, that is the fusion of the integrative [plasmide], great around 5 [kilobasis] ([kb]), with the biggest [plasmide] You (200 [kbs]). The [plasmidis] that don't integrate him don't accumulate because they miss of an origin of [replicazione] for [Agrobacterium] (the so-called [oriC] in E Coli). they select you with the [kanamicina] the containing [Agrobacterias] the recombines [plasmide] You (and here it returns us profit the other used marker, [NPT2]). The system is extraordinarily [efficente], up to the 50% of the treated [protoplastis] it contains and it expresses the DNA transferred by the [Agrobacterium]. this tall efficiency of transformation allows us to select and to easily clone the modified [protoplastis].</p>
<p>[edit] Binary system And today the standard method for the transfer of the T-DNA. It makes use of two [plasmidis], Binary Vector and [PLASMIDE HELPER]. The binary vector is simply a [plasmide] You without the T-DNA, to the place of which they are inserted among the [borders] right and I damage the gene to move to the plant and a marker of selection. Another marker is inserted to the outside of the [borderses] for the future selection in E Coli. to notice that this vector maintains the origin of [replicazione] for [Agrobacterium].</p>
<p>Binary vector</p>

<hr />
<p>The [plasmide helper] is a [plasmide] You without the T-DNA but with still the geniuses [vir]. The binary vector is turned into E. coli, after selection the [trasformantis] are made to conjugate with a log of containing [Agrobacterium] the [plasmide helper] but not the You. In this way, following the activation from a wounded plant, the proteins of the geniuses [vir] (of the [plasmide helper]) they move the fragment of DNA among the two [borderses] (of the binary vector) in the vegetable cell. The binary vector, that is the containing [plasmide] the DNA to be transferred, as vector is maintained that is separately replied in [Agrobacterium]; in this difference is with the method of the [cointegrazione].</p>
<p>[edit] technique of the leaf disks It is not easy to make to grow whole plants beginning from [protoplasti], also for the most proper kinds. An improvement was had him/it with this technique, considering that the leaves are a good source of cells [rigeneranti]. They cuts out small disk forms from the leaves, whose borders are quickly infected if it is inoculated with [Agrobacteria]. The disks are transferred then on filter paper it posts above cells nurses that produce factors of growth. After 2-3 days of crop it transfers him in terrestrial [stimolatore] of buds ([citochinine]) where the cells that bring the [plasmide] are selected thanks to a marker (antibiotic). not to take the risk to spread recombinant [Agrobacteria] in the environment is added to the crop an antibiotic as the [CEFOTAXIME] that kills the bacterium.</p>
<p>The buds develop him in few weeks, they transfer him therefore in terrestrial that induces the formation of the roots ([auxine]). The whole trial takes from 4 to 7 weeks and is applicable to an ample variety of [dicotiledoni].</p>
<p>[edit] markers of selection The Geniuses Reporters furnish us support in to visualize the transformed cells. The gene of E. coli for the enzyme [ß-glucuronidasi] ([GUS]) you/he/she is often placed side by side to the DNA by [trasfettare] to the plants because they has invaluable levels of this enzyme. When cells that express the [GUS] are incubated with [X-glucuronide], a blue coloration [individuabile] produces him with methods [istochimici]. Or if a different substratum is used, the [GUS] can quantitatively be measured with a [fluorimetro]. Only disadvantage is that the cells must have killed for the analysis [istochimica]. Otherwise, using the gene of the [luciferasi] as gene reporter, to the addition of [ATP] and [luciferina] in the ground of crop light is produced, [rilevabile] also through a photographic film. Often, when he is already certain of a method and there is no need to confirm happens him transformation, they are used antibiotic so that to directly eliminate the cells not transformed.</p>
<p>[edit] Use of viruses Viruses could be the ideal solution to transfer DNA to all the cells of a plant: this is precisely what viruses have evolved to do. Unfortunately, the genetic information of most plant viruses is encoded by single-stranded RNA. Only two classes of plant virus containing DNA are known: the virus of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) and the gemini-virus.</p>
<p>The CaMV is a small double-stranded DNA virus. It spreads in the plant through the vascular system and cannot be transmitted to the seeds. This last characteristic is very interesting because it allows a way to limit the diffusion of the new geniuses. However, this virus has two great disadvantages: it infects only plants of the cauliflower family, and its capside is able only to transport short sequences of DNA (300-400 bases).</p>
<p>Gemini-virii are small single-stranded DNA viruses (about 2500 base pairs). They are usually found in pairs (hence the word gemini), with the genome consisting of two molecules of DNA of nearly equal size but different sequence. The molecule A is able to replicate itself in the cells of the plant, but to be infectious the molecule B is required. The virus can also be infectious in the absence of the protein covering (necessary for making place to the transgene). The DNA molecule A can receive the transgene, while the molecule B will be the vector.</p>
<p>Gemini viruses are of interest to genetic engineers, because they can infect monocots as well. The bean golden mosaic-virus (BGMV), the cassava latend-virus (CLV), the tomato golden-mosaic-virus (TGMV), the maize-streak virus (MSV), and the abutilon mosaic-virus belong to the Gemini-virus family.</p>
<p>[edit] other [edit] direct transformation The fate of an introduced nucleic acid as such in a cell it is that to enzymatically be degraded quickly. Some cell, said competent cell, is under particular conditions and accepts the integration of the extraneous DNA in the [genoma]. The principal advantage is that it asks for little manipulation of the DNA, but it has a [fraquenza] of transformation to everything today rather low, around him 1%.</p>
<p>[edit] Microinjection Maneuvering a thin needle of glass with mechanisms that allow fine movement and constantly working with the microscope makes it possible to pierce the membrane of a cell without killing it and to inject small quantities of DNA. The microinjection can get by the problems of using the [protoplastis] and the crops in vitro with the important [monocotiledonis] for the agriculture. In theory it would be enough to inject the gene in the pollen and to install this in the ovary of the kind to get the seed, and thus the plant, transgenic.</p>
<p>[edit] bombardment Can the DNA be fallen with [CaCl2]? on tungsten spheres (or of gold) of 1 [µm] of diameter and shot with a special gun on various targets to the speed of around 430 [m/s]. The gun and the room of the champion have to be otherwise under [vuoto2.2] the resistance of the air it the [microproiettilis]. The targets till now used are crops in suspension of embryonic cells [piastrate] on you filter, intact leaves and grains of corn. The situated cells in the direct trajectory of draught are killed, but there are a concentric zone where the bullets penetrate without killing the cell. The analysis with vector [GUS] has shown that the particles penetrate in the [mesofillo] of the leaves crossing the epidermis. An important result has been gotten with this technique in to make to a herbicide resistant ([PPT, fosfinotricina]) cells corn's [embriogeniche].</p>
<p>[edit] final test Reached the point in which you/he/she has succeeded in making to grow a plant [transgenica] it is necessary to make some tests to appraise:</p>
<p>the activity of the introduced gene; the [ereditabilità] of the gene; non anticipated effects on growth of the plant, quality, etc. If a variety [transgenica] passes these tests, it won't be however very probably cultivated, but submitted to a series of intersections to still get best variety. This because the few varieties of a kind that can efficiently be transformed, they don't generally possess all those qualities required by the producer and by the consumer. For which the plant [transgenica] is submitted to repeated intersections with a plant of a best variety with the purpose to recover the more possible of the [genoma] of this last with in anymore the [transgene]. The following [step] is represented by the tests to appraise the performances of the transgenic plant in the years and in the different environments in which it will be cultivated, what the field or the greenhouse. This phase also includes the evaluation of the effects on the environment and of the safety of the food. it edges her it is largely incomplete, also because it is not entirely still known; To frame better the matter we can say that the conventional intersections summon the whole organism, the techniques of propagation clone her they turn him to the cells, the genetic engineering it manipulates the molecule of DNA.</p>
