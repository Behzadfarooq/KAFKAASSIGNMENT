<p>The matter is now being discussed at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Reina_%28cattle%29_047e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Reina (cattle)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Reina (cattle)</a>. My primary concern about the article is that it comes across as about a 'new breed' of cattle that has only come from a single farmer selectively breeding for a couple of generations. Has anyone written about the cattle before? Wikipedia has <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">a policy</a> that everything written must be verifiable, and not <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 18:18, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Just a quick note in case you didn't see it at the AfD discussion that there's another article about the reina available at <a href="http://www-ni.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2003/junio/23/campoyagro/" class="external free" title="http://www-ni.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2003/junio/23/campoyagro/" rel="nofollow">http://www-ni.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2003/junio/23/campoyagro/</a> that should also contain some info you can use for this article. I think the fact that the species has been called a "patrimonio nacional" is interesting and should help convince folks that it's notable. Thanks for your contributions and looking forward to seeing this article develop! GassyGuy 19:13, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>by the way the tourism section in "Nicaragua" doesnt even have any sources and you post that... the "SAFETY" section is not from a neutral point of view but from a site that promotes tourism in that country... THE WIKIPEDIA RULE STATES ALL ARTICLES MUST COME FROM A NEUTRAL POINT OF VIEW AND OBVIOUSLY NOT EVEN YOU FOLLOW THESE RULES! it says newspapers are welcome now everything i posted i didnt say or write the newspaper did so i dont know if your a new worker or something but learn to do your job right because the WIKIPEDIA RULES ARE SO DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU PEOPLE ACTUALLY DO! so leave my sections alone because it looks like i know the rules better than you do... and if this is goin to become a problem i would like to get more information and possibly speak to the owner of the site and make the BIGGEST COMPLAIN ON HOW UNACCURATE THE WIKIPEDIA ARTICLES ARE and that is a FACT!</p>
<p>Hi Bacanaleranica, please go to the discussion page for Nicaragua and let's come to a common ground on the Nicaragua Saftey piece. I look forward to collaborating with you. --<a href="../../../a/g/r/User%7EAgrofe_25fd.html" title="User:Agrofe">Agrofe</a> 02:26, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, i notice your trying to read solid grounds with the user and you edits were good but you mentioned Nicaragua was the second poorest country in the wester hemisphere, it was, its not before. Some sources say that Haiti and Honduras are and others say Honduras, Haiti and Bolivia are.<br />

<ul>
<li>Hi Lanicoya, Thanks for the comments. I think you mean that Nicaragua might not be the second poorest after Haiti anymore? You could be correct as I have seen some conflicting figures. I wonder if anyone really knows?... Does the World Bank have these statistics? By the way, I am a bit concerned that this article is second rate because of some of the ongoing conflict and constant reediting by some users. What do you think?--<a href="../../../a/g/r/User%7EAgrofe_25fd.html" title="User:Agrofe">Agrofe</a> 01:34, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Hi! Yes, thats what i meant. When i updated the statistics on the <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_Nicaragua_9c29.html" title="Economy of Nicaragua">Economy of Nicaragua</a> article i noticed Honduras ranked right after Nicaragua, and I've seen other sources say Bolivia and Honduras (including Haiti on both points) ranked under Nicaragua. I could get you the pages if you wish.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm also concerned. I don't consider myself anything superior to anyone which is how that user makes me seem. I do know there is crime and corruption, but then again, thats everywhere regardless of how much GDP a country has, am i right? Because the article is part of the Central American project i don't think there should be a crime section for only 1 country, and if someone decides to put their time in, i suggest all countrys have one. I thought it was unfair for Nicaragua to be the only one with a tourism section (which is not longer there) so im working on one for Honduras right now, and Nicaragua also.<br />

<p>nicaragua is still amongs the poorest its haiti, honduras, nicaragua, bolivia check the cia world fact book they are accurate<a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacanaleranica_46c1.html" title="User:Bacanaleranica">Bacanaleranica</a> 04:16, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>an encyclopedia isnt suppose to have a tourism section, a crime section, or an abortion section use as an example other encyclopedias that were made by real professionals none of them contain things that volunteers want to post. You want to make this a good encyclopedia then use others as an example so it can be good a nd reliable because right now i wouldnt recommend this encyclopedia to anyone so lets all be professional about this lets not play favorites on countries just because volunteers are from nicaragua and colombia those articles will be the best and el salvador and costa rica the worst wich by the way need alot of work el salvador needs improvement more things about tourism with good sources like a tourism website like the one used for nicaragua and costa rica its the tourist capital of central america it defenetly needs a tourism section if we are going to all break the encyclopedia rules we might as well put in a tourism section even though a real encyclopedia isnt supposed to have one<a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacanaleranica_46c1.html" title="User:Bacanaleranica">Bacanaleranica</a> 04:16, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi Bacanaleranica, thanks for the comments. So we don't take up too much space or upset anyone can we try to stay focused? Perhaps we should look at a well established article like the USA or Germany to get some ideas of what the contents and sections should be? You are correct that the CIA Fact Book shows that Nicaragua is the third poorest country in the western Hemisphere after Honduras &amp; Haiti. SHould we amend the economy section to show this? I look forwatd to your feedback. --<a href="../../../a/g/r/User%7EAgrofe_25fd.html" title="User:Agrofe">Agrofe</a> 14:03, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I did some random checking and Costa Rica, East Timor, France, Germany and Kenya do not have tourism sections. Namibia do have a tourism section. None of the above have crime sections. Brazil has a section called "Social Issues" that has a subsection called Poverty and Inequality". Most seem to have a culture section. Does tourism belong here?</p>
<p>Also, I do not see any issues with tackling articles one at a time. Why can't we all put our heads together to come up with a common ground. I have moved this conversation to the talk page in the Nicaragua article so eveyone can participate.--<a href="../../../a/g/r/User%7EAgrofe_25fd.html" title="User:Agrofe">Agrofe</a> 14:33, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is baseball american? I would check but for some odd reason i can't use any search engine. Well, you should put something in your sports section about how Nicaraguans call baseball "Boer" and its the number 1 sport over there. They have this saying "Viva el Boer". I would get sources but.. like i said i can't use google&#160;:(<br />

<p>Hi LaNicoya, yes, baseball is definately American. Isn'tBoer a team? I think it is the National Team of Nicaragua. I will try to get a list of the teams to put up there. I will add the #1 sport (if you don't first&#160;:-) )--<a href="../../../a/g/r/User%7EAgrofe_25fd.html" title="User:Agrofe">Agrofe</a> 16:24, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes it was. I found this <i>"Baseball came to Nicaragua in the late nineteenth century..." Nicaragua's first team, founded in 1891, was called the "Managua Base-Ball Club.." "In 1905, U.S. Consul Carter Donaldson sponsored a new team named "Boer," after the..."</i> <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1510/is_1987_Fall/ai_5151507/pg_2" class="external autonumber" title="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1510/is_1987_Fall/ai_5151507/pg_2" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (fourth paragraph down)</dd>

<p>I found an interesting article saying Viva El Boer meant 'Down with Somoza' a while ago, im not sure if this is true, but then again i probably wasn't alive when/if it was true. Ill look for it later.<br />

<dd>Greetings! I'd love to try and help, but I have to admit I'm not much of a horticulturalist. My main focus is plant anatomy and taxonomy in a few genera. But I can direct you to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Horticulture_and_Gardening_2300.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Horticulture and Gardening">Wikipedia:WikiProject Horticulture and Gardening</a>. You can ask there to see if anyone is willing to put in some time on the article. You're right that it looks notable. There are plenty of articles on varieties, cultivars, and brand names of horticulturally signficant plants. Best thing of all is to be <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">bold</a> and go at it yourself. Check out your library and see what you can find on this subject. If you can't find a reference for the offending passages like "some say," then remove them (you can copy and paste them to the talk page to be searched for later if you want, too). Review <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> for information on verifiability and citing sources. I try to use print sources (books, journal articles, newspaper, etc.) rather than websites because the "authority" of a website is so often disputed with a select few exceptions. But go at it and see what you can come up with.

<p>Thanks. I cleaned up the Nicaragua article a bit and added sources, i just can't seem to make the political/history section a bit shorter.. I re-read it about 20 times and everything looks like it belongs, not to mention how unorganized the main history page for Nicaragua is.<br />

<li>I did not remove any tags. I added the text "Speedy Delete" in the body of an article I created after I saw it was already in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../a/g/r/User%7EAgrofe_25fd.html" title="User:Agrofe">Agrofe</a> 13:25, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I apologize if there was some confusion on this. When I looked at the article (which has since been deleted, so I can't go back and check for sure), there were three entries in the history: your original entry, then an edit by another person who added the speedy delete (e.g., db-nnnn) tag, which creates the pink box on the article, then yours, which blanked the page (including the speedy delete tag) and added the words "Speedy Delete." It's entirely possible that the last two actions were done in very close proximity to each other, and perhaps you thought you were just blanking the original page, not the page as modified by the tag. In any event, please review the speedy deletion procedures to see how the tags work; if you want to recommend something for speedy deletion in the future, the tags are the way to go. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProofreader_J-Man_4a2e.html" title="User:Proofreader J-Man">Proofreader J-Man</a> 03:18, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>No apology required. I need to learn the deletion process. Thanks for getting back to me on it. Regards--<a href="../../../a/g/r/User%7EAgrofe_25fd.html" title="User:Agrofe">Agrofe</a> 17:25, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Agrofe, thanks for your note. My problem with that page is that it tries to paint a positive picture of factory farming, right down to not calling it that!&#160;:-) So I feel we need to add some more realistic or critical material. My understanding is that gestation stalls for sows are very common. Are you saying that's wrong? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:46, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi SlimVirgin, thanks for getting back. There was definately huge bias in the article (I hope a bit less now since my rough rework). The article should definately not paint industrial ag/factory farming in a positive (or negative light) but should present "what it actually is". We can work on this.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>I certainly have no aversion to referring to the content as factory farming, they both (IA or FF) conote the same thing to me and I would think most agriculturalists also feel the same regardless of their leanings. The only drawback I see to the term factory farming is that it seems to me a bit provincial or sophomoric. I am ambivilent though and think the two terms should be intermingled throughout. If it appeared I was trying to diminish the usage of FF in the content then it was not intentional.</dd>

<dd>With regards to the gestation question, yes, these stalls are certainly common. But the size and environment can vary largely and certainly the current photo portrays the aboslute smallest and most restrictive systems. Thanks for the prompt response. Please let us know your thoughts. --<a href="../../../a/g/r/User%7EAgrofe_25fd.html" title="User:Agrofe">Agrofe</a> 00:07, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Agrofe, thanks for your note. I'll take a look as soon as I have time.
