<p>Hi, Angr! I rather hoped this day would never come, but it looks like I am stuck and all my usual research channels are failing me, so you are my last resort&#160;:) As I probably already mentioned a couple million times in the past, I'm learning Irish. My main "textbook" is the Irish People web-based course, but I am slowly (very slowly!) working with the Ó Siahdail's <i>Learning Irish</i>, and am now on Lesson Five. This is where I got stuck. I do not know why, but Lesson Five is where Ó Siahdail introduces future tense for the first time. You know, <i>beidh/ní bheidh/an mbeidh...</i>, <i>beifear/ní bheifear...</i>, etc. The concept is, of course, quite simple, but I am having helluva time trying to determine how these constructs are pronounced. Ó Siadhail does provide pronunciation, but having seen how significantly Cois Fhairrge's dialect can deviate from Standard Irish, I am rather skeptical. You mentioned in the past that you'd be willing to help me out should I have a question that relates to Irish, but not really to Wikipedia. I am wondering if the offer still stands. Pronunciation of the constructs above, as well as of <i>bhíothadh/ní rabhad</i> (past tense), is what I need. Thank you!--<a href="../../../a/g/_/User%7EAg_Foghlaim_ee64.html" title="User:Ag Foghlaim">Ag Foghlaim</a> 18:49, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As usual, there's no one single pronunciation used in all dialects, so your best bet is to just learn one acceptable pronunciation and use that. Ó Siadhail's pronunciations aren't used in all parts of Ireland, but they'll certainly be understood everywhere. If I were teaching Irish outside of Ireland, the pronunciations I would recommend are:</dd>

<li>beidh <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[bʲej]</span> (bheidh <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲej]</span>, mbeidh <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[mʲej]</span>)</li>

<p>Hi, Angr! Back in March I asked you about the pronunciation of <i>bí</i> in different forms, to which you provided a very helpful answer. I just wanted to clarify some things about the <i>bhíothadh</i> form. Both <a href="http://www.csis.ul.ie/focloir/default.HTM" class="external text" title="http://www.csis.ul.ie/focloir/default.HTM" rel="nofollow"><i>An Foclóir Beag</i></a> and my <i>Collins Irish Dictionary</i> (not to mention <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_verbs.html" title="Irish verbs">Irish verbs</a>&#160;:)) provide <i>bhíothas</i>, not <i>bhíothadh</i>, as the translation of "one was". Ó Siadhail sticks with <i>bhíothadh</i>, which is probably dialect-specific. Would you please clarify for me what the difference between the two forms is and which would be better for a learner like me to use? Same goes for the Ó Siadhail's <i>rabhadh</i>--<i>Collins Irish Dictionary</i> suggests <i>rabhthas</i>, and <i>An Foclóir Beag</i>--<i>rabhthar</i> (I am not entirely sure if I'm looking at the right tables, though). I would prefer Standard Irish, or a Connacht Irish version.--<a href="../../../a/g/_/User%7EAg_Foghlaim_ee64.html" title="User:Ag Foghlaim">Ag Foghlaim</a> 19:20, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The official standard (<i>Caighdeán Oifigiúil</i>) is <i>bhíothas</i> and <i>rabhthas</i> in the past tense, so those are the forms you as a learner should use. <i>Rabhthar</i> is the autonomous form in the present subjunctive, not the past indicative. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 21:00, 20 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Bhuel, níl ionadh orm ar chor ar bith&#160;:) Ó Siadhail is often maddening in regards to the dialect-specific vocabulary and phrases he uses. No matter how much effort I put into trying to catch all those dialect perks and replace them with Standard Irish, I keep finding myself in a position of having learned something that I should have learned in a completely different way. Anyway, thanks again for your help and for clarification of present subjunctive vs. past indicative--I am yet to figure out <i>An Foclóir Beag'</i>s abbreviations, so it was completely my screw-up.--<a href="../../../a/g/_/User%7EAg_Foghlaim_ee64.html" title="User:Ag Foghlaim">Ag Foghlaim</a> 21:47, 20 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I know, that's why I can never recommend Ó Siadhail in good conscience to someone wanting to learn Irish. The problem is, there's nothing else out there! <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 21:58, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Angr! Sorry to bother you again; I am wondering if you could answer a few more questions of mine.</p>
<p>I've been working on Ó Siahdail's Lesson 7 (yup, my progress is not very impressive, I'm afraid) during the past week, and, of course, this is where he once again surprised me by unloading the whole bunch of verb tenses of <i>bí</i> on me. Anyway, I've been trying to make sure all forms were standard and not dialect-specific, and <a href="http://www.csis.ul.ie/focloir/default.HTM" class="external text" title="http://www.csis.ul.ie/focloir/default.HTM" rel="nofollow">An Foclóir Beag</a> was of great help to me here. Then I tried to match the pronunciation guidelines from your <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_Archive_11_53be.html#Please.2C_help" title="User talk:Angr/Archive 11">previous response</a> with what Ó Siahdail says in Lesson 7 and with what <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_orthography.html" title="Irish orthography">Irish orthography</a> says. I am kind of stuck in a few places:</p>
<ol>
<li>Both <i>An Foclóir Beag</i> and my little <i>Collins Irish Dictionary</i> (Standard Irish through and through) give <i>bhíothas</i> as the Standard form of <i>bí</i> for "one was". Ó Siahdail gives <i>bhíothadh</i>, and you also recommended me this form last time, albeit with pronunciation different from Ó Siahdail's (<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲiːhəv]</span>). Same goes for the dependent forms (Ó Siahdail's <i>ní rabhadh</i> vs. An Foclóir Beag's <i>ní rabhthar</i> vs. Collins Gem's <i>ní rabhthas</i>). I didn't give it much thought last time, but now when I'm trying to piece everything together, it is rather confusing.</li>
<li>In Imperfect, how are analytical forms (<i>bhíodh sé</i>, <i>bhíodh sí</i>...) pronounced? From what I gather, it should be <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲiːt]</span>, but I really want to make sure I got it right. Ó Siahdail says that <i>dh</i> is pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[t]</span> before a slender <i>s</i>; <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_orthography.html" title="Irish orthography">Irish orthography</a>--only before <u>pronouns</u> beginning with an <i>s</i>. Which one is standard?</li>
<li>Ó Siahdail uses a dot under <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[t]</span> in the transcription on page 27, but I couldn't find this symbol in Appendix I. What is the meaning of that dot?</li>
<li>Again, in Imperfect, would <i>bhíodh</i> be pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲiːx]</span> when followed by anything but a slender <i>s</i>? According to <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_orthography.html" title="Irish orthography">Irish orthography</a>, it should be.</li>
<li>Pronunciation of <i>dh</i> in Conditional--same questions as for Imperfect. I figured this much out: <i>bheinn</i> = <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲiːnʲ]</span>; <i>bheifea</i> = <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">['vʲefʲa:]</span>; <i>bheadh sé</i> = <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲat ʃe:]</span>; <i>bheadh sí</i> = <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">['vʲat 'ʃi:]</span>; <i>bheimis</i> = <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">['vʲimʲʃ]</span>; <i>bheadh sibh</i> = <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">['vʲat 'ʃivʲ]</span>; <i>bheidís</i> = <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">['vʲedʲi:ʃ]</span>; <i>bheifí</i> = <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">['vʲefʲi:]</span>. Is this correct?</li>
<li>Pronunciation of <i>dh</i> in Future (<i>beidh mé</i>, <i>beidh sí</i>...). Last time you told me <i>beidh</i> is pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[bʲej]</span>. Now I can't figure out why. Why not <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[bai]</span>? Not <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[bei]</span>? Does it matter which letter/sound it is followed by? Aaaaa!</li>
</ol>
<p>I am sorry for so many questions--hopefully I am not bugging you too much with this stuff--but I am kind of desperate to figure all this out on my own; not when all my sources contradict one another. I would certainly appreciate your answers when you get a moment. Thanks!--<a href="../../../a/g/_/User%7EAg_Foghlaim_ee64.html" title="User:Ag Foghlaim">Ag Foghlaim</a> 20:15, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ol>
<li><i>An Foclóir Beag</i> and Collins are quite right: past tense autonomous is <i>bhíothas</i>, not <i>bhíothadh</i> in the standard language. Sorry about confusing you before. Pronounce it <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲiːhəs]</span>.</li>
<li><i>bhíodh sé</i> doesn't really have a "standard" pronunciation. In Connacht in general, it's <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲiːt ʃe:]</span>, but in Ulster it's <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲiːu ʃə]</span> and in Munster it's <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲiːx ʃe:]</span>. To the best of my knowledge, the Connacht pronunciation is <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲiːt]</span> only before <i>sé, sí, siad</i> (<u>pronouns</u> beginning with slender s), and otherwise <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲiːx]</span>, so that <i>bhíodh Seán</i> is <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲiːx ʃa:n]</span>.</li>
<li>The dot under the t is supposed to mean the place of articulation is alveolar or postalveolar rather than dental. I didn't bother indicating this because it's a completely phonetic assimilation to the following <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʃ]</span> and therefore IMO not worth mentioning in a broad transcription.</li>
<li>Yes, imperfect <i>bhíodh</i> is <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲiːx]</span> except before <i>sé, sí, siad</i>. (And in Munster, it's <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vʲiːx]</span> even before <i>sé, sí, siad</i>, so if you want to adopt Munster pronunciation for these forms, it'll be one less thing to remember.)</li>
<li>I think <i>bheimis</i> is actually <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">['vʲemʲəʃ]</span> (i.e. it's an exception to the rule that <i>ei</i> is [i] before nasals). <i>Beidh</i> is also an exception to the spelling rules; <i>eidh</i> doesn't represent [ai] here but is broken down into <i>ei</i> [e] + slender <i>dh</i> [j].</li>

<dd>Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll probably print your answers out and frame them--yes, they are <i>that</i> useful to me! The only thing you missed was my sub-question about the dependent forms in #1 (Ó Siahdail's <i>ní rabhadh</i> vs. An Foclóir Beag's <i>ní rabhthar</i> vs. Collins Gem's <i>ní rabhthas</i>). There are three forms to chose from. By analogy, I would guess that <i>ní rabhthas</i> is the standard one, but I am curious as to where <i>ní rabhthar</i> came from. It was my impression that <i>An Foclóir Beag</i> used Standard Irish as well.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for your suggestions, I much prefer to stick with Standard Irish, or with Connacht when it's impossible, as it was the case with <i>bhíodh sé</i>. Munster and Ulster are interesting, too, but I'd rather limit the variations at this point as much as possible.</dd>

<dd>Since you seem to be the type who's not intimidated by technical grammar terms, you might look into buying the Christian Brothers' <i>New Irish Grammar</i>, which is very dry but the absolute standard reference grammar. Using them now as a tie-breaker for the dependent form of the past tense autonomous, the answer is... (drumroll please)... <i>rabhthar</i>. I guess <i>rabhthas</i> is either an analogical form or a typo in Collins Gem. (A typo is quite possible, as they get <i>rabhthar</i> right in the present subjunctive at the bottom of the column.) <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 20:58, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, let's just say I am not <i>easily</i> intimidated&#160;:) I must admit that when you recommended I read <a href="../../../s/y/l/Syllable_coda.html" title="Syllable coda">syllable coda</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/l/Syllable_onset.html" title="Syllable onset">syllable onset</a> it was a bit too, erm, challenging.

<p>Hi, Angr! It's been a while since I bugged you, hasn't it?&#160;:) I have just two really minor questions this time. If you could answer them whenever you have a spare minute, I'd be very grateful.</p>
<ol>
<li>How is <i>abhaile</i> pronounced? According to <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_orthography.html" title="Irish orthography">my pronunciation bible</a>, it's supposed to be <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/'aulʲə/</span>, but what I hear is more like <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ə'walʲə/</span> (which kind of makes sense, when you think that <i>abhaile</i> is a form of <i>baile</i>). Still, which is right (standard)?
<dl>
<dd>I say [ə'waljə], if that helps. <span class="internal" title="View my user page" style="white-space: nowrap;">-- <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a>·<a href="../../../e/v/e/User_talk%7EEvertype_12bd.html" title="User talk:Evertype"><span title="Leave me a message">✆</span></a></span> 21:33, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>In sentences <i>Bheinn ansin</i> (I would be there) and <i>Bhínn ansin</i> (I used to be there), is <i>bheinn</i> pronounced exactly the same as <i>bhínn</i>? That is my impression based on the pronunciation guidelines. If they <i>are</i> pronounced the same, how would I know if the speaker means "would be" or "used to be"? If they are not, what is the difference?

<dd>Thanks for the tips, Evertype! Whether it helps or not depends on which dialect of Irish you are speaking. In order not to get confused to death, I stick with Caighdeán/Connacht (I may move on to incorporating other dialects in a few years). Which part of Ireland are you from?--<a href="../../../a/g/_/User%7EAg_Foghlaim_ee64.html" title="User:Ag Foghlaim">Ag Foghlaim</a> 21:48, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with Evertype's answers. <i>abhaile</i> is indeed basically "a-bhaile", it belongs to the class of Irish adverbs that begin with unstressed [ə]. And <i>bheinn</i> is an exception to the rule that <i>ei</i> is usually pronounced <i>i</i> before nasals; as we talked about last time, these forms of "tá" like to play by their own rules. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 06:29, 21 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Darn, I knew I should have asked you about <i>all</i> forms of <i>tá</i> just in case! Anyway, I see that Evertype indicated above that he pronounces <i>bhínn</i> as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/vi:ɲ/</span>. What is that <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɲ/</span> sound? Is it the same as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/nʲ/</span>, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ŋʲ/</span>, or something completely different (sort of like <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɲ/</span> in French <i>ga<u>gn</u>er</i>, maybe)? I don't see this particular symbol anywhere else in the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_orthography.html" title="Irish orthography">Irish orthography</a> article. And speaking of Irish orthography, I see that you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Irish_orthography&amp;curid=1347074&amp;diff=76949511&amp;oldid=76252110" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Irish_orthography&amp;curid=1347074&amp;diff=76949511&amp;oldid=76252110" rel="nofollow">added</a> a couple exceptions for the <i>ea</i> and <i>eo</i> combinations (which was very helpful to me, by the way). Two questions about that: are <i>(an)seo</i> and <i>seomra</i> not qualifying exceptions as well? Is the <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/o/</span> sound in <i>beag</i> really <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/o/</span>? On the tapes I listen to (with one of them, however, being Munster-based), it kind of sounds like <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/o/</span>, but it's not really the same <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/o/</span> as in other words. Am I just being too concious about such minor details, or am I just listening to the wrong tapes?</dd>
<dd>Finally, are there other (common) adverbs structured in the same way as <i>abhaile</i>?</dd>
<dd>As usual, there is no end to my gratitude for your invaluable help. If it weren't for you patiently answering my questions, I would have probably put my Irish studies to end soon after I started. With your help, it will be my first anniversary next week, <i>and</i> I am excited to report that I find myself understanding 40-60% of content of unabridged Irish texts (such as the <i>Lá</i> articles or articles in Irish Wikipedia), or 70-80% with a dictionary (although I'm not having that much success on the speaking front, nor is it easy for me to write in Irish myself yet).

<dl>
<dd><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɲ/</span> is basically like in French <i>ga<b>gn</b>er</i>. It's used in northerly dialects (Mayo (where Evertype lives) and Donegal) as the "tense" equivalent of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/nʲ/</span>. <i>Seomra</i> has a long vowel AFAIK, but you're right that <i>(an)seo</i> is another exception; I forgot it before. The vowel of <i>beag</i> is certainly phonemically /o/ in most accents (though in Donegal it sure sounded more like /e/ to me), but phonetically it's probably rather fronted because of following a palatalized consonant. Keep in mind that the color (backness vs. frontness) of short vowels in Irish is almost entirely determined by the quality of the surrounding consonants. If when pronouncing <i>beag</i> you're careful to make the <i>b</i> properly palatalized and the <i>g</i> good and back, just get the height of the vowel right (mid, not high or low), and the color will almost take care of itself. There's a whole slew of adverbs starting with an unstressed [ə]: besides <i>abhaile</i>, there's <i>abhus</i>, <i>anseo</i>, <i>ansin</i>, <i>ansiúd</i>, <i>anall</i>, <i>anonn</i>, <i>aduaidh</i>, <i>aneas</i>, <i>anoir</i>, <i>aniar</i>, <i>anuas</i>, <i>aníos</i>, <i>inné</i>, <i>inniu</i>, <i>anocht</i>, <i>amárach</i>, <i>anuraidh</i>, <i>arís</i>, <i>arú</i>, <i>amach</i>, <i>amuigh</i>, <i>isteach</i>, <i>istigh</i>, and probably several more I'm not thinking of right now.

<dl>
<dd>The reason why I thought <i>seomra</i> is supposed to be pronounced with short <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/o/</span> is because it is (kind of) a recommendation of the Irish People lessons (namely <a href="http://www.leyline.org/cra/languages/IrishPeople/Lesson12.html" class="external text" title="http://www.leyline.org/cra/languages/IrishPeople/Lesson12.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, but they do mention it's only true "in parts of Ireland").</dd>
<dd>I'll have to study more about the color/height concepts—I've never seen sounds explained in those terms—and it looks like they may be quite useful in my studies.</dd>
<dd>Also, thanks for the extensive list of the <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ə/</span>-adverbs. While I knew most of them, I didn't know them all, knew a couple of them wrong, and never thought of putting <i>abhaile</i> in the same row.</dd>
<dd>As for the ga:, no, I'm not really active, although <a href="../../../../ga/c/o/n/Speisialta%7EContributions_Ag_Foghlaim_9c53.html" class="extiw" title="ga:Speisialta:Contributions/Ag_Foghlaim">present</a>. I'm planning to increase my participation there as my Irish progresses, but that probably won't be for another year or so. For now, I'm just using the articles as study materials, tracking a few discussions, and adding interwikis when I see that an article I am reading lacks them. Nothing too grandiose&#160;:)--<a href="../../../a/g/_/User%7EAg_Foghlaim_ee64.html" title="User:Ag Foghlaim">Ag Foghlaim</a> 16:10, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I also have a related question. I don't remember if it was you who told me that or if I read it elsewhere, but, if I remember correctly, the pronunciation of letter "l" depends on its lenition/eclipsis. While in writing this letter is never modified, its pronunciation actually differs if it stands in a position where another lenitable/eclipsable letter would be lenited/eclipsed. An example would be <i>in aice leis an lampa</i>, which is along the same lines as <i>in aice leis an gcoláiste</i>. First of all, is that true at all, or is it something different that I completely misunderstood? Second, if its true, does the strict version of IPA provide any means to show the difference in pronunciation of letter "l" in various positions?--<a href="../../../a/g/_/User%7EAg_Foghlaim_ee64.html" title="User:Ag Foghlaim">Ag Foghlaim</a> 14:06, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As for L, there are only some dialects where it's pronounced differently under lenition than otherwise. If you look at the table in <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_phonology.html#Fortis_and_lenis_sonorants" title="Irish phonology">Irish phonology#Fortis and lenis sonorants</a> you'll see rows for <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">Lˠ</span>, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">Lʲ</span>, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">lˠ</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">lʲ</span> in Old Irish, and their modern correspondents in the three main dialects. Under lenition, the modern counterpart of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">Lˠ</span> becomes the modern counterpart of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">lˠ</span>, while the modern counterpart of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">Lʲ</span> becomes the modern counterpart of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">lʲ</span>. (The same thing holds for N, by the way.) However, being dental consonants, L and N don't undergo lenition after the definite article anyway, so you use the unlenited pronunciation in <i>don lampa</i>. And L and N aren't affected by eclipsis at all, so <i>ár lampa</i> is no different from ordinary <i>lampa</i>. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 14:16, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Panu, I found your tip regarding má, mura, sula, and nuair to be of incredible help. I am, however, still an early learner who is stuck on má/dhá (Ó Siadhail's lessons 8 through 10, as you might have guessed). If time permits, could you please put together a tip that would describe the system behind the following sentences from the Irish grammar point of view? The sentences are:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>When I am [not] there, I am [not] pleased.</i>
<dl>
<dd>I don't say you couldn't say "Nuair a bhíonn mé ansin, bíonn mé sásta"; "Nuair nach mbíonn mé ansin, ní bhíonn mé sásta"; "Nuair nach mbíonn mé ansin, ní bhíonn mé sásta", and so on. However, I would tend to rephrase the whole thought so as not to need the "nuair" at all: "Is cúis áthais/míshástachta dom gach uair dá dtagaim ansin" ("every time of all the times I come there is a cause of happiness/unhappiness to me").</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>When/if I am [not] there, I will [not] be pleased.</i>
<dl>
<dd>This should be straight enough: Má bhíonn mé ansin, beidh mé sásta. Mura mbí mé ansin, beidh mé sásta. Má bhíonn mé ansin, ní bheidh mé sásta. Mura mbí mé ansin, beidh mé sásta.</dd>
<dd>The form "mbí" is the old subjunctive present, only used after "sula" and "mura". Some say you should substitute an indicative present nowadays (sula mbíonn), some say a future (sula mbeidh), I don't remember which one of these schools Ó Siadhail represents, but for me as a friend of Ulster Irish it is still natural to cling to the subjunctive.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>If I were [not] there, I would [not] be pleased.</i>
<dl>
<dd>Dá mbeinn ansin, bheinn sásta.</dd>
<dd>Mura mbeinn ansin, bheinn sásta.</dd>
<dd>Mura mbeinn ansin, ní bheinn sásta.</dd>
<dd>Dá mbeinn ansin, ní bheinn sásta.</dd>
<dd>After "dá" and "mura", you can also use "mbínn", which is the past subjunctive, still quite frequently used by Ulster authors ("Dá <b>mBíodh</b> Ruball ar an Éan").</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>If I had [not] been there, I would [not] have been pleased.</i>
<dl>
<dd>Usually, you use the same for this. I.e. the Irish conditional mood refers both to present and past. However, there are tactics you can use in order to emphasize that you are actually speaking about past. For example, "dá mbeinn gan dul ansin" = "if I hadn't gone there" ("if I were without going there") and "mura mbeinn gan dul ansin" = "if I had gone there" ("unless I were without going there").</dd>
<dd>There is also the trick of "murach go/nach/gur/nár" or (typically in Ulster dialect) "ach go bé go/nach/gur/nár" (also written "achab é go/nach/gur/nár"). Basically, this structure juxtaposes what really happened (in indicative past) with what could have happened otherwise (in conditional mood). So, take a look at these:</dd>
<dd>Murach go raibh mé ansin, ní bheinn sásta.</dd>
<dd>Ach go bé go raibh mé ansin, ní bheinn sásta.</dd>
<dd>Now, the thing that happened is, that you were there, and that is written in normal past tense form. The thing that would have happened otherwise, i.e., you wouldn't have been happy, is in conditional mood.</dd>

<p>Which category of infinitive would a construct such as <i>ceist a chur</i> fall? I understand that <i>chur</i> here is a lenited form of the verbal noun, but how does "<i>a</i>" come into play? Thanks!--<a href="../../../a/g/_/User%7EAg_Foghlaim_ee64.html" title="User:Ag Foghlaim">Ag Foghlaim</a> 20:52, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>A</i> is used to separate a verbal noun from its preceding direct object. Historically it's derived from the preposition <i>do</i> "to", so syntactically <i>ceist a chur</i> is identical to German <i>eine Frage zu stellen</i>. The difference is that in German, <i>all</i> the complements of the verb precede the infinitive, while in Irish, only the direct object does. So if you want to say something like "I'd prefer to ask him a question at 3:00 under the oak tree", in Irish it comes out as "I'd prefer <i>a question to ask</i> at 3:00 under the oak tree to him", while in German it comes out as "I'd prefer to him at 3:00 under the oak tree <i>a question to ask</i>." —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 07:32, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you, Angr, this helps. What is the precise grammatical term for the "a"+"verbal noun" construct, if there is one? Would it make sense to add this information to this article? The reason I am asking is because all my study materials seem to use this construct without any explanation.

<dd>Darn, I was hoping for more than that. My problem is that while I can recognize this form in the text and translate it correctly (Gaeilge-Béarla), I am never sure if I myself use it right (Béarla-Gaeilge). That may, of course, be because I need more practice.

<dd>Sorry! My expertise is phonology, not syntax, and I'm not a native speaker. My instinct is to use the Noun + <i>a</i> + VN construction whenever the noun is the direct object of a VN, unless the VN is being used to form a progressive (with <i>ag</i>) or a perfective (with <i>tar éis</i> or <i>i ndiaidh</i>). So <i>Is fearr liom ceist a chur</i>, but <i>Tá mé ag cur ceist</i> and <i>Tá mé i ndiaidh cur ceist</i>. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 15:52, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh no, no need to apologize. I understand very well that you are not a native speaker. Native speakers, however, are for some reason generally not at all as eager to answer my periodic barrages of questions as you are, and your answers are always helpful. I'll keep what you said in mind and, of course, keep practicing.
