<p>I have been filling in TT Races from 1939 back, and have used your description for the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935_Isle_of_Man_TT_5ede.html" title="1935 Isle of Man TT">1935 Isle of Man TT</a>, but would like to cite the source or sources for the information, as per <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing_sources</a>. I have had a few "citation needed" notices for my own contributions, so was hoping to fill in the blanks. 1935 to 1939 are done, if you want to add anything to them? <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeasalt_2715.html" title="User:Seasalt">Seasalt</a> 06:02, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You are correct Agljones, H G Tyrrel Smith was an Irish motorcycle racer. Found it in some German race results. Thank you for the 1935 sources. This H G Tyrrel Smith was quite a winner, but have not found anything biographical on the net. I do not know the IOM course, so could not comment on the shortcomings or otherwise. I just fill in what info can be found with Google.

<dd>A personal thanks for correcting rider nationalities, and for your "summaries". While I was never greatly interested in the TT before, I find the riders and "racing identities" quite colourful characters, and your race summaries add to the picture. Enjoyed the added <a href="../../../h/_/g/H_G_Tyrell_Smith_d9cb.html" title="H G Tyrell Smith">H G Tyrell Smith</a> info. I guess I should use tables more often.</dd>
</dl>
<p>On IOM TT site <a href="http://www.iomtt.com/TTDatabase/Riders.aspx?ride_id=644" class="external free" title="http://www.iomtt.com/TTDatabase/Riders.aspx?ride_id=644" rel="nofollow">http://www.iomtt.com/TTDatabase/Riders.aspx?ride_id=644</a> there is a "bio" on Ted Mellors by his daughter that makes some claims I have not been able to verify. She says he was 1938 European Champion, but other sources say Ewald Kluge for '38 and '39. If you come across anything on Mellors please let me know. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeasalt_2715.html" title="User:Seasalt">Seasalt</a> 13:24, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>So it would be correct to say "350 cc European World Champion"? I like the Scotland tag myself. There's another one, Bob McIntyre is it? Not sure. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeasalt_2715.html" title="User:Seasalt">Seasalt</a> 12:25, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The inter-war TTs are all there now. The preambles are all from <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isle_of_Man_TT_b7a4.html" title="Isle of Man TT">Isle of Man TT</a>, and I assume are mostly your material, but I don't have any Isle of Man Weekly Times copies to check the dates and quote sources/references. I am hoping you might add them as you edit in new information. I am also hoping that my filling in the results tables and moving preambles was helpful, and not a negative factor. Liked the South African flag change. Did not think of different year/government flag versions. Appropriate. Thank you for the <a href="../../../e/_/a/E_A_%28Ted%29_Mellors_dd8c.html" title="E A (Ted) Mellors">E A (Ted) Mellors</a> info too. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeasalt_2715.html" title="User:Seasalt">Seasalt</a> 14:55, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have just written a Bob McIntyre article, and found you have an article already. I will put it up on my userpage for u to have a look at and see if you feel ok about it being incorporated. Unless you are already working on a full text version, in which case you may feel free to use any portion u think appropriate. I will place the address here as soon as it is up. My apologies.

<p><a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeasalt_Vincent_12fc.html" title="User:Seasalt/Vincent">Bob McIntyre draft</a> I have not done any wikilinking in it. Should I? <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeasalt_2715.html" title="User:Seasalt">Seasalt</a> 12:31, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for the message about Bob McIntyre. I had created the entry after completed the 1957 Isle of Man TT Races entry. I had intended to expand the article for Bob McIntyre around the 100mph lap of 1957. I have been checking source material in regard to Bob McIntrye national service and the accident regarding his death in 1962. I thought about including his Manx Grand Prix entries and also the racing at the Southern 100 Races in the Isle of Man. I have just been looking at the Mike Halewood entry and was not too sure about using these types of summary tables. Perhaps, a format can be agreed to, as I have been using Stanley Woods as a base entry.</p>
<p>If you would like to go ahead and expand the entry for Bob McIntyre and perhaps include a photo. I had been waiting for somebody to contact me about the recent additions, but thought it may have been in respect to another entry rather than Bob McIntyre. I would like to expand the Jimmie Guthrie entry as I have been trying to check his war service. I understand both Guthrie and McIntrye where dispatch riders as was Geoff Duke.</p>

<dd>Someone I'd do if I could find info, (the internet is lacking)....Walter Handley. I'll look in Wikipedia commons for picture, but have not mastered image upload protocols here yet.<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeasalt_2715.html" title="User:Seasalt">Seasalt</a> 10:40, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Only problem was birthdate. You have 28 November, I had 2 November. My internet sources are all obviously derived from same place as they share paragraphs. I put 2 because had a reference for it, but if you've got a reliable source for 28, certainly change it to that. Feel free to change anything. Haven't looked for pic yet.<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeasalt_2715.html" title="User:Seasalt">Seasalt</a> 12:17, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The source for Bob McIntyre birthdate is the book "Bob McIntyre - The Flying Scotsman" by Mick Walker. I will like to check entry, but I do not like to use just one source and this is the delay in finishing Bob McIntyre. The book also describes Bob McIntyre's National Service which he was the dispatch rider as he was the only one that could ride a motor-cycle!!!!</p>
<p>In respect to photos I had noticed that a picture was "borrowed" for the entry for Harold Daniels. I also find including photos difficult to upload.</p>
<p>For Walter Handley I found the following entry at <a href="http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/dh.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/dh.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/dh.htm</a>&#160;;-</p>
<p>Walter Leslie Handley (GB) 5 Apr 1902 - 15 Nov 1941 Walter Handley was born in Aston, Birmingham 1902. He was a well-known motor cyclist who won the Senior Manx TT in 1930. Handley’s Corner on the Manx TT circuit was named after him. He was also involved with car racing, driving Rileys. Entered the 1934 &amp; 1935 Mannin Beg. He had a bad crash at hhe 1936 Empire Trophy after taking over Dixon’s third placed Riley. He was killed, serving with the Air Transport Auxiliary, Kirkbampton, Cumberland 1941.</p>
<p>Walter Handley's death is sometimes quoted as 1940. (<a href="../../../a/g/l/User%7EAgljones_3aef.html" title="User:Agljones">Agljones</a> 10:47, 11 December 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>I found a bit more about WH doing <a href="../../../r/e/x/Rex-Acme_b72a.html" title="Rex-Acme">Rex-Acme</a>.There is information there I could use for Handley. I think one of my reference sites had more McIntyre death details...something like rained before 500 cc race, puddle on corner that was not there for earlier 250 race, fights way to front after bad start only to hit puddle, aquaplane off line, hit pothole, catapult into something solid.(tree?) It was an account given by a friend of his. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeasalt_2715.html" title="User:Seasalt">Seasalt</a> 11:03, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have checked the Mick Walker book and it gives Bob McIntyre birth as the 28th November. It also gives a similar account to the accident at Oulton Park in 1962.</p>
<p>I am not too sure, but I understand that Walter Handley was a victim of a "friendly-fire" incident that occured over the River Thames east of London, perhaps in the area of Canvey Island, Isle of Dogs or Isle of Sheppey.</p>
<p>Also, at the first Isle of Man TT Race in 1922, Walter Handley on his first ever lap of the Mountain Course turned right and commenced to ride the course in the wrong direction and was stopped by a Flag Marshall at Governor's Bridge. During practice for the 1935 TT Races, Walter Handley badly injured his thumb while replacing a primary drive chain when he stopped in Sulby Village.</p>
<p>(<a href="../../../a/g/l/User%7EAgljones_3aef.html" title="User:Agljones">Agljones</a> 12:35, 12 December 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>I love that going the wrong way bit. At least he was luckier then than the rider that missed his turn and was killed on a newly erected barrier one year. I'd like to include it if I could have a source reference to keep the critics at bay? The Mick Walker book, do you have the page number where McIntyre's birthdate is mentioned? I think I can get the full title and ISBN number off the net to complete the reference. Mannin Beg and Mannin Moar(?), are they car races? <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeasalt_2715.html" title="User:Seasalt">Seasalt</a> 13:50, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The details of the Mick Walker book are as follows;-</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bob-Mcintyre-Flying-Mick-Walker/dp/1859835007/sr=1-1/qid=1165931870/ref=sr_1_1/203-7414946-3527934?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external free" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bob-Mcintyre-Flying-Mick-Walker/dp/1859835007/sr=1-1/qid=1165931870/ref=sr_1_1/203-7414946-3527934?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bob-Mcintyre-Flying-Mick-Walker/dp/1859835007/sr=1-1/qid=1165931870/ref=sr_1_1/203-7414946-3527934?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books</a></p>
<p>The quote for Walter Handley going the wrong way in 1922 can be found in the ACU 1968(?) Isle of Man TT Race Guide and is the only written quote that I have seen for this.</p>
<p>The details for the events surrounding Walter Handley and the fatal aircraft crash may be found in the Keig Collection of TT photographs, but I am not sure what volume number.</p>
<p>The Mannin Beg and Mannin Moar Car races on the Isle of Man replaced the Tourist Trophy Car Races. The car races became the British Empire Trophy after the war. Various circuits where used including part of the TT Course and part of the <a href="../../../c/l/y/Clypse_Course_8060.html" title="Clypse Course">Clypse Course</a> and became known as the Willaston Curcuit. Former winners of the Mannin Beg and Mannin Moar Car race series include Dick Seaman and Prince Bira.</p>

<p>I got all that for the book, but the actual page number where the item of information appears is part of a full citation, hopefully as given for my Tragatsch references. Rex-Acme &lt;ref name="Tragatsch"&gt; Title: The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Motorcycles, Editor: Erwin Tragatsch, Publisher: New Burlington Books, Copyright: 1979 Quarto Publishing, Edition: 1988 Revised, Page 260, ISBN 0906286077&lt;/ref&gt; (The internet references seem less rigorous.) Hope its not tiresome of me to ask which page of the book has McIntyre's birthdate? There are internet pages with the names and cars for races there (Mannin Beg and Moar), including Wal Handley for a couple of years. Not much to explain it tho, just results.

<p>The reference to Bob McIntyre birthdate was from Mick Walkers book and I picked-up a copy to read in W.H.Smith Bookshop just to check details. I will have to go back to W.H.Smith to look for page number. The book also gives the address and I presume it is from a copy of a birth certificate?</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/l/User_talk%7EAgljones_1da9.html" title="Edit section: Walter Handley">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Walter Handley</span></h2>
<p>The Keig Collection Vol 1 on page 36 describes Walter Handley as the motor-cycle messenger for the OK-Supreme factory and on his first lap of the TT Course made the wrong turn and travelled the wrong direction. I think the ACU TT Race Guide for 1968 gives a better account of this. It is a understandable mistake to make as I think the race paddock was moved as Douglas Corporation started building the TT Grandstand in the early 1920's and the area would have been all large fields and not heavily built-on as it is today.</p>
<p>The Mac McDiarmid book the 'Magic of the TT' makes a reference to the aircraft crash in which Walter Handley was killed. The aircraft involved was a Bell P-39 Airacobra which crashed on take-off. The book does not give a reference to the source of the information. The P-39 Airacobra is a very unsually type of aircraft for a member of the Air Transport Auxiliary to be flying. I found information that 601 Squadron where flying the P-39 Airacobra from Duxford before converting to the Supermarine Spitfire in 1942.</p>
<p>The only other source that I can give is a newspaper article about 10 years ago in which a TT rider that was part of Air Transport Auxiliary was killed in aircraft over Canvey Island that was shot down in a "friendly-fire" incident and I thought that this refered to Walter Handley. I also found information that Walter Rusk a team-mate of Jimmie Guthrie at Norton died in 1940 of pneumonia, but another source states that he was killed in a RAF flying accident. I can only concluded that perhaps the Mac McDiarmid book did not perhaps check their sources correctly in respect to Walter Handley crash. Also, I am not too sure what the original source of the story of Walter Handley taking the wrong-turn in 1922.</p>
<p>In the 1930's the Mannin Car Races where held the week before practice started for the TT Races. There was a number of circuits used including part of Douglas Promenade. After the war the races became the British Empire Trophy and in 1953 a driver was killed after hitting a bank and thrown out of a his car. The next driver through the corner ran-over the injured driver and was killed. This incident occured about a 7-10 days after Les Graham was killed during the 1953 Senior TT Race. After adverse newspaper comment in the UK daily newspapers to these events a number of changes where made to the TT course and the first use of the Clypse Course.</p>

<p>I see what you mean about the P39, A new that year American naturally aspirated, hence low altitude (&lt;17000feet) ground attack aircraft, used mainly by the Russians. Re-named P-400 for RAF. To be a P39c had to be one of first three? Needed long take-off area, underperformed, diverted to Russia from December 1941. "The Flying Cannon". Could evade Spitfires and Me109s at low altitude, but could not compete at high altitude.</p>
<p>Timeline: Ordered sight unseen. Eagerly anticipated as result of optimistic prototype specs, the first of three P39C arrived at RAF Colerne from US on July 3, 1941, other two next day (For testing) First British-purchased Airacobras began arriving at Colerne before the end of July. By the end of September, eleven machines had been received. No. 601 "County of London" Squadron was selected to be the first Fighter Command squadron to equip with the Airacobra. No. 601 Squadron pilots found numerous flaws and weaknesses. The Air Fighting Development Unit received a British Airacobra I on July 30. They subjected it to tests and completed their report on September 22. By the end of September, No. 601 Squadron had received permission to take its Airacobras into action. On October 9, two Airacobras took off from RAF Manston and flew across the Channel. On this raid, they shot up an enemy trawler near Gravelines. The next day two Airacobras visited the same area, but found no targets. On October 11, two aircraft flew to Gravelines and Calais and hit some enemy barges and then three Airacobras flew to Ostend, but no targets were found. After these four missions, the RAF Airacobras were taken off operations because of difficulties encountered with the compass. The compass was too close to the guns in the nose, and when the guns were fired, the compass got thrown out of alignment. Deviations of anything from 7 degrees to 165 degrees were recorded. Without a reliable compass, pilots tend to get themselves lost. In December of 1941, the Airacobra was officially withdrawn from operational service with the RAF. A decision was made to divert the bulk of the British Airacobra contract to Russia. They were re-crated and shipped to the Soviet Union during 1942. In all, the Soviet Union received 212 of the British Airacobras (some of them shipped direct from the USA), but 49 more were lost at sea en route. No 601 Squadron relinquished its 13 Airacobras in March of 1942 in favor of Spitfires. One Airacobra was fitted with an arrester hook and was used for deck landing trials at the RAE at Farnborough. See: <a href="http://home.att.net/~jbaugher1/p39_5.html" class="external text" title="http://home.att.net/~jbaugher1/p39_5.html" rel="nofollow">Airacobra I for RAF, P-400</a></p>
<p>Air Transport Auxiliary: A far-sighted man, Gerald d'Erlanger, got permission to start an organisation to ferry passengers and aircraft around the country. Thus began the ATA, who eventually moved 309011 aircraft of 140 different types. They cleared the factories and took the aircraft to maintenance units and other squadrons of the RAF and Fleet Air Arm. Britain needed pilots to ferry new aircraft to service airfields and military bases across the country, from both manufacturer's airfields and maintenance units. It was not deemed viable to use fully-trained RAF pilots to ferry the aircraft, so the next best option was reluctantly accepted, this was to take on civilians who held a pilots licence. According to official records it was thought that it would take six hundred and twenty four civilians to replace twelve RAF pilots! For this target to be reached, it was finally agreed that the civilian pilots had to be recruited, rather than called up, to ensure the quality of the flying skills of the applicants and allow a rank structure to be based on experience.</p>
<p>Handley volunteered to shift aircraft round the country, must have held a pilot's licence, so was Kirkbampton a short runway? He wouldn't have necessarily ever flown one before. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeasalt_2715.html" title="User:Seasalt">Seasalt</a> 12:29, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The reference for Bob McIntyre and his date of birth can be found on page 8 of the Mick Walker book.</p>
<p>The reference to Walter Handley and his first practice lap on the TT Course in 1922 can be found on page 36 of the book "TT Topics and Tales" by David Wright. The quote appears from Walter Handley himself and I presume it may have been from an autobiography, however, no source is quoted. The same incident is quoted in the "ACU TT World Championship Road Races 1968 Official Programme and Guide" on page 25. The same page also quotes that Wal Handley received a letter of appreciation from the ACU after an incident at Greeba Castle during the 1929 Senior TT Race.</p>
<p>I have not been able to find the newspaper article that relates to a TT Rider that was killed in an aircraft accident during the war. However, I did find a recently published book about wartime airfields in the Northern England and Scotland. The entry for Kirkbride airfield (Ordnance Survey Map NY 227 558 GB Grid) near Kirkbampton, explains that a Capt W.L.Handley was killed flying a RAF Airacobra I due to a loss of control in November 1941. It did not say if this was on take-off or on final approach to Kirkbride or if Kirkbride was his intended destination. The Isle of Man Examiner for November 1941 does make a brief mention of Wal Handleys accident but no cause of the crash.</p>
<p>The book "The Magic of the TT. A century of racing over the Mountain" by Mac McDiarmid on page 133 describes the accident as "while serving as a ferry pilot in the Second World War when his Bell Airacobra crashed just after take-off near Carlisle." It is interesting that the same book gives a list of great TT Races and includes the 1939 Lightweight TT win by Ted Mellors in this list.</p>

<p>The details of the Wal Handley aircraft crash can be found in the Kirkbride section on pp143 of "Cumbria Airfields in the Second World War including The Isle of Man" by Martin Chorlton. The aircraft crash is descibed as a loss of control, 2 miles east of RAF Kirkbride near Fingland.</p>

<p>"The entry for Kirkbride airfield (Ordnance Survey Map NY 227 558 GB Grid) near Kirkbampton, explains that a Capt W.L.Handley was killed flying a RAF Airacobra I due to a loss of control in November 1941." (taken from above)Did that quote come from: <i>Title: "Cumbria Airfields in the Second World War including The Isle of Man", Author: Martin Chorlton, Publisher: Countryside Books (25 Oct 2006), pp143, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1-85306-983-3</a></i>, or another book on airfields? (If its same, is it the same page?) That sentence covers a lot. You've certainly done some very focussed research on this. I've included "The aircraft crash is descibed as a loss of control, 2 miles east of RAF Kirkbride near Fingland." under that reference, and paired with that afore-mentioned quote, gives a good explanation.<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeasalt_2715.html" title="User:Seasalt">Seasalt</a> 12:48, 19 December 2006 (UTC) 1955 sidecar passengers...could find nothing on net<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeasalt_2715.html" title="User:Seasalt">Seasalt</a> 13:19, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The description of loss of control is a quote from the book about Cumbria Airfields. I added the Ordnance Survey reference for Kirkbride airfield as there is another station at RAF Kingstown a few miles from Kirkbride village. I have not been able to find the newspaper article that I have refered to in respect to a wartime aircraft crash regarding a former TT rider. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission Website gives a reference to W.L.Handley and also there is an entry for W.F.Rusk that was killed in an aircraft accident during 1940. I presume that this is Walter Rusk, but another source gave cause of death as pneumonia.</p>
<p>I do no think it is possible to complete this part of Wal Handley's entry in full until more details can be found about the cause of the aircraft accident and also the circumstances regarding Walter Rusk. A website for aircraft crashes may give the correct information or perhaps contacting the MOD directly?</p>
<p>The letter of appreciation that was sent to Walter Handley in 1929, I think is reference to the crash at Greeba Castle which involved, Walter Handley, Jimmy Simpson, Jack Amlot and Doug Lamb who died later of his injuries.</p>
<p>I have also had problems with sidecar passengers in results and it is difficult to trace the correct passengers for the 1954 Sidecar TT Race. I would like to expand the narrative for the 1954 Junior TT Race, however I have mixed-up the lap-times in my notes and will have to check them. I have been rather side-tracked by the Handley aircraft crash. One last detail is the 1931 Junior TT results as the winner Percy Hunt is given a time of 3:34.21, 2nd place Jimmie Guthrie a time of 3:27.26 and 3rd place Ernie Nott a time of 3:33.01. This would indicate that Guthrie was the winner rather than Percy Hunt. However, the average race speed appears to be correct?</p>

<p>There was no production racing in 1957, but why was that? - <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeasalt_2715.html" title="User:Seasalt">Seasalt</a> 11:56, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The 1957 Isle of Man TT Races was Golden Jubilee event and featured an 8 Lap Senior event. The reason for dropping clubman event may have been due to fall in entries and the widening gap between production motor-cycles and grand prix machines. Or it may have been due to congested practice and race timetable inluding practice on Clypse Course and reduction in practice time. It must have been complicated to close the road for practice on the Clypse Course and then have an practice session on the Mountain Course. The clubman race was also held on the last Saturday of practice week reducing overall practice time. This is Saturday practice is now traditionally the last practice session for the TT Races and is also the reserve practice day if practice time is reduced due to bad weather.

<dd>The only worry I have with this info is the "verifiability". Through my Ducati writing I have found that magazines without issn numbers are not considered "verifiable", and could be challenged. The standard for web sources is much less stringent. My Ducati material has not been challenged, but could be. I will use the information provided in the hope that it is not challenged, but know its possible. I get a bit upset when things I have edited or kept up-to-date get axed by enthusiastic rule studiers, like the "Major and Notable British Marques" info-box. It got changed into a list of manufacturers, because there were no criteria for "Major and Notable".

There is no source given and some of the information is incorrect and spelling mistakes have been transposed from the same book. I have added a template at the bottom of the page and added <a href="../../../k/e/p/Keppel_Gate_2183.html" title="Keppel Gate">Keppel Gate</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creg-ny-Baa_5feb.html" title="Creg-ny-Baa">Creg-ny-Baa</a> as separate enteries. For the entry for <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarquinio_Provini_1f99.html" title="Tarquinio Provini">Tarquinio Provini</a>, I intially thought that this is from the 2006 Offical TT Programme, but now I am not so sure.</p>

<p>If it is a direct copy, that is copy-vio (violates copyright). The wording should be different to the source material. You can of course change anything that is copyvio, or incorrect.<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeasalt_2715.html" title="User:Seasalt">Seasalt</a> 13:51, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyredroom_6171.html" title="User:Myredroom">Myredroom</a> 17:46, 28 February 2007 (UTC) was wondering if i could identify the Enfield in the photo. Do you know anything about these models? My answer was -</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1938 single port J model 500cc is my best guess. There was also a "twin port" J2 model, with two exhaust ports splitting from the single exhaust valve, giving a twin pipe exhaust. Mainly sidecar machine. The J model was also sold after ww2, but with telescopic forks. Your picture has the pre-war girder forks. Good for 75mph with stock low gearing. I am going on the straight back rear stand, as i cannot be entirely certain from engine appearance alone that it is not a 350 variant. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeasalt_2715.html" title="User:Seasalt">Seasalt</a> 11:05, 2 March 2007 (UTC)<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeasalt_2715.html" title="User:Seasalt">Seasalt</a> 10:54, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I apologize, I didn't see your edit regarding the Canadian flag. I thought you might have mis-edited. The <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_Canada_52f6.html" title="Flag of Canada">Flag of Canada</a> page shows its first appearance as February 1965.

<p>If you have finished with the rewrite, it may be time to remove the rewrite tag. What do you think? BTW, I modded the template with the show/hide navigation style. Hope you agree.

Thanks for the improvements to TT Course names template. The <a href="../../../s/n/a/Snaefell_mountain_course.html" title="Snaefell mountain course">Snaefell mountain course</a> needed a re-write as some of postings where plagarised directly from the internet and book "The Magic of The TT. A Century of Racing over The Mountain" by Mac McDiarmid. The re-write style is based on the Formula 1 racing circuit <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circuit_de_Spa-Francorchamps_db91.html" title="Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps">Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps</a> although I have not been able to find a map of the TT Course suitable to be displayed. I will try to add more information to the history of the Snaefell mountain course and also increase the number of TT course names.</p>
<p>The template for TT Riders has also attracted some comment. It was created after Wikipedia indicated that some entries for the TT Races where "orphaned" or did not have sufficient links. It was meant for TT Riders which do not appear extensively in the TT results and are significant to the history of the TT races such as <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archie_Birkin_c0e7.html" title="Archie Birkin">Archie Birkin</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Surridge_e8f1.html" title="Victor Surridge">Victor Surridge</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_James_Walker_3eb8.html" title="Frederick James Walker">Frederick James Walker</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/g/Inge_Stoll_9527.html" title="Inge Stoll">Inge Stoll</a>. I think it may be appropriate that a large number of pre-war TT riders may be included in this list, but not to be used extensively to list all post-war TT Races world championship competitors for the period 1947-1976. However, I have included <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santiago_Herrero_69f5.html" title="Santiago Herrero">Santiago Herrero</a> in this list which you may find acceptable. {<a href="../../../a/g/l/User%7EAgljones_3aef.html" title="User:Agljones">Agljones</a> 12:28, 22 March 2007 (UTC)}</p>
