<p>While that was never clearly explained, as to how Tai arrived, it is apparent that without the aid of one of the newer digidestined it was possible to enter the digital world.(Otherwise Mimi would be unable to, as she does shortly before Palmon was attacked by one of the Digimon created by Arukenimon). If I'm right, the only requirements to enter the digital world is that the gate is open, a ask tha can be acomplished by a D3, but can also occur naturally.</p>

<p>Well, I myself would consider Agumon to be male, simply because Digimon have genders (and if you need proof of this, in Season 2, Veemon falls in love with Gatomon). Agumon's personality is best described as male. Anyways, this is just a fan's perspective, so take it as you will. --66.183.131.46 20:15, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Right but during the Tamers season Renamon said that Digimon were not dived into genders 71.68.54.47 21:43, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>They probably don't have <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genitals.html" title="Genitals">genitals</a>, but when even the characters in the story itself use "him" or "her" then it's pretty safe for us to do the same. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 02:23, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we should just stick to it. I don't remember any digimon referring to itself with gender-pronouns, but even if it did...it's only the english dub. I don't think Japanese has pronouns that are explictly gender-sensitive. Also, the problem with referring to digimon as 'he' or 'she' is that we can't do it for all digimon. For example, we can probably agree that agumon is a 'he', but Botamon is generally an 'it'. Botamon is also apparantly Lalamon's fresh form, so i guess we must have he-Botamon and she-Botamon in the mix. And then there're digimon who don't show any apparant gender - should we just make an arbitraty decision about whether to user 'he' or 'she'? Or maybe use 'it' on then? Then we're going to have some digimon with the 'he' pronoun, some with the 'she' pronoun, and some with just 'it'. Not to mention, the same digimon will probably end up being referred to with different genders in different sections (IIRC, agumon is generally a 'he'. But the Botamon article's always referred to botamon as 'it's). Then what about things like silphymon. As far as Adventure 02 is concerned, Silphymon is a fusion between Gatomon (apparently a she) and aquilamon (apparently a he).</dd>

<dd>So really, i think we should just stick to using "it" the whole way through. It would look a bit funny on sections like Angewomon, but technically, it isn't wrong. Renamon states in Tamers that all digimon don't have genders. Otherwise, we'll have one small group of digimon with he/she, another group where people can potentially argue over, and the vast majority as its. --Saintmagician 12:18, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"1.5: IS SILPHYMON MALE OR FEMALE? (or "DO DIGIMON HAVE SEXES?")</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>For all intents and purposes, Silphymon is a male.</p>
<p>The issue of debate is whether or not Digimon actually HAVE physical sexes. Some will say they do, some will say they do not, and are merely "Digimon," and have a sex only in respect to their personalities.</p>
<p>If you believe that Digimon have physical sexes, then Silphymon is a male, due to the fact that he is Hawkmon's natural Ultimate form, regardless of having Gatomon's mind within him.</p>
<p>If you are a subscriber to the "no sex" belief, then you really can't peg a sex on Silphymon, because 'it' has two minds inside of 'it,' and hence is both male and female, but by the same token, is neither. However, if Hawkmon became Silphymon on his own, without Gatomon, then he would have a male mind.</p>
<p>Confusing, isn't it?</p>
<p>In episode 3.49, "D-Reaper's Feast," Renamon notes that "Digimon aren't divided into genders" - the line in the original version directly translates as: "By nature, distinctions of gender do not exist among digimon." Also, in describing Renamon, Tamers writer Chiaki Konaka states that "officially, Digimon do not have gender." But he himself notes that "If anything, gender seems fairly easy to identify in digimon," and says that Sakuyamon was clearly feminine.</p>
<p>To clarify some word misuse - Digimon ARE classified into gender, because gender is a cultural classification, where one is considered "he" or "she." Digimon quite blatantly and undeniably have that. It is being professed here that Digimon do not have SEXES, the physical classification of being male and female - which holds true for MOST Digimon, but characters such as Angewomon, LadyDevimon, Lillymon and, as Konaka notes, Sakuyamon, are quite blatantly female. So, the fact of the matter is that even the officials do not adhere to the official statement on the matter.</p>
<p>We do not know if Digimon reproduce - however, in the Japanese version of 1.13, "His Master's Voice," the "Scubamon" wanted Kari to be their queen so they could procreate with her (see question 5.1). But then again, these creatures were apparently not really Digimon. As this is a kid's show, I hardly think we should hold our breaths waiting, anyway."</p>

For every digimon species, we've been listing its appearance in every digimon media. That's not needed. The anime is digimon's main media. So for the anime main characters, we give them proper articles. For things like the various Digimon games - any *significiant* digimon appearances can be documentated on the game article. So the thing about dot agumon i removed...can go to the article about the game where dot agumon appears (asuing dot agumon is at all significant to the game, otherwise, it's trivia and we don't need it here)/.--Saintmagician 01:17, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't believe he was referred to as anything other than "MetalGreymon" but that was without a doubt his virus form (who also happens to be the original MetalGreymon).

No mention of metalgreymon being a different 'version'. Different color, yes. But the term "virus"/"viral" has a very specific meaning in digimon.

<dd>Why would the DigiDestined recognise him as a different version? He's just as much "MetalGreymon" as his vaccine counterpart if not more. There's no way to explain his change in appearance other then the fact that it could have only been a virus attribute MetalGreymon, although it doesn't necessarily need its own section in the article, but at least a mention. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightmare_SE_d239.html" title="User:Nightmare SE">Nightmare SE</a> 16:02, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The point is that it's not cannon. It doesn't mean a digidestined had to recognise him as a virus version - a lot of the cannon information is not directly stated. For example, from those "digimon analyzer" screens that used to come in digimon adventure. Or from those "previous episode" summaries that happened at the beginning of 02 episodes.</dd>
<dd>Just because the anime doesnt prove an explaination for his change in appearance, it doesn't mean we make speculations about what "it could have been" and then include them into wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>The evil version of metalgreymon already does have a mention in the article. It just doesn't have a seperate section, and isn't called "blackmetalgreymon" or "metalgreymon virus". --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 12:59, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>How is it not canon yet Botamon who was never given a name in the anime canon? And how is calling him an "evil" MetalGreymon not speculation? He was never called that, thats just speculation based on the fact that he was working for a villain, the only difference is the blue MetalGreymon that appeared in the anime has ALWAYS appeared as a virus attribute outside the anime. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightmare_SE_d239.html" title="User:Nightmare SE">Nightmare SE</a> 17:23, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Because 'evil' is being used as a descriptive term. But if you consider it OR, then you're welcome to change it to something less judgemental. Like just "the MetalGreymon which was under Ken's control", and so on. As i explained before, saying it is a "virus" is defintely OR because the term "virus" has a very specific meaning in the digimon universe. When you say "the blue metalgreymon was a virus", what you actually mean is that "the attribute of the blue metalgreymon is 'virus'". You're NOT saying "the blue metalgreymon is a <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virus.html" title="Virus">microscopic particle that can infect the cells of a biological organism</a>". Virus isn't being used as a descriptive term, but used to mean "viral <i>attribute</i>". --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 10:10, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is there any categorical (in-episode) proof that Botamon is this Agumon's Fresh? <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndiawilliams_db26.html" title="User:Indiawilliams">Indiawilliams</a> 19:29, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think so. I think it's either an extrapolation from Agumon (Adventure)'s Digivolution line, or from a V-pet toy. If it's from one of the v-pet toys, i'd say we don't include it, as per <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Digimon_Systems_Update_819b.html#Hagurumon_X_and_Adventure_Megas" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Digimon Systems Update">this discussion</a>. --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 04:02, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The V-Pets keep the "official" lines, and in any case, Baby II digimon have always had the same Baby I form. Koromon has always come from Botamon, and in the v-pets, he still does, and ONLY does. So I don't see where the uncertainty comes from. <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.211.181.173_d279.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.211.181.173">128.211.181.173</a> (talk) 18:16, 12 February 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>I added in an Other Forms section for some of the other Agumons so people would know about them (I added in the link to them), and had some info on BlackAgumon. Hope it was a good idea... <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeosj_9ce4.html" title="User:Leosj">Leosj</a> 00:47, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry it wasn't, this article is about Agumon the <i>character</i> from Digimon Adventure, SnowAgumon, ClearAgumon, ToyAgumon, ShadowToyAgumon and BlackAgumon can have their own entries in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Rookie_Digimon_%28Part_1%29_c6bc.html" title="List of Rookie Digimon (Part 1)">List of Rookie Digimon (Part 1)</a>. There's also happens to be bunch of other variations that there's really nothing to say about like Agumon Hakaze, DotAgumon, ExtraAgumon, etc. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightmare_SE_d239.html" title="User:Nightmare SE">Nightmare SE</a> 01:16, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
