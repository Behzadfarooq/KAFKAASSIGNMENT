<p>Well, there is a discussion page for every article. Click the discussion tag at the top of the article's page. Also, you can leave a message for individual users just like you did for me, on my talk page.

<p>Lot's of things are odd around here, but we just do what seems to work best. It's been decided that no signatures will go into the articles themselves; those can go on the talk/discussion pages. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCD_4f74.html" title="User:DanielCD">DanielCD</a> 21:27, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Agathoclea,</p>
<p>Are you refering to the removal of the category at Template:User independent Assyria? This was done because of a request by Wikipedia's founder, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a>.

<p>no I was referring to the wholesale recategorising of historical articles on ancient Babylonians <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Pylambert" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Pylambert" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgathoclea_2154.html" title="User:Agathoclea">Agathoclea</a> 23:43, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>ok - just noticed you had reverted one of his changes that is why I followed into your page <a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgathoclea_2154.html" title="User:Agathoclea">Agathoclea</a> 23:51, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As a matter of fact, the "Chaldeans" category included on the one hand articles about ancient Chaldea and on the other over present-day Chaldean catholics, unrelated to ancient Chaldea. And after reading the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaldea.html" title="Chaldea">Chaldea</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaldean.html" title="Chaldean">Chaldean</a> articles, I doubt the ancient "Chaldeans" called <b>themselves</b> Chaldeans, so why not putting their kings in some Babylonian category&#160;? Modern Assyrians/Chaldeans/Syriacs/Arameans keep trying to make people believe they're the inheritors of the ancient Babylonian empire, they even have a "Patriarch of Babylon", they could just as well claim to be named Babylonians. (P.S. please answer on the page of your correspondent, not on yours, it's easier) --Pylambert 23:59, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not interested in ancient Chaldeans, why should I crate a category about them, I'm not a specialist of antiquity. The solution would be, like for Assyria, to create a category Chaldea, no problem with me if you want to do that. --Pylambert 17:35, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am Chaldean and I'm obsessed with ancient Assyro-Babylonian history. Chaldean in Aramaic is Kaldu which was a title that meant Astrologer/Priest/Mathmetician basically someone experienced in the Ancient Arts and Sciences. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../1/2/2E/User%7E12.15.7.70.html" title="User:12.15.7.70">12.15.7.70</a> (<a href="../../../1/2/2E/User_talk%7E12.15.7.70.html" title="User talk:12.15.7.70">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_12.15.7.70_4f0f.html" title="Special:Contributions/12.15.7.70">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>nice&#160;:-) I have been reading on the German wikkipedia that Chaldeans came from the area of Kuwait before moving onto Babylon - do you have an English source for that? also I'd be interrested in the English spelling of Bit-Yâkin what is said to be their original home. <a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgathoclea_2154.html" title="User:Agathoclea">Agathoclea</a> 21:51, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I saw you modified the proposed expansion. I don't think the Page you suggest is equivalent to the many, many pages they have in the German Wiki covering that road system (one for each Autobahn and, I believe, Bundesstrasse as well). --<a href="../../../m/m/o/User%7EMmounties_8e5b.html" title="User:Mmounties">Mmounties</a> 21:34, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You can link them directly from there. That's the nice thing. All the wikis can link to those. --<a href="../../../m/m/o/User%7EMmounties_8e5b.html" title="User:Mmounties">Mmounties</a> 17:02, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi, below are the two lines in the town info box that you need to specify the image in. {{Infobox Town DE|<br />
name=Renchen|<br />
name_local=Grimmelshausenstadt|<br />
<b>image_coa =Wappen fehlt.jpg|</b><br />
<b>image_map =Karte_Renchen.png|140px|</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>These two images from the Renchen page I just did today are both in the Commons. You link them from any page like you would link an image that was loaded up to the en-wiki. If you click on the image in German, you'll see whether it's already in the Commons. If it is, you don't need to upload again. All you need to do is replace the German "Bild:" with the English "Image:" if you link from within the text. For the town info box, all you need to do is place the filename next to the equal sign on the respective line like I did on the two lines copied above. Hope this explains it a little better.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But now I have a question for you. &#160;:) Did you create the navigation bar for Hof County? Can you tell me where I might find ones that may exist for some of the counties I work on? If not, I need to learn how to do this!

<dd>Just wanted to let you know, I was "yelled" at yesterday by an admin on the commons because I didn't save enough info with my images (now I'm just copying all that the German image has on its page) and that I didn't place them in categories. I spent quite a bit of time yesterday to go back over the images I had uploaded before and filled in the blanks (so to speak). So if you now use the commons, make sure you do that. It's a lot easier to do when you first get them in. &#160;:) --<a href="../../../m/m/o/User%7EMmounties_8e5b.html" title="User:Mmounties">Mmounties</a> (<small><a href="../../../m/m/o/User_talk%7EMmounties_4d00.html" title="User talk:Mmounties">Talk</a></small>) <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" /></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/25px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="15" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" /></a> 00:15, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the copy-right thing only applies to actual content and images on the articles, not the external links per se.

<p>Hello Agathoclea. I deleted that sentence because it seemed to imply that there was a formal Roman presence in Britain between Julius Caesar and Claudius' invasions. Evidence for this, as I understand it, is based on the claims made at the beginning of a recent series of Time Team <a href="http://news.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=706092005" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=706092005" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. This has since been examined <a href="http://www.atrium-media.com/rogueclassicism/Posts/00000861.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.atrium-media.com/rogueclassicism/Posts/00000861.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and the theory has disappeared rather swiftly. If you wished to state that Romans were in Britain prior to the military invasion then I could not disagree but felt that the sentence claiming that there was Roman "support [for] local rulers friendly to Rome or to protect trading posts suggests a military presence which is not attested. If you could specify the archaeological evidence that History Today cites then I would be pleased to reconsider my position but I am not aware of any other pre-Claudian occupation theories. As for your request that the article explores the pros and cons of the theory, I would support its re-inclusion once the evidence has been listed.

<p>Beaufort was born in Ireland, Liam gallagher for example is listed as english, but his parents where Irish. So why do you think that beaufort sould be listed as British? And why then haven't you already changed the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Irish_Victoria_Cross_recipients_f949.html" title="List of Irish Victoria Cross recipients">List of Irish Victoria Cross recipients</a> into List of <i>British</i> Victoria Cross recipients???<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilltheking_7d70.html" title="User:Billtheking">Billtheking</a> 13:54, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If the fact that he may or not be Irish is getting in the way of major facts about the person I have a problem with nationalistic bias. Why don't you put birth and death location in the lead ... then people can make up their mind if he was Irish or not. But as a major feature (accomplishment) of his life was that he was an officer of the British navy. That was his choice and the basis for his fame as it was there he produced his famous charts. As far as the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Irish_Victoria_Cross_recipients_f949.html" title="List of Irish Victoria Cross recipients">List of Irish Victoria Cross recipients</a> is concerned the point is which British people of Irish birth/connection/location/whatever have achieved that distinction, so I have no problem with it apart from general reservations against <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EListcruft_170b.html" title="Wikipedia:Listcruft">Listcruft</a>. <a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgathoclea_2154.html" title="User:Agathoclea">Agathoclea</a> 16:43, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Regarding your comment that I might look to keep an eye on your edits, I can assure you that I will do no such thing. Like any other editor, I have many articles on my watch list, but I am not in the habit of trolling through other editors contributions to check their "POV". I have no idea why <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperdude99_7f6a.html" title="User:Superdude99">User:Superdude99</a> decided to contact me regarding <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlibabs_bdec.html" title="User:Alibabs">User:Alibabs</a> - I have had no contact with S99 whatsoever.

<p>Hello,</p>
<dl>
<dd>I noticed that you deleted the Category:Firearm deaths from the 'Adolf Hitler' Article. I realize I also included the Category:Firearm suicides. I would like them both to be included. I am a researcher. If I want to call up a list of all Firearm Deaths, it is necessary for this to be included in an Article. If I want to call up just those suicides by firearm, it is necessary for this Category to be included in the Article. Including both Categories in the same Article makes both tasks much simpler for all of us.</dd>

<dd>It shouldn’t matter how many Categories a given Article falls under, if they are relevant to the subject so be it. Again, an Encyclopedia is primarily a research tool, and the convenience of the researcher must be in mind when it is constructed and maintained. I do not want to make a huge deal of this, but I do not see where it matters how may Categories a particular Article falls into – each needs to be included for it to be complete.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If all of the entries in a given Subcategory fed into the main Category, and this main Category could be viewed as a separate and complete list – this would be fine. But without this, if I wanted to have a list of all persons who were the victims of firearm deaths I would have to locate all of the subcategories, view each as a separate list and collate them myself. This seems rather foolish when this could be accomplished for me by including all of the relevant Articles into a main Category in the first place. In this way I could view all of them, or just a subset.</dd>

<p>Hi, I agree with you that the detailed gas properties belong to the article about the gas rather than Auschwitz. It's all right to move it there, but not delete it completely without a good reason. This said, I believe some information about the gas in the Auschwitz article is still appropriate.

<p>Thanks for your comments on using centuries for establishments long ago. I've been meaning to work on that and I was thinking of doing the centuries prior to 1000 AD. I also think that decades are likely to be useful and I've had a look at the way this hierarchy has been implemented for the births and deaths categories. It seems complicated, which has been putting me off.</p>
<p>I'm not sure which year you had in mind as I've been working on lots of years.</p>
<p>Finally, I don't want to make the categories too broad (ie cover too long a time period). I'm not sure how this will work out, but I hope that as the Wikipedia gets more world-wide historical detail it will be possible to see the detail of what was going on in any given year (or decade). Currently, historians only either give general information or focus on one part of the world for the specifics. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenshed_5a67.html" title="User:Greenshed">Greenshed</a> 23:22, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I noticed that you've started using icons with your votes on RfA. Briefly, I'd like to ask that you not do that.

<dd>Your involvement in that seems fine. I'm not sure there's much more to say about that, as you seemed to have taken a fairly minor role in that. The accusations from the IP that you were 'stalking' are clearly unfounded. It's quite usual as an admin (and doing that sort of thing as a non-admin) to get that sort of comment. A quick scan of my talk page should show that (I am less likely to remove posts entitled "Petros471 Abuses Adminstrative Priveleges" from my talk page than other people!), and I like to think of myself as one of the less controversial admins around&#160;:)</dd>

<dd>Try and use edit summaries for all edits, including ones on talk page. They are handy for finding specific posts in the page history etc. There is an option in preferences to make Wikipedia prompt you for one if you don't enter them if you simply find yourself forgetting.</dd>

<p>Hi Agathoclea. Your familiar with this so I'm wondering if you can help by giving a warning to Timothy to stop placing socketpuppet labels on numberous user pages? In some cases he is edit warring with those users, who are reverting the changes he is making to their user pages. It's very uncivil and becoming increasingly disruptive.</p>
<p>It's silly for me and others to keep reverting him too when he not only persists but each time expands the list to include yet new users. I note he has even decided to publicize my persional home IP address as well: <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.121.40.153.html" title="User:64.121.40.153">User:64.121.40.153</a> with the label. I've never denied this is my IP address, and it only occurs when I get unintentionally logged off. Still, I prefer to keep my IP address private. Needless to say this is not a "puppet" and he knows this but does it just to harass. In this, is it not also a violation of privacy? I've removed all of Timothy's additions. I would like an admin intervention to tell him to stop this distruptive, wiki-stalking behavior. He might listen if he is given an official warning from an admin. I've already taking him to informal mediation over this issue in IRC with no luck, despite agreement from the mediator.

<p>I removed the Neighbourhood Watch link because the organisation has dissolved and as such couldn't have a relationship with them. If you feel that the archival site is still useful, please feel free to readd it, bearing in mind the fact that it could be taken offline anytime soon. I must query your request to keep the spam tag, as the general consensus is to remove this if all links have indeed been removed, and to instead leave a comment using &lt;!-- here --&gt; instead so that editors can see that there has been a problem but that readers of the page are not assaulted with the tag. Does this make sense?

<p>If you are one of Jehovah's Witnesses, advocacy from you would only reinforce the user's accusation. If you are not a JW, this would lead to the presumption of non-bias and would be most helpful (and thank you for offering). With constant attackers like this, the best method of defending against deliberate misinformation and POV wars is for non-aligned editors to be logical and measured with their responses, and use Wikipedia policies to deflate their methods. - <a href="../../../c/o/b/User%7ECobaltbluetony_df3f.html" title="User:Cobaltbluetony">CobaltBlueTony</a> 15:08, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I actually wasn't trying to change all the other stuff, only capitalize the comment part instead of the wikiformatting.

<dd><i>It's not important enough to argue about. Besides, with the way Wikipedia works, someone would agree that Wikiformatting doesn't work in HTML comments, but someone would probably argue about the fact that (in the process of re-typing it out and being from North America) I changed the S to Z, someone else would argue that the caps are distracting, with yet another suggesting we remove the notice as superfluous, and someone who had invested hours in the article claiming it is vitally important to keep it there. Several months later, consensus would be that we not change anything.

<p>Sorry, but an infobox usually shows the portraits of the person's head - and even preferably without a military cap. The rather blurred image of Hitler in Yugoslavia does not meet this infobox standard. The image of Hitler taken from a Mussulini photo is a compromise, until somebody uploads a better image. Why do you think the Hiler in Yugoslavia image is so great for the infobox? regards, <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamptown_46e8.html" title="User:Camptown">Camptown</a> 09:14, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>It's me Carabinieri again. I noticed you created the {{<a href="../../../m/u/n/Template%7EMunich-U-Bahn-stub_2cf0.html" title="Template:Munich-U-Bahn-stub">Munich-U-Bahn-stub</a>}} template today. Unfortunately you didn't propose it at <a href="../../../w/s/s/WP%7EWSS_P_67de.html" title="WP:WSS/P">WP:WSS/P</a>, where the creation of stub templates and categories is coordinated. What will be done with it is now being discussed at <a href="../../../w/s/s/WP%7EWSS_D_4924.html" title="WP:WSS/D">WP:WSS/D</a>. The stub looks like it was formed well, but it also needs to reach a threshhold of about 60 stubs, in order for it to make sense to keep it. Maybe you can find some more stubs to use the template on.--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarabinieri_1a8f.html" title="User:Carabinieri">Carabinieri</a><a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarabinieri_f294.html" title="User talk:Carabinieri"><sup>T</sup><sub>T</sub><sup>a</sup><sub>a</sub><sup>l</sup><sub>l</sub><sup>k</sup><sub>k</sub></a> 21:41, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think the list of stubs should go that deep, because it is a lot of work to sort the stubs if everyone just uses the {{<a href="../../../g/e/r/Template%7EGermany-stub_7a55.html" title="Template:Germany-stub">Germany-stub</a>}}.--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarabinieri_1a8f.html" title="User:Carabinieri">Carabinieri</a><a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarabinieri_f294.html" title="User talk:Carabinieri"><sup>T</sup><sub>T</sub><sup>a</sup><sub>a</sub><sup>l</sup><sub>l</sub><sup>k</sup><sub>k</sub></a> 14:09, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

Machst du dir eventuell auch die Mühe, außer Stubs mit einem Halbsatz anzulegen auch die Inhalte darin ein wenig voranzubringen? Bilder gibt's zu vielen U-Bahnhöfen auf den Commons und mit etwas gutem Willen lässt sich auch zu annähernd jedem Bahnhof was aus <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munich_U-Bahn_da36.html" title="Munich U-Bahn">Munich U-Bahn</a> oder <a href="../../../../de/u/-/b/U-Bahn_M%C3%BCnchen_9c97.html" class="extiw" title="de:U-Bahn_München">de:U-Bahn München</a> ziehen. Ach ja, achte auch etwas auf die richtige Schreibung der Bahnhöfe, ein paar hab ich gerade verschoben. BTW, U7 und U8 kannst du vernachlässigen (hast du ja ohnehin nur teilweise aufgeführt), die werden in 6 Wochen eingestellt. --<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloSch_7f9f.html" title="User:FloSch">FloSch</a> 09:11, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Die "alte U5" fuhr vom 8. Mai 1972 bis zum Fahrplanwechsel am 2. Juli 1973, siehe z.B. MVV Report 1973, Seite 25.</dd>
<dd>Dass U7 und U8 ab Fahrplanwechsel nicht mehr fahren, ist zwar noch nicht offiziell verkündet (da es noch nichts definitives zum Fahrplanwechsel im MVV gibt), aber es ist aller Voraussicht nach so. Ja, es ist nach wie vor Glaskugel, aber ich für meinen Teil halte es für sicher. Warte noch 2-3 Wochen, dann wird man davon vermutlich auch was in der Presse lesen. U7 und U8 sind künftig nur noch Teil der U1 bzw U2 und nicht mehr "Linienwechsler" wie bisher, von daher wäre es äußerst unlogisch, sie weiter unter diesem Namen zu betreiben. --<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloSch_7f9f.html" title="User:FloSch">FloSch</a> 17:50, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, thanks for your message. It looks like the flickr license is changed, or I really made a mistake but I can't imagine that actually. Since I uploaded <a href="../../../h/a/r/Image%7EHarley_Jane_Kozak.jpg_759a.html" title="Image:Harley Jane Kozak.jpg">Image:Harley Jane Kozak.jpg</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/e/Image%7ELee_Child.jpg_e1df.html" title="Image:Lee Child.jpg">Image:Lee Child.jpg</a> from the same source. Which indeed also are on a not compatible license anymore. Are you a Commons admin? If so, I quess you can delete the images. This is one of the reason why I recently always mail permissions to confirm, then you don't have that problem. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarion96_c83d.html" title="User:Garion96">Garion96</a> <a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarion96_d01f.html" title="User talk:Garion96">(talk)</a> 18:00, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh, agreed - Kleeneze, EHR - always a good sign: NOT! BCCI and Leeson at Barrings were our versions of WorldCom/Enron, but this one is an apparent piece of white collar crime. The big question for me is - why did they think they could trade out post the July profit warning; and secondly, why did people (savers) keep giving them cash? eeZee TV is not my kinda thing, other wise I'd watch - they do give out the odd "we're still trading" message - and the studios/registered office are within JML's HQ premises. I bet there's a share holders agreement which covers this eventuality. PS - love the UserPage photo!

<p>I have re-rated some Universities you rated as Mid-importance, for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think we should fill "Low-importance" mostly with the stuff that really isn't very important, like <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adenauerplatz_%28Berlin_U-Bahn%29_833d.html" title="Adenauerplatz (Berlin U-Bahn)">Adenauerplatz (Berlin U-Bahn)</a> or <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_100th_Light_Infantry_Division_b54d.html" title="German 100th Light Infantry Division">German 100th Light Infantry Division</a></li>
<li>The old universities like <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Leipzig_3c40.html" title="University of Leipzig">University of Leipzig</a> are quite important and relevant due to their history and their famous alumni and professors</li>
<li>The "elite" universities like <a href="../../../l/m/u/LMU_Munich_9628.html" title="LMU Munich">LMU Munich</a> do get frequent media mentions and international interest today</li>
</ul>
<p>If we think of the Universities as part of a hypothetical "Education in Germany" WikiProject, I guess a couple of universities would be rated Top or High importance. I think we shouldn't rate them three levels lower than that for the general Germany project. (Or I'll feel bad about tagging <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> as top-importance). <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 16:12, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

But it is no use edit-waring over those. On the other hand if such matters go to ArbCom they usually reflect very badly on the user who selectivly deletes warnings ect. <a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgathoclea_2154.html" title="User:Agathoclea">Agathoclea</a> 23:22, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the comments on this, Agathoclea. On a related note, I'd like to get your take on people copying others' comments from an article talk page to user talk pages. Unless the discussion is moving there, or unless it's just a bit quoted to respond to, I'm not comfortable with my comments being copied in a way that may give the impression that I posted them on the user talk page in the first place. Thanks. -<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 13:55, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is very explicit and direct as to where the talk came from. It has a link and everything. It is a closely related discussion that will be updated as talks from where it was received progresses, but I have removed myself from that particular talk due to its heated nature.</dd>
<dd>I don't think I have any issues with you, Milo H Minderbinder, besides your reverting my revision that is yet to be resolved. That is were my focus is.</dd>
<dd>If you are not "comfortable with my comments being copied in a way that may give the impression that I posted them on the user talk page". Then we can always cooperate and come to an agreement as long as you talk politely w/o attacks, as you have done here. And as you can see, you received a proper response and not a attack back from me.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, it will soon go into the archive so you needn't worry about other people reading it. Plus, to try and make you more comfortable, I could be more direct and leave a note before that section that says you did not post them on this user talk page, but I think, to be realistic, nobody would visit this one talk page out of soooooo many and read the talks for fun.</dd>
<dd>But, if this is really, really, really a big issue to you, I could always remove it since you are being very cooperative. Hope we can focus of the revision issue instead.</dd>

<p>This is the mechanism on how this vandal operates. He uses...{{User:FFFearless|FFFearless}} to spam your user page. An example:</p>
<p><i>I am a freelance writer working on an article about the wide array of people who make Wikipedia their life, their passion, their pastime. Wikipedia “addicts” if you will. I’m looking for people willing to tell their story of how they got sucked into the intellectual whirlwind that is Wikipedia; how you got started editing, how the obsession grew, and what you spend your time focusing on these days? Do you write articles from scratch? Is your main push toward one particular type of article? Do you patrol for typos and errors, or spend your time diligently fixing vandalism? Do you take part in the “social aspects” of Wikipedia; engaging in animated discussions or decorating your user page with all sorts of internet memes? Have you ever forced yourself to take a “Wikipedia break”? If so, what’s your 20/20 hindsight on the obsession? Basically I’m just trying to get an idea of what it’s like for various Wikipedia “addicts.” If you are interested in participating, please email me</i></p>
<p>This article is intended to be a light informational piece, nothing too heavy or controversial, just merely introducing readers to a subculture that they likely had no idea existed. So please don’t email me with your conspiracy theories, or your grudge against the Wikipedia hierarchy… unless it directly applies to your overall experience with the site. This article is about the USERS, not about the pros and cons of the site itself.</p>

<p>UPDATE: 11/27/06</p>
<p>After a bumpy start (check out my user talk page) I've actually been getting a lot of good responses, both from people who take part in the various "social aspects" of the site, as well as from people who are simply hardcore editors and consider most of the social interaction outside of collaborating on article to be anti-effective to the objective of the site.</p>
<p>I would still like to hear from anybody who has been involved in the Adopt-a-User program (whether as the adoptOR or the adoptEE). Also, I'd like to speak to anybody who has been involved in any heavy collaborative efforts with other editors on specific articles - or who have been heavily involved with a Wiki collaboration project. I'd like to get some thoughts on what that process is like.</p>
<p>Thanks to everybody who has been so helpful thus far.</p>

<p>UPDATE 12/3/06</p>
<p>The article is coming along nicely. All the various aspects of the site are segue-ing nicely into each other for a good flowing narrative and discussion. I plan on sending emails to any user whose quotes I used for their approval within the next couple of days. And when the final draft of the piece is done, I will email a copy of it to anybody who participated, with the strictest of promises that you will not republish it on your user page or anywhere else until after it has appeared in print.</p>
<p>Thanks again to all who took the time to tell me their wiki-stories. It has been really hard trying to narrow down what to use and who to quote as so many people had such intriguing and insightful things to say. I truly hope this article opens up the eyes to more people about the great work going on here at Wikipedia.</p>

<p>Well the article is complete and I have already started submitting it. I will keep everyone posted on where and when it ends up running. I have sent copies of the completed article to everyone who particpated in the interview process, under the strict understanding that it not be redistributed or reposted until after the article has been published. So far the feedback from Wikipedians has been good and even full of truly constructive criticism (which I expected no less of from the folks here&#160;:-) ).</p>

<p>I don't know that there actually is a policy on these things. What had happened was that, in the preparation of the Project Directory, I was going through all the projects which had been created, so I could know what all was there to be listed, and starting deletion discussions about those which had been inactive (meaning no project-related activity on the project page for the past three months) which had at most one listed member, the founder. The reasoning behind this was that these projects, for good or ill, were effectively clearly one-person projects, which doesn't meet the standard definition of a collaborative project. The closest thing to a policy regarding projects is that any project page which has no listed members, or only the founder listed as a member, and had had no activity as above in the past three months, can be tagged as inactive. Any of these projects could technically be considered for deletion, but there is no good reason to think that they necessarily would be. Also, crooked as it may sound, in some cases I myself joined the projects or performed some project-related activity on the project page of projects which I thought were either well-formed and just insufficiently advertised or were good ideas, but poorly formed. The only real thing close to policy I know of are that (1) any project which has no members stands a reasonable chance of deletion if an MfD tag is put on the page, and (2) any project page with no activity over three months can be tagged as inactive, and that in some cases some of these might be nominated for deletion. There is nothing like a set "policy" regarding the deletions themselves, however, they are all discussed in regular MfDs. I know that the above is overlong, but I hope it comes close to answering your questions. The Germany project you mentioned had specifically been around for three months, and in that time no one other than the founder had joined. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 16:48, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, the officialness is all a bit unofficial, but since it's transcluded on 85 articles now, I think we can go ahead with the category. <a href="../../../b/e/r/Category%7EBerlin_U-Bahn_stubs_18ea.html" title="Category:Berlin U-Bahn stubs">Category:Berlin U-Bahn stubs</a> can be used as an example on formatting the category page. I included it on the rail stubs category page more for completeness than anything else; the template exists and is in use, so it should be mentioned there. <a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlambo_7b8d.html" title="User:Slambo">Slambo</a> <small><a href="../../../s/l/a/User_talk%7ESlambo_46ea.html" title="User talk:Slambo"><font color="black">(Speak)</font></a></small> 11:52, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It now works in {{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikiProject_Germany_5e80.html" title="Template:WikiProject Germany">WikiProject Germany</a>}} (I see you have added some image requests already before it worked).

<dd>You're probably right about the flag overdose, although it's not as bad as when I returned to Germany from the US during the Football World Cup&#160;;-) For the regional (or historical) subprojects, I suggest we implement yes/no switches just like the amazing {{<a href="../../../t/r/a/Template%7ETrainsWikiProject_0b20.html" title="Template:TrainsWikiProject">TrainsWikiProject</a>}} does. The subprojects could also have their own importance switches attached should that be necessary (and assessemtn for a focused subproject will be easier than for all of Germany). Maybe I'll create a <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mainz.html" title="Mainz">Mainz</a> task force as proof of concept soon, although <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> is probably the only subproject that has a decent chance of actual success (I know of at least five enwiki admins living in Berlin, I guess we have quite a large userbase here), but that also means there are enough other people that can start that subproject and I don't have to do it. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 23:25, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The requested photos category needs a lot of work, probably not from photographers but from people who simply upload dewiki images at commons. I think we should slowly merge the category into our own to decrease talk page template clutter. Showing the coat of arms for a city subproject opposite the flag is a nice idea and would probably look really good, but will make things complicated for the "small" switch or impossible in case of several city subprojects sharing one topic (don't have a good example right now, but <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace_of_Westphalia_adc8.html" title="Peace of Westphalia">Peace of Westphalia</a> is as much a Münster topic as an Osnabrück one), so I'm inclined to go for the usual stacked placement if only for sake of my own sanity. Or do you have a good suggestion for the implementation? <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 10:08, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Agathoclea—you may be interested in putting your name to, or at least commenting on <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_9d65.html#A_new_parallel_syntax_for_autoformatting_dates" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">this new push</a> to get the developers to create a parallel syntax that separates autoformatting and linking functions. IMV, it would go a long way towards fixing the untidy blueing of trivial chronological items, and would probably calm the nastiness between the anti- and pro-linking factions in the project. The proposal is to retain the existing function, to reduce the risk of objection from pro-linkers. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 00:53, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Are you ready to get started?</p>
<p>The waiting time over at Admin coaching is long (some people have been waiting in line since July). I'm an admin coach with the project, and for my students I set up a group discussion page so that we could all learn from each other. The scope of this concept has expanded into the <b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Transhumanist_Virtual_classroom_482e.html" title="User:The Transhumanist/Virtual classroom">Virtual classroom</a></b>, which is an open forum for the teaching and learning of advanced Wikipedia skills.</p>
<p>Anyone and everyone is welcome to participate, as a student, as a coach, or both. Every week or two a new major topic of discussion or classroom assignment is introduced, usually with a guest writer who presents his or her expertise on the current subject and who remains on hand to answer questions. Everyone is encouraged to participate in the discussions, such as sharing your expertise, asking and answering questions, etc.</p>
<p>The current topic of discussion is <b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Transhumanist_Virtual_classroom_482e.html#Budgiekiller.2C_on_vandalism" title="User:The Transhumanist/Virtual classroom">vandalism</a></b>, and our guest writer is <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBudgiekiller_c362.html" title="User:Budgiekiller">Budgiekiller</a>.</p>
<p>All discussions are open-ended, so all previous discussion topics and classroom assignments are still there for viewing and further participation. There are also sections for posting miscellaneous topics and questions, requesting coaching assistance, etc.</p>
<p>In addition to inviting those who would like to learn, I routinely invite experts from all over Wikipedia to come and contribute for the benefit of all. The VC is rapidly turning into a clearing house of the best resources, methods, and techniques known for working on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>You are cordially invited to participate.</p>
<p>Here's an announcement box which you can place on your userpage or at the top of your talk page for keeping up to date with classroom assignments.</p>

<dd>Thanks, I feel honoured. I have changed the pronouns - short explanation in the editsummary. Quite ironic that the username I actually wanted was taken by an indef-banned sock.

<p>Wow, I'm terribly sorry. I must have misread the edit count and I thought you only had 6 edits to the Wikipedia talk space. I was shocked by so many people supporting when you had such a low amount of discussion. Thanks for bringing that up. I changed it to support.

<p>Hello Agathoclea,</p>
<p>I think using the "Mid" rating for _every_ city below 100k inhabitants is slightly overdone, especially given the liberal usage of the words "town" and "city" in most Wikipedia articles on German places. Certainly, a <i>Flecken</i> with maybe 5,000 people living there wouldn't be of medium importance in Germany, for instance. For now, I am planning to tag articles on mostly unknown places with the "Low" rating, use the "Mid" for places of notable size (say, <a href="../../../z/w/i/Zwickau.html" title="Zwickau">Zwickau</a>) and "High" for ones above a certain threshold. (Haven't run into an example for that one yet, though.) The "Top" rating I'll probably spare for the bigger stuff above, say, 250,000.</p>
<p>Of course that isn't set in stone, as my main focus is on the class assessment right now. There's about 1,700 articles which do not have a class assigned right now.</p>

<p>Wow, with a 95% 'support' vote on Christmas Day you must be feeling like you've just receieved the best present that a Wikipedian can receive from the community right about now - well done! I'm sure that a Bureaucrat will be along shortly in order to issue you with a shiny new set of admin tools. If you have any questions about using them then please ask - I'm just about finished working out how to use them myself!

<p>I'm sorry my report on AIV wasn't more clear. Cplot's been a pain for a few weeks now, so I thought the reference would be picked up quickly, but I guess some people have been lucky enough not to have had to deal with it. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 01:43, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just saw that you deleted the article I created to make a definition of the word "treneff." I was surprised that it happened and would like to explain to you that the page is in no way meant as a "personal attack" as you cited in your deletion. In fact, the person the page is about is a very good friend of mine whose reputation is known throughout the city where we live and is fast spreading around the campus of MTSU. In fact, he begged me to make the article about him here on Wikipedia himself. I can understand if you still find the article to be inappropriate for Wikipedia, however I feel that there was a misunderstanding on the intent of the page. It was created with the intent of humor and nothing more.</p>

<dd>I have just done so - I wanted to leave a personal message rather than the template one. The block notice you left has a wrong timestamp - did you c&amp;p or is one of the servers up the creek again?.</dd>
<dd><i>Inappropriate actions</i> - normally the usual process of RfC and ArbCom. In particular bad cases a steward will emergency de-sysop to prevent further damage.

You were amongst a number of editors who considered that I wasn't ready for the mop yet and as a consequence the RFA did not succeed (69/26/11). I am extremely grateful that you took the time to advise me on to improve as a Wikipedian and I'd like to assure you that I'll do my level best to develop my skills here to a point where you may feel you could trust me with the mop.</p>
<p>I've been blown away by the level of interest taken in my RFA and appreciate the time and energy dedicated by all the editors who have contributed to it, support, oppose and neutral alike.

<p>Thank you for initiating this revisit. While I am struggling to find time to continue in ways that seem useful from my own perspective, some of the easiest things to accomplish are related to what I spend most of my time here doing now. My most effective, and probably most prolific tasks to start with would be dealing with vandals, speedy deletes, and working my way into afd's. I don't want to bite off more than I can chew, so I may make a deliberate statement as to the self-imposed limitations on my activities on my user page if my nomination is approved. Right now, I must run, but I will come back to this later tonight.

<p>Hello, I responded to your question on my tal page. If you could be of any assistance I would be grateful. The images are indeed copyrighted, but I don't know which option to choose. I have been given the images by Tufts University to use as I wish on the Web. Melody Ko is the Tufts photographer. She takes photographs, and then the University buys them from her. The University gave them to me on a cd. If you could be of any help please let me know. I spent hours trying to put up the images, so I would like to make sure they aren't deleted. thank you Pmurph07 08:30, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>First of all I recommend you stop adding any pictures, so you won't waste any efforts. Secondly as wikipedia gets mirrored into a number of commercial ventures all pictures have to be on a free licence (GFDL or equivalent). Could you check with Melody, if she is prepared to do so (Or if she she has transfered copyright to the University check with the office to follow the same procedure).

<p>Hi I just joined Wikipedia yesterday, and I realised just how much I loathe vandalism. I've decided to become a kind of part-time unofficial vandalism fixer, and I have a question which I thought I should ask an administrator...I was wondering, when you put a warning (template or otherwise) on a non-member's talk page, is there any guarantee that they read it? I have used Wikipedia for a long time without being a member, and I had never even heard of a talk page!

<p>Go ahead and delete article if you like, but it might be good to have a page (if there isn't one already) of German Mil. terms when relating to regiments, brigades, battalions, etc. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinejoesmith_907c.html" title="User:Valentinejoesmith">V.

<p>There's really not much to restore. Please check out <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Bettina_Redlich_b12c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bettina Redlich">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bettina Redlich</a> as well, as that was the original source of the effort to delete the page. I was just the final step. All the page said about her was that she was an actress. Ok. Fine. But saying that does nothing to show why she's notable. Why should she have a page in an encyclopedia?</p>
<p>You mention expanding it. I'm hesitant to restore it as it currently is, since it really is not a useful page. One possibility would be to userfy the restored page to a work area in your userspace. Then you could work on expanding it a bit here before it gets moved back into place once it is a decent article. Sound reasonable? - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 14:06, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

I edited the stubs, categories, and inter-wiki link at the bottom to be non-functional. Just a pet-peev of mine, active categories and such in user space.&#160;:) But other than that, it's just as it was before the PROD/AFD/deletion. You can now work on it, and when you get it to a state that shows it's notability, it can be moved back to the article space.

<p>Welcome, Charles01</p>
<p>Thank you for your kind welcome message, Agathoclea. At the moment I'm working on an article on Deidesheim where (1) I used to live and which (2) has a particularly good article in the German wiki by (mostly) a fellow using the name Kallistratos, who seems to know a lot more about geology than they teach you in the English schools. And I've made a start on translating the article on the Rhenish Republic, tho here I bring a little context on my own account to the table since I studied the Weimar period as a special subject at uni some years ago.... (Don't believe them if they tell you history doesn't change once it's happened.) I anticipate concentrating initially on those areas where I have knowledge of my own to bring to the table, tho I am enjoying translating stuff from the German and French wikis (and learning a lot thereby, which for me is at least part of the point of it all). Once I run out of things where I have special knowledge of my own, I anticipate (unless I will fade out of the wiki world entirely) looking more closely at the 'Germany To Do' lists....</p>

Unless the deleting admins had only deleted the article based on prior precedence, then I think the album article should not be kept. If their are verifiable sources on Young B, and a whole new acceptable article can be made, then we can keep the album article.

<p>Hey, the 211.28.166.87 user has *yet again* added the section to the GRAW article. If you take a look at <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.85.234.166.html" title="User talk:64.85.234.166">User_talk:64.85.234.166</a> you can see that this user appears to be a sock puppet of the user you previously blocked and has repeatedly performed this edit and has a history of dubious edits. Can you just remove the section in question and perhaps semi-protect the article? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/b/User%7ECobaltBlue612_3b7a.html" title="User:CobaltBlue612">CobaltBlue612</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/b/User_talk%7ECobaltBlue612_38e6.html" title="User talk:CobaltBlue612">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CobaltBlue612_9c5e.html" title="Special:Contributions/CobaltBlue612">contribs</a>) 10:20, 19 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>hmm, not quite so clear a sock as they are opposite sides of this planet - unless some proxies are involved. <a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgathoclea_2154.html" title="User:Agathoclea">Agathoclea</a> 11:01, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Hrm. Maybe not, but it seems very dubious giving that the two exhibit a similar pattern of poor behavior, controversial edits and personal insults and interact positively only with each other. It may not be sock-puppetry if no proxies are involved, so perhaps trolls of a feather? Very unusual though <a href="../../../c/o/b/User%7ECobaltBlue612_3b7a.html" title="User:CobaltBlue612">CobaltBlue612</a> 11:05, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
