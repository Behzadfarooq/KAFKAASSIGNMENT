<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/a/Agathe_Uwilingiyimana_db71.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Agathe Uwilingiyimana, a <a href="../../../t/u/t/Tutsi.html" title="Tutsi">Tutsi</a>, was born in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a> in the village of Nyaruhengeri, some 140 km southeast of <a href="../../../k/i/g/Kigali.html" title="Kigali">Kigali</a>, Rwanda's capital city, to farming parents. Shortly after she was born the family emigrated from the border region of <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butare.html" title="Butare">Butare</a> to work in the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgian_Congo_5c79.html" title="Belgian Congo">Belgian Congo</a>. Her father moved the family back to Butare when Uwilingiyimana was four. After success in public examinations she was educated at Notre Dame des Citeaux High School, and obtained the certificate to teach <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanities.html" title="Humanities">humanities</a> at twenty.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a> she received an A-level certificate in mathematics and chemistry; she became a mathematics teacher in a <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butare.html" title="Butare">Butare</a> social school. In the same year she married Ignace Barahira, a fellow student from her village. Their first child was born later in the year; they would go on to have five children.</p>
<p>When she was thirty (in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>) she taught <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemistry.html" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a> at the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_University_of_Rwanda_ba00.html" title="National University of Rwanda">National University of Rwanda</a>. This was financially possible because her husband obtained a University Laboratory post at twice the salary of a math teacher. She received a B.Sc. in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, teaching chemistry for four years in the Butare academic schools. Rwandan media was later critical of her scientific education, as it was thought that girls should not study science.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/a/Agathe_Uwilingiyimana_db71.html" title="Edit section: Rise to prime minister">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rise to prime minister</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a> she created a Savings and Credit Cooperative Society among the staff of the Butare academic school, and her high profile role in the self-help organization brought her to the attention of the Kigali authorities, who wanted to appoint decision makers from the discontented south of the country. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> she became a director in the Ministry of Commerce.</p>
<p>She joined the Republican and Democratic Movement (MDR), an opposition party, in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>, and four months later was appointed Minister of Education by Dismas Nsensiyaremye, the first opposition prime minister under a power-sharing scheme negotiated between President <a href="../../../j/u/v/Juvenal_Habyarimana_3419.html" title="Juvenal Habyarimana">Juvenal Habyarimana</a> and five major opposition parties. As education minister she abolished the academic ethnic quota system, awarding public school places and scholarships by open merit ranking. This decision earned her the enmity of the Hutu-extremist parties.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_17.html" title="July 17">July 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>, after a meeting between President Habyarimana and all five parties, Agathe Uwilinigiyimana became the first woman prime minister of Rwanda, replacing Dr Nsensiyaremye, the man who had appointed her Minister of Education, and whose exoneration of the president was unpopular with the other parties. Since Uwilinigiyimana didn't have the power base of the other candidates, and was not wanted by Habyarima most observers believe that her appointment as prime minister was based on the political calculation by the President that she would divide the opposition, and by the opposition that she would be controllable. On the day of her appointment, Nsensiyareme suspended Uwilingiyimana's MDR membership. (The MDR had opposed the formation of any interim government excluding the rebel RPF.)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/a/Agathe_Uwilingiyimana_db71.html" title="Edit section: Arusha accords">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Arusha accords</span></h2>
<p>The Habyarimana-Uwilingiyimana government was still <a href="../../../h/u/t/Hutu.html" title="Hutu">Hutu</a> dominated, and had the daunting task of successfully negotiating a peace accord with the rebel <a href="../../../r/w/a/Rwandese_Patriotic_Front_a092.html" title="Rwandese Patriotic Front">Rwandese Patriotic Front</a> (RPF), the <a href="../../../t/u/t/Tutsi.html" title="Tutsi">Tutsi</a>-dominated guerilla movement. An agreement between Habyarimana, the five opposition parties (led ostensibly by Uwilingiyimana), and the RPF, was finally reached on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_4.html" title="August 4">August 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>. Under the "<a href="../../../a/r/u/Arusha_accords.html" title="Arusha accords">Arusha accords</a>", Habyarimana's ruling <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Movement_for_Democracy_and_Development_4a9e.html" title="National Movement for Democracy and Development">MRND</a> would take the transitional presidency, and the Prime Minister would come from the MDR. Since the MDR has suspended Uwilingiyimana they chose <a href="../../../f/a/u/Faustin_Twagiramungu_3fe3.html" title="Faustin Twagiramungu">Faustin Twagiramungu</a> (who had been instrumental in suspending her) to replace her.</p>
<p><a name="Caretaker_prime_minister" id="Caretaker_prime_minister"></a></p>

<p>President Habyarimana officially dismissed her as Prime Minister eighteen days after her appointment to the office, but she stayed on in a caretaker capacity for eight months, until her death in April 1994. This was despite being excoriated by all the Hutu-dominated parties, including her own MDR, and President Habyrimana's ruling party, which held a press conference in January 1994 attacking Uwilingiyimana for being a "political trickster".</p>
<p>The swearing in of the "Broad Based Transitional Government," or BBTG, was to have taken place on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_25.html" title="March 25">March 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>. At that point, Uwilingiyimana was to have stepped down in favor of Faustin Twagiramungu, having been guaranteed a lower level ministerial post in the new government. However, the RPF did not appear at the ceremony, postponing the establishment of the new regime. She reached agreement with them that the new government would be sworn in on the following day.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/a/Agathe_Uwilingiyimana_db71.html" title="Edit section: Assassination">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Assassination</span></h2>
<p>The talks between President Habyarimana, Uwilingiyimana, and the Rwandan Patriotic Front were never concluded, because the president's plane was rocketed on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_6.html" title="April 6">April 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>. In an interview with <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_France_9a2b.html" title="Radio France">Radio France</a> on the night of President Habyarimana's assassination, Uwilinigiyimana said that there would be an immediate investigation. She also said, in her last recorded words:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"there is shooting, people are being terrorized, people are inside their homes lying on the floor. We are suffering the consequences of the death of the head of state, I believe. We, the civilians, are in no way responsible for the death of our head of state."</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_Assistance_Mission_for_Rwanda_dbf4.html" title="United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda">UN peacekeeping force</a> sent a <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgian</a> escort to her home before 3am the following morning; they intended to take her to <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Rwanda_3b1d.html" title="Radio Rwanda">Radio Rwanda</a>, from where she planned a dawn broadcast appealing for national calm. Uwilingiyimana's house was further guarded by five Ghanaian U.N. troops on the outside in addition to the ten Belgian troops. Inside the house, the family was protected by the Rwandan presidential guard, but between 6.55 and 7.15 the presidential guard surrounded the UN troops and told them to lay down their arms. Fatally, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_Assistance_Mission_for_Rwanda_dbf4.html" title="United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda">blue berets</a> ultimately complied (handing over their weapons just before 9 am).</p>
<p>Seeing the stand-off outside her home, Agathe Uwilingiyimana and her family took refuge in the Kigali U.N. volunteer compound around 8 am. Eye witnesses to the inquiry on U.N. actions say that Rwandan soldiers entered the compound at 10 am, and searched it for Agathe Uwilingiyimana; she was eventually found, with her husband, and they were shot and killed by the presidential guard on the morning of <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_7.html" title="April 7">April 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>. In his book, <i>Me Against My Brother</i>, Scott Peterson writes that the U.N. troops sent to protect Uwilingiyimana were castrated, gagged with their own genitalia, and then executed.</p>
<p>In his book <i><a href="../../../s/h/a/Shake_Hands_with_the_Devil_2b7e.html" title="Shake Hands with the Devil">Shake Hands with the Devil</a></i>, UN commander <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rom%C3%A9o_Dallaire_a0ae.html" title="Roméo Dallaire">Roméo Dallaire</a> writes that Uwilingiyimana and her husband surrendered themselves to the genocidaires to save their children, who stayed successfully hidden in a volunteer's house (the children survived, leaving the country for Switzerland).</p>
<p>Major Bernard Ntuyahaga was indicted by the UN court for the murder of Agathe Uwilingiyimana and UN peacekeepers, but the charges were dropped <a href="http://www.internews.org/activities/ICTR_Reports/ICTRnewsMAR99.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.internews.org/activities/ICTR_Reports/ICTRnewsMAR99.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.internews.org/activities/ICTR_reports/ICTRnewsNOV98.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.internews.org/activities/ICTR_reports/ICTRnewsNOV98.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/299858.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/299858.stm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/341887.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/341887.stm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Black_c0aa.html" title="Christopher Black">Christopher Black</a>, a legal defender for Rwanda politicians accused in genocide, claims that UN forces and General Dallaire personally were implicated in this murder <a href="http://www.sandersresearch.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=793&amp;Itemid=67" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sandersresearch.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=793&amp;Itemid=67" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.</p>

<p>Though short, her political career was precedent-setting as one of the few female political figures in Africa. She was contemporaneous with <a href="../../../s/y/l/Sylvie_Kinigi_a100.html" title="Sylvie Kinigi">Sylvie Kinigi</a>, Prime Minister of <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burundi.html" title="Burundi">Burundi</a>. As a memorial to the late Rwandan Prime Minister, the Forum for African Women Educationalists (FAWE) established <i>The Agathe Innovative Award Competition</i>. The award funds educational and income generating projects aimed at improving the prospects of African girls. One of FAWE's founding members was Agathe Uwilingiyimana.</p>
