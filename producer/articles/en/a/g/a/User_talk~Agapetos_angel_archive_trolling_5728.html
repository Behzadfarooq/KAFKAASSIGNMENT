<dd>What exactly do you mean by "<i>Blind Freddy</i>"? Looking over your use of Guettarda's username at <a href="../../../j/o/n/Talk%7EJonathan_Sarfati_eed5.html#Consensus_attempt" title="Talk:Jonathan Sarfati">Talk:Jonathan_Sarfati#Consensus_attempt</a>, it's pretty clear what you were attempting to do. And adding/signing the usernames of others there crossed the line. I've warned you about POV pushing already, and you've chosen to dismiss or discount my warnings. Your actions there are rapidly approaching the point where others will legitimately demand administrative intervention to put right. Again, I suggest you take a wikibreak from this article, find something non-controversial to edit for a while, and use that time to rethink you participation on this topic. When you've got 3 admins telling you to chill out you're likely doing something very wrong. As for this "poll/summary" of yours, its time has long passed, you're merely using it to force the issue for your version of the content, which others have rightly identified as pov. This situation is addressed specifically at <a href="../../../s/t/r/Wikipedia%7EStraw_polls_a7e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Straw polls">Wikipedia:Straw polls</a>: "<i>If you try to force an issue with a poll, expect severe opposition, people adding a "polls are evil and stupid" option and your poll not being regarded as binding.</i>" <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 16:41, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have responded to this in the appropriate talk. <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Blind_Freddy" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Blind_Freddy" rel="nofollow"><i>Blind Freddy</i></a> is an Australian euphemism, the meaning of which is obvious. Review of your participation in the discussion, with its false accusations and <i>ad homs</i>, would show that your 'admonishment' comes with conflict-of-interest. I would kindly suggest that <i>you</i> step back and examine your behaviour, as it does not represent the standards of impartiality necessary for an admin. There was assumed malice where none was intended. The summary that was misconstrued came <i>after</i> an attempt at a poll, and therefore, was not signatures on a poll, but rather a listing of names that participated or 'rang in'. After discussion with KC, I made the changes she requested/required. Ringing in after the fact only emphasises your attempts to discredit me, as illustrated several times in talk, as an editor, rather than either responding to content, or attempting to assist me and the other editors who are working together with compromise to achieve a well-written article. <a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgapetos_angel_f3c0.html" title="User:Agapetos angel">agapetos_angel</a> 03:18, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First you signed my name to a list. When I struck it out you replaced it with a post that stated I did not say what I said. I am fed up of your intentional mischaracterisation of what I said. I can edit your post to remove personal attacks, and I can edit your post to remove lies about me. It isn't like I made it look like <i>you</i> were saying what I had to say - <b>unlike you</b>. Lay off the dishonesty. Stop making claims in my name which are outright false. Is that too much to ask? There is no reason that I have to tolerate your mischaracterisation. I asked you to change it, you refused. I am under no obligation to tolerate your dishonesty. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 05:04, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I, as requested by an admin after you complained, changed the bullet list that was misconstued as a poll (even though it came after the 'poll' and was obviously a summary). Saying that your dissent was implied was not dishonest, and regardless of that fact, did not give you the right to edit my postings in any way. Your disagreement with my assessment, posted after my assessment, would have been sufficient. Your continued editing (and now deletion) of my postings is not appropriate. <a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgapetos_angel_f3c0.html" title="User:Agapetos angel">agapetos_angel</a></dd>

<dd>It <i>is</i> dishonest to keep insisting that I said something when I said nothing of the sort. You <i>don't</i> have to right to make dishonest claims about what I said. If you refuse to remove them, then I have no choice but to remove them. It isn't a matter of "disagreement with my assessment" - you are making outright brazenly false statements, and you insisted on making them despite my insistence that you remove the misleading material. You have no right to put words in my mouth. You have no right to insist on your right to lie. You can't just go around claiming that people said things they did not say. Why is it too much to ask that you quit attributing statements to me which I did not make and did not imply? <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 05:33, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What are you talking about here? I hit save instead of preview and rolled back the change.

It was a temporary measure to allow you to remove the offensive text. When you refused I had no choice but to remove the entire post.

<dd>Guettarda, you have falsely accused me, and I have shown that by the evidence. Posting the two diffs above, and adding commentary to them now in retrospect that does not match the chain of events, does not support this false accusation.

<p>KC told you to remove everyone else's name but your own. She <b>did not</b> tell you to reinstate the assertions regarding me. If you had simply done as she asked, the material would have been removed. Instead, you <b>chose</b> to reinstate the content that I has asked you to remove. After I gave you a few days to comply with my original request, I checked back and foudn that you had reinstated the lie. Please stop <i>pretending</i> to be a victim. You post false assertions about me, <i>repeatedly</i> and then you claim that I am accusing you falsely? Have you no shame? You lie, you lie about lying, and then you accuse me of lying? You posted diffs that could in no way be considered <b>evidence</b> since they are totally unrelated to <b>either</b> of your sets of falsehoods. <i><b>You have yet to provide a shred of evidence in support of your false assertions</b></i>. You are <b>still</b> lying despite the fact that I have posted evidence that your <i>second</i> set of claims (the assertion that you have posted evidence to support your initial assertion) is patently false. I am totally baffled at why you keep asserting things that are patently and demostrably false. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 05:55, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>AA, your evidence shows only that you persisted in stating "what Guettarda thought" after being asked, then told not to do so. Guettarda was well within guidelines to strike-through and then remove, with an appropriate comment, your doing so.</p>
<p>A summary reads like this: "Well, it looks like we're fairly evenly split on Bumpkis was a farmer, and Bumpkis was an agriculturalist, with one lone holdout for Bumpkis was a gardener."</p>
<p>Please note the lack of editors' names involved in that summary. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 10:29, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Your version of a summary reads without editor's names, that's true. Mine does not. However, this does not mean that mine against any written policy, as far as I am aware. You warned me based on your assumption of malice that I was inserting names in a poll. I showed how the listing of names was not a poll, but came <i>afterwards</i> to summarize. Under protest and with explanation, I even complied with your requirement by making an edit so it did not look like a poll. It is not required, however, that I edit my opinion that Guettarda implied dissent to the revision, especially as the evidence has born out that my opinion is correct by the revision and the critique. I did not state "what Guettarda thought". I stated what I thought, that the dissent was implied. I'm sorry that you disagree, but until it can be shown that policy prevents saying that an editor implied something, especially when evidence shows that to be true, the point stands that the deletion of my (and the other editor's) postings was not appropriate. All that served to do was to leave the complaint, without the evidence that the complaint was invalid. I am trying to be reasonable. I made the edit so that it was extremely clear that it was my opinion in a summary of events. I have even asked Guettarda in Talk why he thinks my assessment based on the evidence is incorrect. This is active listening. X relates what they think Y said. I was attempting to come to a consensus in each dispute by asking if my assessments of the points made so far was accurate. If you note, I did this in several sections,not just that one. Why Guettarda got angry, and remains angry, I am trying to ascertain in a 'step back and see the other point of view', but I still fail to see how I misrepresented him in any way, shape, or form.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, I don't appreciate that FM falsely accused me, and posted my old IP on the Talk page, as well as revealing where I am located, and his other subsequent personal comments that are unrelated to content. This is, <i>to my viewpoint</i>, a very harsh breach of admin responsibility to good behaviour and a serious offence. After your strong admonishments to me on the above issue, I would ask if you please would apply equally impartial (and proportionate) admonishment to FM's actions in Talk.

<ul>
<li><i>I stated what I thought, that the dissent was implied</i> - so you feel that you have the right to make up falsehoods?</li>
<li><i>but until it can be shown that policy prevents saying that an editor implied something</i>, <i><b>especially when evidence shows that to be true</b></i>, <i>the point stands that the deletion of my (and the other editor's) postings was not appropriate</i> - You don't have the right to attribute an opinion to me which I have not expressed, and your protestations to the contrary, <b>there is no evidence to support your allegation</b>. Your allegation false.</li>
<li><i>All that served to do was to leave the complaint, without the evidence that the complaint was invalid</i> - The complaint was valid. There was never any evidence to support your <b>false</b> statement.</li>
<li><i>I am trying to be reasonable</i> - how is it reasonable to insist on your right to post false statements?</li>
<li><i>I have even asked Guettarda in Talk why he thinks my assessment based on the evidence is incorrect</i> - for one, this is a loaded question; please point me to the posting, I don't recall noticing it; what evidence?</li>
<li><i>This is active listening</i> - active listening? You post a false statement about me. I ask you to remove it. You refuse. I remove it. You complain. If this is your idea of listening (disregarding what other people say and pretending to be the wronged party rather than the aggressor) I'd hate to think what your idea of "not listening" is.</li>
<li><i>Why Guettarda got angry, and remains angry, I am trying to ascertain in a 'step back and see the other point of view', but I still fail to see how I misrepresented him in any way, shape, or form.</i> - what a crock. It's <b>very simple</b> why I am upset. <b>You attributed opinions to me which were false</b>. When you make stuff up that's false, it misrepresents people. How could you possibly find that hard to understand?</li>
<li><i>I don't appreciate that FM falsely accused me</i> - if he actually were falsely accusing you, it would mean that he was doing what you were doing. If you don't appreciate being falsely accused, you should make certain that you don't falsely accuse others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seriously - first you falsely attribute opinions to me, then you claim that there is "evidence" to support your false claim, then you present to be confused about why I am upset with your lies, and <i>then</i> you have the gall to complain about "false accusations"? And you claim to be "listening"? Why are you making all this up? <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 16:03, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I used this word, recognising that it is a strong accusation, but supported by above, I don't think it was an inappropriate one. [Internet troll] is defined on Wikipedia as:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In Internet terminology, a troll is a person who posts rude or offensive messages on the Internet, such as on online discussion forums, to disrupt discussion or to upset its participants. "Troll" can also mean the message itself or be a verb meaning to post such messages. "Trolling" is also commonly used to describe the activity.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The use of false accusations as character assignation is a common ploy in debate, usually found on the political arena. This is usually the result of a lack of ability to respond to debate points and come to agreements through compromise. As the discussion in the article's talk has been disrupted several times, and as the messages which include continued assertions of lying and other false accustions that fly in the face of the evidence were being continued, the attempt to upset this participant was obvious. Ergo, the use of trolling. This was not intended to be commentary about the contributor, but of the actions. <a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgapetos_angel_f3c0.html" title="User:Agapetos angel">agapetos_angel</a> 06:34, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, regarding complaints that I personally attacked Guettarda by requesting that he stop trolling: Guettarda removed the one comment I left on his talk page with the same sort of comment regarding 'trolling' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGuettarda%2FArchive10&amp;diff=37291859&amp;oldid=37282013" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGuettarda%2FArchive10&amp;diff=37291859&amp;oldid=37282013" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> as well as having a statement at the top of his talk page about how trolling would be removed. That evidence was used to point out that the complaint was contrived, at which time he archived and removed that phrase from his talk page. <a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgapetos_angel_f3c0.html" title="User:Agapetos angel">agapetos_angel</a> 10:37, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
