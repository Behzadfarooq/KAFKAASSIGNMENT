<p>I don't think that Against Me! as Tom Gabel's solo work started in college apartment complexes. My understanding is that he started it while still in Naples (a number of my friends recall seeing him playing outside of shows, and sometimes seeing them with Tom and various people on buckets)</p>
<p>I doubt that this statement in the article is true and should be changed or cited, because if it's false, it obviously doesn't belong in the article. KurtFF8 05:20, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
While it is true that Against Me! started in Naples, I was at the laundromat show, which was at College Manor Apartments in Gainesville on a Thursday night in fall 2000.</p>

<dd>I'm sure it's possible that there are some tounge-in-cheek aspects to it, but Tom Gable (who I assume wrote the lyrics) has said before that he is (or at least was) an anarchist, so I'm assuming that the message of the song, while being portrayed as tounge-in-cheek, could also be serious at the same time.

<p>He's obviously not an anarchist anymore, since he deals with those fucking bastards on MTV and FUSE-FionMacCumhail 07:20, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>regardless, that wouldn't make the song toungue-in-cheek, it would jsut make it hypocritical. toungue-in-cheek means to me that Gable disagrees with anarchism, which I would doubt..

<dd>lol, yeah, sell-outs, I know. It's always annoying to see a good band go the way of commercialization. Alas, we lose another one to the dark side. Anti-flag really upset me too with all their punkvoter drivel (actually, punkvoter made me upset with a lot of bands), not to mention signing to a major label, sounding worse and becoming supposed pacifists (they had the song "kill the rich" and now they have a song called "Power to the Peacefull").

<dd>Antiflag was never anarchist though. They said they were anarchist in their music but real people who have actually talked to them have said they were pretty reformist. One of them in the band was a Leninist though. Leninism is almost bad as capitalism so I think its better that they sell out anyways lol. Good band though</dd>

<dd>If he didn't mean everything he sang in the song, then maybe it could be tongue-in-cheek - for example, the bit about smashing the Starbucks window strikes me as sending up anarchists a little... Also, I think Leninism is far worse than capitalism - it's nothing more than repressive state-capitalism. At least capitalism has some freedom... <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupersheep_75b6.html" title="User:Supersheep">Supersheep</a> 11:42, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I think people just interpret it the way they want to, because it can be twisted either way. It seems obviously pro-anarchist to me, but that's very likely just because I'm an anarchist.

<p>I already changed it, but I'm having second thoughts... perhaps the best description would be "hyperbolic" - that way, regardless of whether it's toungue in cheek or not, people will realise it's not to be taken too literally.. --<a href="../../../n/a/u/User%7ENaught101_5571.html" title="User:Naught101">naught101</a> 09:01, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Although I'd agree with your interpretation of hyperbolic, I think that unless the band made/makes some kind of statement about their intent, then we shouldn't speculate since it's really contensious and not incredibly obvious. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><b><font color="black">Ungovernable Force</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_Wikipedian_kitchen_68b8.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force/Wikipedian kitchen"><font color="green"><sup>The Wiki Kitchen!</sup></font></a> 22:58, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it's kind of shallow to think that just because a band signed to a major label it makes them any less of an anarchist than they were before. I've talked to Gabel because he happens to be my first cousin, on a regular basis. And his views on having a band are pretty simple in that, not everyone in the band is an anarchist, so he never really viewed Against Me! as an anarchist band. And I think a lot of people lose sight of that. Sure, Gabel wrote some anarchist songs on their early recordings, but you must remember, that was a totally different situation in which it was just controlled by him and one other member who probably agreed with him fully. Tom still claims to be an anarchist, but is also a very lucid anarchist. He's very realistic, and keeps things in perspective. I think to call a band to sell out would say that they have abandoned their former ideals, and honestly, Against Me! as a four-piece band never really stated all-out that they are an anarchist band. However, "Baby, I'm an Anarchist!" does sound like a tounge-in-cheek ballad. I don't think it's saying that anarchist beliefs are moronic, however. I think it's just pointing out the difference between liberals and far-leftists and anarchists, and how they are ironically commonly associated. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.236.57.67_d92e.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.236.57.67">72.236.57.67</a> (<a href="../../../7/2/2E/User_talk%7E72.236.57.67.html" title="User talk:72.236.57.67">talk</a>) 04:57, 8 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>First off, calm down. Second, <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_punk.html" title="Folk punk">folk punk</a> is an established genre. There are many bands that play a mix of folk and punk (<a href="../../../t/h/i/This_Bike_Is_A_Pipe_Bomb_95d7.html" title="This Bike Is A Pipe Bomb">This Bike Is A Pipe Bomb</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defiance%2C_Ohio_%28band%29_758e.html" title="Defiance, Ohio (band)">Defiance, Ohio</a> to name just two).

<dd>Well, unlike the edit I just congratulated you for, I'm not quite so sure about this one. They used to say they were anarchists, didn't they? I don't listen to them much though, so I'm not the expert on this band. I'd say keep it in, but just weakly. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><b><font color="black">Ungovernable Force</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><sup>Got something to say?</sup></font></a> 05:32, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not an expert myself.. but they could say they are anarchists (at an personal level), but .. can a band who signed for Fat Wreckords and tours with <a href="../../../n/o/f/NoFX_f6c8.html" title="NoFX">NoFX</a> be considered anarcopunk. They have more relations with other comercial punk bands than with anarkopunk bands.. i don't think they are anarkopunk at all. IMHO the just happen to play a style of music which can be considered "punk rock", rock, folk-punk (you name it) and they call themselves anarchists. That doesn't put you in the anarkopunk category. The bottom line is, besides what they say they are and their music style, what facts make them "anarkopunk"? Tell me what you think. <a href="../../../c/a/c/User%7ECacuija_18b6.html" title="User:Cacuija">Cacuija</a> (<a href="../../../c/a/c/User_talk%7ECacuija_0498.html" title="User talk:Cacuija">my talk</a>) 15:21, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First, isn't it anar<i>ch</i>o-punk? As for the stuff on record labels, Propagandhi is on Fat Wreckords too, but I've never seen anyone try to say they aren't anarchists because of that. It seems a little improper to say a band isn't anarcho-punk just because of that. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><b><font color="black">Ungovernable Force</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><sup>Got something to say?</sup></font></a> 19:55, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, sorry about missing that part--I had 5 minutes till class started so only had a minute or two. I'd say any band that is made up of anarchists, blends that into their lyrics and plays punk music of some kind. For myself personally, they should also be active in political/social movements related to anarchism and should be trying to live consistently with their beliefs, but that's my own <i>personal</i> view and I don't think it's a good measure of whether a band should be included or not in an encyclopedia. Case in point--well, this one. I might have considered them anarcho-punk earlier on, but they do seem to be really selling out in my opinion. I wouldn't really consider them that great an example of an anarcho-punk band, but they do probably meet the basic definition for on here. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><b><font color="black">Ungovernable Force</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><sup>Got something to say?</sup></font></a> 04:01, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>By definition (note that i don't like "book" definitions) from <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-punk.html" title="Anarcho-punk">Anarcho-punk</a>: "Anarcho-punk is a part of the punk movement consisting of groups, bands and individuals promoting specifically anarchist ideas.". note the "promoting". Can you tell me how this band promotes anarchism?, again, at an individual level their members may consider themselves anything, at a group level.. i don't think we can consider this band anarcho-punk. Still my question remains unanswered "besides what they say they are and their music style, what facts make them 'anarkopunk'?". thanks for your feedback, - <a href="../../../c/a/c/User%7ECacuija_18b6.html" title="User:Cacuija">Cacuija</a> (<a href="../../../c/a/c/User_talk%7ECacuija_0498.html" title="User talk:Cacuija">my talk</a>) 04:40, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Besides what they say and their musical style"? Why leave out the two most imporatant aspects that define an anarcho-punk band? They even have a song that mentions Anarcho-punk. I fail to see how they are <i>not</i> anarcho-punk. Just because they are now on a major label doesn't take away what they stand for (or even if they no longer stand for that, the majority of their music and message does) KurtFF8 20:56, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You still don't answer my question. So, based on your point of view, shall we place The <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_Pistols_b1a7.html" title="Sex Pistols">Sex Pistols</a> in this category? <a href="../../../c/a/c/User%7ECacuija_18b6.html" title="User:Cacuija">Cacuija</a> (<a href="../../../c/a/c/User_talk%7ECacuija_0498.html" title="User talk:Cacuija">my talk</a>) 03:03, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, The <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_Pistols_b1a7.html" title="Sex Pistols">Sex Pistols</a> have a different musical style, and don't really hold anarchist views (to my knowledge) and those are the two things that distinguish a band as "anarcho-punk" from what I understand that genre to be. KurtFF8 04:42, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Musical style has nothing to do with anarco-punk.. You just have to play punk, or something like that and even if you play other music style, and you want to consider yourself anarcho-punk, i think it's perfectly fine. it is the attitude, For instance Catharsis is hardoce-metal IMO, they are anarcho-punks. The point is. Against me! as well as The Sex Pistols play "punk" music, and they might say they are anarchists or have songs about "revolution" and bla blah's. that doesn't make them anarkopunk. So in my opinion your "musical style" point is not valid, and your "don't really hold anarchist views" apply for boths. Please, someone show something that verifies that Against me! say they consider anarco-punks... something else than just a few (if only one) members say "we are anarchist" more at an intelectual level. Otherwise, i will be removing them from <a href="../../../a/n/a/Category%7EAnarcho-punk_a16e.html" title="Category:Anarcho-punk">Category:Anarcho-punk</a> Category until someone provides a valid source.

<dd>On another note, can we agree that they are actually a <i>punk</i> rock band? I've changed the intro paragraph to mention that. Artiste-extraordinaire 23:58, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The "Type of Music" section is fairly subjective, and written very strangely. Also, I think the author of that section was confusing "soft rock" with "folk rock". I'd say that bit either needs to be wiped out, or cleaned up (ie. citing the comparison to Bob Dylan). Jeridus 21:11, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, good call on wiping that bit out. I just managed to catch it before it was deleted, and it really wasn't written very well. I couldn't quite tell if he knew what he was talking about or not, but he made a good call on that bit about "Wagon Wheel" sounding like Dylan. The best I can figure it is this; the version that Against Me! does (from <i>PROTECT: A Benefit for the National Association to Protect Children CD - 2005</i>) is pretty much as it's performed originally by the Old Crow Medicine Show (from <i>S/T CD - 2004</i>), but even they only added some lyrics to an old Dylan song called "Rock Me Mamma" (from <i>Genuine Bootleg Series CD - 1994 - Originally recorded in 1973</i>). Personally, I completely prefer the AM! version over the OCMS version, but the original Dylan song is even better.</dd>
<dd>Anyways, that's just a random bit of information in case anyone was curious. Maybe the writer will be surprised if he reads this, who knows? (Callthekettleblack 05:37, 9 March 2007 (UTC))</dd>
