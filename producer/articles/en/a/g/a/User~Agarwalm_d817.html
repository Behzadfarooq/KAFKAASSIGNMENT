PROJECT DETAILS</p>
<p>1. SME—Seamless Mobility Engine, Nov’ 2005-Till Now Employer: Motorola India Electronics Pvt. Ltd.</p>
<p>Project Description Seamless Mobility Engine is a framework to handle seamless mobility requirements at device side. SME sits below the application layer and interacts with various transports and protocols stacks. A device can roam in various networks; and SME triggers association on the network and sends the indication to protocols to register on this network. SME also takes care of various other tasks which are required to make a service available on a network. When a device leaves a network and associates on the other network, SME handovers the services running on the previous network to the new network. My Role: I have the complete responsibility of a module of SME. This module is “Environment Manager (EM)”. EM handles different profiles related to various services, networks, protocols etc. Based upon the priorities mentioned in the profile, EM associates on a network and triggers other modules of SME to make the services available on the associated network in the preferred order. EM also keeps track of the networks presence. When the signal strength of an associated network is very low then EM associates on the next preferred network and disassociates on the earlier network. EM also informs other modules about the supported protocols for services and supported transports for protocols. EM also selects the preferred route for Data applications. Environment/Tools/Technology: Linux, Windows, C, Eclipse, XML, GSM, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Seamless Mobility, Profile Management</p>

<p>3. CN622 (Next version of CN620)--A Dual-Network Mobile Office Device(MOD), Jan’ 2005 – Sep’2005 Employer: Motorola India Electronics Pvt. Ltd.</p>
<p>Product Description CN622 is the next version of CN620 (described below). The changes in this version included some UI changes like Tab Control, Number Highlight, and Wrap-around viewer etc. In addition to this there were customizations for different operator needs. The few other options explored on CN622 were Messaging over WLAN and Data Seamless Mobility. My Role: I was involved to develop tab control and viewer control. Also the customizations required in other controls like List Control, From Control, Edit Control etc was my responsibility. I was also responsible for integrating applications with the changed controls. I was also involved in the “Data Seamless Mobility” initiative for CN622. Environment/Tools/Technology: WINCE, C++, MIP, Identity Management, Data Seamless Mobility, NDIS</p>
<p>4. IMS—IP Multimedia Subsystem, April’ 2005 – June’2005 Employer: Motorola India Electronics Pvt. Ltd.</p>
<p>Product Description The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) standard defines a generic architecture for offering Voice over IP (VoIP) and multimedia services. It is an international, recognized standard, first specified by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP/3GPP2) and now being embraced by other standards bodies including ETSI/TISPAN. The standard supports multiple access types –including GSM, WCDMA, CDMA2000, Wireline broadband access and WLAN. For users, IMS-based services enable person-to-person and person-to-content communications in a variety of modes – including voice, text, pictures and video, or any combination of these – in a highly personalized and controlled way. For operators, IMS takes the concept of layered architecture one step further by defining a horizontal architecture, where service enablers and common functions can be reused for multiple applications. The horizontal architecture in IMS also specifies interoperability and roaming, and provides bearer control, charging and security. My Role: I worked on this project along with above mentioned CN622. I was involved in designing. During this project I learnt the concepts of SIP and IMS. Environment/Tools/Technology: Linux, C, SIP, SDP, IMS, IPSec, SSL 5. CN620—A Dual-Network Mobile Office Device(MOD), May’ 2003-Jan’ 2005 Employer: Motorola India Electronics Pvt. Ltd.</p>
<p>Product Description CN620 Mobile Office Device (MOD) ties together with Wi-Fi and cellular technologies for easier, more efficient, access to voice and data networks both inside and outside the office. This is the first device that can hand-over an active VoIP call to GSM via Wi-Fi, when the user travels beyond the WLAN coverage. Vice-versa only "PBX anchored" calls will continue when moving from GSM to WLAN. In other words, it is a device that can seamlessly hand off active calls between Wi-Fi based office VoIP phone systems and normal GSM networks. Not only that, but while in enterprise WLAN mode the device would work like a normal office desk phone allowing you to dial office extensions. In addition to other features of normal cell phones, MOD also provides many key features including call hold, conference calling, multiple simultaneous active calls, and access to corporate email, data, applications and directories. The device also allows users to surf both the corporate intranet and internet. My Role: I was involved as a UI (user interface) team member. Below were my roles and responsibilities as a team member.</p>
<p> Designed and developed “Phone Status” application. This application allows the user to edit and change the name/number for the telephone lines supported by SIM; to change the active line set on the phone; to see the battery status; to check the memory usage on the phone; to see the information like software version, hardware version, Mac Address, IP address etc.  I was actively involved during the design and development of “Sound Settings” and “Volume Settings” application. I was also responsible for the feature interaction scenarios for these applications.  I was responsible for the enhancements and for fixing the bugs reported in any feature of the phone.  As a whole, I worked on many applications during this project. These are “Phone Status”, “Sound Settings”, “Volume Settings”, “Phone Book”, “Tasks”, “Calendar”, “Initial Settings”, “Accessories” including a part of “Shell” and “Aggregates”.</p>

<p>(Below mentioned projects are the Major Academic Projects)</p>
<p>6. Cache Efficient Algorithms (Done as a requirement of Master of Technology degree)</p>
<p>Product Description Cache Efficient Algorithms are those algorithms that perform efficiently on the caches. These algorithms are required because due to the increased difference between the processor and memory speeds, a good overall performance of an algorithm cannot be achieved without its good cache performance. Cache Efficient Algorithms can be characterized into two major sections namely – “Cache Aware Algorithms” and “Cache Oblivious Algorithms”. We define an algorithm to be cache aware if it contains parameters (set at either compile-time or run-time) that can be tuned to optimize the cache complexity for the particular cache size and line length. Otherwise, the algorithm is cache oblivious. My Role: In my thesis, I proposed the designs of “cache efficient single source shortest path algorithm”, “cache efficient all pair shortest path algorithm”, and “cache efficient minimum spanning tree algorithm”. I also implemented the proposed designs and proved that they work efficiently on cache. The proposed design give a better overall performance than the existing Dijkstra’s algorithm for single source shortest paths, Floyd-Warshall algorithm for all pair shortest path, and Kruskal’s and Prim’s algorithms for minimum spanning tree. Environment: Linux, C,</p>
<p>7. Speech Recognition (Done as a requirement of Bachelor of Technology degree)</p>
<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION Speech recognition technologies allow computers (or other type of machine) equipped with a source of sound input, such as a microphone, to interpret human speech. Such systems can be classified as to whether  the system requires the user to “train” it to recognize their own particular speech patterns or not,  the system is trained for one user only or is speaker independent,  the system can recognize continuous speech or requires users to break up their speech into discrete words,  the system is intended for clear speech material, or is designed to operate on distorted transfer channels and possibly background noise or other speaker talking simultaneously,  the vocabulary the system recognizes is small (in the order of tens or at most hundreds of words) or large (thousands of words) My Role: I designed a speech recognition system which was meant for a small vocabulary. The system was speaker independent. Selection of recognition sets was based upon the phonetic distinctiveness of the words in the set. The system was designed under following major steps.  Pre-Filtering: LPC (Linear Predictive Coding) method was used for pre-filtering to prepare the samples; LPC uses a particular function to calculate differences.  Framing / Windowing: In this step sample data was separated into specific sizes, hence prepared the sample boundaries for analysis.  Comparison and Matching: This Step compares the current window with the known samples, there are basically two techniques for it, HMM (Hidden Markov Model) and Template Matching. In the project design Template Matching is used, in this technique error for the word is the sum of the errors for each frame. Environment: Windows 2000, C</p>
<p>In addition of these two academic projects there were other projects done in academics on UNIX, Linux, JAVA, JSP, JDBC, RMI etc.</p>
