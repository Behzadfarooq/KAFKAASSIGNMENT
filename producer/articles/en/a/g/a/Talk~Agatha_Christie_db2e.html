<p>you can force links to work by making any substantial change to the page the link appears on; you don't have to change spaces in the link to underscores. In fact, I avoid changing them to underscores because then the term you do that to doesn't show up in a search. You could instead copyedit or change some minor bit of punctuation; or even add an <i>&amp;nbsp;</i> somewhere in the article. That's html for a space, but the wikiware thinks the change is substantial enough that it quits accessing the cached version without the active links.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/a/Talk%7EAgatha_Christie_db2e.html" title="Edit section: Mrs Oliver">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mrs Oliver</span></h2>
<p>The following came from ../wiki.phtml, which was created by some kind of software bug we had briefly. <a href="../../../k/o/y/User%7EKoyaanis_Qatsi_7ab5.html" title="User:Koyaanis Qatsi">Koyaanis Qatsi</a> --</p>
<p>Despite seemingly replacing Hastings as Poirot's foil only in the later novels, Mrs Oliver was in fact created much earlier.</p>
<p>First seen, albeit very briefly, in 'Parker Pyne Investigates', where she devises plots for false mysteries to amuse bored clients of retired civil servant turned Mr Fix-it, Parker Pyne.</p>
<p>Her first proper appearance comes in 'Cards on the Table' where along with several others, including Poirot, she attempts to investigate the circumstances of the death of the host of a party which she and Poirot attended.</p>
<p>After this novel, it was 16 years before Christie again teamed her up with Poirot in 'Mrs McGinty's Dead', where she plays a peripheral part in the investigation after arriving on the scene as a guest and hitting Poirot with an apple core thrown from her car window!</p>
<p>She also appears in 'Dead Man's Folly' (again creating a murder mystery, but a real murder occurs during the proceedings).</p>
<p>'Pale Horse' (which I have not read) was her next appearance.</p>
<p>She then teams up with Poirot for 'Third Girl', 'Halloween Party' and 'Elephants Can Remember', in all of which she plays an active part in introducing Poirot to the case and in assisting his solution of it.</p>
<p>From the books I have read, Mrs Oliver appears to be a successful crime novelist, having created a Finnish detective beloved by the public. She hates the character and is shy of attention she gets from fans. She is rather overweight, eats large quantities of apples, lives alone in a London flat, tries many different hairstyles and is often vague and absent minded.</p>
<p><a name="Playing_fair_and_love_stories" id="Playing_fair_and_love_stories"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/a/Talk%7EAgatha_Christie_db2e.html" title="Edit section: Playing fair and love stories">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Playing fair and love stories</span></h2>
<p>Maybe I read the books too quickly or beacause I read them in French, but I do not agree that Christie was fair with her readers. Often, very often the detective finds the solution with elements that were not mentioned at all before.</p>
<p>One of the best example is found in Murder on the Orient Express. Before Poirot explains that everybody was somehow connected to the killed baby, we had never heard of this baby before. It is truly frustrating.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would be very surprised it this were the case in the French translation. In my Fontana/Collins English edition of 1974, the full details of the Armstrong kidnapping case are given in chapter seven of section one, there being three sections in total. It is key to all of the exposition. <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJennyRad_a308.html" title="User:JennyRad">JennyRad</a> 13:49, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Another example would be: The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side. Sure we know that the first victim was ill when she met the murderess. But only Miss Marple has heard the name of the disease. Christie never mentions it before the very very end when everyting is told.</p>
<dl>
<dd>True, we don't know the name of the disease, but that would have given the game away completely. We know the victim was ill, and that she had to put makeup on her face to disguise her illness, so I don't think it's beyond guessing. Nowadays it's an even more well-known illness and well-known risk than it was when the story was written. And crucially, it's not the case that Miss Marple knows from the start and it's withheld from the reader - she doesn't know either, she has to make that intuitive leap before she checks it out. Christie's different in that regard from many other mystery writers (Conan Doyle springs to mind), who withhold essential facts before they reveal the solution so that there's no chance of even making an educated guess. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobelia_e9a3.html" title="User:Tobelia">Tobelia</a> 08:09, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>And other examples could be found.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please list them. The only example I can think of is <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Clocks_e089.html" title="The Clocks">The Clocks (novel)</a>, and the detective's method of discovering the evidence is that book's gimmick.--<a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EEllissound_3f9f.html" title="User:Ellissound">Ellissound</a> 01:35, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have read every Agatha Christie novel at least twice (except for one, which I am saving). I agree with Ellissound -<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Clocks_e089.html" title="The Clocks">The Clocks (novel)</a> is the only time when Christie truly pulls the solution out of her hat. Both examples cited above -Murder on the Orient Express and The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side- can be solved by a diligent reader. The Clocks cannot. fshepinc</dd>
</dl>
<p>Another thing could be said about the author: she was romantic! When she could add a love story to her story, she would do it. The examples are countless when Poirot helps a couple to fall in love or when the dark handsome man falls in love for the young rich woman.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This I agree with - several of the novels are thinly-disguised romance novels (<a href="../../../p/a/s/Passenger_to_Frankfurt_0885.html" title="Passenger to Frankfurt">Passenger to Frankfurt</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/s/Destination_Unknown_12b1.html" title="Destination Unknown">Destination Unknown</a>, among others). <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJennyRad_a308.html" title="User:JennyRad">JennyRad</a> 13:49, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A large number of Christie's books have their own pages here on Wikipedia, but a significant proportion of them are classified as "stubs". While I'd be very willing (an able) to expand them with more plot detail, for example, it doesn't seem to me that the pages which are <b>not</b> classified as stubs are actually giving more detail. Consequently I'm hesitant to expend time filling out details which are not what Wikipedia is designed for. I'd appreciate a more experienced Wikipedian advising me on what details would be considered useful and/or interesting to "de-stub" these pages. (E.g. <a href="../../../4/2E/5/4.50_from_Paddington_b85b.html" title="4.50 from Paddington">4.50 from Paddington</a>, which is a stub, as compared to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sittaford_Mystery_3c90.html" title="The Sittaford Mystery">The Sittaford Mystery</a>, which is not.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are no hard and fast rules for what makes a "stub" and what doesn't - the tags are added at editors' whims. It can get a bit arbitrary. So add what material you think is pertinent and valuable and then remove the stub tab. My opinion is that except for a few of her most notable books, such as Murder of Roger Akeroyd (sp?) or Murder on the Orient Express, plot synopsis should be limited to just a couple of paragraphs; concnetrate on other information like whether a movie was made, or shared plot lines/secondary characters with other books.

<p>As a lot of the books were published under alternative titles in the US, I've added a bunch of US titles to the list of works, using what seems to be the standard format "(also known as <i>X</i>)". I've also amended one of them (Taken at the Flood) so that the UK title comes first, for consistency.

<p>I am not convinced 'William Shakespeare' is a genre of literature.

<p>I think it ought to be changed to "Agatha Christie is one of the world's best-known mystery writer....... and apart from Shakespear and J K Rowling, all-time best-selling author of any genre?".

<p>I've just changed "fiction" to "books", as the wording previously implied that Shakespeare did not write fiction, which term very definitely applies to a large fraction of his work, whereas the latter is clearer, as Shakespeare wrote plays and poems rather than books. <a href="../../../o/u/_/User%7EOu_tis_fba0.html" title="User:Ou tis">Ou tis</a> 02:27, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"In 1930, Christie married (despite her divorce) a Roman Catholic . . ."</p>
<p>Christie's divorce is what changed her marital status from married to single, so her divorce would in fact be a necessary prerequisite to her remarriage, not an impediment as the sentence implies. If the contributor who added that information is trying to indicate that Christie herself, Mallowan himself, Christie's family, Mallowan's family, the Catholic Church or the press/public had a specific problem with Christie marrying a Roman Catholic because of her divorce, then those objections need to be elucidated. If the contributor is just adding it to say that, in general, the Roman Catholic Church doesn't recognise divorce and doesn't allow its members to remarry after divorce, then it's <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> and also, in the absence of it actually causing Christie a material problem, pretty much irrelevant. <a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBinabik80_d67b.html" title="User:Binabik80">Binabik80</a> 14:26, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>actually, it has nothing to do with her and all with him. it's his church that doesn't recognize intermarriage and divorcees getting married. to be married in the catholic church is far different than the legal kind. a marriage to them must be to another catholic and it is forever, barring the rare annulment. i have a feeling they did not have a religious marriage, in that case the parentheses are pointless.</dd>

<p>Can anyone provide justification for the claim that a character in Anthony Berkeley's "The Poisoned Chocolates Case" is based on Christie?

<p>I find the reason "she's a writer, not a narrative" cited by Chcknwnm insufficient justification for removing the spoiler tag. The following paragraph does contain spoilers which would not be expected by all readers. I have therefore reinstated the spoiler tag. My gut feeling is that Chcknwnm removed the tag based on a personal dislike of spoiler tags similar to that of <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanes_Why_tags_are_evil_60cb.html" title="User:Shanes/Why tags are evil">Shanes</a>.

<p>Many modern sources charge Agatha Christie with blatant anti-semitism and racism. Several of her novels have very strong anti-semitic comments (one example is Lord Edgware Dies), and the original title of And Then There Were None, Ten Little Niggers, has been the subject of much debate. I am surprised that this issue is not addressed in the main entry for Christie. Fshepinc 05:33, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps because similar charges can be made against most western authors of the same period. (They can, in fact, also be made against many non-western authors of the same period - we humans are a nasty lot - but English speakers rarely read those, so we don't know.) Compared to her contemporaries, Christie was extremely mild in this area. - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidWBrooks_491e.html" title="User:DavidWBrooks">DavidWBrooks</a> 11:28, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, few - if any - other writers wrote anything like 'Racial Musings', an ode against miscegenation published in Poems.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The "anti-semitism" is usually in the form of references to "a touch of the Levant", oily hair, noses, etc., with the clear implication that these characters might well be Syrians or Lebanese or Turkish, and not just Jewish. "Ten Little Niggers" was the nursery rhyme that most of us learned as "Ten Little Indians", but since the Brits of that era considered people from India to be "niggers", the reference is racist, but not aimed at black people from Africa. Just a little context. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrtolan88_d8ce.html" title="User:Ortolan88">Ortolan88</a> 20:50, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Though I find the title "Ten Little Niggers" thoroughly objectionable, and it unpleasantly reflects the racism of the period, in itself it doesn't tell us anything specific about Christie's own racism. It's one of many examples of Christie using a well-known nursery rhyme of the time (like One, Two, Buckle My Shoe etc) to frame her story, rather than a comment about ethnicity - particularly since there are no black people (or indeed Indians) in the plot.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>'Racial Musings' indeed sounds like quite another matter. I've never come across it either - probably the reason it's not mentioned is that nobody's heard of it.

<p>I counted 66 novels in the works list in this very article, not 80. If you include the co-authored works, it comes to 69. Still far from 80. So where did 80 come from? Combining novels, co-authored works and short story collections makes it 90. So which do you want? I edited it to 66.
