<p>Nothing is known of her early life, and what speculation has appeared is inextricably linked to the contentious issue of Agatha's paternity, one of the unresolved questions of medieval <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genealogy.html" title="Genealogy">genealogy</a>.

<p>Agatha's origin is alluded to in numerous surviving medieval sources, but the information they provide is sometimes imprecise, often contradictory, and occasionally outright impossible. The earliest surviving source, the <i><a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle_2487.html" title="Anglo-Saxon Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a></i>, along with <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florence_of_Worcester_9895.html" title="Florence of Worcester">Florence of Worcester</a>'s <i>Chronicon ex chronicis</i> and <i>Regalis prosapia Anglorum</i>, <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simeon_of_Durham_cb24.html" title="Simeon of Durham">Simeon of Durham</a> and <a href="../../../a/i/l/Ailred_of_Rievaulx_d201.html" title="Ailred of Rievaulx">Ailred of Rievaulx</a> describe Agatha as a kinswoman of "Emperor Henry" (<i>thaes ceseres maga</i>, <i>filia germani imperatoris Henrici</i>). In an earlier entry, the same Ailred of Rievaulx had called her daughter of emperor Henry, as do later sources of dubious credibility such as the <i><a href="../../../c/h/r/Chronicle_of_Melrose_a14f.html" title="Chronicle of Melrose">Chronicle of Melrose Abbey</a></i>, while <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_of_Paris_c2a2.html" title="Matthew of Paris">Matthew of Paris</a> calls her the emperor's sister (<i>soror Henrici imperatoris Romani</i>). <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_Gaimar_9f23.html" title="Geoffrey Gaimar">Geoffrey Gaimar</a> in <i>Lestoire des Engles</i> states that she was daughter of the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_Hungary_7965.html" title="King of Hungary">Hungarian king and queen</a> (<i>Li reis sa fille</i>), although he places the marriage at a time when Edward is thought still to have been in <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kievan_Rus%27_1194.html" title="Kievan Rus'">Kiev</a>, while <a href="../../../o/r/d/Orderic_Vitalis_1de7.html" title="Orderic Vitalis">Orderic Vitalis</a> in <i>Historiae Ecclesiasticae</i> is more specific, naming her father as king <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solomon_of_Hungary_b692.html" title="Solomon of Hungary">Solomon</a> (<i>filiam Salomonis Regis Hunorum</i>), actually a contemporary of Agatha's children. <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_of_Malmesbury_3b75.html" title="William of Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a> in <i>De Gestis Regis Anglorum</i> states that Agatha's sister was a Queen of Hungary (<i>reginae sororem</i>) and is echoed in this by <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberic_of_Trois-Fontaines_3372.html" title="Alberic of Trois-Fontaines">Alberic of Trois-Fontaines</a>, while less precisely, Ailred says of Margaret that she was derived from English and Hungarian royal blood (<i>de semine regio Anglorum et Hungariorum extitit oriunda</i>). Finally, <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_of_Howden_6bca.html" title="Roger of Howden">Roger of Howden</a> and the anonymous <i>Leges Edwardi Confessoris</i> indicate that while Edward was a guest of Kievan "king Malesclodus" he married a woman of noble birth (<i>nobili progenio</i>), <i>Leges</i> adding that the mother of St. Margaret was of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rus%27_%28people%29.html" title="Rus' (people)">Russian</a> royal blood (<i>ex genere et sanguine regum <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugians.html" title="Rugians">Rugorum</a></i>).<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/a/Agatha%2C_wife_of_Edward_the_Exile_84c9.html" title="Edit section: German theories">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">German theories</span></h2>
<p>While various sources repeat the claims that Agatha was daughter or sister of either Emperor Henry, it seems unlikely that such a sibling or daughter would have been ignored by the German chroniclers.</p>
<p>The description of Agatha as a blood relative of "Emperor Henry" may be applicable to a niece of either <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_II%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor_f235.html" title="Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor">Henry II</a> or <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_III%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor_aa09.html" title="Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor">Henry III</a>, Holy Roman Emperors (although Florence, in <i>Regalis prosapia Anglorum</i> specifies Henry III). Early attempts at reconstructing the relationship focussed on the former. Georgio Pray (1764, <i>Annales Regum Hungariae</i>), O.F. Suhm (1777, <i>Geschichte Dänmarks, Norwegen und Holsteins</i>) and Istvan Katona (1779, <i>Historia Critica Regum Hungariae</i>) each suggested that Agatha was daughter of Henry II's brother <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruno_of_Augsburg_ffab.html" title="Bruno of Augsburg">Bruno of Augsburg</a> (an ecclesiastic described as <i>beatae memoriae</i>, with no known issue), while Daniel Cornides (1778, <i>Regum Hungariae</i>) tried to harmonize the German and Hungarian claims, making Agatha daughter of Henry II's sister <a href="../../../g/i/s/Giselle_of_Bavaria_6d4f.html" title="Giselle of Bavaria">Giselle of Bavaria</a>, wife of <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_I_of_Hungary_ee6e.html" title="Stephen I of Hungary">Stephen I of Hungary</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> This solution remained popular among scholars through a good part of 20th century.</p>
<p>Although it's tempting to view St. Margaret as a granddaughter of another famous saint, Stephen of Hungary, this popular solution fails to explain why Stephen's death triggered a dynastic crisis in Hungary. If St. Stephen and Giselle were indeed Agatha's parents, her offspring should have succeeded to the Hungarian crown and the dynastic strife could have been averted. Actually, there is no indication in Hungarian sources that any of Stephen's children outlived him. Likewise, all of the solutions involving Henry II would seem to make Agatha much older than her husband, and prohibitively old at the time of the birth of her son, Edgar.</p>
<p>Based on a more strict translation of the Latin description used by Florence and others as well as the supposition that <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_III%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor_aa09.html" title="Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor">Henry III</a> was the Emperor designated in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, genealogist Szabolcs de Vajay popularized another idea first suggested in 1939.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>. He <i>hypothesized</i> that Agatha was the daughter of Henry III's elder (uterine) half-brother, Liudolf, Margrave of West Friesland. This did require a reevaluation of the chronology of the marriages and children of <a href="../../../g/i/s/Gisela_of_Swabia_f42a.html" title="Gisela of Swabia">Gisela of Swabia</a>, mother of both Henry III and Liudolf. The theory was largely accepted for thirty years until René Jetté proposed a <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kievan_Rus%27_1194.html" title="Kievan Rus'">Kievan</a> solution to the problem,<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> since which time opinion has been divided among several competing possibilities. A Scottish genealogist and antiquarian, Gregory Lauder-Frost, summarised numerous early sources and the various theories <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> but discounts de Vajay's theories and leans towards the HRE ancestry.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/a/Agatha%2C_wife_of_Edward_the_Exile_84c9.html" title="Edit section: Kievan theory">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Kievan theory</span></h2>
<p>Jetté pointed out that <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_of_Malmesbury_3b75.html" title="William of Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a> in <i>De Gestis Regis Anglorum</i> and several later chronicles unambigously state that Agatha's sister was a Queen of Hungary. From what we know about the biography of <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_the_Exile_3fbf.html" title="Edward the Exile">Edward the Exile</a>, he loyally supported <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_I_of_Hungary_1f67.html" title="Andrew I of Hungary">Andrew I of Hungary</a>, following him from <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kiev.html" title="Kiev">Kiev</a> to Hungary in <a href="../../../1/0/4/1046.html" title="1046">1046</a> and staying at his court for many years. Andrew's wife and queen was Anastasia, a daughter of <a href="../../../y/a/r/Yaroslav_the_Wise_ed7f.html" title="Yaroslav the Wise">Yaroslav the Wise</a> of <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kiev.html" title="Kiev">Kiev</a> by <a href="../../../i/n/g/Ingegerd_Olofsdotter_635f.html" title="Ingegerd Olofsdotter">Ingigerd of Sweden</a>. Following Jetté's logic, Edward's wife was another daughter of Yaroslav.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>This theory accords with the seemingly incongruous statements of <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_Gaimar_9f23.html" title="Geoffrey Gaimar">Geoffrey Gaimar</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_of_Howden_6bca.html" title="Roger of Howden">Roger of Howden</a> that, while living in Kiev, Edward took a nativeborn wife "of noble parentage" or that his father-in-law was a "<a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russian</a> king".<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jetté's theory seems to be supported by an <a href="../../../o/n/o/Onomastic.html" title="Onomastic">onomastic</a> argument.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> Among the medieval royalty, Agatha's rare <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a> name is first recorded in the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian_dynasty.html" title="Macedonian dynasty">Macedonian dynasty</a> of <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_Empire_38f2.html" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantium</a>; it was also one of the most frequent feminine names in the Kievan <a href="../../../r/u/r/Rurikid.html" title="Rurikid">Rurikid</a> dynasty.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> After <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_life_and_children_of_Vladimir_I_a6ad.html" title="Family life and children of Vladimir I">Anna of Byzantium</a> married Yaroslav's father, he took the Christian name of the reigning emperor, <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basil_II_6250.html" title="Basil II">Basil II</a>, while some members of his family were named after other members of the imperial dynasty. Agatha could have been one of these.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>The names of Agatha's immediate descendants — Margaret, Cristina, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_I_of_Scotland_9be5.html" title="David I of Scotland">David</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_I_of_Scotland_0ee5.html" title="Alexander I of Scotland">Alexander</a> — were likewise extraordinary for Anglo-Saxon Britain. They may provide a clue to Agatha's origin. The names Margaret and Cristina are today associated with Sweden, the native country of Yaroslav's wife Ingigerd.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> The name of Margaret's son, David, obviously echoes that of <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solomon_of_Hungary_b692.html" title="Solomon of Hungary">Solomon</a>, the son and heir of Andrew I.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup> Furthermore, the first Russian saint (canonized ca. 1073) was Yaroslav's brother <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_and_Gleb_edfa.html" title="Boris and Gleb">Gleb</a>, whose Christian name was David.</p>
<p>The name of Margaret's other son, Alexander, may point to a variety of traditions, both occidental and oriental: the biography of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> was one of the most popular books in 11th-century Kiev.</p>
<p>One inference from the Kievan theory is that Edgar Atheling and St. Margaret were, through their mother, first cousins of <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_I_of_France_cb1b.html" title="Philip I of France">Philip I of France</a>. The connection is too notable to be omitted from contemporary sources, yet we have no indication that medieval chroniclers were aware of it. The argumentum ex silentio lead critics of the Kievan theory to search for alternative explanations.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/a/Agatha%2C_wife_of_Edward_the_Exile_84c9.html" title="Edit section: Bulgarian theory">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bulgarian theory</span></h2>
<p>One of the latest theories was proposed by Ian Mladjov.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> Dismissing the Kievan theory as insufficiently grounded, he infers that Agatha was daughter of <a href="../../../g/a/v/Gavril_Radomir_e245.html" title="Gavril Radomir">Gavril Radomir</a>, Tsar of <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgaria.html" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> by his first wife, a Hungarian princess, the daughter of Duke <a href="../../../g/e/z/Geza_of_Hungary_8c1e.html" title="Geza of Hungary">Géza of Hungary</a>. This hypothesis has Agatha born in Hungary after her parents divorced, her mother being pregnant when she left Bulgaria, as indicated in Byzantine sources. The argument is based primarily on the onomastic precedent provided by the fact that Gavril Radomir's own mother was also named Agatha<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup>, and it vindicates the intimate connection between Agatha and Hungary attested in the Medieval sources.</p>
<p>The article reviews the sources, the Hungarian, German, and Kievan theories for Agatha's antecedents, and looks into the contemporary onomastic repertoire, concluding that of the few contemporary Agathas, only Gavril Radomir's mother could possibly have been an ancestor of the wife of Edward the Exile. Some of the other names associated with Agatha and used to corroborate theories based in onomastics are also readily available within the Bulgarian ruling family at the time, including Mary and several Davids. Another aspect of the study is to draw attention to genealogical improbabilities posed by several marriages within the prohibited degrees of kinship, as posited by earlier theories (especially the German and Kievan ones, including the French marriage of <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_of_Kiev_02f4.html" title="Anne of Kiev">Anne of Kiev</a>). The article also re-examines some long-standing assumptions about the chronology of Gavril Radomir's marriage to the Hungarian princess, and concludes that its dating to the late 980s is unsupportable, and its dissolution belongs in c. 1009–1014.</p>
<p>This corrected chronology, the clear onomastic precedent, and the lack of problematic genealogical relationships would allow Agatha's identification as the daughter of <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_I_of_Hungary_ee6e.html" title="Stephen I of Hungary">Saint Stephen</a>'s sister, raised at the Hungarian court, and married (possibly while in exile in Kievan Rus') to Edward the Exile. It is inferred that the relative familiarity with Germany and unfamiliarity with Hungary partly distorted the depiction of Agatha in the English sources; her actual position would have been that of a daughter of the (unnamed) sister of the King of Hungary (Stephen I), himself the brother-in-law of the Holy Roman Emperor (Henry II, and therefore kinsman of Henry III).</p>

He indicates several possible sources (e.g. the marriages of Emperors <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_the_Blind_dabe.html" title="Louis the Blind">Louis the Blind</a> and <a href="../../../o/t/t/Otto_II%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor_dce5.html" title="Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor">Otto II</a> to Byzantine brides, as well as that of <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimir_I_01f3.html" title="Vladimir I">Vladimir I</a> of Kiev) for the use of these names.</li>

<li id="_note-8"><b><a href="#_ref-8" title="">^</a></b> According to one theory, Agatha was not a daughter but sister of Yaroslav. Indeed, the last wife of Yaroslav's father, <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimir_I_01f3.html" title="Vladimir I">Vladimir I</a>, seems to have been a German princess, who could have been described as "filia germani imperatoris Henrici". It is generally accepted that their daughter Dobronega married <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casimir_I_of_Poland_ac01.html" title="Casimir I of Poland">Casimir I of Poland</a> about the same year when Edward is thought to have married Agatha (judging by the date when their eldest child was born). If Agatha was Yaroslav's sister (rather than daughter as Jette thought), she would still have close ties to the Hungarian royal family. For instance, one of Yaroslav's sisters was the wife of Ladislas the Bald, a paternal uncle of Andrew I.</li>
<li id="_note-9"><b><a href="#_ref-9" title="">^</a></b> It has been argued that Ingigerd's original Christian name was Margaret. Whatever the truth, the names Margaret and Cristina were not explicitly recorded in Sweden before the 12th century. For details, see: Ф.Б. Успенский. Скандинавы - Варяги - Русь: Историко-филологические очерки. Moscow, 2002. Pages 60-61.</li>
<li id="_note-10"><b><a href="#_ref-10" title="">^</a></b> Andrew's second son was actually named David. Current scholarship traces these names to the famous oration of <a href="../../../i/l/a/Ilarion.html" title="Ilarion">Ilarion</a> of Kiev, in which he likened Vladimir (i.e., grandfather of Andrew's wife) to the victorious David and Yaroslav (i.e., Andrew's father-in-law) to the wise Solomon. The comparison became so popular that later historians assigned to Yaroslav the sobriquet "Wise".</li>
