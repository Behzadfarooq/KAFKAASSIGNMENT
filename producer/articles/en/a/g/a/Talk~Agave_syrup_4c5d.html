<p>Anybody want to say what the constituents (sugars &amp; sweet tasting substances in particular). I had a bit of look around on the web but the suggestion seems to be that some are adulterated with sugars not naturally found in agave. Is there an expert who can write some info on this. I ask for this in particular reference to diabetic and low GI/GL diets. 212.32.87.199 13:48, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This article is full of nonsense (come on, "insulin is not needed to break it down"???), almost certainly due to the "facts" being derived in part or in whole from commercial websites whose primary purpose is to <i>sell</i> the product. It needs a major overhaul and links or references that inspire more confidence. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 18:19, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A scan of Lexis-Nexis shows a few articles that mention this product, but so far none in depth. Similarly, a Google search unfortunately shows that the pages describing the syrup are primarily those producing, distributing, or marketing it. The important thing is that the harvesting and production, and photographs showing the various types (light, dark, etc.) be shown, and thus the sales sites can't be avoided; that is why I looked for ones that had a lot of detailed information about the production, the plant from which it's made, etc. On the other hand, the person who keeps adding the "volcanic nectar" site throughout the article, at the top of all other links, etc. seems to be doing it primarily to promote that particular product. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 18:28, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And why shouldn't he? Having other commercial links in the article just invites such additions. He just wants to get in on the free publicity that his competitors are getting. It's one of the reasons why I believe it's a bad idea to have links to commercial websites in an article in the first place, and why I strongly disagree with the suggestion that that having commercial links is better than having no links at all. In fact, I believe that such links are the <i>worst</i> possible kind to have in an article because they have no incentive to be NPOV or even truthful. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 21:44, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you look at the different types of agave nectar sold in the U.S. it's no wonder that company Volcanic Nectar keeps putting links on the site. I've been to Mexico and have visited the different facilities manufacturing the agave and I've seen what is going on down there. All of the brands you see sold here in the U.S. are being labeled in the same 2 facilities other than the Volcanic Nectar brand. The labels for the different brands were being put on the same agave in different bottles. Each label seems to say different things too. They vary from calories to carbs and from raw to standard. This industry really needs to be cleaned up because it appears that our friends south of the border are just out to make a buck.</dd>

<dd>As for the shortage in agave... not so. There are thousands of acres in Mexico of this stuff. Where do all of the shortage rumors come from? The major tequila manufacturers. They are trying to declare shortages of agave to the world so they can keep increasing the price of their tequila. With the introduction of agave as a sweetener, they are starting to lose their grip. We saw dying farms because they can't sell their agave fast enough. Mexico better clean up the monopoly or there might really be a shortage some day. --<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.41.189.17 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.41.189.17_48f5.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.41.189.17">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<p>I'll admit, I'm not very computer savy. I thought I had done something wrong when I came back to the site and saw them removed. I thought you were referring to someone from their company adding the links. Who is the one removing mine? Would it be better for them to add the links? I can send them an e-mail to see if they want to add a link. I just thought it would be a good idea since Wikipedia was so high on the search engines for the word agave. If there is a better way or if I'm doing something wrong, let me know.</p>
<p>I contacted Volcanic Nectar and told them they should have an expert make a change on the Agave Syrup page with correct information. For example it says something silly like "the best agave for you is high in fructose." What sense does that make? At what point did more sugar equal healthy? Who wrote that? Anyway, they sent me an e-mail saying they corrected some of the information. When I checked today, I see it has been erased and the old incorrect information has been added back in. Any idea why Badagnani? --<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.41.189.17 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.41.189.17_48f5.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.41.189.17">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p><i>The best agave syrup for your body must be low in fructose (less than 50%), low in glucose and cannot contain any other sugars.</i> How can the best agave syrup be both low in fructose and glucose if these are both their main constituents? Also, if fructose is less than 50% that means glucose will be near 50%. Given that it is fructose that has a low glycemic index compared to sucrose and glucose, how its percentage being low and glucose relative high be "best" for your body?

<p>A brief look at the history will show why this page is protected. Discussion is required to resolve this issue.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> created this page, and it included wholesale quotes from commercial sites engaged in marketing agave syrup, together with links to the homepages of these sites. One of these homepages was devoid of factual information, but the justification for including it was apparently the (not NPOV) information buried deeper in the site and lifted for inclusion. Furthermore, there was a paragraph of unsubstantiated assertion denigrating two producers, to the benefit of a third.</p>
<p>My initial intervention was prompted by these unsubstantiated commercial comparisons. Subsequent reversion led me to question the NPOV status of the entire article and the spam status of the commercial links. I have tried to improve this article, and have been frustrated by constant revertion ("justified" by irrelevant or false assertions in the edit log). <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Fourman_cf64.html" title="User:Michael Fourman">Michael Fourman</a> 21:37, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Who is editor Bagdani? The two links presented for users to further their knowledge about the production of agave syrup (which are actually used as sources for much of the information in this article), though commercial, are the best links on the Internet as far as a complete description of the production process, region, etc. This discussion should have taken place before the editor blanked them in the presumed aim of "improving" the article. Reversion ("constant," at that) did take place on the parts of no fewer than two editors, including the one writing above. However, reasoned discussion usually does lead to reasonable results, often involving compromise. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 21:43, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I haven't been actively involved in editing this article, but I and several other editors have tried to remove the commercial links. Each time they have been re-added by Badagnani, with the exception of the Volcanic Nectar link, which another editor keeps re-adding. I have already explained above why I think such links are a bad idea and have no place in a Wikipedia article. It's my opinion that this article should be stripped more or less to a stub unless better references can be found. I am very much in favor of providing less information rather than more, if that information is unsubstantiated, unverifiable, and suspect. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 02:11, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I don't support deleting it from the article, though the editor "protecting" the article seems to have chosen carefully to do so at the moment the links were gone, rather than still there. The article, after all, is primarily about a modern consumer product and thus the link is quite appropriate in describing that product, as well as something about its history and production. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 02:16, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

My offer to stub out pending consensus is still open. Why not just stick to using the noncommercial links as sources?

<dd>If the links are to remain in the article, then at the very least they should be labeled as "commercial links" or "commercial sources" rather than as "external links" and certainly not as references.

There is no reason that agave syrup should have a more extensive article than that.

<dd>MrDarwin, there is no intrinsic problem with WP having commercial links, and no policy against commercial links that offer some kind of valuable information not already in WP. For instance, if a commercial site had a section with a detailed walkthrough of their processing facility, including pictures, and description of how it all works, I would consider that a perfect external link. If it's free advertising for them, well that's a very nice <i>quid pro quo</i> that encourages other commercial sites to provide more factual information on their sites. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 20:58, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To take the specific example of the ELF link above, about the only thing of value to us is the half-dozen sentences describing their process - they supply interesting details like temperatures and times. It's really borderline as to whether it's worth making an external link for that alone. From a bit of Googling I note that two different websites use the exact same process description, which makes me wonder who's copying whom, and maybe that the real source of the process description is only in printed form, not online at all, and has been typed in without attribution. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 21:10, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, we now know that agave sap in its natural state was called <i>aguamiel</i> in Spanish. An English translation of the Spanish Wikipedia article on aguamiel ( <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aguamiel" class="external free" title="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aguamiel" rel="nofollow">http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aguamiel</a> ):</p>

<dd>Aguamiel (translated as "Mead") is the sap that is contained in the heart of plants known like magueys; pertaining to the family of the agaves, specially of the pulqueros magueyes. The <i>aguamiel</i> is the basic material from which <i><a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulque.html" title="Pulque">pulque</a></i> is made, a spirit of pre-Hispanic origin that is still consumed in the states of central Mexico. Numerous properties of that country experienced a bonanza derived from the culture of the magueys for the extraction of <i>aguamiel</i>, although as of the 1930s, the <i>aguamiel</i> was displaced by the masificación in beer consumption. In order to extract the <i>aguamiel</i> it is necessary to hope to that the maguey matures approximately by eight years. The heart of the succulent one is drilled with a knife, and the <i>tlachiquero</i> -- the person dedicated to the extraction of the <i>aguamiel</i> -- introduces his acocote -- a bule of form extended -- in the orifice, from which <i>aguamiel</i> flows. In some regions of Mexico, the <i>aguamiel</i> is a drink of daily consumption, specially in the regions of the semi-empty <i>hidalguense</i> and <i>potosino</i>. It contains great amounts of sugars and proteins. Also one is used in the bread elaboration and other culinary creations to him of the settlers of the Mexican High plateau.</dd>

<dd>If aguamiel is indeed drunk as a beverage in Mexico, is it produced in the same way, and the same viscosity as what is sold in the U.S. as agave syrup/nectar? I couldn't imagine drinking an undiluted, syrupy liquid such as agave syrup. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 08:16, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From the Spanish Wikipedia article on Mayáhuel, who was apparently the goddess of the agave, and agave beverages:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Mayáhuel was the Mexican goddess of the maguey, and by extension, of the embriaguez. She is one of the deities related to the Earth, and in that sense, she is hermanada with others like Tonantzin (mother of the Gods), Cihuacóatl (the pattern of the women died in the childbirth) and Tlazoltéotl (the hungry lady of inmundicias, that so are the meaning of its name). In tatno that divinity of the vegetal world, is also a goddess of the fertility. For that reason, it shares attributes with Xilonen and Ilamatecuhtli, patterns of the maize; and with Chicomecóatl, Seven lady Serpent and patron of the maintenances (also Earth goddess). Mayáhuel was represented like a young person with the body painted of blue that was shown by one penca of maguey. Their attributes were the double cord in one of the hands, malacate of cotton without spinning, and the yellow spots in their face. Some times she was represented with a nariguera of jade and loading one vasija of mud. All these attributes share them with other divinities like the indicated Tlazoltéotl, and specially with Chalchiuhtlicue, the pattern of terrestrial waters. Like these two divinities, Mayáhuel was sign of the bad luck. That one that it was born in a day related to this goddess, insurance would have to finish badly: malacate of cotton and the two cords mean adultery and perdición, derived in cosmogonía mexica with the embriaguez. The husband of the goddess of the maguey was Patécatl, that designated in náhuatl some grass that added itself to the mead of the agave to produce pulque. Their children were the Centzon Totochtzin, or the Four hundred and Countless Rabbits, which he nursed (with pulque, of course) through the many chests that supposedly he had. [ to publish ] Legend of the creation of the maguey In principle Mayáhuel was a beautiful young person who lived with his grandmother, a Tzintzimitl stars that to try to prevent that it leaves the sun. In an occasion, Quetzalcóatl it convinced it so that it lowered to the Earth to love itself turned the branches of a branched off tree. But when her grandmother awoke and not vió to Mayáhuel, it called to other Tzintzimitlis so that they lowered to the Earth to help to look for him its granddaughter. When they approached the tree separated in two, then the grandmother, discovering to her granddaughter like a branch, breaks and leaves it the rest so that she devours another Tzintzimitl. Nevertheless the branch which Quetzacóatl had become remained intact. When the rest of the young virgin moved away to Quetzacóatl volume and it buried them. Of it it brought forth the plant of the maguey, of which pulque is extracted, used in the ceremonies like ritual drink and offering for the Gods. Thus, after its death, Mayáhuel became goddess.</dd>
