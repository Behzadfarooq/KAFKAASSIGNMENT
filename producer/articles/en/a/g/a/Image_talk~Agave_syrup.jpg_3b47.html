	    <p>1. This is a promotional image and such a tag is clearly allowed on Wikipedia; 2. This form of repeated delete trolling is extremely damaging and harmful to Wikipedia and its educational purpose; 3. The company from whose website the image comes has not complained and most likely will not complain about this use of this photo; 4. There are other, more pressing issues facing Wikipedia at this moment; 5. Not every editor can afford a digital camera; 6. This editor needs to cease what appears to be a vendetta against another editor strictly for the purpose of trying to teach another editor "a lesson" that is not improving Wikipedia one iota, and create his/her own content, enriching, rather than depleting Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 19:18, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To respond to several of these points: First, note that the "promotional" tag specifically states that the image must not be replaceable. Wikipedia does not accept all promotional images, only those that meet our fair use criteria. Note, moreover, that those criteria are devoted not only to the goal of avoiding legal trouble, but also to that of maximizing the amount of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_as_in_freedom.html" title="Free as in freedom">free</a> content we produce. While the image may not be right-this-moment replaceable, or replaceable by one particular editor, it is possible that someone could take and upload a free photo for this purpose.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To your accusation of a vendetta; I assure you that this is not the case. The fair use policy is being enforced more actively now than it has been in the past, and while many good-faith editors who had gotten the impression that certain types of images which were not permitted are permitted have been upset by this change, the policy is being enforced in good faith, and in pursuit of the goal of increasing the amount of free content we produce, one of the <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">five pillars of Wikipedia</a>.

<dl>
<dd>Although it was Quadell that tagged this image, I assume your "vendetta" comment was directed at me, since I have tagged several more of yours. If that is the case, please look at my edit history. It may appear that I am singling your images out, but in fact I've tagged literally hundreds, so it's only the law of averages that has made me hit a few of yours. —<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowbok_9a99.html" title="User:Chowbok"><span style="background:black; color:white; font-weight: bold;">Chowbok</span></a> <a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChowbok_a1df.html" title="User talk:Chowbok"><span style="background:white; color:black;">☠</span></a> 23:59, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>P.S. The argument that "Wikipedia should allow a copyrighted image because I can't afford a digital camera" seems rather akin to "Wikipedia should allow copyrighted text because my English writing skills are poor". FWIW, any drug store will make digital images from film. Heck, if you send me printed pictures, I'll scan them for you and upload them. Let me know if you want my address. —<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowbok_9a99.html" title="User:Chowbok"><span style="background:black; color:white; font-weight: bold;">Chowbok</span></a> <a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChowbok_a1df.html" title="User talk:Chowbok"><span style="background:white; color:black;">☠</span></a> 00:07, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>2. I understand your desires to reduce the amount of copyrighted images on Wikipedia, but keep in mind that just because you took an image with your own camera does not mean it is not copyrighted. There are actually buildings out there that you've not allowed to take photographs of because the 'copyright holder' says no - IIRC. In any case, my point is that if you take a picture with the <i>Agave syrup</i> bottles prominently displayed it will still be just as 'copyrighted' as if the company in question took the image themselves (which I believe is the case here).</p>
<p>Note that I've never read up any copyright laws – which makes me practically an expert.--<a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnss123_0498.html" title="User:Anss123">Anss123</a> 16:53, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That is absolutely not true, at least in the United States (which is the relevant jurisdiction for Wikipedia). The only buildings you aren't allowed to take pictures of are a handful of military and intelligence structures, and that's for security reasons, not copyright. You also can take photos of commercial products and do what you like with them. You think the Coca-Cola company owns the copyright to every photo ever taken of a family barbeque? —<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowbok_9a99.html" title="User:Chowbok"><span style="background:black; color:white; font-weight: bold;">Chowbok</span></a> <a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChowbok_a1df.html" title="User talk:Chowbok"><span style="background:white; color:black;">☠</span></a> 18:49, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Indeed. Why, for instance, can companies get sued over using, say, a coke bottle in a movie? (This has happened with other products IIRC) In the case of the building (not sure if it was in the USA but it was discussed here on Wikipedia somewhere...) there was some rule stating that if the building took up more than X percent of the image they had copyright on it.--<a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnss123_0498.html" title="User:Anss123">Anss123</a> 18:56, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry, but you're simply wrong. Please see <a href="http://www.krages.com/phoright.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.krages.com/phoright.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. —<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowbok_9a99.html" title="User:Chowbok"><span style="background:black; color:white; font-weight: bold;">Chowbok</span></a> <a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChowbok_a1df.html" title="User talk:Chowbok"><span style="background:white; color:black;">☠</span></a> 19:03, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>To give a better example of what I mean. Say you take a family photo, and a magazine just happens to lie face up on a table. Who own the copyright of the resulting image? What if you ignored the family (cut them away with MS Paint or some such) so that you end up with the Magazine cover only, who has the copyright now? I'm honestly not sure.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Assuming the magazine is of a Marvel comic, and that marvel have a photograph of the same front cover on their homepage. What legal difference is there to uploading your image, or Marvel's image to Wikipedia - assuming you release whatever copyrights your holding? Surly Marvel retains all copyright for their magazine cover?--<a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnss123_0498.html" title="User:Anss123">Anss123</a> 19:16, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>We're getting a bit far afield here. The point is that Wikipedia currently considers photos taken of commercial products to be copyrighted by the photographer. If you think this is a mistake, then please start a discussion at <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMedia_copyright_questions_04f1.html" title="Wikipedia:Media copyright questions">Wikipedia:Media copyright questions</a>. —<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowbok_9a99.html" title="User:Chowbok"><span style="background:black; color:white; font-weight: bold;">Chowbok</span></a> <a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChowbok_a1df.html" title="User talk:Chowbok"><span style="background:white; color:black;">☠</span></a> 19:41, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Okay, I'll post the question there - but - are you saying that I can photograph a book and claim copyright? I somehow doubt that "You also can take photos of commercial products and do what you like with them".--<a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnss123_0498.html" title="User:Anss123">Anss123</a> 20:07, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Let's distinguish between photos of commercially distributed creative works and photos of ordinary commercial products. If I just take a picture of a copyrighted book cover, distributing that picture would infringe the cover artist's copyright. If I take a picture of a glass bottle of syrup, no copyright is being infringed. Thus, free images of commercial products that are not creative works can be created. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobth_3967.html" title="User:Robth">Robth</a><sup><a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobth_e82d.html" title="User talk:Robth">Talk</a></sup> 06:40, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
