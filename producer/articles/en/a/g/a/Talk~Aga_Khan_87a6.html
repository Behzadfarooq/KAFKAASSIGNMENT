<p>This article is pretty one-sided, really, and seems to have been written to promote the Agas Khan. The absence of Prince Aly Khan was particularly surprising: I have added a very brief explanation of his situation and a link to his article. Obviously it is not necessary to go on about him or his scandals at length here, but it is relevant to mention that the succession was changed to avoid his becoming Aga Khan IV. This fact is constitutionally important with regard to the Aga Khan's role as well as being indicative of the social and cultural history of the position. -- <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinaSparkle_3b36.html" title="User:TinaSparkle">TinaSparkle</a> 14:10, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am curious why there is no discussion of Hasan bin Sabah (or Hassan as-Sabba or <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasan-i_Sabbah_3e9a.html" title="Hasan-i Sabbah">Hasan-i_Sabbah</a>) and the order of the Hashishin on this page?</p>
<p>I do see some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&amp;search=Nizari+Ismaili&amp;fulltext=Search" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&amp;search=Nizari+Ismaili&amp;fulltext=Search" rel="nofollow">linkage</a> to pages on the Ismaili branch of Islam, (Nizari Ismaili), but no real discussion of the connection.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/a/Talk%7EAga_Khan_87a6.html" title="Edit section: Aga Khan Disambiguation page needed">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aga Khan Disambiguation page needed</span></h2>
<p>I see that <a href="../../../s/a/d/Sadruddhin_Aga_Khan_ac7d.html" title="Sadruddhin Aga Khan">Sadruddhin Aga Khan</a> was once listed on this page, but that he was removed because he was not one of the Ismaili Aga Khans.</p>
<p>Since we do have more Aga Khans than just the ones listed here, as well as other topics which bear the name (such as the Ismaili-related <a href="../../../a/g/a/Aga_Khan_Award_for_Architecture_4aef.html" title="Aga Khan Award for Architecture">Aga Khan Award for Architecture</a>), I think a disambiguation page for Aga Khan is in order.</p>
<p>I propose the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content currently on Aga Khan be moved to a newly-created page called Aga Khan (Ismaili Islam).</li>
<li>The current Aga Kahn page be restructured into a disambiguation page for all of the forms of Aga Khan, Ismaili and non-Ismaili.</li>
</ul>

<dd>There's also a racehorse named Aga Khan.. --simo 11:28, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>--- Regarding the above comments from Kevyn ...</p>
<p>Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan is HH the Aga Khan's uncle, and son of Aga Khan III. Though there is Aga Khan in his title, it is because he is son of an "Aga Khan" and does not remain hereditary for him, if he had children. Any article on "The Aga Khan" needs to be on HH Karim al Husseini Aga Khan (ie Aga Khan IV). Articles on others with "Aga Khan" in their titles are the ones that need to have the disclaimer, and not the other way around. These would include Prince Amyn Aga Khan (AK IV's brother), Prince Saddrudin Aga Khan (AK IV's uncle), Princes Yasmin Aga Khan (AK IV's sister), Prince Rahim Aga Khan (AK IV's son), Princes Zahra Aga Khan (AK IV's daughter), Prince Hussein Aga Khan (AK IV's son), and Prince Ali Mohamed Aga Khan (AK IV's son). Of course, one of the Aga Khan's children (or grand-children) will become Aga Khan V - but that is sometime in the future. Lastly, saying Aga Khan (Ismaili Islam) remains ambiguous even by your logic, as all the ones listed are still of the family and are all important figures for Ismailis (though not the same as the Aga Khan himself).</p>
<p>I agree with some or all of the others deserve their own pages. Prince Sadruddin was the longest serving UNHCR in its history, and served during some tricky times. He started his UN service in 1958, and worked with them till his passing. His Bellereve foundation is an important legacy, as is his collection of Islamic art, particularly an unparralled collection of historic Persian miniatures. The others have similar things to their list of achievements.</p>
<p>Lastly, the items that bear the name Aga Khan, such as the Aga Khan Award for Architecture, were all created by the Aga Khan, and not others who have Aga Khan in their names. The Aga Khan Award for Architecture is one such example. The idea, the funds, the continued guidance, among other things, all come from him. There are other things also that should / could be listed, such as the Aga Khan Program for Islamic Architecture at Harvard and MIT. Once again, both via his endowments (Something like $70-$90M I believe, but would need to be confirmed). Then there are other significant items, such as Archnet, etcetera. I don't know if people really realize all what the Aga Khan has done in context of positive impact in a global sense. Al-Azhar park was a $30-$40M gift to the city of Cairo, a city his ancestors founded in 969. I believe just the programs he's initiating in Canada are in the order of $250M, and don't forget the $400M he and his partners have already put into Afghanistan (not promissed, rather already spent). Recently, he commited $50M for rebuilding from the earthquake in Pakistan.</p>
<p>When I have time, I'll have to go back into this one and add some of these other significant items.</p>

<p>In the first sentence, I think "Mogol" should read "Mongol". At least we strongly supsect this, but please tell what Mogol means if our guess is wrong.</p>

<dd>Actually it is one of several forms in western languages of Mughal, the name of India's imperial dynasty (originally Sultans of Delhi, later styled Padshah i-Hind), which was however thus called because it was descended from the Mongol dynasty of Genghis Khan <a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastifex_6571.html" title="User:Fastifex">Fastifex</a> 11:59, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
