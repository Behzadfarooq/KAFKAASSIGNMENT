<p>Hey, JayJasper</p>
<p>I've been working on the Van Morrison article. They say pick a subject and learn as much as you can. He's proven to be an interesting person and for someone so private, several books have been written that give enough information for these purposes. I have to admit I'm confused about the United Kingdom versus Irish thing.The entry I've made on this myself is Blue-eyed soul singer under genre. You didn't change that, and I wonder if it's correct. I saw him referred to as a blue-eyed soul singer and reading in the wiki entry for it it seems right, so I changed it from soul which seems to be for black soul singers. I guess he's moved back to Ireland. He's listed as living in Dublin, but he was born in Belfast, UK. People kept changing the flag back and forth, someone took it away completely. I've left it alone--someone else can figure that out! I think this is a touchy subject for the people in Northern Ireland. Thanks for helping out on Van.</p>

Hi Agadant,</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback on my contributions to the Van Morrison article. Although, after perusing the history page, it's obvious my input has been rather miniscule compared to yours. You've obviously done extensive work on the VM article, which is excellent. So, thanks for all you've done. The only thing I could find needing correction were the category tags identifying Van as British rather than Irish. Ireland is, I believe, part of the UK, however only natives and citizens of Great Britain are commonly referred to as "British". Of course, Van did live in England for a period, but I feel the fact that he was born and raised, and currently resides, in Ireland makes the "Irish" tag more accurate. I agree with your categorization of blue-eyed soul singer, especially given the definition on the wiki entry. It's good to hear from a fellow "Van the man" fan, and fellow Virginian as well. Again, much appreciation for your comments and all your fine work on the article.</p>
<p>--<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayJasper_e6d3.html" title="User:JayJasper">JayJasper</a> 22:09, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Hi. First of all, I'd like to attempt to clear up your problem in understanding the situation re British vs Irish. JayJasper is wrong when he says, "Ireland is part of the UK". Only <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> is part of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. As such, people from Northern Ireland are British. However, and this is where it starts to get complex, there are those of us in Northern Ireland who reject, to various degrees, any notion that we might be British. It doesn't stop us being British in the eyes of the law though.</p>
<p>Many people prefer to be called Northern Irish, as it combines a certain sense of Britishness (NI <i>is</i> part of the UK), with a certain sense of Irishness (self-evident).</p>
<p>JayJason is again wrong when he asserts that "only natives of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> are commonly referred to as British". Great Britain is an island. The nationality of people born in the UK to British parents, is British. Likewise, the nationality of people born in the USA, to American parents, is American.</p>
<p>The UK consists of four countries: <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a>. People from England are English, but their nationality is also "British". Ditto with the Scottish, the (Northern) Irish and the Welsh.</p>
<p>People from the Republic of Ireland have it easier - they are no longer part of the UK, so they don't have a tier-structure nationality! They are Irish and their nationality is also "Irish".</p>
<p>For the UK though, you could think about Texans vs Americans, or Virginians vs Americans etc.</p>
<p>Van Morrison was born and grew up in Belfast, in the same area as I did (though at very different times). As such, he is definately British by virtue of his birth nation. I have no doubt that Morrison is proud, like I am, of his Irish heritage also. Like me, I would say that he probably self-describes as an Irishman or as British, depending on the context at the time. The same is true with the Scots and the English for example.</p>
<p>I hope that crash course doesn't confuse you all the more! Anyway, to your question about his membership of Clubsound. I'm not sure I'd go that far. As far as I remember, he used to jam with the band, and probably played a few gigs with them. I thought I had provided some sort of citation for his article. You should look up all the info you can on <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Jones_9c26.html" title="George Jones">George Jones</a> - I'm sure he mentioned Van the Man more than once!</p>
<p>Curiously enough, I was friends with George's son in school. I say "curiously" because his name is Jay - short for Jason. Well there ya go! Anyway, I hope I've been of some use. If you're still stuck on the <a href="../../../c/l/u/Clubsound.html" title="Clubsound">Clubsound</a> link, I'd be happy to give it some research time in the next week or so and see if I can dig anything up. --<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;font-family: Monotype Corsiva;"><a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a></span> 21:58, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Agadant. It's not that I'm a busy guy, it's just that I've been overseas for the last few weeks and haven't had too much internet access, so I haven't been looking at what's been going on with wikipedia. So I missed what happened with the whole POV business. But I' ve read through the posts on the talk page. I have to agree with you that it definitely was POV, it's a good thing you spotted that and have worked to fix it. Keep up the great work (you're definitely a big asset to the Van article)! - <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAkamad_92a5.html" title="User:Akamad">Akamad</a> 00:43, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>If something is easily verifiable, it generally does not require a reference (Van is a singer for example). It really comes down to personal judgement, if you feel people will dispute any material on the article, cite a source for that material. Any and all negative comments about a living person have to be referenced, as per <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons</a>. When it comes to entire paragraphs, I would say it's fine to put multiple page numbers in the footnote and only reference it once. Like I said, it really comes down to whether or not you feel people will question any of the material on the article, if they do question it, or you think they will, then it needs a reference. Hope this helps. All the best. - <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAkamad_92a5.html" title="User:Akamad">Akamad</a> 19:54, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Agadant: I understand the reasons for your deleting my edits on the Van Morrison discography, but I don't feel that rumors of the <i>possibility</i> of a reissue campaign warrant removing them. Until such a time as a record label publicly announces, with projected release dates, the existence of such a campaign, then I feel that the article should reflect the fact that a majority of the body of work by this major artist remains out of print.PJtP 21:23, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hello again: In your posts to me on my talk page, you stated the following: "I feel like your edit is not done in an encyclopedia style as is required."</p>
<p>Please explain your assessment further.</p>
<p>You later added this comment: I added information I found on the Van Morrison Unofficial website that seems to indicate that Van is in complete control of his albums and as we know he is so private about everything he does, all we can do is speculate on what's going on.</p>
<p>Since you say that speculation is the only recourse to the status of the Van Morrison discography, then once again I feel that my edit is justified, since the bulk of his catalogue is *indeed* out of print, and any speculation does not change that fact. Until confirmed information arrives from either Van himself or his current label that a reissue campaign is forthcoming, I believe that the info on his Wiki site should reflect this status. Once an announcement is made, then that info (including any estimated street dates for the reissues) should be added to the page, but the indication of the out of print status should remain. Once the reissues hit the stores, then the "out of print" status should be changed to "in print," and not before.PJtP 03:06, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well Yes, but how to go about it is the question. We're not supposed to put any original research or anything that can't be backed up by reliable sources. Can you find a source that states with authority that these albums have been deleted? I haven't seen one. Everyone is just stating what they think. Another point is that by putting the Amazon links on each album it's like advertising where people can buy them, and I don't think we can give that appearance.<a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgadant_253e.html" title="User:Agadant">Agadant</a> 03:22, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Okay, here's my original research for outside, reliable sources. A) I live in Boston, and I have been to Barnes &amp; Noble and Newbury Comics (HMV, Tower, and Virgin stores have all pulled out of this area), and only certain Morrison CDs continue to appear in their racks. B) I have done searches on the Barnes &amp; Noble in-store search databases, and the out-of-print albums do not appear anywhere at all on that database. Barnes &amp; Noble maintains that it can get any CD in print, and that its database reflects this. Ditto for Newbury Comics. C) Record companies do not announce albums they no longer print, just as television networks do not refer to programs they have just cancelled. So Blue Note, Universal-Mercury, or any other label that Van has been on, will not have a page or a site saying "Sorry, fans, these Van Morrison CDs no longer in stock because we didn't think they were selling enough." D) Generally, something like Wikipedia would be the authoritative source to tell the public that certain books or records are no longer in print. The only other possibility would be articles in various music publications - Mojo, Uncut, Spin, etc. I look over those magazines regularly; haven't seen anything in recent months. Googling "out of print Van Morrison" yields no definitive information. E) I agree with your point about Wikipedia not appearing to be a shill for Amazon, but I included the link because Amazon *does* provide the best evidence for these albums being out of print via the prices being fetched for used copies. Only rare and out of print used CDs can regularly demand prices of $25-plus. If people think something is out of print, Amazon will probably be the first place they go to anyway. I can include a disclaimer for the Amazon links stating that said links are for corroboration purposes. Sorry to be so long-winded, but I am trying to be thorough about this - I don't make edits lightly. Now, could you please inform me as to how I'm not doing things in an encyclopedia style?PJtP 15:04, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Also, discussing rumors is generally not helpful in articles. -- <a href="../../../n/o/_/User%7ENo_Guru_cc59.html" title="User:No Guru">No Guru</a> 23:52, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This is the problem with Wikipedia, which is why many people with expert info get turned off from bothering with it, and why the Middlebury department of History has banned its use as a source - certain editors begin to believe that they 'own' a particular page, and that nothing should be changed without their consent. That's actually understandable - an article can become your baby, and you don't want to see inappropriate things added; but such is the nature of the collective project that is Wiki. I myself have suffered from this - I put in a lot of work into the article on Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young (which isn't even one of my favorite bands it's just that I know the history very well) only to have some of it replaced by duller writing and inferior work. Now, if whoever had edited my CSNY article had done so with superior stuff, I would have been all for it and quite happy; but you can go to the talk page on the CSNY article and see what kind of arguments were used to rebut my edits. As regards the Van discography, I am willing to take out the word 'indefensible,' but I would like to add that this is not a non-neutral viewpoint. The 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica, acknowledged by scholars and historians to be the greatest encyclopedia ever written, is loaded with articles which fail the Wikipedia NPOV criteria. While science requires neutrality, and history requires presentation of opposing interpretation, any article dealing with art is fairly useless *without* a viewpoint. It's not enough to tell the who what and where with Art - you also need to explain the hows and whys. The 1911 editors understood this - read their fabulous article on Beethoven for proof. At some point, you *have* to violate neutrality to say something meaningful about culture and art, especially in an encyclopedia that is fast becoming the first source people go to for info. It could be judged wrong to state that the works of David Cassidy being out of print is an indefensible position, but would it be wrong to claim indefensibility for such a state of affairs regarding Duke Ellington? For Mozart? Beethoven? Would it really violate NPOV to state that Shakespeare being out of print is indefensible? Van Morrison was a fairly important artist of the 1970s, and many still agree Astral Weeks as being one of the greatest recordings ever made. Would it violate neutrality to say that he's the best musical entity in Western history? Yes. But does it violate neutrality to simply say that it's indefensible for an artist of his stature to have so many works out of print, denying people the ability to make an assessment of his worth via hearing his work? At some point, you have to make a judgment, and if the NPOV stands in the way of making a good judgment, then that rule should be altered. You bend rules to fit reality, not the other way around. PS I added the rumors section from a statement on the talk page section Albums deleted? by Agadant re 'It appears that in June 1997, a lot of these albums were deleted from the previous label, and reissued. So this is probably what will happen again' as a courtesy. I will remove that as well. PPS The Morrison albums *are* out of print; that is a fact, and again, that cannot be corroborated by an outside source beyond retailers unless you can get either Morrison's management, agents, or dep't directors at the record labels on the phone. I thought retailers info would be sufficient.PJtP 18:57, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your argument does not make sense to me, because you don't have expert information, and have never before contributed to this article. Someone asked the question on the talk page about the albums being deleted and I answered as a courtesy with what I still believe to be a probable reason for the deletion and for a probable reissue in the near future. I provided a link to <a href="http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/ask_bb/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003544276" class="external text" title="http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/ask_bb/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003544276" rel="nofollow">ask.billboard.com Vanished Morrison</a>dated February 9, 2007 reinforcing my viewpoint. You have stated at length your views about certain wikipedia editors thinking an article is their baby. Well my question is why do editors with no seeming interest in the article try their best to promote their causes and in the process weaken the article that you have worked hard to improve with no help from them? I believe even you would have to agree that I have an honest interest in this article and have spent hours researching and learning to use Wikipedia in order to make it a better article. I don't understand your strong interest in making this one entry while contributing nothing else to it. Why don't you investigate whether an artist has to wait a certain amount of time to reissue albums from another record label. It would make sense.--- No Guru did agree with me on your entry not being appropriate for the article.<a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgadant_253e.html" title="User:Agadant">Agadant</a> 20:36, 5 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>One of the main reasons the entry should not be added is because it does not have footnotes to back it up with a reference from a reliable source as has already been stated. I have faithfully had to do this for entries made by others and as I have now done for the entire article. How can one editor make an entry disregarding this. The Amazon links are not useful for this and are the type of commercial links I have tried to avoid.<a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgadant_253e.html" title="User:Agadant">Agadant</a> 20:56, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
