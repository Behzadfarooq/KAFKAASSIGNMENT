	    <p><b>Consulting Project</b></p>
<p><b>Arclinea Boston</b></p>
<p>We believe that Arclinea Boston would be a great fit for our group consulting project. Several group members have experience in marketing, as well as marketing to high net worth individuals, and would offer some great insights as to how best to position the brand in this market; one has worked in engineering and design and would be able to converse with the architects; a few of us have extensive ties in Boston, where the brand has the strongest recognition, and we could be very helpful in promotion decisions. We feel that this project could be mutually beneficial. There is a tremendous opportunity to learn about business development and advertising for a company in the field of luxury, which many of us are interested in learning about. We are all very quick learners and are eager to be as helpful as possible in developing Arclinea Boston’s business and target marketing.</p>
<p>We are confident that our backgrounds, experience, and personalities would greatly contribute to the success of Arclinea Boston’s business venture.</p>
<p><b>City of Boston</b></p>
<p>Our group would like to work with the City of Boston to implement and unveil its employee self-service program to the approximately 19,750 city workers currently without access. Not only are we excited about the visibility of the client and the scope of the project, but also feel like our group’s interests and experiences are a particularly well-suited match for this project. Our group includes two members who have led or been a part of large scale enterprise software implementations (including the lead on an implementation for the Alternative Investments group at Deutsche Bank), in addition to three members with experience as public relations and marketing managers. One of our members was director of national public relations for Microsoft in China. Finally, one of the members has extensive background working in the public sector, having worked with the Governor Paul Celluci, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, and Suffolk County Superior Court Judge John P. Connors. Our group believes our strengths in large-scale information technology implementation, public relations and marketing, as well as our commitment to the greater-good of the Boston gives us a competitive advantage in ensuring a flawless execution of the client’s project.</p>
<p><b>Dana Farber</b> Dana Farber Cancer Institute</p>
<p>Group III would be honored to have the chance to work with the professionals and patients of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. The Dana Farber Cancer Institute is world renowned and would provide Boston College and our group great exposure within the Boston Healthcare Industry. The greatest aspect of the lodging demand consultant project is the ability to work diligently for an excellent organization but more importantly assist those that are battling cancer, AIDS and related diseases. If Group III were to be appointed as the consultant group for this project, the group would adhere to the mission and adopt the values of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. The group would also share the core values of Impact, Excellence, Compassion and Respect, and Discovery.</p>
<p>The project is extremely interesting in that it combines strategy and business development. These two aspects of business are of great individual interest to Group III. The team will need to conduct research from a business standpoint of whether to create joint ventures with other hospital facilities in Boston area as well as research whether or not the Dana Farber should build their own accommodations.</p>
<p>Group III is comprised of individuals with career experience in marketing, sales, public relations, investment and real estate research, law and engineering. Group III believes that their career experiences will provide the Dana Farber with a strong well rounded consultant team. Each of the business expertise that each individual brings with them will be vital towards the successful completion of the project. Group III also has personal relationships with members of the Boston Healthcare Industry as well.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
<b>Berkshire</b></p>
<p><br />
We feel Team III will be a good fit for the Berkshire Property Advisors (BPA) business consulting project. BPA assesses new investment opportunities in the multifamily real estate segment throughout the United States. This consulting project involves capturing an analysis of vast amounts of data. Results from this analysis will be used to derive investment decision. Our team encompasses a variety of skill and comes from a diverse background. We have investment, real estate research, public relations and marketing skills as a result of our varied professional experience. Each of these skills will be vital towards the successful completion of this project. Moreover we also feel that we will be able to apply our business skills acquired in the first semester of our program to this project as most of our team members are keen to build a career in finance, strategy and real estate management. We feel that Berkshire Company would benefit most as their consulting partner as we would get a fresh business perspective to tackle the scope of their project. Our analysis of the project would be dynamic in nature because of varied background and having the right kind of skill required for this project. This would result in a substantial difference to the consulting approach we take.</p>
