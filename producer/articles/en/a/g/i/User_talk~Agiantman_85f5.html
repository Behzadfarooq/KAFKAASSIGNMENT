<dd>(a) i have never met kizzle &amp; i'm not his professor. i did work for one year at his university, while he was not even in attendance -- a coincidence we discovered by chance not long ago. (b) i'm not a sockpuppet, wolfman retired. a sockpuppet is using two accounts at once. on my user page you will see that i mention having a past name, and i have not made a secret of it (or you obviously wouldn't know about it). i did use wolfman once since derex: to vote in a vfd that required a minimum 100 edits; wolfman had about 6000. i am quite proud of my record as wolfman. i do note that you seem awfully damn knowledgeable about wikipedia details for such a newbie. you wouldn't be a sockpuppet yourself, now would you? (c) of course i checked to see what you were adding to other articles. the first thing i saw you do was say that tyson got convicted with mentioning the wee tiny detail that espy was acquitted of 30 charges. you are indeed a paragon of neutrality. btw, <i>you</i> followed me to the espy page. and <i>i</i> wrote the rape page in the first place. (d) kizzle should indeed mind his language, but you should also consider why you provoke such a reaction. you should mind your language too. (e) don't assume you know my politics. i'm not a democrat. but since <a href="../../../s/b/v/SBVT_0828.html" title="SBVT">SBVT</a>, i have had a very low tolerance for smear campaigns and lies. i like to combat smear with fact. and that is what i have been doing. if you don't think i'm being neutral, then supply facts of your own. that is what i have been doing myself. i am happy to be educated. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerex_a544.html" title="User:Derex">Derex</a> 17:14, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>look, i appreciate removals of pro-Communist bias as much as the next guy -- I'm a registered U.S. Republican. however these guys are right that what Stalin did is not genocide by any definition of the word and you're really not helping your case on the talk page. i'd suggest you concede this one and try to make more objective edits on USSR-related articles where leftist bias actually is a significant problem.</p>
<p>i'm messaging you rather than just dismissing you because it is my opinion that several wik political articles do have a leftist bias, in some cases very egregious bias that goes untouched, and if you could focus on NPOV rather than political debates you'd gain more credibility on this project. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrey_Stone_e7d3.html" title="User:Trey Stone">J.

<p>Hi Agiantman, you've been reported for a 3RR violation at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalin.html" title="Stalin">Stalin</a> and for incivility on the talk page. This is just to warn you that if you violate 3RR in future, you may be blocked from editing without further warning. Also, it's better to leave out the <i>ad hominem</i> comments when dealing with contentious issues. I've never been involved in editing this article, but I know it has caused a lot of trouble for various editors, so it's best to tread lightly and deal only with the content issues, and not with what you perceive to be the motives of other contributors.

<p>The deletion of unsourced material is not vandalism. The deletion of sourced material may be. In this case, the statement that Freeman did not believe in antisepsis does require a source. Also, is there any evidence that infection played a factor? If not, it simply proves that Freeman was a quack, but that is not the issue about Rosemary Kennedy.

<p>Over the years, the Wikipedia community has developed several policies and guidelines about editors' conduct. These standards are applicable to admins, other longtime editors, newly registered accounts, and even anonymous IP’s. We want to <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">avoid biting the newbies</a>, but that doesn't constitute a license for them to be disruptive. You've been here several weeks now, and important policies have been called to your attention, yet you continue to violate them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a>. Your talk page shows that your incivility has been called to your attention by <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> and by <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_McClenon_acae.html" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a>. When Robert tried to help you by advising you of this policy, you accused him of harassing you. After these warnings, you made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Rosemary_Kennedy&amp;diff=21140238&amp;oldid=21136128" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Rosemary_Kennedy&amp;diff=21140238&amp;oldid=21136128" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>, suggesting that Robert was "on the Kennedy PR payroll". The policy against such personal attacks isn't just some vague hope that people will be nice. It's a policy. It's enforceable. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a>, a longtime member of the Arbitration Committee, has <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia_talk%7ENo_personal_attacks_4f76.html#A_proposed_revision" title="Wikipedia talk:No personal attacks">written</a>: "The no personal attacks rule has been one of the most frequently cited Wikipedia policies used by the Arbitration Committee. Violations have resulted in bans of up to a year in extreme cases."</li>
<li><a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a>. We have a clear policy: "Any <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">good-faith</a> effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism. Apparent bad-faith edits that do not make their bad-faith nature inarguably explicit are not considered vandalism at Wikipedia." The policy goes on to note that NPOV violations are not vandalism. So, if you disagree with an edit, even if you disagree because you consider the edit biased, that doesn't make it vandalism. You shouldn't continue to sling around the word "vandalism" in such circumstances.</li>
</ul>

<p>i glanced at some of your changes on the Kennedy article. i'm not really well-informed on the subject of Kennedy family shenanigans but the "Mormon" bit seemed a little POV to me (although the previous version could use some tweaking.) i dunno if i'll involve myself in this but i may look at it a little more. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrey_Stone_e7d3.html" title="User:Trey Stone">J.

<p>Greetings and thanks for your note of support. The clique composed of Willmcw and SlimVirgin is one of the worst operating on Wikipedia and I'm sorry (but not surprised) to hear that you've had a bad experience with them as well. Willmcw has very strong political and personal beliefs and pushes them regularly in his edits and screening of other people's edits, and SlimVirgin is always standing nearby to assist him when somebody objects to the way he batters and harasses other editors that don't conform with those beliefs. I've experienced this first hand and seen the two of them do it many times, occassionally calling in other fellow travellers in their clique to assist in things such as burying an RfC against one or more of them for misbehavior. SlimVirgin tried to do this to me recently when I filed an RfC against Willmcw for a very blatant and incontrovertable NPOV abuse (he was inserting <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Duke_357b.html" title="David Duke">David Duke</a> quotes into an article to make it look like the Klan supported a viewpoint opposite of his!). Most of the normal good faith editors who visited the RfC immediately recognized how Willmcw was in the wrong and went to work trying to fix the problems he'd created on that article. But Slim and the clique showed up to "vote down" the RfC en masse without even looking at the evidence because Willmcw is one of "their guys." Another way this group operates is to find a newcomer to Wikipedia who disagrees with one of their opinions. Newcomers are by definition inexperienced at how edits happen here so many times they react in confusion when they start getting bombarded with hostile allegations of vandalism or mass reverts of their edits. I've seen Will, Slim &amp; Co. show up and effectively run some of them off the forum this way, completely disregarding Wikipedia's policy against biting the newcomers with hostility the moment they arrive. If you have a moment please stop by the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Wikipedia%7EStalking_f70d.html" title="Wikipedia:Stalking">Wikipedia:Stalking</a> article and contribute to the discussion there as non-clique voices are needed and the aforementioned clique is trying its hardest to bury and dismantle the thing (partially because one of their own - Willmcw - knows he's guilty of the very same offenses it pertains to).
