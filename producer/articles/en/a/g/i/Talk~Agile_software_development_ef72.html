<p>Any documentation to the success of the 2nd, 3rd, ... commercial release of agile software developed systems would greatly help as the current article touts agile software methodology as an effective way to deliver complete working software without any evidence to back up that claimed advantage. Furthermore, documentation to the cost of maintaining an agile methodology developed softare system would help since close to 3/4ths of the cost of a piece of softare is after it is released.</p>

<p>Well, I think that all agile methodologies are just a subset of iterative-incremental models. In the section Ag. vs. I-I two differences are mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>time period of increments is measured in weeks -- but Iterative-Incremental model does not prescribe increments length,</li>
<li>work is performed in a highly collaborative manner -- again, in the I-I model you are free to use any of the other methodologies when working on one increment, from the waterfall approach to a total chaos.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, agile development is, let's call it, an "instance of I-I model" defined by its paramaters (increment length, increment development process, ...).</p>
<p>What is your opinion?</p>

<dd>I think that there are fundamental differences, and they are in the perspective of the values and principles. The iterative nature of delivery is merly an mechanism of providing it. It could be copied from iterative methodologies, but it isn't so important as is, for Agile. The agile is a framework for all lightweight methodologies, as they respect values and principles fom the manifesto. - <a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELittlesal_c183.html" title="User:Littlesal">Littlesal</a> 20:47, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The information on PRINCE2 appears to me to be much too detailled, going in the direction of a proof of concept or feasability study rather than an encyclopedia article. I would characterize it as an argument for using PRINCE2 for the management of agile software development and a lengthy demonstration by the author of one possible way of doing that. I don't, personally, disagree with the content, but I would delete the PRINCE2 sections and replace the section <b>Agile methods and project management</b> with something on the lines of the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agile methods differ to a large degree in the way they cover project management. Some methods are supplemented with guidelines on project management, but there is generally not comprehensive support (footnote citing Abrahamsson et al., 2003). PRINCE2 has been suggested as a suitable, complementary project management system. -- adding a footnote citing Agile Alliance at <a href="http://agilealliancebeta.org/article/file/904/file.pdf" class="external free" title="http://agilealliancebeta.org/article/file/904/file.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://agilealliancebeta.org/article/file/904/file.pdf</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>and quoting</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>PRINCE2 (Projects in Controlled Environments) . . . is a project management method that was specifically designed to be generic and independent of any particular project type or development method. As with DSDM,its use is dramatically on the increase in both the public and private sectors. As a development method and a project management method, the two should be complementary. Some have perceived the dynamic emphasis of DSDM and the control emphasis of PRINCE2 to be in conflict. However, this is not the case. When DSDM was being developed, those involved had PRINCE firmly in mind. This is reflected in a number of the DSDM principles and techniques – for example, product-based planning, the involved partnership of users and developers, and the strong emphasis on the underlying business case.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I thought I should propose it here before deleting a rather large chunk of text.<br />
<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBoson_0dfa.html" title="User:Boson">Boson</a> 21:09, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Have now done this and also tried to fix the citations. This still needs work, but I think the missing-citations problem is fixed; so I have removed the citations required template. <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBoson_0dfa.html" title="User:Boson">Boson</a> 23:06, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I do disagree with the content here. I propose removing the citation of PRINCE2 altogether. The PRINCE2 methodology IS clearly in conflict with the philosophy of Agile - it is a documentation intensive, big phase methodology, and it is diametrically opposite to Agile. Although PRINCE2 is purportedly designed to be scaled according to the project's needs, the core philosophy is about "big-bang" delivery, and hence its application in an Agile project would result in what is known as PINO: PRINCE in Name Only. I would expect that both PRINCE2 and Agile practitioners would agree with this; on the whole, each probably believe that the strength of their approach is their rejection of each other. (This does not mean that they two practises exclude each other's techniques, just that their core philosophy is at odds.) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 62.128.215.24 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_62.128.215.24_943a.html" title="Special:Contributions/62.128.215.24">contribs</a>)  2007-03-13.</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>I have now updated the link to agilealliance.org in the reference, which had become invalid owing to a reorganization of that Web site. The DSDM consortium seem to be pushing the ability to combine DSDM with PRINCE2, which is why I was loth to remove PRINCE2 completely. The reason may be "political" but it does seem to be a valid POV. I would not oppose its deletion but would welcome more input from the UK, where PRINCE2 may be a de facto standard(?). It would be nice to have more information on project management. The DSDM article could probably do with a rework as well. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBoson_0dfa.html" title="User:Boson">Boson</a> 22:36, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed the paragraph from the end of the "Principles behind agile methods ..." section. I think it is biased, not very encyclopedic in tone and makes unsupported assertions. Maybe the original author would like to try to fix it up. Here it is (<a href="../../../p/e/a/User%7EPeashy_b91c.html" title="User:Peashy">Peashy</a> 14:29, 15 February 2007 (UTC)):</p>
<p>One fundamental difference of an iterative/agile approach is the recognition that specs are typically built in a vacuum of theory prior to real-world experience. An iterative/agile development cycle forces the real world into the picture (thus "working code"), whereas the document driven process puts far too much pressure on the document author(s) to get it right the first time, which cannot be done. This is not an argument against documentation - just a recognition of documentation as a process tool and not the end goal. Further, the agile approach draws developers into the problem definition process, so that they are actively engaged in the solution. This active engagement also allows them to introduce new technology accelerators that the spec process would never have introduced.</p>
