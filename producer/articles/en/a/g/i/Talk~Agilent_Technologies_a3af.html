<dd><i>It is interesting to note that HP <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_printer.html" title="Computer printer">printers</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer.html" title="Computer">computers</a> were developed as logging devices to record and process data from the instruments. By the late 1990s however, the tail was wagging the dog, with the instruments as an $8 billion business and the computers and printers as a $32 billion "afterthought". It was separated from HP in 1999, with the HP name being retained for marketing purposes for the computer and printer lines, even though the true lineage went to the instrument company.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The author of this paragraph obviously has an ax to grind. None of the sentences is accurate. The author has myopia for the HP 1000 series computers and associated printers -- HP first created desktop calculators. The tail was not wagging the dog, and computers and printers weren't an afterthought. Both companies retain "the true lineage," but I acknowledge on the <a href="../../../h/e/w/Hewlett-Packard_9234.html" title="Hewlett-Packard">HP</a> page that Agilent "bears the legacy of the original instrument company." As Michael Feldman says, "anyone who says otherwise is itching for a fight." <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Chambers_aaa6.html" title="User:Tim Chambers">tbc</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Hmmm ... Well, most anyone who works in the computer trade can tell you that there is precious little of the HP tradition in their current products or service standards. The HP tradition of "do it the best way you know how, and if it costs a lot, well, that's just the way it is", is dead, dead, dead. Their retail computer products (and to a leser extent even their printers) are appallingly cynical, jerry-built products. Compare with, for example, their ultra-solid prodcts from the 286 era. Weird designs, but built like tanks, and as reliable as sunrise. As for their new, outsourced service standards, the less said the better. Everything slashed to the bone. I had always fondly imagined that the instrumentation division was something of a throwback to the old, quality-focussed HP.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But how to accurately reflect all that in an encyclopedia entry, I don't know. Right now the entry reads like a PR department puff job. But it probably shouldn't read like a hatchet job either. (OK: <i>I'd</i> write it as a hatchet job, but then I have to work on the poxy damn things far more often than I'd like to. From time to time I have seriously considered introducing a flat-rule policy that we do not service HP or Compaq products, because they are too flimsy, often hopelessly incompatible with industry standards, and shoddily made. It's just not worth the trouble. But I haven't. (Yet.) We just charge extra. Not enough extra, mind you. They are (in general) <i>far</i> more difficult to work on than most systems, and the peripheral components in them (bottom-of-the-market junk, as a rule) have alarmingly high failure rates.) We really ought to mention their shift in market positioning. They used to be a quality brand once. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 14:34, 11 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I actually think it was metaphorically tail wagging the dog. The very first product produced by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard was actually not a calculator, but an Audio Oscillator. If I remember right, these were then also purchased by Disney to use in their new Feature lenght cartoon Fantasia. Oscillators are still today part of the product-portfolio of Agilent Technologies. Hewlett-Packard is also today one of the bigger customers of Agilent Technologies, as are actually most computer/communications/semiconductor -companies today... As for any discussion on the quality (or lack thereof) of HP products, it is misplaced here as the entry is about Agilent Technologies and not HP.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry, but I think the removed paragraph was dead-bang accurate and <b>not</b> POV. If you go back and read, for example, <i>HP Journal</i> from the early computer years, it is very clear that HP was doing its computer and calculator work so that they would have access to instrument controllers (and so that engineers could buy extreme-performance calculators from the same company from which they bought extreme-performance instrumentation). The original "ThinkJet" printer was clearly developed to allow inexpensive graphical hard copies to be produced from instrumentation, but HP was also smart enough to realize that they had a hot property in their hands in the form of the invention of an entire class of printers: the inkjet.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is also clear when you speak to people from HP's <i>Test and Measurement</i> and <i>Medical</i> divisions that they felt increasingly divorced from the computer and calculator folks. And, of course, HP also built by acquisition, buying Apollo Computer wholesale to eventually form HP's Unix workstation business. Apollo, was definetly not apart of the HP culture, and the rift between the original HP and the computer folks continued to grow. Finally, of course, Fiorina had <b>nothing</b> to do with HP culture and seemed intent on dismantling it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's definitely fair to say that the true lineage of David Packard's and Bill Hewlett's company went with Agilent. I'd like to see us restore this paragraph (or sommething very much like it) to the article.</dd>

<p><br />
I think this whole conversation misses the point. Test and measurement is an industry where people will pay for quality; retail computers is not. It's like asking a hyena and baby deer to live in harmony; just not in the nature of hte beast. I don't think you should blame HP/computers for not living up to HP/historical; it is just not something that can happen. By the way, not everyone is so enamoured of HPs past; my boss taught me that HP stood for High priced, and that, at least in electronic test (multimeters, oscilliscopes, etc) you could always get an HP product equivalent from someone else with 90%+ functin for half the price - but this is now very ancient history.</p>

<p>Sorry, I didn't phrase that very well. What I meant was more: "Which of these two was it meant to refer to" (I'm trying to fix the links to the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instrument.html" title="Instrument">instrument</a> disambiguation page). However, I think you've still answered my question, so I'm going to go ahead and change it to [[Measuring instruments|scientific instrument]]s. If I got the wrong one, then I trust you'll fix it for me.
