<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/i/Agios_Dometios_ff9f.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>History</b></span></h2>
<p>Agios Dometios has existed since <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine.html" title="Byzantine">Byzantine</a> times as a small <a href="../../../v/i/l/Village.html" title="Village">village</a>, located 4 kilometres west of Nicosia. Mention of Agios Dometios comes from as early as the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franks.html" title="Franks">Franks</a> era. The town is named after Saint Dometios who originated from <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persia.html" title="Persia">Persia</a> in the 4th century AD and who became <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> later in his life. He lived in a cave in <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesopotamia.html" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> and converted many people into Christianity. <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Emperor_293f.html" title="Roman Emperor">Roman Emperor</a> Ioulianos accused Dometios of tricking people, so Dometios answered the Emperor that all of these harmless people visit him freely and he can’t just send them away. Ioulianos felt offended by his answer and ordered his death. Dometios was stoned to death at 362 AD. The <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church.html" title="Church">church</a> of Agios Dometios was built in the <a href="../../../1/7/t/17th_century.html" title="17th century">17th century</a> and is dedicated to the <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint.html" title="Saint">Saint</a>. It’s built on a small hill and is one of the town’s main attractions.</p>
<p>Agios Dometios grew bigger in the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a> and expanded until <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>. The Turkish invasion of 1974 caused the <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupation.html" title="Occupation">occupation</a> of 37% of the island including 4/5 of Agios Dometios. Until today, the <a href="../../../u/n/_/UN_0433.html" title="UN">UN</a> buffer zone runs through Agios Dometios and cuts the town into two pieces.</p>
<p>The Turkish invasion brought an economic decline, and many residents of the Nicosia suburb abandoned their homes due to fear of the <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invaders.html" title="Invaders">invaders</a>. Expansion halted up until <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a> when the <a href="../../../m/u/n/Municipality.html" title="Municipality">municipality</a> of Agios Dometios was founded. An organized plan to revive the town began, and up to now, new buildings, parks and roads are still being built while the population of Agios Dometios has been rapidly growing. Today Agios Dometios is a modern <a href="../../../e/u/_/EU_f2e6.html" title="EU">European</a> town.</p>

<p>The parish of Agios Pavlos is located around the church of Saint Paul and consists mainly of <a href="../../../r/e/f/Refugee.html" title="Refugee">refugee</a> settlements due to the Turkish Invasion of 1974. The Agios Dometios junior high school is also located in Agios Pavlos.</p>

<p>The partial opening of the <a href="../../../b/o/r/Border.html" title="Border">borders</a> between the controlled area of the Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish occupied area in <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_2003.html" title="April 2003">April 2003</a> set up debate about opening some additional <a href="../../../c/h/e/Checkpoints.html" title="Checkpoints">checkpoints</a> both for cars and on foot along the Green Line. One of the areas selected was the end of Democratias avenue in Agios Dometios. Finally, an agreement was reached and in late April of 2004 both sides started separate works building a road and placing control buildings. On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_23%2C_2004.html" title="May 23, 2004">May 23, 2004</a> the checkpoint was given to the public, and on the first day thousands of <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cypriots.html" title="Cypriots">Cypriots</a>, on both sides passed through the check point.

<p>Horseracing was revived in Cyprus, Agios Dometios from the end of the 19th century. However, the tradition of the sport in this country, as evidenced by archaeological findings existing in the Cyprus Museum, is lost in the depth of the Hellenistic period, where we come across horseracing descriptions by Homer and other ancient authors. Horseracing in those days was actually a "sport of kings" who participated in them. When Kings of ancient Salamis of Cyprus died, their horses were buried with them. Horse racing is for the first time entered in the Olympic Games in the 7th century b.c. Agios Dometios is dubbed by many as Cyprus <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betting.html" title="Betting">betting</a> capital. The presence of the islands <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_horse_racing_venues.html#Cyprus" title="List of horse racing venues">Horse Race Track</a> in the municipality brings hefty revenue to the town but also attracts thousands of horse enthusiasts and gamblers during the races.
