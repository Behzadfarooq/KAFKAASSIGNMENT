<p>I'm sorry Mel, but Squeak box did edit my words on a TALK page. That is a 'no no' on Wikipedia, is it not? Let's talk about philosophy. The Internet is a planetary phenomenon, and one of the problems that we all have are the SPAMMERS, people that create VIRUSES, etc. I'm sure you understand and agree. International Law, National Law, and State Law define the locus of the crime as the unit that will have jurisdiction. For example, if you and your wife visted Florida and there was a public altercation between the two of you, you could be arrested for Domestic Violence. Your due process rights would be upheld, but you would be responsible to the laws of Florida. Cyberstalking laws work the same way. The fact that Squeakbox is in the UK, or any other place, is not exculpatory. Squeakbox is cyberstalking me. Are you excusing his behavior? <a href="../../../a/g/w/User%7EAgwiii_34b2.html" title="User:Agwiii">Agwiii</a> 17:50, Apr 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure what any of the above has to do with philosophy, but let's stick to facts. I have already said that there is no evidence that he's doing any such thing, nor have you supplied evidence in the form of Diffs — you've just repeated the claim. On the other hand, you have made unsubstantiated claims against him in a number of places, most of them inappropraite, such as 'Vandalism in progress'. Moreoever, I have just discovered that you have removed a VfD notice from an article that you created, before the debate and voting was complete. Moreover you did so in an edit marked '<b>m'</b>. You are getting perilously close to vandalism, and you have already made personal attacks. I strongly advise you to calm down — perhaps stop editing for a while until you regain some sense of proportion. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 18:01, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Squeakbox is dog posting me.</li>

<li>If the Vfd on the Ron Branson page was removed by me, it was a mistake. The history of the votes and the discussion of same is there. Mea culpa if that was my mistake.

One editor to another, I think that you should just try to relax, maybe take a break for a day or two, and consider whether the two of you simply disagree on a few pages.

<dd>Hi ClockworkSoul! Thanks for your very kind and wise words. In New York City in the 1960s, Kitty Genovese was stabbed to death on the sidewalk in front of her apartment. She was repeatedly stabbed by the stalker. She cried out to her neighbors and they closed their windows. Squeakbox's dog posting and changing my words on a TALK page are similar (but in no way as severe) as the stalker/mugger who killed Kitty. Walking away when we're right is simply not what good American citizens do. <a href="../../../a/g/w/User%7EAgwiii_34b2.html" title="User:Agwiii">Agwiii</a> 17:42, Apr 10, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Hello again, Agwiii. I genuinely appreciate how you feel in this, and it always pains me to see disagreements turn ugly. I know that I'm not directly involved here, and of course you're free to ignore me, but as a neutral observer that essentially only knows both of you through your contribution history, I think that you may be approaching this the wrong way. If you genuinely feel wronged by another user, the best way to go about it is to be as rational as possible. You studied law for a bit, you probably know all too well that a person that over-presses their point is often ignored or worse, regardless of whether they're "right". Again, I'm just hoping to help a little bit, and I hope everything turns out well. – <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClockworkSoul_028f.html" title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 17:52, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Just a quick followup: Wikipedia has a standard series of steps to resolve disputes like these.

<p>I understand that you would prefer for Squeakbox to stop reverting your edits. I read the FL statute (I'm a 2L), but from a purely legal standpoint, I have serious doubts that he has done anything "causing substantial emotional distress to that person and serving no legitimate purpose." While I am certain that you do not like Squeakbox's edits, I am fairly certain nothing he has done could cause <b>substantial</b> emotional distress. Even if you could make a case that the rather subjective substantial emotional distress test is met, his legitimate purpose is to maintain neutrality on Wikipedia. Regardless, there is a jurisdictional issue, since Squeakbox is not in the United States (I don't remember enough of first semester Civil Procedure to articulate exactly why, however). What school are you affiliated with? Your user page indicates that you have rather impressive credentials, and I'm just curious.

<p>- + - + - One herding trait obvious in political behavior is caucusing in exclusive cliques. Cliques organize human behavior by relieving their members of reasoning for themselves: The group's dominant members determine the beliefs, values, and behaviors of all the members. This is agreeably efficient, for each clique requires only one mind. Indeed, typical humans carry this characteristic over to larger groups: mobs and political parties. Clique mentality probably indicates a natural limit on the size of human flocks. That is, typical humans can't comprehend huge herds as collections of individuals. To distinguish friends from foes, they must rely on uniforms, if not literal, then figurative--e.g., religion, ethnicity, or skin color. + - + - <a href="http://www.enformy.com/$politic.html" class="external free" title="http://www.enformy.com/$politic.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.enformy.com/$politic.html</a></p>
