<p>{notability}} <b>SURVIVOR AGENT</b> Survivor Agent is one of many Online Survivor Games. Online Survivor games are almost identical to the TV series, Survivor, except in most cases, there is no monetary prize. Your have tribes, immunity and/or reward challenges, tribal council and then a final vote. In SA, each season is based in one particular state. The series, hosted by former online player Mike Bond, started in February 2003. After almost four years, it is one of the five oldest continuous series online. It also ranks among the top five currently with 16 seasons.<br />
<br />
NOTE<br />
<br />
This page was started by Mike Bond, the founder and host of the series. With the popularity of Survivor and Online survivor games, I feel this is a valid page to include. There are a lot of games on there. My home page is Survivor Agent (<a href="http://www.geocities.com/survivoragent/Survivor_Agent.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/survivoragent/Survivor_Agent.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/survivoragent/Survivor_Agent.html</a>). There are several web sites that serves as informational sources for online games. Most notably Fantasy Games Central (<a href="http://p092.ezboard.com/bfantasygamescentral" class="external free" title="http://p092.ezboard.com/bfantasygamescentral" rel="nofollow">http://p092.ezboard.com/bfantasygamescentral</a>)</p>

<p>Ran from Feb. - June 2003.<br />
<br />
The first in the series.<br />
<br />
Steff won the final challenge and voted out Sherry, taking Krista with her.<br />
<br />
Krista beat Steff 4-3 to become the first Survivor Agent winner.<br />
<br />
Steff became the first player to have recieved no votes against her for the entire game.</p>

<p>The first game in which I had a co-host and that was Robin.<br />
<br />
Started with 21 players and three tribes.<br />
<br />
Cindi won the final challenge and voted out Josh, taking Becky with her to the final.<br />
<br />
Becky won the game 5-2. This is the second straight time that the winner of the final immunity, did not win the game</p>
<p><a name="SA_3:_Florida_Keys" id="SA_3:_Florida_Keys"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgentbay_sandbox_0d54.html" title="Edit section: SA 3: Florida Keys">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">SA 3: Florida Keys</span></h2>
<p>The only series that was based in part of a state. Marathon is the only tribe in SA history to have never won an immunity challenge.<br />
<br />
This was the first time that a juror was removed. Brian got into a verbal confrontation with the host and was replaced by Frankie.<br />
<br />
Laurie won the final challenge and voted out Ryan, taking Andy to the final.<br />
<br />
The game ended in a 3-3 tie. One vote was declared void because the juror swore she sent an email saying she wanted Andy to win and I remembered it as she wanted Laurie to win. Since neither one of us had any email to back it up, I declared a tie.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgentbay_sandbox_0d54.html" title="Edit section: SA 4: Alaska">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">SA 4: Alaska</span></h2>
<p>For the second straight time, a juror was replaced. Melissa failed to send in her final words so Shane replaced her on the jury.<br />
<br />
Tribal Council 11 was quite shocking. The alliances were Cindi, Lisa and Steff vs. Jinx and Kelley. Steff had a reward to sit someone from the challenge and she picked Jinx. Kelley won the immunity challenge and gave it to Jinx. (She is thus far, the only player to give immunity to someone else). CLS all voted for Kelley but Kelley had a reward which would cancel all votes against her at one TC before the final 4 if she had a majority of the votes. She had not recieved a majority yet so all three votes were cancelled and Jinx and Kelley voted out Steff. At the next TC, Lisa and Jinx tied at 2-2 but Lisa had more previous votes.<br />
<br />
Kelley (who recieved no votes against her) won the final challenge and voted off Cindi, taking Jinx with her.<br />
<br />
Kelley became the first and only player to recieve all seven votes at the final council.</p>

<p>At the merge, Jason (who had been the first player voted off) was allowed to return to the game).<br />
<br />
With seven players left, Jason was removed for being inactive. Dawn did not post any final words so the 11th place finisher, Rob M. joined the jury.<br />
<br />
Blake won the final challenge and voted off Melissa, taking Gary with him. This was the first all-male final in SA history.<br />
<br />
Blake beat Gary 5-1. Mo was unable to vote due to a family emergency.</p>
<p><a name="SA_6:_Idaho" id="SA_6:_Idaho"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgentbay_sandbox_0d54.html" title="Edit section: SA 6: Idaho">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">SA 6: Idaho</span></h2>
<p>Boise completely dominates the tribal challenges winning five to just one for Pocatello. Boise had the huge advantage 7 to 3. After surviving the first TC at the merge, Pocatello (Lisa, Shane and Tom) are picked off. In the final immunity challenge, Melissa trailed by nearly 15 minutes but breezed on the final part in just three minutes. Liz managed to hang on by 1:53 and she voted out Caitlin and took Melissa with her.<br />
<br />
Liz (who was Kelley from Alaska) became the first player to win two season as she beat Melissa 6-1. Padraig was the lone jury member to vote for Melissa.</p>
<p><a name="SA_7:_Louisiana" id="SA_7:_Louisiana"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgentbay_sandbox_0d54.html" title="Edit section: SA 7: Louisiana">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">SA 7: Louisiana</span></h2>
<p>The season started out with the boys (Cypremort) competing against the girls (Audubon). Cypremort was hampered by the fact that at every challenge, at least two members did not participate. Thus it was no surprise that Audubon won five of the six challenges. Once the merge came, alliances were flying all over the place. Meg won IC #12 which was key since she in the minority alliance. When she won IC 13, Katie became the first player ever to snuff her own torch. She refused to vote for her alliance mates, Tom and Val.<br />
<br />
Meg (who had no votes against her the whole game) then won the last immunity challenge to become the first player to win the last three challenges. She voted out Tom and took Val with her. Val then edged Meg 4-3 for her first ever survivor win. In keeping with the trend, Ryan was removed from the jury for not posting his final words. This was the fivfth straight time it had happened. Sherry replaced him.</p>

<p>This was unique as all 21 players were playing under false names.<br />
<br />
For the first half of the game, each players were assigned a certain amount of points (1 for 1st, 2 for 2nd so on) as where they placed in the immunity challenge. The point total was cumulative and after each challenege, the person who had the highest amount of points was eliminated. Once we got to 10 players, then it was a normal game.<br />
<br />
The dominant alliance was Baby, Nelson, Charlie and Beverly. However, due to some rewards and a few mistakes, All but Beverly were picked off in a row.<br />
<br />
Marie won the final challenge and voted off Beverly, taking Viola with her. Marie won the final vote, 5-4 but due to two factors, the game was declared a tie. At the final elimination tribal council, the host accidentally posted the real name of Marie which caused a few people to switch votes. Also, because of a misunderstanding, Viola did not answer the jury questions, which also influenced a few votes.<br />
<br />
Meg was Marie. She became just the second player to win three SA's. Meg also is the only player in SA history to have won the last three immunity challenges. In fact, she has done that in all four games she has played.</p>

<p>There have been 174 players in the series.<br />
<br />
40 players have played in 2 or more games.<br />
<br />
Tom F. has played in the most games at nine. Also playing in six or more games are Donna (aka Steff), Padraig, Sherry and Velva.<br />
<br />
Kelley and Megs are the only players to have won more than one game.</p>
