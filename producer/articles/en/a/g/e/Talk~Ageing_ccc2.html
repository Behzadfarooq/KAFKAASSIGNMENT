<p>I find it bad practice to have a page named with impropper spelling. Perhaps this could be moved to Aging (life cycle) instead?

<dd>I think the American was joking. Both spellings are of course correct, but, unlike other differences between Commonwealth and American English, this is one where the American spelling is much more widely used. Having the article about humor being called "humour" (even though it was originally spelled "humor...") is fine. But this article should be "Aging." Foreigners will get confused by all the articles and books with the "aging" spelling. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiFair1_6758.html" title="User:WikiFair1">WikiFair1</a> 08:00, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html#National_varieties_of_English" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Wikipedia policy</a> is quite clear, all varieties of English are equally acceptable. Ageing is no less common than any other Commonwealth English spelling. A Google search shows that the aging/ageing ratio is similar to the the humor/humour ration, for instance. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 15:30, 12 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Huh? The "aging" / "ageing" spelling ratio is, precisely, 217,000,000 to 35,100,000, i.e., about 7 to 1. How did you conduct your Google search? You obviously did it incorrectly. Again: this will be confusing (not "confuseing") to the many non-native speakers who are using (not "useing") Wikipedia to try to learn about both aging and English. Noah Webster had some flaky proposals. "Aging" wasn't one of them. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiFair1_6758.html" title="User:WikiFair1">WikiFair1</a> 08:19, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And humor/humour is 256,000,000 to 64,000,000, licorice/liquorice is 5,200,000 to 1,500,000, yogurt/yoghurt is 4,700,000 to 17,400,000. International English terms are generally less popular than American English, but Wikipedia has a longstanding rule that we don't pick the most popular spelling. Instead we use the first spelling used for the article. If we adopted your system, Wikipedia would use nothing but American English. Also it should be noted that most people in the world are taught International English, so if anything this spelling benefits ESL learners. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 16:54, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1) My point about the ratio wasn't an argument, I was correcting your research. (And my question wasn't rhetorical: how did you conduct your Google search?) I agree using the most popular spelling in general is a bad idea. 2) "International English" doesn't mean British or Commonwealth English. 3) Most people in the world are actually taught American English (Mexico and most of South America, most of Eastern Europe, most of China -- though not Hong Kong -- all of Japan). The "ageing" spelling harms ESL users, since A) it's one of the Commonwealth spellings that is particularly inconsistent with other -ing spellings. (Plenty of American spellings are illogical as well, though, to be sure!) B) it is the spelling used by most of the research community, even many people in England, such as Aubrey de Grey. And just look at the errors in the reference section (which I'm now going to correct, though someone will likely change them back). Names of books are incorrectly spelled with the "ageing" spelling. This will make it hard for people to track down the references. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiFair1_6758.html" title="User:WikiFair1">WikiFair1</a> 07:30, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your wrong with that, American English is only really taugh in the United States and some parts of South America. There is a reason Commonwealth English is also called <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_English_6880.html" title="International English">International English</a>. Almost all the countries with a huge number of ESL learners, such as those in South Asia, Africa, and Western Europe are all taught British English. Also please understand there was nothing wrong with my Google searches. I did not say aging and ageing are equal, I stated that they are only as unequal as any International/American spellings. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 17:59, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I am not wrong. Do some research. British English is taught lots of places, American English is also taught lots of places. In part because of China and Japan, the total number of ESL learners who are taught American English is higher. About "International English" -- that sometimes refers to American English, sometimes to British English, sometimes to something else entirely. In any event, I gather you have no interest in improving Wikipedia, but would rather promote your favorite variety of English. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiFair1_6758.html" title="User:WikiFair1">WikiFair1</a> 05:59, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>SimonP wrote: "The rule is that the first spelling used should be used throughout, and ageing was the original spelling." For the record, that is not <i>the</i> rule, it is one of several rules. Another is the one I cited: "If an article is predominantly written in one type of English, aim to conform to that type rather than provoking conflict by changing to another." Throquzum violated the rule I cited, and provoked conflict. However, as I recall, you were the actual author of the first non-stub version, so I think your wishes should be respected, if it really matters to you that much. I reverted the changes for the simple reason that it is indeed a violation of policy, and did indeed seem likely to be provocative. But, again, I feel original non-stub authors should have a larger "vote" in these matters than others, even if that's just my feeling, not policy.

Because biogerontology is a subcategory of gerontology, ie, senescence is a subcategory of ageing, it makes more sense to merge senescence into ageing rather than the other way around.

<p>As the saying goes, two are better than one. Do not merge either way (linking works just fine).</p>
<p>I agree that the 2 articles should be kept separate. Due to each article's substantial size, and due to the likelihood of the articles growing still larger. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETranshumanist_3b06.html" title="User:Transhumanist">Transhumanist</a> 11:35, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since Rowe and Kahn (1987) have distinguished between successful aging and normal aging, should there not be a sub-heading for "Successful aging"?<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EACEO_4c06.html" title="User:ACEO">ACEO</a> 18:43, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
The distinction goes back to an article published by Rowe and Kahn, in 1987, in the journal "Science" (their 1997 publication was in "The Gerontologist"). The title of this paper implied an attempt to distinguish "normal" ageing - where people suffer the detrimental effects of ageing, especially extrinsic factors - from "successful ageing" where extrinsic and detrimental factors play only a minimal function. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EACEO_4c06.html" title="User:ACEO">ACEO</a> 18:48, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have now put in the Rowe and Kahn references. They occur at the end of the article. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EACEO_4c06.html" title="User:ACEO">ACEO</a> 18:40, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The claim at the end of the article about usage of gold in India read rather as a tag-on after the section on successful ageing, so I have moved it to its own section. Can I please urge that some one finds a source for this claim and cites it? I have added how Aldwin and Gilmer prefer the term "optimal ageing" to successful ageing, and in my section on this, note some cultural variations in fear of death. This may go some way to rectification of an earlier concern about this article - that its views were not pancultural. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EACEOREVIVED_683e.html" title="User:ACEOREVIVED">ACEOREVIVED</a> 09:16, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>No one has, as yet, added a source citation for that claim, so I have categorised this article accordingly. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EACEOREVIVED_683e.html" title="User:ACEOREVIVED">ACEOREVIVED</a> 19:58, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
