<p>The main reasons are:</p>
<ol>
<li>He only appears in one film in the series: personally, I think Cypher is the only Matrix character appearing in one film who should get a dedicated article; everyone else should be described in the "List" articles. This page breaks that consistency.</li>
<li>This page is mostly an <i>overly-detailed</i> description of the events in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Matrix_Reloaded_fa18.html" title="The Matrix Reloaded">The Matrix Reloaded</a></i> that involve Johnson. Is all that really necessary?</li>
<li>The number of images in the article appears, to me, to be too great compared to the size of the article - I don't think that this extensive use of images would fall under fair use.</li>

<p>Good point. Even Johnson being the leader of the upgraded agents and appearing more than the rest, this article should go in <a href="../../../a/g/e/Agents_%28The_Matrix%29_87fc.html" title="Agents (The Matrix)">Agents (The Matrix)</a>.</p>

<p>Okay you guys say that I'm over exaggerating with the <a href="../../../a/g/e/Agent_Johnson_6830.html" title="Agent Johnson">Agent Johnson</a> article so what do you want me to do? Why do you think I'm abusing the number of images for the article? Last time I checked I thought it was alright as long as I didn't put any type of offensive, sexual, or irrelevant pictures. Well tell me what you think I should do with the article. P.S. Also what do you mean by "<i>satisfying this big fan</i>".SonicXRouge 16:35, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry, but I just found it kinda funny to read "portrayed, voiced, played. . .". I'm not even sure if it was you who wrote that, but everywhere else it just says "played by", and that <b>is</b> enough. Besides, the character should be introduced first, not the actor (portrayer, voicer...), so it does give out the impression that whoever wrote this is a big fan of the guy... <a href="../../../v/d/s/User%7EVdSV9_80e7.html" title="User:VdSV9"><font color="#207912"><b>VdSV9</b></font></a>•<a href="../../../v/d/s/User_talk%7EVdSV9_9217.html" title="User talk:VdSV9"><font size="4px">♫</font></a> 13:04, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Characters should get their own personal profile, no matter how least of importance the character is. For example in wikipedia, they have "List of programs and machines". But I feel that article is just like a "summary" to describe those characters. I really think the Agents shouldn't be there since they have their own article. That information in "List of programs and machines" should just be added in the "Agents" article. But that article just covers the basics of the agents, what they can do, the clothes they wear, etc. It shouldn't include any plots that the Agents were in, caused, etc. because thats not what the article "Agents" is about. Its not right to put in the "Agents" article that they took Morpheous prisoner in "The Matrix" in order to get the access codes to the Zion mainframe; something like Agents have incredible power and have great indurance, their main purpose is to kill any red pill they encounter, which include Neo and Trinity, or rogue programs like the keymaker. Agent Smith has his own profile and he was once an Agent. In <i><b>Dictionary of Matrix</b></i> Agent Johnson has his own profile, the link is <a href="http://www.dictionary-of-matrix.com/index.php/Agent_Johnson" class="external free" title="http://www.dictionary-of-matrix.com/index.php/Agent_Johnson" rel="nofollow">http://www.dictionary-of-matrix.com/index.php/Agent_Johnson</a>. I honestly don't see anything wrong with a character having his/her own profile. I hope Agent Johnson keeps his profile here instead of being an addition to the "Agents" article. <i><b>I just want to expand and help the Matrix series, nothing else, is that too much to ask?</b></i> (I'm Sorry <a href="../../../v/d/s/User%7EVdSV9_80e7.html" title="User:VdSV9"><font color="#207912"><b>VdSV9</b></font></a>•<a href="../../../v/d/s/User_talk%7EVdSV9_9217.html" title="User talk:VdSV9"><font size="4px">♫</font></a> if I'm offending you in any way.)

<dd>I shouldn't really use a horizontal rule there, but this is a fairly long resonse with a lot of formatting, and it should help keep this comment separate.</dd>

<dd><b>"Characters should get their own personal profile, no matter how least of importance the character is."</b></dd>
<dd>From <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_Minor_characters_9616.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Minor characters">Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Minor characters</a>:
<ol>
<li><b>Major characters</b> (and places, concepts, etc) in a work of fiction should be covered within the article on that work of fiction. If the article on the work itself becomes long, then giving major characters an article of their own is good practice.</li>
<li><b>Minor characters</b> (and places, concepts, etc) in a work of fiction should be listed with short descriptions in a <i>"List of minor characters."</i> This list should reside in the article relating to the work itself, unless either becomes long, in which case a separate article for the list is good practice.</li>
<li>Fictional characters which are cultural icons <b>transcending their appearance in a particular work of fiction,</b> or who <b>cannot be neatly tied to a particular work of fiction or fictional universe</b> deserve articles of their own, regardless of other circumstances.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't class Agent Johnson as a major character (nowhere near as major as Neo, Smith, Morpheus or even Cypher), and he's definitely not a cultural icon. Therefore, he's a minor character, and should therefore be included only in the "List" article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>"In <i>Dictionary of Matrix</i> Agent Johnson has his own profile"</b></dd>
<dd>Dictionary of Matrix is not Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>"I just want to expand and help the Matrix series, nothing else, is that too much to ask?"</b></dd>
<dd>Fair enough. But please bear in mind that:
<ol>
<li>Adding content is not <i>necessarily</i> a good thing: as an example, it's often better to work a point into an article's prose rather than simply add an extra bullet point to a "trivia" section.</li>
<li><i>All</i> the Matrix-related articles need a lot of work, and it is often the case that the fewer articles there are, the easier it is to improve and maintain them, and the more consistent their style and quality.</li>
<li>Wikipedia has a reputation as a place where <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">fancruft</a> runs rampant. IMO, articles on pop culture should be limited and properly organised in order to promote the idea that including pop-culture content does not inhibit Wikipedia's validity.</li>

<p>Why does <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Keymaker_%28Matrix_character%29_7102.html" title="The Keymaker (Matrix character)">The Keymaker</a> (click on it) have his own profile? He only appears in one of the films and isn't that much of an importance as Neo, Trinity, or Smith? It's not an obsession, it's an attempt to increase the expansion of minor characters of the Matrix Series. So what do you suggest we should do with the <a href="../../../a/g/e/Agent_Johnson_6830.html" title="Agent Johnson">Agent Johnson</a> article? SonicXRouge 16:53, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Keymaker article hadn't been converted to the correct format yet. Which I've now done - it's now a redirect page.</dd>
<dd>The content of this article should be incorporated into the two articles suggested, and this one changed to a redirect page (not sure yet which of the two it should redirect to, though). --<span style="font-family:monospace"><a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_R_4809.html" title="User:Nick R">Nick R</a><sup><a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENick_R_4235.html" title="User talk:Nick R"><span style="color:#008800">Talk</span></a></sup></span> 16:38, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
