	    <p>A Case For Two Indian Standard Times.</p>
<p>(1) Introduction. We were on our trip to Guwahati and Shillong. In both the places we realised that it used to dawn early. The sky would be bright at about quarter past four and sun would rise before five 'O' clock. At six or quarter past six it would be up in the sky as if it was eight thirty or nine 'o clock in Western India . Consequently it would be dark at half-past six PM in the evening as against the darkness which was seen in the Western India. I would find it difficult to adjust my body rhythm to this clock. Luckily this wasn't required to continue for long. I was back to Mumbai with in a week. This set my mind on a thought " why should we have a standard time which is so discordant with the local time " especially in the Eastern part of the country? Is it allright? Doesn't it have any effect on economy, health and psychology of the people living in the area? Shouldn't we approach the issue more scientifically and analyse the same and question the status quo, rather than taking it as a fait-acomplii?</p>
<p>(2) Rotational Time Solar-time, Daylight saving-time. Let us now understand different terms used for measurement of time . The Earth's rotation causes the stars and the sun to appear to rise each day in the East and set in the West. The apparent solar day is measured by the interval of time between two successive passages of the Sun across the observer's celestial meridian, the visible half of the great circle that passes through the zenith and the celestial poles. Apparent solar time is the hour angle of the centre of the true Sun plus 12 hours. Mean solar time is 12 hours plus the hour angle of the centre of the fictitious mean Sun. Local mean solar time depends upon longitude; it is advanced by four minutes per degree eastward. In 1869 Charles F. Dowd, principal of a school in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. proposed the use of time zones, within which all localities would keep the same time. Others, including Sir Sandford Fleming, a Canadian civil engineer, strongly advocated this idea. Time-zones were adopted by U.S and Canadian railroads in 1883. In October 1884 and international conference held in Washington, D.C., adopted the meridian of the instrument at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, as the prime or zero, meridian. This led to the adoption of 24 standard time zones. The boundaries of which are determined by local authorities. These boundaries in many places deviate considerably from the 15 intervals of zones. The international Date Line is a zigzag line in the mid-Pacific Ocean near 180 longitude. When one travels across it westward a calendar day is added; one day is dropped in passing eastward. During World War I daylight-saving time was adopted in various countries; clocks were advanced one hour to save fuel by reducing the need for artificial light in evening hours. During World War II , all clocks in the United States were kept one hour ahead of standard time for the interval Feb.9, 1942-Sept.30,1945, with no changes made in summer. Beginning in 1967, by act of Congress, the United States has observed daylight-saving time in summer, though state legislatures retain the power to pass exempting laws, and a few have done so.</p>
<p>(3) Definition of standard-time Sir Sandford Fleming, a Canadian railway planner and engineer, outlined a plan for worldwide standard time in the late 1870s. Following this initiative, in 1884 delegates from 27 nations met in Washington, D.C. and agreed on a system basically the same as that now in use. The present system employs 24 standard meridians of longitude (lines running from the North Pole to the South, at right angles to the Equator)15 apart, starting with the prime meridian through Greenwich , England. These meridians are theoretically the centres of 24 standard time zones; in practice, the zones have in many cases been subdivided or altered in shape for the convenience of inhabitants.</p>
<p>(4) Biological clock of plants, animals and human bodies - effect of temperature/ prescriptions of Swastha-vritta (Ayurved). It is well established that living organisms often have some sort of internal clock that regulates their behaviour. There is a tendency, for example, for leaves of leguminous plants to alter their position so that they lie in one position by day and in another position by night. In animals, similar daily rhythms are usually acquired, but in experimental conditions animals nevertheless tend to adapt better to a 24 hour rhythm than to any other. Similarly, humans themselves have some power to estimate time in the absence of clocks and other sensory cues. Temporal rhythms in both plants and animals (including humans) are dependent on temperature. Experiments on human subjects have shown that, if their temperature is raised, they underestimate the time between events. Ayurved had taken into consideration the effect of the rotational movement of the Earth, Sunrise &amp; rise in temperature due to the position of the Sun on human body. Therefore it has prescribed getting up well before sunrise and starting the daily chores as well before the sunrise so that before mid-day when the Sun is positioned exactly above your head you could have finished major chunk of your important work. In doing so you would use the best hours of the day when temperatures are low and the efficiency is high. Productivity in this period is at its peak. With this one can justifiably rest in the afternoon (mid-day) when the temperatures are high and efficiency is low. One can also utilize this time for lunch as one is expected to be hungry after a couple of hours of hard work. But does it happen this way?</p>
<p>(5) The reality Now let us have a look at our country. It is a vast sub-continent spread over 2000KMs from East to West. It's longitudinal co-ordinates are 97*25'E to 68*07'E.That means it encompasses 29 longitudinal lines. Between two adjacent longitudes the time lag is 4 minutes. This means between the East and West ends of our country the time difference is of 116 minutes, i.e. nearly 2 hours. World over scientists have made 24 time zones, equal to the number of hours that that Earth takes to rotate round itself. Each time-zone covers 15 longitudes. Our country actually spreads over to two time-zones. We had the freedom to have two standard times. I am not aware of any reason for not doing so. On our West Pakistan STD time is at GMT+5 hours where as on the East Bangladesh STD time is at GMT+6 hours. Our country expands much beyond Bangladesh. Now let us have a look at the table showing sunrise, Sunset, twilight start and end and midday timings of selected cities in Eastern and Western India on two days one in summer i.e. 22.06.2001 and one in winter i.e. 22.12.2001.</p>

<p>City Midday Length of day in Hours Civil Twilight start Sun rise Sun set Civil Twilight End Eastern India Imphal 11.16 13.41 4.00 4.26 18.07 18.32 Agartala 11.26 13.37 4.13 4.38 18.15 18.41 Shilong 11.24 13.44 4.06 4.32 18.16 18.42 Guwahati 11.25 13.47 4.06 4.32 18.19 18.45 Kolkata 11.30 13.31 4.27 4.52 18.23 18.49 Patna 11.41 13.44 4.33 4.59 18.44 19.10 Western India Rajkot 12.40 13.30 5.39 6.04 19.34 19.59 Mumbai 12.40 13.17 5.38 6.02 19.19 19.43 Ahmedabad 12.41 13.33 5.29 5.55 19.28 19.53 Jaipur 12.28 13.50 5.07 5.34 19.24 19.50 Chandigarh 12.24 14.28 4.53 5.21 19.29 19.56 Banglore 12.21 12.53 5.31 5.55 18.48 19.12 Cochin 12.26 12.42 5.43 6.06 18.48 19.11</p>
<p>It is seen that where as in Imphal mid-day is at about 11.12 to 11.16 at Rajkot and Mumbai it is at about 12.40 even between Kolkata and Mumbai the difference in midday is of one hour. The Eastern sector plunges in to darkness more than one hour earlier and also brightens up about an hour earlier than the Western sector.</p>
<p>(6) Mis-match of Biological clock, solar time and standard time - Effects thereof. Human life in the modern times is more and more linked to the clock which shows the standard time. It is Unfortunate that majority of the people do not give importance to the position of Sun in the sky. Most of our routines are linked with the standard time. Therefore, in the Eastern sector when people come to offices the time that is left before it is a true midday is hardly an hour or so. Same is the case of shops and trade. Thus a very valuable, productive and relatively cool one hour is lost . Similarly in the evening the night comes early by one hour leading to preponement of midnight by one hour. Therefore, the midnight in Eastern sector is actually to be reckoned at about 11.00pm Indian standard time. The prescription of Swastha Vritta ( Ayurved) is that one should sleep minimum two hours before midnight so as to get a good sleep leading to good health. But in practice the prime time of the Doordarshan and other news &amp; entertainment channels extends well beyond 10.00PM IST. Which actually leaves less than one hour for the people in Eastern India before midnight which is not a healthy practice.</p>
<p>(7) Consideration of the work force population &amp; Saving of effective working hours.</p>
<p><br />
Population chart for Eastern India S.N. State Population - 1991 1 Meghalaya 1760626 2 Tripura 2744827 3 Mizoram 686217 4 Manipur 1826714 5 Nagaland 1215573 6 Arunachal 858392 7 Sikkim 403612 8 Assam 22294562 9 West Bengal 67982732 10 Bihar 86338853 11 Orissa 31512070</p>
<p>The total population in the Eastern sector form longitude 80* E to 97*E is of the order of 30 crores. This covers the state of Bihar, Jharkhand Orissa, West Bengal, Sikkim, Assam, and all states in the North East. Let us assume that out of the 30 crores 12 crores are able and working hands. The effective gain due to efficient management of productive time as brought out above in para 4 is one hour per day per workman. 12 crores multiplied by one eighth of a man-day works out to 1.5 crores man days per day. If the daily minimum wages are rupees 39 this amounts to the generation of wealth of Rs.58.5 crores per day. With 200 working days in a year this would amount to Rs. 11,700 crores per annum. This whooping sum would certainly change the face of Eastern India and in its turn that of Bharat.</p>
<p>Day light- saving - Saving of energy Having two standard times in our country would also help in saving a lot of electricity and energy. As the twilight end timings would closely match the time of closer of shops and other establishments. Though it would be difficult to quantify the savings on this account it can be easily guestimated to thousands of crores of rupees.</p>
<p>Reduction in pollution Due to the changed standard time for Eastern India the daylight utilisation will improve by one hour which would automatically entail reduction of requirement of power which will be also reduce utilisation of diesel generator sets in cities and major towns. This will help reduce pollution significantly.</p>
<p>(9) Countries having more than one ST. Following countries have more than one standard time: Canada, USA, Russia, Australia Indonesia. Where as Russia has nearly 13 standard times Canada, USA and Australia have 6 ,7 and 3 standard times respectively. A relatively smaller country like Indonesia has two standard times .Therefore India has every reason to seriously think of more scientific management of its daylight and productive hours of each day. All that is required is a putting our heads together and finally a decision to divide the country in two geographical time zones. each covering approximately fifteen longitudes 68E to 83E and 83 to 97E. However for each contiguous area of a state even if small portion lies on the other side of dividing line. It will be treated as falling in the same time zone as that of the major portion of the state . These are however matters of details to be discussed at the stage of implementation .</p>
<p>(10) Possible problems and their solutions. The adoption of two standard times will affect transport, communication and broadcasting business to the extent of adjustments in their time tables, time-specifications for concessions, claims and such legal and financial matters. (a) Time tabling for Rlys. and Air lines. (b) Time reckoning for communications for Telecommunications. (c) Time reckoning for Doordarshan and All India radio for commercial charges. However these are also details to be worked out by the service provider</p>
<p>(11) Conclusion and agency for the change. In the ancient times for every major occasion there used to be a high priest. Similarly for this major change there will have to be an agency which will have to take lead in this matter. Since this issue touches science, health, and economy, The ministries of Science and Technology ,culture, Human resource development and finance at centre or the various state governments of the states in the Eastern sector could take lead in this regard. This has some thing to do with being more scientific in our approach towards conducting our lives.</p>
