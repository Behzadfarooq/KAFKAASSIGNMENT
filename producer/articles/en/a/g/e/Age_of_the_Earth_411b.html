<p>Modern <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geology.html" title="Geology">geologists</a> consider the <b>age of the Earth</b> to be around 4.567 billion years (4.567×10<sup>9</sup> years). This age represents a compromise between the interpretations of oldest-known terrestrial <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mineral.html" title="Mineral">minerals</a> – small crystals of <a href="../../../z/i/r/Zircon.html" title="Zircon">zircon</a> from the <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Hills_1f81.html" title="Jack Hills">Jack Hills</a> of <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Australia_84d0.html" title="Western Australia">Western Australia</a> – and <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronomer.html" title="Astronomer">astronomers</a>' and <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planetary_science.html" title="Planetary science">planetologists'</a> determinations of the age of the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_system.html" title="Solar system">solar system</a> based in part on radiometric age dating of <a href="../../../m/e/t/Meteorite.html" title="Meteorite">meteorite</a> material and <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth%27s_moon.html" title="Earth's moon">lunar</a> samples.</p>
<p>Interpretation of <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radiometric_dating.html" title="Radiometric dating">radiometric age dating</a> of <a href="../../../z/i/r/Zircon.html" title="Zircon">zircons</a> suggests that the Earth is at least 4.404 billion years old. Comparing the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass.html" title="Mass">mass</a> and <a href="../../../l/u/m/Luminosity.html" title="Luminosity">luminosity</a> of the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun.html" title="Sun">Sun</a> to the multitudes of other <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star.html" title="Star">stars</a>, it appears that the solar system cannot be much older than those rocks. <a href="../../../c/a/-/Ca-Al-rich_inclusions_5ce2.html" title="Ca-Al-rich inclusions">Ca-Al-rich inclusions</a> (inclusions rich in <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calcium.html" title="Calcium">calcium</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/u/Aluminium.html" title="Aluminium">aluminium</a>) – the oldest known solid constituents within <a href="../../../m/e/t/Meteorites.html" title="Meteorites">meteorites</a> which are formed within the solar system – are 4.567 billion years old, giving an age for the solar system and an upper limit for the age of the Earth. It is assumed that the accretion of the Earth began soon after the formation of the Ca-Al-rich inclusions and the meteorites. Since the exact accretion time of the Earth is not yet known, and the predictions from different accretion models vary from several millions up to about 100 million years, the exact age of the Earth is difficult to define.</p>
<p>In the centuries preceding the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_revolution.html" title="Scientific revolution">scientific revolution</a>, the age of the Earth was determined either by using the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_belief.html" title="Origin belief">accounts of creation</a> in religious texts, or by <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophical.html" title="Philosophical">philosophical</a> interpretations of <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geologic.html" title="Geologic">geologic</a> features (most notable are the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greece_e4c9.html" title="Ancient Greece">Greek</a> <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosopher.html" title="Philosopher">philosophers</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theophrastus.html" title="Theophrastus">Theophrastus</a> and <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenophanes.html" title="Xenophanes">Xenophanes</a>).</p>

<p>Studies of <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stratum.html" title="Stratum">strata</a>, the layering of rock and earth, gave <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_history.html" title="Natural history">naturalists</a> an appreciation that the Earth may have been through many changes during its existence. These layers often contained <a href="../../../f/o/s/Fossil.html" title="Fossil">fossilized remains</a> of unknown creatures, leading some to interpret a progression of organisms from layer to layer. <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenophanes.html" title="Xenophanes">Xenophanes</a> interpreted fossil-bearing strata in much the same way during the 6th Century BC.</p>
<p><a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicolas_Steno_cbf2.html" title="Nicolas Steno">Nicolas Steno</a> (17th Century) was one of the first Western naturalists to appreciate the connection between fossil remains and strata. His observations led him to formulate important <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stratigraphy.html" title="Stratigraphy">stratigraphic</a> concepts (i.e., the "<a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_of_superposition.html" title="Law of superposition">law of superposition</a>" and the "<a href="../../../p/r/i/Principle_of_original_horizontality.html" title="Principle of original horizontality">principle of original horizontality</a>"). In the 1790s, the British naturalist <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Smith_%28geologist%29_d2ce.html" title="William Smith (geologist)">William Smith</a> hypothesized that if two layers of rock at widely differing locations contained similar fossils, then it was very plausible that the layers were the same age. William Smith's nephew and student, John Phillips, later calculated by such means that the Earth was about 96 million years old.</p>
<p>The naturalist <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikhail_Lomonosov_77bc.html" title="Mikhail Lomonosov">Mikhail Lomonosov</a>, regarded as the founder of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russian</a> science, suggested in the mid-<a href="../../../1/8/t/18th_Century_7857.html" title="18th Century">18th Century</a> that the Earth had been created separately from the rest of the universe, several hundred thousand years before. Lomonosov's ideas were mostly speculative, but in <a href="../../../1/7/7/1779.html" title="1779">1779</a>, the <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">French</a> naturalist the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georges-Louis_Leclerc%2C_Comte_de_Buffon_1461.html" title="Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon">Comte du Buffon</a> tried to obtain a value for the age of the Earth using an experiment: He created a small globe that resembled the Earth in composition and then measured its rate of cooling. This led him to estimate that the Earth was about 75,000 years old.</p>
<p>Other naturalists used these hypotheses to construct a <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Earth_fb0d.html" title="History of the Earth">history of the Earth</a>, though their timelines were inexact as they did not know how long it took to lay down stratigraphic layers. In 1830, the geologist <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Lyell_0570.html" title="Charles Lyell">Charles Lyell</a>, developing ideas found in Scottish natural philosopher James Hutton, popularized the concept that the features of the Earth were in perpetual change, eroding and reforming continuously, and the rate of this change was roughly constant. This was a challenge to the traditional view, which saw the history of the Earth as static, with changes brought about by intermittent <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catastrophe.html" title="Catastrophe">catastrophes</a>. Many naturalists were influenced by Lyell to become "uniformitarians" who believed that changes were constant and uniform.</p>

<p>In 1862, the physicist <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Kelvin_3362.html" title="Lord Kelvin">William Thomson</a> (who later became Lord Kelvin) of <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> published calculations that fixed the age of the Earth at between 20 million and 400 million years. He assumed that the Earth had been created as a completely molten ball of rock, and determined the amount of time it took for the ball to cool to its present temperature. His calculations did not account for the ongoing heat source in the form of radioactive decay, which was unknown at the time.</p>
<p>Geologists had trouble accepting such a short age for the Earth. Biologists could accept that the Earth might have a finite age, but even 100 million years seemed much too short to be plausible. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>, who had studied Lyell's work, had proposed his theory of the <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a> of organisms by <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_selection.html" title="Natural selection">natural selection</a>, a process whose combination of random heritable variation and cumulative selection implies great expanses of time. Even 400 million years didn't seem long enough.</p>
<p>In a lecture in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1869.html" title="1869">1869</a>, Darwin's great advocate, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Huxley_2093.html" title="Thomas Huxley">Thomas H. Huxley</a>, attacked Thomson's calculations, suggesting they appeared precise in themselves but were based on faulty assumptions. The German physicist <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermann_von_Helmholtz_e4d6.html" title="Hermann von Helmholtz">Hermann von Helmholtz</a> and the Canadian astronomer <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Newcomb_d176.html" title="Simon Newcomb">Simon Newcomb</a> contributed their own calculations to the debate: They independently calculated the amount of time it would take for the Sun to condense down to its current diameter and brightness from the nebula of gas and dust from which it was born. They came up with a value of 100 million years, which seemed to set an upper limit on the age of the Earth that was consistent with Thomson's calculations. However, they assumed that the Sun was only glowing from the heat of its <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravitational_contraction.html" title="Gravitational contraction">gravitational contraction</a>. They knew of no other ways for it to produce its energy.</p>
<p>Other scientists backed up Thomson's figures as well. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>'s son, the astronomer <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Darwin_6c43.html" title="George Darwin">George H. Darwin</a> of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Cambridge_5f20.html" title="University of Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>, proposed that the Earth and <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon.html" title="Moon">Moon</a> had broken apart in their early days when they were both molten. He calculated the amount of time it would have taken for <a href="../../../t/i/d/Tidal_acceleration.html" title="Tidal acceleration">tidal friction</a> to give the Earth its current 24-hour day, and concluded that Thomson was on the right track.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/9/1899.html" title="1899">1899</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Joly_7496.html" title="John Joly">John Joly</a> of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Dublin_8733.html" title="University of Dublin">University of Dublin</a> calculated the rate at which the oceans should have accumulated <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halite.html" title="Halite">salt</a> from <a href="../../../e/r/o/Erosion.html" title="Erosion">erosion</a> processes, and determined that the oceans were about 90 million years old.</p>

<p><a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_%28geology%29.html" title="Rock (geology)">Rock</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mineral.html" title="Mineral">minerals</a> naturally contain certain <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_element.html" title="Chemical element">elements</a> and not others. By the process of <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radioactive_decay.html" title="Radioactive decay">radioactive decay</a> of radioactive <a href="../../../i/s/o/Isotope.html" title="Isotope">isotopes</a> occurring in a rock, exotic elements can be introduced over time. By measuring the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concentration.html" title="Concentration">concentration</a> of the stable end product of the decay, coupled with knowledge of the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half_life.html" title="Half life">half life</a> and initial concentration of the decaying element, the age of the rock can be calculated. Typical radioactive end products are <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argon.html" title="Argon">argon</a> from <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potassium.html" title="Potassium">potassium</a>-40 and <a href="../../../l/e/a/Lead.html" title="Lead">lead</a> from <a href="../../../u/r/a/Uranium.html" title="Uranium">uranium</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thorium.html" title="Thorium">thorium</a> decay. If the rock becomes molten, as happens in the Earth's <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mantle_%28geology%29.html" title="Mantle (geology)">mantle</a>, such non radioactive end products typically escape or are redistributed. Thus the age of the oldest terrestrial rock gives a minimum for the age of the Earth assuming that a rock cannot have been in existence for longer than the Earth itself.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_the_Earth_411b.html" title="Edit section: Discovery of radioactivity">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Discovery of radioactivity</span></h3>
<p>By the turn of the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>, Thomson had been made <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Kelvin_3362.html" title="Lord Kelvin">Lord Kelvin</a> in appreciation of his many scientific accomplishments. He had reason to feel confident of himself, and the fact that multiple attempts to determine the age of the Earth seemed to show that it was about 100 million years old led him to feel very certain that his estimates were correct. The geologists could only suggest (correctly) that Kelvin didn't have all the facts, and they still believed that the Earth was far older than 100 million years.</p>
<p>The breakthrough that would ultimately resolve the conflict took place in 1896, when the French chemist <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henri_Becquerel_095c.html" title="Henri Becquerel">A. Henri Becquerel</a> discovered <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radioactivity.html" title="Radioactivity">radioactivity</a>. In <a href="../../../1/8/9/1898.html" title="1898">1898</a>, two other French researchers, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maria_Sklodowska-Curie_fb05.html" title="Maria Sklodowska-Curie">Marie</a> and <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Curie_c34c.html" title="Pierre Curie">Pierre Curie</a>, discovered the radioactive elements <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polonium.html" title="Polonium">polonium</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radium.html" title="Radium">radium</a>. In 1903 Pierre Curie and his associate Albert Laborde announced that radium produces enough heat to melt its own weight in ice in less than an hour.</p>
<p>Geologists quickly realized that the discovery of radioactivity upset the assumptions on which most calculations of the age of the Earth were based. These calculations assumed that the Earth and Sun had been created at some time in the past and had been steadily cooling since that time. Radioactivity provided a process that generated heat. George Darwin and Joly were the first to point this out, also in 1903.</p>
<p>There was the issue of whether the Earth contained enough radioactive material to significantly affect its rate of cooling. In 1901 two German schoolteachers, Julius Elster and Hans F. Geitel, had detected radioactivity in the air and then in the soil. Other investigators found it in rainwater, snow, and <a href="../../../g/r/o/Groundwater.html" title="Groundwater">groundwater</a>. Robert J. Strutt of Imperial College, London, found traces of radium in many rock samples, and concluded that the Earth contained more than enough radioactive material to keep it warm for a long, long time.</p>
<p>Strutt's work created controversy in the scientific community. Lord Kelvin spoke for those who still believed in the older estimates, fighting a stubborn rear-guard action in public against the new findings up to his death in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1907.html" title="1907">1907</a>, though he admitted in private that his calculations had been shown to be incorrect.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>To feel completely vindicated, scientists needed to come up with new and more rigorous estimates of the age of the Earth. Radioactivity, which had overthrown the old calculations, yielded a bonus by providing a basis for new calculations, in the form of radiometric dating.</p>
<p><a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_Rutherford_48e8.html" title="Ernest Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Soddy_7ec9.html" title="Frederick Soddy">Frederick Soddy</a> had continued their work on radioactive materials and concluded that radioactivity was due to a spontaneous transmutation of atomic elements. In radioactive decay, an element breaks down into another, lighter element, releasing alpha, beta, or gamma <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radioactive_decay.html" title="Radioactive decay">radiation</a> in the process. They also determined that a particular radioactive element decays into another element at a distinctive rate. This rate is given in terms of a "<a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-life.html" title="Half-life">half-life</a>", or the amount of time it takes half of a mass of that radioactive material to break down into its "decay product".</p>
<p>Some radioactive materials have short half-lives; some have long half-lives. <a href="../../../u/r/a/Uranium.html" title="Uranium">Uranium</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thorium.html" title="Thorium">thorium</a>, and <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radium.html" title="Radium">radium</a> have long half-lives, and so persist in the Earth's crust, but radioactive elements with short half-lives have generally disappeared. This suggested that it might be possible to measure the age of the Earth by determining the relative proportions of radioactive materials in geological samples. In reality, radioactive elements do not always decay into nonradioactive ("stable") elements directly, instead, decaying into other radioactive elements that have their own half-lives and so on, until they reach a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stable_element.html" title="Stable element">stable element</a>. Such "decay series", such as the uranium-radium and thorium series, were known within a few years of the discovery of radioactivity, and provided a basis for constructing techniques of radiometric dating.</p>
<p>The pioneers of radioactivity were <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertram_B._Boltwood_bf25.html" title="Bertram B. Boltwood">Bertram B. Boltwood</a>, a young chemist just out of <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_University_757c.html" title="Yale University">Yale</a>, and the energetic Rutherford. Boltwood had conducted studies of radioactive materials as a consultant, and when Rutherford lectured at Yale in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1904.html" title="1904">1904</a>, Boltwood was inspired to describe the relationships between elements in various decay series. Late in 1904, Rutherford took the first step toward radiometric dating by suggesting that the <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_particle.html" title="Alpha particle">alpha particles</a> released by radioactive decay could be trapped in a rocky material as <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helium.html" title="Helium">helium</a> atoms. At the time, Rutherford was only guessing at the relationship between alpha particles and helium atoms, but he would prove the connection four years later.</p>
<p>Soddy and <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_William_Ramsay_1173.html" title="Sir William Ramsay">Sir William Ramsay</a>, then at <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_College_f5fc.html" title="University College">University College</a> in London, had just determined the rate at which radium produces alpha particles, and Rutherford proposed that he could determine the age of a rock sample by measuring its concentration of helium. He dated a rock in his possession to an age of 40 million years by this technique. Rutherford wrote,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>I came into the room, which was half dark, and presently spotted Lord Kelvin in the audience and realized that I was in trouble at the last part of my speech dealing with the age of the earth, where my views conflicted with his. To my relief, Kelvin fell fast asleep, but as I came to the important point, I saw the old bird sit up, open an eye, and cock a baleful glance at me! Then a sudden inspiration came, and I said, 'Lord Kelvin had limited the age of the earth, provided no new source was discovered. That prophetic utterance refers to what we are now considering tonight, radium!' Behold! the old boy beamed upon me.</i><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rutherford assumed that the rate of decay of radium as determined by Ramsay and Soddy was accurate, and that helium didn't escape from the sample over time. Rutherford's scheme was inaccurate, but it was a useful first step.</p>
<p>Boltwood focused on the end products of decay series. In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1905.html" title="1905">1905</a>, he suggested that <a href="../../../l/e/a/Lead.html" title="Lead">lead</a> was the final stable product of the decay of radium. It was already known that radium was an intermediate product of the decay of uranium. Rutherford joined in, outlining a decay process in which radium emitted five alpha particles through various intermediate products to end up with lead, and speculated that the radium-lead decay chain could be used to date rock samples. Boltwood did the legwork, and by the end of 1905 had provided dates for 26 separate rock samples, ranging from 92 to 570 million years. He did not publish these results, which was fortunate because they were flawed by measurement errors and poor estimates of the half-life of radium. Boltwood refined his work and finally published the results in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1907.html" title="1907">1907</a>.</p>
<p>Boltwood's paper pointed out that samples taken from comparable layers of strata had similar lead-to-uranium ratios, and that samples from older layers had a higher proportion of lead, except where there was evidence that lead had <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leaching.html" title="Leaching">leached</a> out of the sample. However, his studies were flawed by the fact that the decay series of thorium was not understood, which led to incorrect results for samples that contained both uranium and thorium. However, his calculations were far more accurate than any that had been performed to that time. Refinements in the technique would later give ages for Boltwood's 26 samples of 250 million to 1.3 billion years.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_the_Earth_411b.html" title="Edit section: Arthur Holmes establishes radiometric dating">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Arthur Holmes establishes radiometric dating</span></h3>
<p>Although Boltwood published his paper in a prominent geological journal, the geological community had little interest in radioactivity. Boltwood gave up work on radiometric dating and went on to investigate other decay series. Rutherford remained mildly curious about the issue of the age of the Earth but did little work on it.</p>
<p>Robert Strutt tinkered with Rutherford's helium method until 1910 and then ceased. However, Strutt's student <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Holmes_7452.html" title="Arthur Holmes">Arthur Holmes</a> became interested in radiometric dating and continued to work on it after everyone else had given up. Holmes focused on lead dating, because he regarded the helium method as unpromising. He performed measurements on rock samples in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911.html" title="1911">1911</a> and concluded that the oldest was about 1.6 billion years old. These calculations were not particularly trustworthy. For example, he assumed that the samples had contained only uranium and no lead when they were formed.</p>
<p>More important, in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1913.html" title="1913">1913</a> research was published showing that elements generally exist in multiple variants with different masses, or "<a href="../../../i/s/o/Isotope.html" title="Isotope">isotopes</a>". In the 1930s, isotopes would be shown to have nuclei with differing numbers of the neutral particles known as "<a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutrons.html" title="Neutrons">neutrons</a>". In that same year, other research was published establishing the rules for radioactive decay, allowing more precise identification of decay series.</p>
<p>Many geologists felt these new discoveries made radiometric dating so complicated as to be worthless. Holmes felt that they gave him tools to improve his techniques, and he plodded ahead with his research, publishing before and after the First World War. His work was generally ignored until the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a>, though in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a> Joseph Barrell, a professor of geology at Yale, redrew geological history as it was understood at the time to conform to Holmes's findings in radiometric dating. Barrell's research determined that the layers of strata had not all been laid down at the same rate, and so current rates of geological change could not be used to provide accurate timelines of the history of the Earth.</p>
<p>Holmes's persistence finally began to pay off in 1921, when the speakers at the yearly meeting of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science_4c62.html" title="British Association for the Advancement of Science">British Association for the Advancement of Science</a> came to a rough consensus that the Earth was a few billion years old, and that radiometric dating was credible. No great push to embrace radiometric dating followed, however, and the die-hards in the geological community stubbornly resisted. They had never cared for attempts by physicists to intrude in their domain, and had successfully ignored them so far. The growing weight of evidence finally tilted the balance in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a>, when the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_National_Research_Council_2ca5.html" title="United States National Research Council">National Research Council</a> of the US <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Academy_of_Sciences_baad.html" title="National Academy of Sciences">National Academy of Sciences</a> finally decided to resolve the question of the age of the Earth by appointing a committee to investigate. Holmes, being one of the few people on Earth who was trained in radiometric dating techniques, was a committee member, and in fact wrote most of the final report.</p>
<p>The report concluded that radioactive dating was the only reliable means of pinning down geological time scales. Questions of bias were deflected by the great and exacting detail of the report. It described the methods used, the care with which measurements were made, and their error bars and limitations.</p>

<p>Radiometric dating continues to be the predominant way scientists date geologic timescales. Techniques for radioactive dating have been tested and fine tuned for the past 50+ years. Forty or so different dating techniques are utilized to date a wide variety of materials, and dates for the same sample using these techniques are in very close agreement on the age of the material.</p>
<p>Possible contamination problems do exist, but they have been studied and dealt with by careful investigation; leading to sample preparation procedures being minimized to limit the chance of contamination. Hundreds to thousands of measurements are done daily with excellent precision and accurate results. Even so, research continues to refine and improve radiometric dating to this day.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_the_Earth_411b.html" title="Edit section: Why meteorites were used">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Why meteorites were used</span></h4>
<p>Today's accepted age of the Earth of 4.55 billion years was determined by <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clair_Cameron_Patterson_2412.html" title="Clair Cameron Patterson">C.C. Patterson</a> using Uranium-Lead dating on fragments of the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canyon_Diablo_meteorite_74b8.html" title="Canyon Diablo meteorite">Canyon Diablo meteorite</a> and published in 1956.</p>
<p>The quoted age of the Earth is derived, in part, from the Canyon Diablo meteorite for several important reasons and is built upon a modern understanding of cosmochemistry built up over decades of research.</p>
<p>Most geological samples from the Earth are unable to give a direct date of the formation of the Earth from the solar nebula because the Earth has undergone <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stratification.html" title="Stratification">stratification</a> into the core, mantle and crust, and this has then undergone a long history of mixing and unmixing of these sample reservoirs by <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plate_tectonics.html" title="Plate tectonics">plate tectonics</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weathering.html" title="Weathering">weathering</a> and <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrothermal_circulation.html" title="Hydrothermal circulation">hydrothermal circulation</a>.</p>
<p>All of these processes may adversely affect isotopic dating mechanisms because the sample cannot always be assumed to have remained as a closed system, by which it is meant that either the parent or daughter nucleide or an intermediate daughter nucleide may have been partially removed from the sample, which will skew the resulting isotopic date. To mitigate this effect it is usual to date several minerals in the same sample, to provide an isochron. Alternately, more than one dating system may be used on a sample to check the date.</p>
<p>Some meteorites are furthermore considered to represent the primitive material from which the accreting solar disk was formed. Some have behaved as closed systems (for some isotopic systems) soon after the solar disk and the planets formed. To date, these assumptions are supported by much scientific observation and repeated isotopic dates, and it is certainly a more robust hypothesis than that which assumes a terrestrial rock has retained its original composition.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, ancient <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archaean.html" title="Archaean">Archaean</a> lead <a href="../../../o/r/e/Ores.html" title="Ores">ores</a> of <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galena.html" title="Galena">galena</a> have been used to date the formation of the Earth as these represent the earliest formed lead-only minerals on the planet and record the earliest homogeneous lead-lead isotope systems on the planet. These have returned age dates of 4.54 billion years with a precision of as little as 1% margin for error.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_the_Earth_411b.html" title="Edit section: Why the Canyon Diablo meteorite was used">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Why the Canyon Diablo meteorite was used</span></h4>
<p>The Canyon Diablo meteorite was used because it is a very large representative of a particularly rare type of meteorite which contains <a href="../../../s/u/l/Sulfide.html" title="Sulfide">sulfide</a> minerals (particularly <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troilite.html" title="Troilite">troilite</a>), metallic <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nickel.html" title="Nickel">nickel</a>-<a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron.html" title="Iron">iron</a> alloys, plus silicate minerals.</p>
<p>This is important because the presence of the three mineral phases allows investigation of isotopic dates using samples which provide a great separation in concentrations between parent and daughter nucleides. This is particularly true of uranium and lead. Lead is strongly <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chalcophile.html" title="Chalcophile">chalcophile</a> and is found in the sulfide at a much greater concentration than in the silicate, versus uranium. Because of this segregation in the parent and daughter nucleides during the formation of the meteorite, this allowed a much more precise date of the formation of the solar disk and hence the planets than ever before.</p>
<p>The Canyon Diablo date has been backed up by hundreds of other dates, from both terrestrial samples and other meteorites. The meteorite samples, however, show a spread from 4.53 to 4.58 billion years ago. This is interpreted as the duration of formation of the solar nebula and its collapse into the solar disk to form the sun and the planets. This 50 million year time span allows for accretion of the planets from the original solar dust and meteorites.</p>
<p>The moon as another extraterrestrial body which has not undergone plate tectonics and which has no atmosphere, provides quite precise age dates from the samples returned from the Apollo missions. Rocks returned from the moon have been dated at a maximum of around 4.4 and 4.5 billion years old. Martian meteorites which have landed upon the Earth, have also been dated to around 4.5 billion years old by lead-lead dating.</p>
<p>Altogether the concordance of age dates of both the earliest terrestrial lead reservoirs and all other reservoirs within the solar system found to date are used to support the hypothesis that the Earth and the rest of the solar system formed at around 4.53 to 4.58 billion years ago.</p>

In <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu_cosmology.html" title="Hindu cosmology">Hindu cosmology</a>, a universe endures for about 4,320,000,000 <a href="../../../y/e/a/Years.html" title="Years">years</a> (one day of <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahma.html" title="Brahma">Brahma</a>, the creator or <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalpa_%28time_unit%29.html" title="Kalpa (time unit)">kalpa</a>) and is then destroyed by fire or water elements. At this point, Brahma rests for one night, just as long as the day. This process, named <a href="../../../p/r/a/Pralaya.html" title="Pralaya">pralaya</a> (<i>Cataclysm</i>), repeats for 100 Brahma years (311 trillion human years) that represents Brahma's lifespan. We are currently believed to be in the 51st year of the present Brahma and so about 155 trillion years have elapsed since he was born as Brahma. After Brahma's 'death', it is necessary that another 100 Brahma years pass until he is reborn and the whole creation begins anew. This process is repeated again and again, forever.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">Chinese</a> thought the Earth was created and destroyed in cycles of over 23 million years. Westerners were more conservative.

<p>Several schools of thought in ancient <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a> had conceived of the idea of <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_time.html" title="Deep time">deep time</a> which stretched far into the past, or far into the future beyond the end of humankind. <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristotle.html" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> thought the Earth and <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universe.html" title="Universe">universe</a> had existed from eternity.

Both camps normally hold that the Earth is 6,000 to 10,000 years old, based on the initial creation account of Genesis 1:1 to 2:4, as well as the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genealogy.html" title="Genealogy">genealogies</a> of humanity provided in the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> thereafter.</p>
<p>There has been some question as to the time frame within the genealogies in Genesis.

Other interpretations (mostly <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodox_Jews_cec6.html" title="Orthodox Jews">Orthodox Jewish interpretations</a>) point to the use of exact Hebrew grammatical construction in the genealogies; these would include: Usage of the direct object marker '<a href="../../../e/t/h/Eth.html" title="Eth">eth</a>' with <i>wayyoled</i>, and use of hiphil <a href="../../../w/a/w/Waw.html" title="Waw">waw consecutive</a> imperfect with the verb <i>yalad</i>, "beget". Other signposts of the text of Genesis being written as strict historical narrative (i.e., extensive use of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colophon.html" title="Colophon">colophons</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/w/Waw.html" title="Waw">waw consecutives</a> throughout) are used to account for a fairly strict genealogy in Genesis, as is confirmed by such Jewish historians as <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josephus.html" title="Josephus">Josephus</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> This then allows no more than several thousand years to account for Earth history.</p>
