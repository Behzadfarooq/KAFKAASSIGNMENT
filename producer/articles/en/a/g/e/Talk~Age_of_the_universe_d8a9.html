<p>Sorry, but some of this stuff really is too hard to make sense of by making minor corrections, so i've cut it out (today <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 13:38, 3 Dec 2004 (UTC)) and pasted it here in case anyone wants to make sense of it:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>This allows us to describe how the universe has evolved over time using an equation like this: <span class="texhtml"><i>t</i> = <i>t</i><sub>0</sub>(1 + <i>z</i>)<sup>3</sup>(1 + <i>w</i>) / 2</span>. As you can see, things are starting to get a bit more tricky, but this equation simply relates the age of the universe to the redshift. This particular example has an additional term w, which comes from something called the equation of state, relating the pressure and density of the universe (p=wdc^2, where p is pressure, d is density and c^2 is the speed of light squared).</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>For a standard model (cosmological constant = constant or zero, no quintessence), we have w = -1, and this equation gives t = t_0 (1+z)^0 = t_0 so time is constant and the universe doesn't expand at all. Maybe this is one of the early historical models with some minor error, but i don't recognise it. <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 13:38, 3 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Things do start to get technical here, but there is a nice confirmation of this model which actually validates it against recent observations. Coming back to the math, the change in the distance is related to time with the redshift relation <span class="texhtml"><i>t</i> = <i>t</i><sub>(</sub>1 + <i>z</i>)<sup>2</sup></span>. However, there is an additional change in time related to redshift as <span class="texhtml"><i>t</i> = <i>t</i><i>o</i>(1 + <i>z</i>)<sup>1 / 2</sup></span>, which (the product of both) brings us back to the original form for our "dust" w=0 universe. The idea of time-variable time probably sounds bizarre, but this is expected since there is no "absolute" concept of time in General Relativity.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The two formulae look weird, i can't make sense of the discussion, and saying that there is no <i>absolute</i> concept of time in GR is misleading, since GR applied to the universe in the standard FLRW model very definitely has a favoured time axis in the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comoving_coordinates.html" title="Comoving coordinates">comoving coordinates</a> system.</p>
<p><br />
The Planck stuff needs some checking too - i'm not familiar with stuff that theoretical, so i'm not sure whether it's meaningful or not. <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 13:38, 3 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was about to post that question myself. If a section or statement does not have a citation, it is thus unverifiable by Wiki standards and should be removed. However, this section provides a valuable bit of information to the article so... we should try to find some peer-reviewed articles or texts that discuss the CNO statements (try Google Scholar). If we can't, the section should be removed. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrobayes_1618.html" title="User:Astrobayes">Astrobayes</a> 22:53, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I moved this section to after the "Age Based on Cosmological Parameters" section. I think that since the CNO studies are speculative it's a good idea to put them after the generally accepted argument based on cosmological parameters and the Friedmann equation. This way the article flows a little better, since the canonical WMAP value gets explained more or less right away... <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesino_560b.html" title="User:Wesino">Wesino</a> 09:38, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I changed "roughly 14.7 billion" to "roughly 15 billion." When you only have accuracy to within a billion years, you don't keep a fraction of a billion years part of the estimate. Significant digits.</p>

<p>I do more basic proofreading than science, which led me to this apparent typo: "Obviously, the entropy increases (due to <b>graviational</b> in fall) and this has the effect that the universe has become cooler than this simple model predicts." I almost corrected it to "gravitational", but that makes the sentence look backwards. Gravitational in fall of a meteorite, for instance, would convert gravitational potential energy to heat energy, and get hotter, not cooler - although I agree that it would increase entropy. Did I discover a typo and/or a more serious mistake? <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_LaPella_8451.html" title="User:Art LaPella">Art LaPella</a> 02:36, August 22, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I do not know where you are looking. Please direct me to the page with "graviational" <a href="../../../p/d/n/User%7EPdn_a12d.html" title="User:Pdn">Pdn</a> 16:28, 22 August 2005 (UTC)OOps I see the page and the item on it.

<p>This whole section looks amateurish, but I am not sure I'm qualified to fix it. One example is that the author refers to the Planck temperature as "measurable" and tries to project forward from it. But that is trying to look way past where we can see - we can't see past the "surface of last scattering" of the CMB. The stuff about Planck temperature is all done by estimating backwards in time from then, and using particle physics, and so it cannot serve as a useful age marker. In fact, things ran so fast near the Planck temperature that the time interval to get way below it is inconsequential compared to the present age. I am not sure if I could get Ned Wright, for example, to fix this. (see <a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmolog.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmolog.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). There is a generic Wiki-problem here - there is a lot of good information out there already, and it is not clear that Wikipedia can attract authors who want to spend time on poorly supervised pages repeating what they have said elsewhere, or what is in books. Wikipedia may be turning into a forum for creationists, "General Semanticists" (<a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Semantics_6eba.html" title="General Semantics">General Semantics</a>), and other cranks to vent their ideas. I mean, really, do you have to study the works of Korzybski to learn that dogs do not create handbooks or literature, or that words are to be distinguished from the objects they refer to? <a href="../../../p/d/n/User%7EPdn_a12d.html" title="User:Pdn">Pdn</a> 16:58, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've experimented with <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_c546.html" title="Wikipedia:Template messages">Wikipedia:Template messages</a> when dealing with something wrong that I can't fix - simple example, <a href="../../../b/a/o/Baotou.html" title="Baotou">Baotou</a>. Templates might embarrass this stuff away, or at least warn people not to believe it. Here are some templates that we might want to choose from for the "Age based on temperature" section here: (I removed templates afterwards - they made the talk page show up in categories. 8/27/05)</p>
<p>Beyond that, I think Wikipedia is too democratic. Nobody is really equal, even though some situations go smoother by pretending they are. In particular, I would establish a class of newbies, forbidden to edit except indirectly, on a new provisional edit page that has to be approved by others. A newbie could graduate if enough text or changes are substantially approved. A banned user returning as a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppet_9d8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppet">Wikipedia:sock puppet</a> would have to qualify all over again. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_LaPella_8451.html" title="User:Art LaPella">Art LaPella</a> 20:51, August 22, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>2943K the temperature of a dully-glowing poker? I think not: iron melts at a mere 1811K. I don't feel adequately qualified to edit the page, though.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've done a bit of poking (heh) around other articles. Unless you're using a tungsten carbide poker (melting point 3143K), you don't really stand a chance of getting a poker anywhere near that hot. I thought for a bit that it might have been a mistake with someone mistaking fahrenheit for kelvin, but even if that were the case the poker would be far from dull (iron melts at 2800 degrees fahrenheit, and alloys like steel at less than that).

<p>The bit about the Planck temperature and the comments following in the article are really a minefield of numbers and concepts that are not well described...and I do have the education to understand them, they're just poorly written. Would the original author of these statements please respond as to what she or he was trying to convey? It doesn't add much to the article as it stands and should be rewritten.

<dd>I have rewritten this section, Wikified it, and given it an understandable basis. As it stood before, it was a mess and added nothing to the article.

I hope everyone enjoys it now. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrobayes_1618.html" title="User:Astrobayes">Astrobayes</a> 22:19, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the "derivation" of the age of the Universe in terms of its temperature should be removed not only because the argument is difficult to follow, but because it is just plain wrong. Here is why:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>For a physically-motivated counter example, one can compare the age of two spatially flat universes with the same CMB temperature (2.7K), but where one model includes a cosmological constant and the other does not (where the matter density is adjusted appropriately to keep the curvature zero). You find that the universe with the c.c. has a larger age than the other. Therefore, because the ages are different but the temperatures are the same, the age of the universe cannot depend on the CMB temperature alone. Historically, the fact that the cosmological constant increases the age of the universe was one of the early arguments that suggested that a c.c. was necessary in the standard cosmological model, since there appeared to be globular clusters that were older than a matter-dominated Universe without a c.c. See <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedmann_equations.html" title="Friedmann equations">Friedmann equations</a> but there doesn't seem to be a reference to the age as a function of various other cosmological parameters that I can find.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>A very much more elementary reason this argument cannot be correct is the following. Suppose the age of the universe <i>t</i> is inversely proportional to the square of the temperature (as asserted). Then since temperature is inversely proportional to the <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scale_factor_%28Universe%29_37b6.html" title="Scale factor (Universe)">Scale factor (Universe)</a> this implies that the scale factor <i>a(t)</i> goes like t<sup>1/2</sup>. This is patently false for the vast majority of the history of the universe -- again see the Friedmann equation page (today the scale factor is growing nearly exponentially, and during matter domination between redshifts of about z=1 and z=10,000 it went like t<sup>2/3</sup>). The only case where this argument is true is during radiation domination. Since the fraction of the Universe's total energy density in radiation is currently around 1 part in 10,000, this is clearly not the case today.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So the only reason that this argument can give anything close to the correct value is due to some kind of numerical coincidence.</dd>

<dd>Now, what <i>is</i> true is that if you do the integrals required to calculate the age of the universe carefully, they all turn out to be of the form 1/(Hubble parameter today) times (function of the fractions of matter, radiation, etc.) So a good back-of-the-envelope statement is that the age of the universe is roughly today's Hubble parameter. Inserting a reasonable value -- 72 km/s/Mpc -- in <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%281+megaparsec+%2F+72+kilometers+%29+seconds+in+years&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%281+megaparsec+%2F+72+kilometers+%29+seconds+in+years&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">Google</a> gives an age estimate of 13.6 Gyr, which is almost precisely correct (and for the right reasons!)</dd>

<dd>Hi Wesino. I don't have a problem with the section being deleted. It was part of a discussion that someone <b>else</b> posted into this article <i>as is</i>. I took a quick stab at updating it a while back, but I couldn't possibly do it justice in a Wikipedia page. It is derived from a principle and, in fact, not "some kind of numerical coincidence". I don't mind discussing it further if you are interested. Thanks <a href="../../../n/o/d/User%7ENodem_1e29.html" title="User:Nodem">Nodem</a> 05:21, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm glad you're OK with the edit, Nodem. I didn't mean to offend by calling it a "numerical coincidence." However that's the only reason I can think of for the calculation giving anywhere close to the right answer, except during radiation domination (which anyway is a poor approximation to our Universe at z &lt; 10,000 or so).</dd>

<dd>It's possible that there's a principle behind it, but it seems that the principle must be false, or at least in severe conflict with observations. As explained above, the essential reason is that it gives a time-temperature relation, and thus a time-scale factor relation, that would</dd>

<ul>
<li>imply the universe is <b>de</b>celerating (since a(t) ~ t<sup>1/2</sup>) in conflict with SNIa observations,</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Without going into detail, the relationship a(t) ~ t<sup>1/2</sup> was from a normalized model and should not be interpreted in the context of the standard model. Also, the universe is not necessarily accelerating/decelerating. This is a conclusion drawn from one specific model using a set of assumptions. The standard model may be right, but until someone detects a WIMP, explains/resolves the various dark energy issues (like where theory and observation conflict by 120 orders of magnitude), I would stick to statements like: <i>"The high-z SNIa appear to be fainter than a simple matter dominated FRW universe based on their observed host galaxy redshift. This may be due to the fact they are further away, which in turn could be that the rate of expansion has increased, which if due to some invisible force, that if we now insert into the mass/energy budget of the universe we could partially fix another problem, although at the expense of the cosmological principle"</i>. Statements of the type "the universe <b>is</b> doing this or that" can become a lot of rope from which one could easily hang. Yes, the current observations are very impressive (considering a decade or two ago there was almost nothing), but they are far from conclusive. Also note that there are some pretty bright folks developing alternatives (like MOND), so I'm not a minority voice in questioning the <i>absolute truth</i> of Lambda CDM.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>disagree with observations of structure formation, which need a matter dominated epoch a(t) ~ t<sup>2/3</sup> followed by dark energy domination,</li>

<dd>Again, the relationship a(t) ~ t<sup>1/2</sup> should not be treated in a comparison like this.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>be in conflict with the cosmic microwave background anisotropy, and especially the location of the first peak (since this essentially measures the angular diameter distance to the surface of last scattering, which depends on the behavior of the scale factor since then),</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>ditto</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>require us to replace the Friedmann equations and thus Einstein gravity. In fact, since the radiation density is extremely tiny today, to get a(t) ~ t<sup>1/2</sup> matter could not gravitate at all -- definitely in conflict with observation.</li>

<dd>From your responses to my points it seems like you're quite enthusiastic about this idea. Lambda-CDM has a few problems and perhaps someday a better theory will be found. But right now you're talking about a "principle," which is associated with a "normalized model" that <i>can</i> be compared to LambdaCDM as far as age calculations go, but can <i>not</i> be compared to classic LambdaCDM predictions or cosmological observations, apparently only predicts (or assumes?) an age-temperature relation, and -- perhaps most importantly for an encyclopedia -- isn't backed up by reliable sources. Perhaps someday it'll be worthy of a journal article or more. But I think we can both agree that for now it doesn't belong in an encyclopedia.</dd>

<p>In its most basic form, the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Bang_a993.html" title="Big Bang">Big Bang</a> theory is based on the idea that the universe was smaller, denser, and hotter in the past. Assuming, therefore, that the initial temperature of the universe is known, and that the change in temperature over time is accurately modeled, the age of the universe can be extrapolated from a measurement of the current temperature of the universe (approximately 2.7 <a href="../../../k/_/_/K.html" title="K">K</a>).</p>
<p>An expanding (or contracting) universe is given a <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scale_factor_%28universe%29.html" title="Scale factor (universe)">scale factor</a> to indicate its current size in relation to a fixed point. This could be a simple distance, or a <a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimensionless.html" title="Dimensionless">dimensionless</a> ratio of one distance (the size now) divided by a size in the past. In the case of a ratio like this, the present scale factor of the universe is one, and for an expanding universe, the scale factor in the past is less than one. Given a universe with scale factor <span class="texhtml"><i>a</i></span>, the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redshift.html" title="Redshift">redshift</a> <span class="texhtml"><i>z</i></span> of an object in the universe is simply the inverse of the scale factor minus one: <span class="texhtml"><i>z</i> = 1 − (1 / <i>a</i>(<i>t</i>))</span>, or <span class="texhtml"><i>a</i>(<i>t</i>) = 1 / (1 + <i>z</i>)</span>.</p>
<p>The temperature of the universe at a given time is <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inverse_proportion.html" title="Inverse proportion">inversely proportional</a> to its scale factor at that time; somewhat analogous to a gas that would cool down if expanded, or heat up if compressed, the temperature of the universe is thus related to redshift as <span class="texhtml"><i>T</i> = <i>T</i><sub>0</sub>(1 + <i>z</i>)</span>. We can do a quick test by using the current temperature of 2.7K and the redshift of <a href="../../../c/m/b/CMB_ff55.html" title="CMB">CMB</a> as 1089 to calculate the temperature of the decoupling surface <span class="texhtml"><i>T</i> = 2.7 * 1090 = 2943K</span> (this is the temperature of the universe when the CMB was emitted.)</p>
<p>In a universe like our own, most of the contents is in the form that does not exert a pressure on its surroundings (clouds of hydrogen gas, stars, planets etc). This is a pressureless, or "dust" model. For this kind of cosmological model, the evolution of the universe (scale factor at a specific time) is <span class="texhtml"><i>t</i> = <i>t</i><sub>0</sub>(1 + <i>z</i>) <sup>− 3 / 2</sup></span>. Putting in the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redshift.html" title="Redshift">redshift</a> of 1089 for the <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmic_microwave_background.html" title="Cosmic microwave background">cosmic microwave background</a> and a current age of the universe <img class='tex' src="../../../math/1/4/4/144271ae6171c1dfdae8f60a8c853dc7.png" alt="t_0 \approx 13.7" /> Gyr indicates the CMB was emitted around 380,000 years after the <i>birth</i> of the universe.</p>
<p>The earliest measurable point in the evolution of the universe is the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planck_time.html" title="Planck time">Planck time</a>, when the universe would be at the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planck_temperature.html" title="Planck temperature">Planck temperature</a>. The Planck temperature represents the maximum attainable temperature in the physical universe and can only be attained via an extreme event, such as the evaporation of a black hole (the Planck temperature is the Hawking temperature of a black hole with a radius of the Planck length <img class='tex' src="../../../math/0/c/b/0cb371c16e93cc57eff6cb0d3373835c.png" alt="4.5 \times 10^{30}" />K). Therefore <span class="texhtml"><i>T</i><i>p</i> = <i>T</i><i>o</i>(1 + <i>z</i><sub>max</sub>)</span>, where <span class="texhtml"><i>T</i><sub>0</sub> = 2.725</span>K and now <span class="texhtml"><i>z</i><sub>max</sub></span> is the maximum redshift as if seen from the Planck time <span class="texhtml"><i>t</i><sub><i>p</i></sub></span>. Using the radiation dominated formula above, we arrive at an age of the universe of 11.667 Gyr.</p>
<p>This is not the end of the story however: First we must take into consideration the matter domination, which in this calculation is equivalent to a change in the value of the Planck time itself. This is a fairly simple integration and results in an age one third greater at 15.556 Gyr. Finally, this model was also simplified by considering that the <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entropy.html" title="Entropy">entropy</a> of the universe is constant. Obviously, the entropy increases (due to graviational in fall) and this has the effect that the universe has become cooler than this simple model predicts. The difference here is around 13.5% (the temperature would be 6.5% higher if entropy had not increased, so the age difference is this squared). This adjustment finally brings the temperature calculated age down to the WMAP age.</p>

<p>380,000 years as the age of the Universe? This doesn't even deserve to be dignified with a proper response. It needs to be removed immediately - as it stands, it compromises the integrity and perception of empricism that Wikipedia holds dear. Justifications of ludicrous religious theories, regardless of how widespread they are, doesn't deserve a place in an encyclopaedia.</p>
<p>This trend in Wikipedia towards including right-wing political, religious and moral sensibilities as valid 'criticism,' no matter how outlandish or utterly falsified by modern science, is disturbing and an indication of intellectual laziness and misguided belief that simply because there are two opposing positions, the factual middle ground is somewhere evenly between the two. In reality, almost no respectably accreditted scientist supports Creationsim, yet it seems that we must always qualify an article on evolution with the 'opposing view' of Creationism. Really, these opposing opinions deserve no more place in Wikipedia than the 'stork theory' in human reproduction.</p>

<p>I am a physicist, I have studied astrophysics, astronomy, and cosmology for years, and this is my suggestion: the first sentence of this article has to go, and asap. Because it is simply not true. It states, "Nothing is certain as to the extent of either the age or size of the universe..." That is factually at odds with the very laws of physics used to calculate the age of the Universe. Not only is there a currently accepted age of the universe, which is calculated in several different ways arriving at the same order of magnitude but in fact, the age of the universe is currently accepted within about 1.4% error. Since this is fact, it needs to be presented in this article as such; just <a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/age.html" class="external text" title="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/age.html" rel="nofollow">click here</a> for a clear and concise explanation of <i>actual measurments</i> of the age of the universe that are not based upon cosmological <i>models for those measurments</i>, such as the big bang. To leave the first sentence as it currently stands would be an egregious offense to the policies of WP to promote NPOV for this subject. I plan on making a change soon and I would like suggestions from those of you who have researched this subject, and understand a way to present it to a general audience for their maximum benefit. I realize how this can be a confusing issue for many people. To be able to do something as complex as measure the age of the universe requires advanced mathematics well beyond what most people are comfortable with, so there needs to be some way to balance the presentation of these measurments from their actual foundations, with a readability for a casual observer. I'd like to work on a solution to this as soon as possible and all feedback would be welcome. Thank you for your time. C.Melton 00:12, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

I agree. I am also an astrophysicist who has studied cosmology.

<p>Just did an edit on the first paragraph. It seemed to get overly technical "very" quickly. I think that a casual reader should be able to gather that the Age of the Universe is just the time between the beginning (=Big Bang) and today. But I think this casual reader could easily be lost in the sentences about integrating proper time along curves (which linked to the Minkowski space article, which makes no sense in this context). Also, the comments jumped directly in to the various alternative models without really explaining the consensus view first (which should really be the purpose of this article, right?).</p>
<p>So I changed things a bit and made the first two sentences as simple as possible to get the idea across. Then I tried to preserve some of the discussion of other possibilities (which were largely about universes without a big bang and infinite age; I added an example of a model with a big bang but of infinite age) as well as some of the comments about the ambiguity of defining time properly in SR/GR. Hope others find that this makes the opening paragraph clearer too <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesino_560b.html" title="User:Wesino">Wesino</a> 10:04, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

I have therefore removed the poor reference and replaced it with better ones. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrobayes_1618.html" title="User:Astrobayes">Astrobayes</a> 11:18, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have also added an additional comment, backed by several peer-reviewed journal articles and one peer-reviewed Ph.D. thesis, that adds a very important point to the editor's comment about strong priors. The impetus for adding these references and my comment was that the editor seemed to be saying that you cannot trust a conclusion or result unless you consider the model first, but this is not the entire story. The model used helps constrain the confidence interval, but does not invalidate the measurment if a different model obtains slightly different results - this amounts to correctly normalizing the data, not invalidating models which the original editor seemed to suggest. There are two branches of statistical tools used in science: frequency statistics (what most people are familiar with) and Bayesian statistics. Only the latter is a tool that adjusts statistical results based upon a model (i.e. prior) being used. Since this important tool is used so often in science (I used it quite frequently when I did astrophysics research as an undergraduate), it is important that it be mentioned because it constrains our confidence intervals for age of the Universe measurments. In other words, we cannot simply eliminate a particular scientific measurement we may or may not agree with just becuase it comes from one model and not another. If this edit is reverted, there should be an overwhelming support to the contrary cited by peer-reviewed research for as it stands, it adds important NPOV content to the article. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrobayes_1618.html" title="User:Astrobayes">Astrobayes</a> 12:09, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>While there are several methods to calculate the age of the universe as we know it and they have produced similiar results, one must wonder, what does this "age" really mean? Does that mean age in our time? Age in relative time? Age in warpped time? Since there's an age, there must be a start, and I believe the most commonly accepted theory is the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Bang_a993.html" title="Big Bang">Big Bang</a>; in which case, while the universe is a <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singularity.html" title="Singularity">singularity</a>, the space-time is warpped at the point from the heavy gravitational fields, wouldn't the calculation of time (using our common time-units) be largely inaccurate as well?

<dd>Gyr is a standard abbreviation for Giga-year or billions of years (aka <span class="texhtml">10<sup>9</sup></span> Julian rotation periods of the Earth around the Sun). Other abbreviations of SI prefixes that will probably be found in physics articles and the other natural sciences would be things like: Bly = "billion light years", pc = "parsec" which is another way of writing 3.26ly or "3.26 light-years." In the natural sciences, the numerical prefixes are used continually and the shorthand for those is to use the first letter of each, e.g. G for Giga, T for Tera, k for Kilo, c for Centi, f for Femto, etc. It was not a mistake in the article to use the abbreviation but I agree that the article would be best served by using consistent units. The Giga article now reflects this. I hope that helps! Cheers, <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrobayes_1618.html" title="User:Astrobayes">Astrobayes</a> 00:12, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems to me that its about time the page was updated to reflect that scientists who used to estimate the Universe to be about 13.7 billion years old (a figure that has seemed firm since 2003, based on measurements of radiation leftover from the Big Bang) and about 156 billion light-years wide, now based on new distance measuring technique finding implies that the universe is instead <b>about</b> 15.8 billion years old and about 180 billion light-years wide.</p>
<p>I also think that there should be an inclusion of the age of the Universe based on Biblical sources included since it is the same. The basis of the calculation and the background is below taken from <a href="http://failedmessiah.typepad.com/failed_messiahcom/2005/07/rabbi_aryeh_kap.html" class="external free" title="http://failedmessiah.typepad.com/failed_messiahcom/2005/07/rabbi_aryeh_kap.html" rel="nofollow">http://failedmessiah.typepad.com/failed_messiahcom/2005/07/rabbi_aryeh_kap.html</a></p>
<p>Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan's View On The Age Of The Universe I thought it would be helpful to again summarize the position of Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryeh_Kaplan" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryeh_Kaplan" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryeh_Kaplan</a>), z"l on the age of the universe.</p>
<p>Rabbi Kaplan was both an illui (genius) in Torah and an illui in physics (After his ordination he earned a masters degree in physics. As a graduate student, Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan was described in a scientific "Who's Who" as a promising young American physicist), and was arguably the most qualified individual of the previous generation to discuss the interface of Torah and science.</p>
<p>PART 1: Background.</p>
<p>1. As long as no halakha (Jewish Law) is involved, there is no reason to paskin on (decide) an issue. 2. In his Guide to the Perplexed, the Rambam (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambam" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambam" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambam</a>) builds several shitot (philosophies) based on da'at yachid, an individual view of a sage that is not upheld by the majority. As long as this is done for hashgafah (philosophy, outlook) and not for legal issues, this is perfectly fine. 3. One cannot label an idea heretical until one has surveyed the sources. Perhaps Gedolim (the Greats) from earlier generations held the same view. If so, the view is not heresy. 4. Sefer Temunah, an early kabbalistic work attributed to the 1st century Tanna Nehunya ben ha-Kanah, is a work that discusses the kabbalistic import of the shapes of the Hebrew letters. Sefer Temunah is quoted in many different Halakhic sources (including the Beit Yosef) that deal with sofrut – writing Torah scrolls, mezuzot and megilot. 5. Sefer Temunah also comments on the Shmita Theory, the idea that sabbatical cycles existed before the creation of Adam, and that those cycles – those years – were <b>actual physical years</b>. 6. Sefer Temunah states that we are in the 6th 7,000-year sabbatical cycle and that the world is 42,000 years old. 7. The Shmita Theory became known as the Shitat Sefer Temunah. 8. Many pre-ARI (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Luria" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Luria" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Luria</a>) kabbalists accepted the Shitat Sefer Temunah, including the Ramban, his close student Yitzhak of Akko, and the RADBAZ. 9. The Ramban's position is difficult to understand if you have not first learned Shitat Sefer Temunah. 10. The ARI (Rabbi Isaac Luria) rejected Shitat Sefer Temunah and taught that these cycles were not physical years but were instead <b>spiritual, non-physical years</b>. Rabbi Moshe Cordevero agreed with the ARI. 11. Because of the spread of Lurianic Kabbalah, Shitat Sefer Temunah became less and less known. For the most part, only those few scholars who studied ancient kabbalistic works were aware of it. 12. In 1838, when the Tiferet Yisrael (Israel Lipschitz of Danzig (1782-1860) was the author of Tiferet Yisrael a well-known commentary on the Mishna. He also wrote Shevilei de'Rakiya, an introduction to the principles of Rabbinical astronomy) wrote his essay on the age of the universe that advocated a universe much older than 6,000 years, his works were banned by some hasidim. Others simply ripped the essay out of the larger work. 13. The Tiferet Yisrael's 'crime'&#160;? Not accepting the ARI's opinion as binding. (See #1, #2 and #3 above.)</p>
<p>PART 2: Could The World Have Been Created 'Old'?</p>
<p>1. No Jewish source exists to support this contention. 2. To make the world appear to be billions of years old when it is really 6000 years old is problematic:</p>
<p>a. It makes G-d appear to be deceptive. b. If one accepts the idea that G-d created an 'old' world, why not say the world was created 5 minutes ago and we with it, with all of our memories, etc. ready-made? c. Again, there is no Jewish source for this idea. [It was invented by the 19th century Christian apologist Philip Henry Gosse.]</p>
<p>3. One can believe it if one desires. Such a belief – even absent Jewish sources to support it – is not heresy.</p>
<p>PART 3: The Shita of Yitzhak of Akko (Isaac ben Samuel of Acre (fl.13th-14th century) was a kabbalist who lived in the Land of Israel).</p>
<p>1. He was a student and a colleague of the RAMBAN (Nahmanides (1194 - c. 1270) was a Catalan rabbi, philosopher, physician, Kabbalist and biblical commentator. "Nahmanides " is the common name for Moshe ben Nahman Gerondi). 2. Was one of the foremost kabbalists of his time. 3. Investigated and authenticated the Zohar (The Zohar (Hebrew זהר "Splendor, radiance") is widely considered the most important work of Kabbalah, Jewish mysticism. It is a mystical commentary on the Torah (the five books of Moses), written in medieval Aramaic and medieval Hebrew. It contains a mystical discussion of the nature of God, and, among other subjects, the origin and structure of the universe), which was then published in his lifetime. 4. Is often quoted in the Mussar classic, Reishit Hokhmah. 5. In his work Otzar HaHayyim, Yizhak of Acco writes that, because the sabbatical cycles referred to in Shitat Sefer Temunah existed before Adam, they must be <b>measured in Divine years, not human years</b>. 6. Therefore, Sefer Temunah is speaking of Divine years when it states that the world is 42,000 years old. 7. According to midrashic sources, <b>a Divine day is 1,000 earth-years long</b>. 8. <b>A Divine year would therefore equal 365,250 earth years</b>. 9. So, according to Yitzhak of Acco, <b>the Universe would be 42,000 x 365,250 earth-years old</b>. 10. That calculation comes out to <b>15.3405 billion years</b>, very close to current estimates for the Big Bang as adjusted by the recent finding that corrects the previous estimate by +15%.</p>
<p>Part 4: Conclusion.</p>
<p>1. There does not have to be a conflict between science and Torah on the age of the universe. 2. Pre-Ari Torah-teachings have in fact been confirmed by modern science.</p>

<p>I've reverted your edits for several reasons, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The introduction to this article starts off with "The age of the universe, according to the Big Bang theory, is the time elapsed between the Big Bang and the present day." That should immediately give you the idea that this article is about <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">science</a>, not religion, or even philosophy. If you want to discuss religious views on the age of the universe, please do it in a new article such as Age of the universe (religion).</li>
<li>You need to provide <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">references</a> to <a href="../../../s/o/u/WP%7ESOURCE_b1c9.html" title="WP:SOURCE">reliable sources</a>. Blogs are not considered to be reliable sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also want to look at the many discussions over at <a href="../../../b/i/g/Talk%7EBig_Bang_8875.html" title="Talk:Big Bang">Talk:Big Bang</a> about the inclusion of religious interpretations in scientific articles.<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Peel_9ea8.html" title="User:Mike Peel">Mike Peel</a> 10:27, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mike, you are not being very scientific. The article is about both religion (the primary stated origin of and therefore age of Universe) and the later 'scientific' challenge to this statement. This has been the scientific pursuit in the attempt to disprove the primary statement. The fact that the most known view in English is based on the Christian view of the Universe, itself based on the Greek beliefs, and was ignorant of other available views is not the issue. It is simply a faulty approach to gathering knowledge by the generations of scientists as defined by "scientific - since 1589, from M.Fr. scientifique, from M.L. scientificus "pertaining to science," from L. scientia "knowledge" (see science) + -ficus "making" + facere "to make" (see factitious). Originally used to translate Gk. epistemonikos "making knowledge" in Aristotle's "Ethics." First record of scientific revolution is from 1803; scientific method is from 1854; scientific notation is from 1961. from O.Fr. science, from L. scientia "knowledge," from sciens (gen. scientis), prp. of scire "to know," probably originally "to separate one thing from another, to distinguish". It seems to me the early Christian scientists not only separated the Jewish understanding of the concept of Universe/Creation, but completely ignored it. The fact is that it is the scientific discussion that is included in the religious interpretation because it came before science! One can not negate precedence of concepts. If there was no statemet of Creation in the Jewish Scriptures, there would never be a requirement to inquire into it's varacity as is indeed the case in all other non-monotheistic cultures&#160;:-)--Mrg3105 12:08, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Try reading <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_method.html" title="Scientific method">Scientific method</a>. Then have a look at the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Bang_a993.html" title="Big Bang">Big Bang</a> article, where similar issues have been discussed, and see how they have resolved it. Specifically, see the "Philosophical and religious interpretations" section, specifically the first section: "While the Big Bang is a scientific theory that is not based on any <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a>, some similarities have not gone unnoticed. There are both theological and philosophical implications, since some religious interpretations and <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_view.html" title="World view">world views</a> conflict with the Big Bang origin of the universe." I am not opposed to the discussion of pre-scientific "measures" of ages of the universe, but a) I don't want to see them intermixed with the scientific discussion (which could promote confusion between the two), and b) I don't want to see <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, hence I want <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">reliable references</a> for the information in the article. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Peel_9ea8.html" title="User:Mike Peel">Mike Peel</a> 12:52, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While I understand that the views expressed in this article are generally accepted among Wikipedia administrators, one cannot overlook the very biased <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutral_point_of_view.html" title="Neutral point of view">POV</a> in this article. I see no mention of <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Earth_creationism_db9a.html" title="Young Earth creationism">young Earth</a> debate, or of any ideas of the age of the universe, for that matter. The entire article is written from the view of a <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macroevolution.html" title="Macroevolution">macroevolutionist</a>.

<dd>The young earth position is not included because it would be giving undue weight to a fringe hypothesis. I'm not sure what you mean by "macroevolutionist"; this article is about cosmology, not biology. It is a science article so it reflects mainstream scientific research in this area.<a href="../../../n/d/t/User%7ENdteegarden_8854.html" title="User:Ndteegarden">thx1138</a> 07:54, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ndteegarden expresses the basic matter well. I suggest you read <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> "undue weight" section. Also, note that you seem to be under the common misunderstanding that the Big Bang and related issues are somehow related to each other. Evolution and the age of the universe are essentially unrelated issues. They are not. One is the concern of biologists and paelontologists the other of cosmologists and astronomers. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 08:13, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>'The young earth position is not included because it would be giving undue weight to a fringe hypothesis.' From Wiki:NPOV: "For example, the article on the Earth only very briefly refers to the Flat Earth theory, a view of a distinct minority." If you can mention that some people believe in a flat Earth, you can mention that some people believe in a young Earth–even briefly. Because a young Earth is not a belief held by only a tiny-minority, it deserves a decent explanation. --<a href="../../../y/u/r/User%7EYurimxpxman_2f94.html" title="User:Yurimxpxman">Yurimxpxman</a> 03:02, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>At the risk of being slapped on the wrist, I've gone ahead and created a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> section covering the creationist position, since that is obviously what Yurimxpxman wanted to see.
