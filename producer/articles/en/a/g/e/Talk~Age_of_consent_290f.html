<p><b><span style="font-size:120%">This article is part of the <i>Age of consent</i> group of articles project.</span></b></p>
<p><b>In the interest of accuracy and quality it was decided by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a><sup>*</sup> to hold these pages to a high standard of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> and to avoid ambiguity through the use of prose (not dot points) discussing the relevant statutes, case law or other authorities.</b></p>
<p>To this end all information must be properly referenced. Where writing about legislation or other law, <u>the appropriate statues and similar must be cited</u>. Where appropriate, portions of the legislation can be quoted. Where possible, a link to an up-to-date online copy of the legislation can be included (preferably, but not necessarily, in English). It is preferable to include any such references in-line, rather than in a separate &lt;ref&gt; section at the bottom of the page. This is to make it easier for readers to find the references in context.</p>
<p>The unfettered age of consent should be in bold text, in order that it stand out. No other ages should be in bold text. Any exceptions to should then be discussed afterwards (close in age exceptions, same sex relations etc).</p>

<p>Looking at this article what we really need to do is have, for each country, a reference to the statutes (or, if no statute, other documentation) setting the age of consent. Only then will the article truly be sourced.

<p>The list of ages needs to be cleaned up. I would do it, but wanted to seek comment to get the best way to do it since many states have exceptions. I am thinking a chart like the one for the countries and to include the exceptions as footnotes. Or the United States could get their own page <a href="../../../a/s/s/User%7EAssawyer_3644.html" title="User:Assawyer">Assawyer</a> 01:59, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that this information needs to be cleaned up. But I also must stress the need for it to be properly cited (see 'challenge' above). I don't think an extra page for exclusivly the USA is an answer - perhaps a page per continental region if we think that extra pages are required.</dd>
<dd>The whole page really does need a rethink, the introduction is good however, the following sections meander a bit and should possibly be rewritten to remove the country specific details and make them more universal. Possibly the page should me more focused with either things like marriage and protitution completely removed (put on their own separate pages?) or included as the concensus indicates. It would be good if we can settle on a format and style common to all the list sections that includes relavant information in an easily comparitive way.</dd>
<dd>I supose what we need do is think about all the issues needed to be discussed in the introduction and following sections then settle on a usefull format for the frequency chart and list of local laws below? <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonotonehell_775d.html" title="User:Monotonehell">Monotonehell</a> 05:50, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sounds good, I will go through using LexisNexis and check out the U.S. states to verify their accuracy and add legal citations. I will be using the following link to do so <a href="../../../a/s/s/User%7EAssawyer_AOC_8c2a.html" title="User:Assawyer/AOC">User:Assawyer/AOC</a>. Feel free to contribute.

<dd>Very good, however you may find yourself in trouble trying to fit the diferences in law between states into a table format. You'll end up with more footnotes than table (lol). <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonotonehell_775d.html" title="User:Monotonehell">Monotonehell</a> 10:36, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm unsure whether it's due to our requests for more statutes or just coincidence but a lot of wonderful editors have been adding citations for law in verious countries. This is great. Soon we can look at moving the countries to subpages. The question still remains as to how to order them. Recently someone boldly reordered the listing so that it's no longer in order of continent. Should the sub pages be grouped by continent(how it was) by alpha(as it is now) or some other grouping. The target should be to get roughly the same amount of text on each subpage while grouping them in a sensible manner. -- <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonotonehell_775d.html" title="User:Monotonehell">Monotonehell</a> 15:51, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems likely the entire section should be deleted pending reintroduction of entries for the various countries once they can be referenced. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomyumgoong_d4a8.html" title="User:Tomyumgoong">Tomyumgoong</a> 01:02, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interesting idea, however I think that would take a very long time to get all the referenced sources in place. We seem to be getting one every few days now. Perhaps it would be an idea to open a new section that is intended to replace the current section and move the referenced parts to there as they get added? <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonotonehell_775d.html" title="User:Monotonehell">Monotonehell</a> 07:38, 3 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps. I understand that it is difficult to replace all of these countries with referenced facts, but might it not be better to provide no information than incorrect information? It seems most of this is just lifted from the popular internet guides to age of consent, most of which are out of date and flawed. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomyumgoong_d4a8.html" title="User:Tomyumgoong">Tomyumgoong</a> 17:44, 3 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Okay I do agree with you in theory but am not bold enough to delete a whole section just like that LOL. Perhaps we could move the entire section out to a linked temporary archived page with a caveat letting people know that most of the information is unreliable at worst as it is unverified. THEN add a new section on the main page stating that ONLY properly referenced information is to be contained there.</dd>
<dd>But only once we've settled on a concensus for the format and content and written a style guide for it.</dd>

<dd>I will not have a problem being bold enough to nuke any information that does not meet the referencing standard (including what I added regarding Brazil) that's agreed to. I would be in favor of requiring that specific statutes be cited in each case, although this will be very cumbersome (considering the language barrier) for many countries. Perhaps there is another compilation or resource we are comfortable lifting information from (Interpol has such a website I believe). <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomyumgoong_d4a8.html" title="User:Tomyumgoong">Tomyumgoong</a> 01:54, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've looked at Interpol's site a number of times and found it out of date unfortunatly. Not a reliable source. I think you've talked me into the wholesale deletetion of bad information. With that indicitive chart at the top we need not have specific bad information below. I think the chart is enough and then have the relavent legal citations and discussions as per the Australia section on sub pages with links from this page. This I believe would balance the article being too large with the need for specific information.

This will take me awhile so I think I'll put a template on the page while I'm bastardising it.

<dd>Nice work! That would have taken a bit for formating. But (here's the bit where I attack all your hard work lol) as I suspected this kind of information is not something that is easily conveyed in a table. A question: The Age differentials you quote, how many are defences at court and how many are exemptions to the law?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The reason I presented the Australian section the way I did was due to the small but important differences in Laws between the states. I suspect that a reader will go to only the sections in which they are interested and read that text. The table format doesn't lend itself well to the idiocies of law and makes it a chore to extract any information. People need things explained to them in a straightforward way. However (here's where I undermine my position) doing it in this way will lead to a huge body of text (note it is already above the 31Kb sugested limit). Perhaps several regional subpages need to be created? I throw it open to discussion. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonotonehell_775d.html" title="User:Monotonehell">Monotonehell</a> 15:02, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe all are devised from the statutes, I merely copied their table. The trouble is many states don't have a bright-line age and many states have a buffer age depending on the victim and actor. In the article I provide the link to, it goes over each states laws. I plan on reading the sections to pull the nessceary citations for the laws regarding statutory rape. As for the table, it could be placed in a separate article like "List of Ages of Consent in the United States" <a href="../../../a/s/s/User%7EAssawyer_3644.html" title="User:Assawyer">Assawyer</a> 15:05, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your right, your Spanish isn't very good. The AoC in Mexico is indeed 12.

<dd>Monotonehell is right. The source cannot be relied on. Just checked the subject Russia--it states that there is NO legal concept of AOC there.

<dd>The point is exactly the opposite. We keep the unverified information out of the article until such time as it can be verified. Much of the information on Interpol is out of date (with the exception of one or two pages that have recent upadates - Japan comes to mind). What Goldminer was refering to was pre 1997 Russia's laws were so vague that the courts could interperet them on a case by case (abitary) basis. Goldminer wasn't refering to the article here.</dd>
<dd>We need both the federal and regional laws for mexico as in Mexico the federal law varies according to the age gap between partners and is often overruled by regional laws. The entries on Interpol are not specific enough to make that information <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifyable</a>.

<dd>Hi Bookmastaflex, I think the reason your edit was reverted was because you only edited the table and left the discusion below as it stands. The table is a summary of the discusion so inorder to complete your edit you'd need to do three things.</dd>
<dd>1- Find the revelent legislation after it passes through the (Canadian) House of review (I forget how the Candian legislature works - Senate, Upper House?).</dd>
<dd>2- Edit the discussion to reflect the change in the law, add a citation to the legislation as a link or footnote.</dd>
<dd>3- Move Canada's entry in the summary table.</dd>
<dd>Any entries in the discussion that are not referenced are going to be removed soon when we finalise the page cleanup so if someone doesn't update Canada then it will be removed. --<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonotonehell_775d.html" title="User:Monotonehell">Monotonehell</a> 14:02, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No one has made much comment in the past few days so I took that as a consesus of sorts and began the restructure. I'm probably halfway through now and it's very late. What I've done is laid out a structure with the information we currently have organised and rewritten as needed. Some areas need fleshing out still. Lots more work to do. The various countries are now on separate pages (well they aren't quite finsihed yet) in order to reduce thepage size. As per the discussion here I'm not including any countries/states that do not have at least a simple citation to the law. Those subpages will also need fleshing out. I'm going to bed now been doing this for 4 hours lol. I'm leaving the work in progress template up until Sunday 5th so I can get the bare bones work done before people start messing with the details.

<dd>Okay my general work is done. It's still a bit rough I'll continue to edit but I also invite others to come in and clean up my work and add decently referenced material to the sub pages.

<p>I don't think there's any real need to move specific age of cosnent information to subpages indefinitely, but it was a good way to get rid of all of the unsourced garbage that plagued the article. Perhaps it can be merged back once it is more complete. The chart remains, however...

<dd>The subpages were created as the main article was well over the recommended size limit as it stood. But of course now that we've removed all the unsourced hearsay it would be much smaller; I was thinking of the future when there will be an entry for every country! (lol) The chart should eventually be informed from the subpages. But as the disclaimer says it's there for indicaion of the 'norm' only. I think it is a good thing for an overview (which the main article is).</dd>
<dd>We also need to flesh out the main article. Most of the sections are mere placeholders. Remembering to alter the introduction to reflect the altered body as we go. --<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonotonehell_775d.html" title="User:Monotonehell">Monotonehell</a> 06:12, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>People seem to not understand the purpose of the picture of the youth jumping off some hay stacks.

<dd>Visualy uninteresting page it is then. I asked for comments/opinions not an edit war. *lol* Oh well, picture in, picture out, picture in, picture out, picture in, picture out, picture in, picture out... I hope we are all above the age of consent cos that's the closest thing to sex I've had in a while. &gt;.&gt;' TMI?.. The background to the picture is this this; I was searching wikicommons for a suitable picture of a group of youths that would dress the page a little in order to improve its visual interest. However nothing suitable could be found. Then I browsed the children section in hope that something had been placed there mistakenly and happened upon the boy jumping picture which shouted "youthful exurberent experimentation" and my visual communications background alarm bell rang. So it wasn't simply a picture with no point, it has visual metaphoric meaning.</dd>
<dd>But I'm happy to leave it out if a few people disagree with, it's just that the first two edits seemed like vandalism. I guess it's a reminder to us all to use the reason field properly and take things to the talk page when we do something that doesn't have an obvious reason. *takes note of own suggestion*</dd>

<p>I've been looking at this passage for some time now and have tried to reword it several times...</p>
<p><i>"In countries where "protection" of youth in terms of sexual behavior has reached its zenith (e.g. the United States), there has been a growing tendency to charge minors as adults for some major crimes. This leads some to consider why it is that a 15 year old could be too immature to agree to sexual relations, yet be mature enough to be tried as an adult for committing a crime and sent to prison, possibly for life.<a href="http://www.courttv.com/archive/trials/abraham/101999_ctv.html" class="external text" title="http://www.courttv.com/archive/trials/abraham/101999_ctv.html" rel="nofollow">1</a>"</i></p>
<p>...I realised that I was labouring under a fallacy. The AoC laws are intended as a protection for children as victims, whereas a murder charge is about protecting the murder victim. I can see why this passage was added, but the argument is <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non_sequitur_%28logic%29.html" title="Non sequitur (logic)">non sequitur</a> and a tad irrelevent so I've zapped it. --<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonotonehell_775d.html" title="User:Monotonehell">Monotonehell</a> 19:34, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There it is again. The urban legend that the age of consent in Japan is 13. I cannot count the number of times a gullible American G.I. stationed here made the front page because he fell for this story.</p>
<p>Beware. The age of consent in Japan is 18. The urban legend derives from the fact that sex with minors under under the age of 13 is a <i>federal</i> offence, while sex with minors 13 thru 17 will throw you in jail on local laws. There once was a time when the age of consent was different for each prefecture. The district of Tokyo was the last holdout, the age of consent there remained 16 up until the mid '80s. After circa 1986, the age of consent in Japan has been 18 in every prefecture. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 219.163.12.72 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_219.163.12.72_823b.html" title="Special:Contributions/219.163.12.72">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>Until last week there wasn't a referenced entry for Japan, but as it stands it may have to be put on the map as 'varies by state'.

<p>This group of pages has seen several distractions from its primary concern recently, mostly regarding the naming of the subpages in relation to the content therein. Can we bring all the concerns here and have a civil, productive argument and hopefully come to some kind of consensus (and possibly teach me to spell?)?</p>
<p><br />
Some rules I think will help the discussion (but might sound a bit condesending - sorry);</p>
<ul>
<li>No normative statements. Example; "It should be this way" without any supporting evidence doesn't further your point. If you have a point of view, that's great!, but tell everyone why you think it should be that way. Cite WP:policy, dictionary definitions and other authoritive sources.</li>
<li>No outright snubs. Let's give any reasoned point of view equal consideration. Just because it's always been this way doesn't make it right.</li>
<li>Let's keep it civil and try not to lose our cool.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
I'll start by dragging this from the N.American talk page to get the ball rolling. If others have more points of concern please feel free to add them here. ---</p>
<p>This <b>should</b> be at ages. While yes, "age of consent" is a <a href="../../../n/c/%28/WP%7ENC%28CN%29_0829.html" title="WP:NC(CN)">common name</a>, this is a <i>list</i> of ages of consent around North America, not just one term. Having it at <a href="../../../a/g/e/Ages_of_consent_in_North_America_8ade.html" title="Ages of consent in North America">ages of consent in North America</a> doesn't even violate WP:NC(CN), as it still USES the common term, just makes it correct. If there was one age of consent in North America, then that would be where the article was, but there are many! Nobody would use <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_consent_in_North_America_f830.html" title="Age of consent in North America">age of consent in North America</a> when it clearly refers to more than one age, and so "ages" is clearly more common. --<a href="../../../r/o/r/User%7ERory096_e5c4.html" title="User:Rory096">Rory096</a> 06:32, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article's focus is on the variance between the Ages that can consent to particular acts. The variable that differs from article to article is <i>not</i> what is consented to, but the difference in ages from state to state. Thus, the proper term for this article is "Ages of consent".

<dd>It seems only a couple of people had an opinion about this. I can think of arguments for both cases, so I went with the one that made the most noise. Even though I think that "age-singular" would be the more common search term I think if we keep the main page "Age of consent" the sub pages can be the plural. I've also edited the disambig page and added a header paragraph to all the sub pages to let people know that they are solely about AoC for sexual activity. Let's hope that clears up any furure confusion. --<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonotonehell_775d.html" title="User:Monotonehell">Monotonehell</a> 08:01, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While the entries by Dr. Waites are most welcome, his enthusiastic effort to properly reference this article has unfortunately resulted in making it look a little like a promotional tool for his new book. While I'm sure this is more a result of the existing serious lack of references than any bad faith on his behalf, it is a problem. It's possible that the only way to truely rectify this is to add further diverse sources.

<dd>lol, I did consider Antarctica when creating the regional layout, but well you know... All six of those subpages have the potential to be quite large if all the regions are added, that's the reason they were separated on that basis. So I don't think it's a good idea to merge them just because of apathy due to systemic bias. All it takes is one editor to make the difference - the Europe page was looking a little sad until one editor added the bulk of the data on there. --<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonotonehell_775d.html" title="User:Monotonehell">Monotonehell</a> 09:59, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For one thing, the phrase "actual consent" is POV - lots of people don't think children <i>can</i> consent to sex, so from that point of view consent by kids would be apparent, not actual.</p>
<p>Also, I don't know where you get this "violence" idea - lots of things are illegal without being "presumed violent." Maybe you want to put a paragraph about this in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_sexual_abuse.html" title="Child sexual abuse">child sexual abuse</a>? Most psychologists would agree that sex with children is inherently violent, but age of consent laws are not necessarily motivated by the views of psychologists.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dan, it depends on the age of the "children". There is little doubt that adolescents can consent to sex. The controversy comprises the ages before or around puberty.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Age of consent is a legal barrier, which varies according to the country or jurisdiction. The phrase "actual consent" indicates the cases where it would be considered that there is consent if the law didn't make any restrictions, once in these cases there was no violence, or any form of manipulation, deceit, nor abuse of authority, nor the use of substances like alcohol, drugs, anesthesia, etc. For instance, if a 14 year old have sex in an area where AoC is 16, he or she may give "actual consent" although legally it is not possible in that area.</li>
</ul>
<p>The phrase is close to a concept used by Matthew Waites in his book (page 132). (a) top of page – “(…) following his criticism of internal proposals to endorse an age of 12 in circumstances where a defendant could prove consent”. (b) middle of page – “The society regarded the term ‘age of consent’ as representing a ‘legal fiction’ by implying that ‘consent’ is only possible above the existing legal age, and hence ignoring the actual existence of consent by persons below that age”.</p>
<ul>
<li>My post that was removed is:</li>
</ul>
<p>“In this sense, the age of sexual consent is also the age below which violence is legally presumed in sexual relations, regardless of any evidence to the contrary or proof of actual consent.”</p>
<ul>
<li>So maybe it should be replaced with&#160;:</li>
</ul>
<p>“In this sense, the age of sexual consent is also the age below which violence is legally presumed in sexual relations, regardless of any evidence to the contrary or of circumstances where a defendant could prove consent.”</p>
<ul>
<li>As for “violence” - The presumption of violence here is a legal one. It is what separates rape from statutory rape. In other words, for the crime to be characterized, it is not necessary the existence of violence (or manipulation, deceit, fraud, use of drugs, abuse of authority, etc). Age only is enough. It is regarded as a "legal fiction" exactly because of this aspect. Even in cases where otherwise the act would not be considered a rape, it is considered like a rape, as a result of the law. Note that the article "age of consent" is already placed in the category "legal fiction" since a long time ago.</li>

<dd>So this Matthew Waites fellow is your source. Googling, I discover that he is a Scottish sociology professor who has written a book on the age of consent. That's fine -- as an academic I suppose he is notable enough to have his opinion represented in the article. But be very sure that everything you get from him is attributed to him as <i>his</i> opinion, not Wikipedia's. And a particular writer's POV doesn't belong in the lead paragraph.</dd>

<p>We've got the great problem that information on ages of consent often are not quite correct, incomplete or interpreted in different ways. How can we improve the presentation of ages of consent?</p>
<p>1. We have to <b>recite the relevant laws</b> - <b>literally!</b> This has to be cited, <b>link</b> to an (official, if possible) page of the criminal code and the <b>exact date</b> of this information. (avoid citing pages like ageofconsent.com - they already did not cite correctly!)</p>
<p>2. We have to interprete the laws and give sources as accurate as possible (preferingly experts publications).</p>
<p>3. We have to present these information in an clear and understandable (and - the most important: <b>checkable!</b>) way, distinguishing between minimum vs. secure age of consent and penetrative vs. "soft" sexual relations.</p>
<p>minimum age of consent = the age only after that an individual can engage in sexual relations with another who is also at or above that age, without the older person forcibly beeing punished when discovered.</p>
<p>secure age of consent = the age at or above which an individal can engage in unfettered sexual relations with another who is also at or above that age, without the older person beeing in risk of punishment at all.</p>

<dd>I agree with most of what you're saying here. There's an orange box at the top of all the AoC Talk pages that states pretty much that. Before the cleanup of these pages back in December 2005 there was NO citation and pretty much all the info was taken stright from ageofconcent.com, which I think is discussed above as being mostly wrong and out of date.</dd>
<dd>I'd caution people on the 'interpretation' you require. Other than stating what the legislation says too much interpretation may lead us into grey areas. Unless one can find (as you also mentioned) authoritive sources for interpretation. This kind of research is <b>very</b> hard to find however.</dd>
<dd>What we've been doing for the past 12 months is, if an edit is unsourced it gets removed after a few days of putting a {citation required} tag on it, if there is no supporting sources.

<dd>Could you please stop changing the focus of sections to this "minimum age of consent" and revert your edits so far that have done so. All the articles in Age of Consent are written from the perspective that there exists an unfettered age of consent, and then in some jurisdictions, there also exists close in age exceptions.</dd>
<dd>Close in age exceptions vary <b>greatly</b> from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, they carry differnet penalties and have different rules depending on where you are. They are not a sufficient commonality for Wikipedia's articles to hold to. Therefore the concensus so far has been to focus on the <b>unfettered age of consent</b> and then mention as a side note in each jurisdiction their specific variations for close in age exceptions, homosexual relations, prohibitions on anal sex and so on as they exist.</dd>
<dd>What you've done is destroy the consistency between articles, please change it back.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>May I ask that in future you add new discussions at the bottom of the talk pages and that you sign your posts (just type four tildes ~ it will be added for you automatically) it makes it easier to see who's saying what. Also you may want to get yourself an account, that way you'll be a name not a number&#160;;) Thanks for your other contributions so far by the way, they have been good.</dd>

<p>An interesting aspect of the AoC topic that appears to not be addressed is the fact that in many places the legal threshold for appearing in porn is 18, and this threshold also extends to the legal age of viewing such material (and in some places the age limit is as high as 21). In many areas, possessing and viewing material that features people under 18 is illegal. Yet as indicated in this article and others, in many of these same jurisdictions, AoC and/or legal marriage age can be much lower. I've started a section on this, but it needs an "informed hand" to make sure it's correct, and that sources are added. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 19:37, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Similar changes in the law in other Anglo-saxon majority countries has had little effect on Pimps and drug dealers or Priests who exploit young people.Interestingly the USA and Britain who have very similar cultural backgrounds tend to have a higher teenage pregnancy rate than European countries that have lower ages of consent.The only likely effect of this Bill ,for example,will be to stop responsible 25 year old accountants having sexual relations with young people .It will not stop those who already exploit young people,since they are already in breach of the law in many cases eg Pimps,18 year old criminals who care very little for unplanned pregnancies or the transmission of diseases.Increasing the age of consent tends to increase the devision between responsible adults and the young and limits the choice for the young and leaves room for exploiters to step in .One has to question the motivation for such a bill;has it been introduced to statisfy personnal religous views .Has it been introduced by overweight middle-aged men because they fear more attractive ethnic groups having sex ,when they themselves are to grotesque to be found attractive by young people.(The UK tightened their laws in the the 1950's,just before the influx of Blacks and Asians into the country).Of course this bill will not stop wealthy Canadians from going abroad in order to breach the new law and hence it is aimed at the poor.Canadians be Scared be very Scared,you will end up as USA ,high child murder rates ,largest consumer of porn. --<i>The previous unsigned opinion was soapboxed by: |213.48.46.141|22:46, 4 July 2006</i></p>

If however a reasoned and unbiased summary of the Child Poverty Report can be extracted that can be directly linked to Age of consent laws (ie not original research or speculation) then it should probably be included as part of <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_consent_reform.html" title="Age of consent reform">Age of consent reform</a> which examines the background of AoC laws.

<p><br />
If it is vandalism ,remove it.Anyway the Canadian process gives an opportunity to test the 'facts' in the main page, such as the reasons for an age of consent, in real time rather than second hand sources.For example the statement, 'The general moral philosophy behind age of consent laws is the assumed need for the protection of minors'is questionable since it does not protect minors against parental abuse;which is the main source of abuse.Also ages of consent when first introduced did not apply inside marriage.Hence if protection of minors is a factual reason then it seems odd that cultures with the same moral tradition have differing ages eg Europe.The debate in Canada may enlighten us on the reasons such as power ,social control etc.Hence 'soap boxing' provides an outlet to question the facts in the main page and hence wikipedia will present the true facts rather than regurgitated phrases from other sources,many of them written by interest groups .</p>
<p>Of course there is no clear link with age of consent and the child poverty report,but it does indicate that abuse (eg young pregnancies) are not less likely in those countries with higher AoC.</p>
<p>To say that there is a religous basis to age of consent is nonsense.Religions have been around for thousands of years without ages of consent.Ages of consent where introduced when religion was losing its control.However religion may be used to find support in changing the age of consent ,even though there is no real religious reason to have one.Religion controlled sexual behaviour through marriage ,therefore never needed an age of consent.So I think there is no religious basis;there is a political/social basis which may use religion for its own end. --<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../2/1/2/User%7E212.85.12.211.html" title="User:212.85.12.211">212.85.12.211</a> (<a href="../../../2/1/2/User_talk%7E212.85.12.211.html" title="User talk:212.85.12.211">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_212.85.12.211_76e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/212.85.12.211">contribs</a>) 17:46, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</small></p>
