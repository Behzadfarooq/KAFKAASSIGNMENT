<h2><span class="mw-headline">Criticism of Radiometric Dating and the "Old" Age of the Earth</span></h2>
<p>Not everyone agrees with what is being said above. For example, there are many reasons to question Radiometric Dating, and whether or not it has any validity at all. For example, many artifacts containing Organic material found buried in supposedly "millions of years old" strata (such as carbonized wood, unfossilized or unmineralized wood -- that can be sawed with a saw or burned in a fire --, unfossilize or unmineralized Dinosaur Bones, etc) have been dated with the Carbon 14 Dating method, and, time and time again, the dates obtained are between about 7,000 years to 40,000 years. However there are many other reasons for questioning this method. For example, all of those "millions of years old" dates are obtained from Volcanic materials; however, there is no way to KNOW for CERTAIN what the original amounts present were. Then there is the problem of Mixing both mother and daughter products together while they are in a molten state. Then there is the problem of Leaching, re-chrystalization, and a host of others.

As to specifics, any semblance of actually making a decent point would be a good start. Like explaining how these criticisms have been missed and are not understood by experts in the field, and have therefore led to gross errors in radiometric samples that are actually used and relied upon for scientific dating. If on the other hand these failures and numerous anomalies in radiometric dating are understood, and have even been uncovered and examined in detail by said experts; then they only serve to improve the methodologies reliability, rather than undermining it, since they know which samples are reliable. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 06:33, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not bad, though I'm sure someone will 'POV' it. Your statement that creationists lack understanding of dating techniques, and your mention of 'accurate results' are disputed by creationists.</dd>

<dd>I'm sure your right about someone accusing it of being POV, but let's address your points. "Lack understanding", the sentence links it to what scientists say, not me, although I certainly agree with it. (evidence to that effect has been provided by Truthteller above) "Accurate results" is Vsmith's, not mine... but then again he has background in the subject. As to preparation, I believed the point Vsmith wanted to emphasize is how modern preparation has changed from the past... but I do see what you're talking about, since it sounds like they are being lazier.

<dd>Oh, now I see <i>clearly</i> - it's the word <b>clear</b> that you object to. How is that POV? Maybe vague and assumes the reader knows what the <i>clear</i> refers to, but not a POV problem - just a wording problem. I did a search and the zircon evidence doesn't seem to be mentioned in the body of the article, just that bit in the intro. That does need to be addressed as it isn't <i>clear</i> from the body of the article just why it's <i>clear from zircons...</i> But, not tonight, I'm tired. Thanks for pointing that out.

<li>"Archbishop James Ussher of Armagh, Ireland, calculated from the Bible"</li>
<li>"Aristotle, who thought the Earth and universe had existed from eternity."</li>
<li>"the Earth had been created separately from the rest of the universe, several hundred thousands of years before."</li>
<li>"created a small globe that resembled the Earth in composition and then measured its rate of cooling. This led him to estimate that the Earth was about 75,000 years old."</li>
<li>" John Phillips, later calculated by [analysing layers] that the Earth was about 96 million years old."</li>
<li>" naturalists were influenced by Lyell to become "uniformitarians" who believed that changes were constant and uniform."</li>
<li>"In 1862, the physicist William Thomson of Glasgow published calculations that fixed the age of the Earth at between 20 million and 400 million years.He assumed that the Earth had been created as a completely molten ball of rock, and determined the amount of time it took for the ball to cool to its present temperature."</li>
<li>"The German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz and the American astronomer Simon Newcomb joined in by independently calculating the amount of time it would take for the Sun to condense down to its current diameter and brightness from the nebula of gas and dust from which it was born. They came up with a value of 100 million years, which seemed to set an upper limit on the age of the Earth"</li>
<li>" Charles Darwin's son, the astronomer George H. Darwin of the University of Cambridge, proposed that the Earth and Moon had broken apart in their early days when they were both molten."</li>
<li>" John Joly of the University of Dublin calculated the rate at which the oceans should have accumulated salt from erosion processes, and determined that the oceans were about 90 million years old."

<li>That's 11 theories thus far and I'm only half way down the article. I'm afraid you'll have to criticse it on other grounds.

<dd>Young earth creationism. I know it has a separate article, and I don't think it needs much more than a link, but this page says YEC is wrong and the modern scientific estimates are correct.

<dd>The use of the word "theories" here is problematic. YEC has a hypothesis which – as far as I'm aware – is not supported by any physical evidence. Until YEC can come up with more than criticisms of established scientific dating; it will remain an unconfirmed hypothesis put forward by those wishing to push their POV. Hence it is not an alternative "theory" (implying scientific theory), nor does its criticisms put in question accepted dating methods. The article reflects this reality. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 04:41, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>IMO a few more changes need to be made.
<ul>
<li>I think the first sentence should be changed because the article starts out with "prescientific notions" and because I think it sounds better this way: "This article describes the historical development of the estimation of the "age of the Earth" including modern scientific dating methods."</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The article is about the historical development of scientific attempts to <i>date the Earth</i>.

<dl>
<dd>Read it. The intro states the age, then the bulk of the article is the historical development up through 1920 something. Then there is the brief paragraph about modern ... (this was added by me back in June) which needs expanding with a lot more detail about the scientific evidence and current state of the science. I agree the article needs a major re-organization to emphasize <i>the current state of the science</i> before the history. <a href="../../../v/s/m/User%7EVsmith_d492.html" title="User:Vsmith">Vsmith</a> 20:49, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The "prescientific notions" section is there as a bit of background only. I presume you are referring to the disambig. sentence - rather than the first sentence of the article. <a href="../../../v/s/m/User%7EVsmith_d492.html" title="User:Vsmith">Vsmith</a> 15:46, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

</dl>
<ul>
<li>I think the second sentence should be changed because it still sounds biased to me. How about this? It presents the POV of most of (not all of) the scientific community without taking a stance on the issue and adds a comma. "For views rejected by most of the scientific community, see..."</li>

<dd>I'll repeat this because I'm sure I saw it above somewhere, to even present YEC as a real alternative is dishonest (not encyclopedic and not NPOV), and is itself "controversial" (or rather silly and preposterous) because it tells other religions they are wrong by implying YEC is the only and/or leading alternative. Furthermore we don't look to American news (who are concerned with viewership as much as they are about journalism) as a standard of objectivity, and neither should you. Most importantly, science indicates certain <b>interpretations</b> of a religion are likely wrong... it does not seek to, nor does it prove any religion or philosophy "wrong" per se (unless one wishes to maintain only <b>their</b> interpretation of a given religion is <b>Correct</b>). - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 22:58, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What do you mean by "other religions"? Other than the ones that incorporate some form of YEC? If they have their own estimates for the age of the Earth, then they should be mentioned, too. If not, then they're irrelevant to this article. I don't understand what you're saying about American news...I don't see how it's relevant to what I wrote. There is a lot of controversiality, and the American news reported on it. I agree with your last sentence. This article should reflect those indications, but in its current state it (indirectly) says YEC of all forms and religions is wrong. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgbert_1074.html" title="User:Ergbert">Ergbert</a> 03:01, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Other religions, go ahead and do the research and you tell me. But I advise that you don't spend much time on it, as it is not relevant to this article and would take a significant amount of space. Also, this would need to be done for every scientific article on Wikipedia. Hopefully this clarifies for you the enormity and fallacy of your position. Should the fact there are other views be mentioned, certainly... detailed, given equal uncritical weight; uh... no.</li>
<li>American news, what I'm getting at is they will do stories/shows on what they think will attract viewership; not because there is actually a general controversy (don't forget the sensationalist dynamic of mainstream media nowadays). While I would acknowledge a controversy over educational philosophy; I find it misleading to say there is controversy over the actual Age of the Earth. It's important to restrain the "controversy" to what is actually contentious.</li>
<li>I also agree with my last sentence. It means science does not seek to prove religious interpretations wrong, but if it happens to do so; it should not translate in an encyclopedia saying there is "controversy" or we need to let people "reach their own conclusions". That is intellectually dishonest and as detailed above unworkable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Could you imagine detailing every religious belief (LET ALONE alternative crackpot/outdated scientific theories) for every aspect of scientific inquiry. It would be bedlam of historical proportions. You need to understand this isn't just about the validity of your beliefs, but using reasonable standards of evidence and notability to write an educational encyclopedia. Without them you would have to contend with an Islamic, Buddhist, Anarchist, Church of Christ (etc.) interpretation of subjects. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 02:27, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Without them you would have to contend with an Islamic, Buddhist, Anarchist, Church of Christ (etc.) interpretation of subjects." And we should mention all of those interpretations. It's unencyclopedic to say "(most, but lets ignore the minority) scientists agree on X" and to ignore all POVs you disagree with. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgbert_1074.html" title="User:Ergbert">Ergbert</a> 21:18, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>But there isn't creation bashing in this article... is there?</li>
<li>I don't consider political/religious controversy terribly relevant to the actual age of the earth; but perhaps its notable enough to mention.</li>
<li>Other POV's aren't being ignored, at worst they are marginalized (since they do not directly address the age of the earth, but a more general Creation) and they are detailed in their own article(s). I could see a need for a "beliefs" section if there was specific/exotic beliefs on the age of the earth not covered by origins/creation articles. Like the beliefs of native americans or others which speak to the age of the earth, <b>not</b> creation.</li>

<p>I made some more changes to the disambiguation text. To avoid edit conflict I didn't make any of my proposed changes that the ongoing discussion is about. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgbert_1074.html" title="User:Ergbert">Ergbert</a> 03:11, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Vsmith, please don't make baseless accusations. In particular, please don't accuse me of POV pushing when you're reverting my POV-reducing edits to more biased versions. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgbert_1074.html" title="User:Ergbert">Ergbert</a> 21:18, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Made another edit...Again, if you object to specific changes, please don't revert everything, and talk about it here so we can resolve this. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgbert_1074.html" title="User:Ergbert">Ergbert</a> 21:24, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I prefer the Royboy/Vsmith version. Your current version isn't outrageous, though, and having stuffed up radioactive/metric (I prefer active, but it looks like metric is correct) I'll listen for a bit. I did take the rant out though. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> 21:53, 27 October 2005 (UTC).</dd>
