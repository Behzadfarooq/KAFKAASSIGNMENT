	    <p><i>The first thing that should be mentioned is that all characters and the story itself are entirely fictional. Names and places with exact names are coincidences and are not intentional.)</i></p>
<p>Agent's real name is Vash Jay Mackenzie, but we'll call him Agent for now. Agent joined Starfleet and trained as a security officer. While in the academy, he applied for and was selected to the Hazard Team class which involved advanced weapons and tactics.</p>
<p>After graduating from Starfleet Academy, Agent was immediately assigned to duty on a Starbase close to the Romulan-Federation Neutral Zone. Although surprisingly quiet, Agent did have many adventures while stationed at this starbase and managed to rescue a Romulan defector with the help of Jason Kendall. A close friend to Agent was Angel (Real name is Jennifer Lee). They had met while at the academy, and became quick friends. Angel was training to be a medical officer, and because of Agent's connections in the Starfleet Hazard Team Engineering Core, got one of her inventions approved for further design and development. After graduating from Starfleet Academy Angel was assigned to the U.S.S. Majestic, which was a Galaxy Class vessel, as a medical officer, . The U.S.S. Majestic was assigned to patrol in the Gamma Quadrant, so many of the encounters with other species could become extremely hostile. For this reason the Majestic was assigned four squads of Hazard Team officers. These Hazard Team officers were trained in many forms of combat, and are taught the specialized fields in engineering, medical, command, and science.</p>
<p>After serving on the starbase for five years, Agent was transferred to the USS Majestic and promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Junior Grade after being assigned to Omega Squad. Angel was also assigned to Omega Squad to serve as an in-field medical technician. Agent and Angel were finally reunited onboard the Majestic. It was only then that the medical invention Angel had designed started that actual construction phase by the Engineering Core, do to a few emergencies that had happened within that team's personnel. One month after being transferred to the Majestic, Agent's Omega Squad was assigned to an away mission. They were responding to a distress call from the colony planet Draxus 4.</p>
<p>Agent beamed down with his squad of Hazard Team officers along with Commander Rab and Chief Tactical Officer Alexi. They met a civilian as they moved east, and he told them that the labs were located in the North-East region. He would not tell more because he feared for his life, and he ran off with a crowd of civilians toward their escape ship. Proceeding eastward, the away team encountered the first sign of the insurgents on Draxus 4.</p>
<p>Three snipers were on the roof of a building, and they challenged the team, telling them that they were from Section 31 and that for their interference they must die. Before Agent and his team could do anything, the snipers shot Commander Rab and Tactical Officer Alexi, killing them both on the spot. Quickly taking cover, Agent ordered his team to eliminate the snipers. Agent had no idea what Section 31 was, and neither did any of his team. Agent then contacted the Majestic, and Captain Maxwell told them to continue with the mission. While scanning the area for any additional snipers, one of the Omega Squad officers saw movement from the South Pass. The away team headed down the South pass and met a lone soldier. This soldier was Sarah. She was part of the small security force that the scientists had hired to protect them and their equipment and labs. Sarah needed help because the orbital ships that housed some of the genetic experiments had crashed and were now attacking the housing area where most of the scientists were staying.</p>
<p>Agent agreed to help and told the rest of Omega Squad to watch the South pass, taking only Angel with him. As they headed down to the housing area, Sarah told Agent to protect the main entrance until one of the rent-a-guards could get into position and destroy the two crashed ships which contained the apparently malfunctioning cloning facilities. Agent tried to contact the Majestic, but interference was blocking the signals, and Sarah's subspace radio was down. Agent took up position immediately, while Sarah headed back to the secondary defenses in the colony. As soon as she got to her bunker, she sent out one of her guards along a narrow path that would lead to a cliff across from where the ships were crashed. The aliens began rushing Agent soon after that. Apparently the genetic experiments were not complete yet, as Agent was able to easily mow them down. However, a few did get past Agent, and Sarah and her crew had to deal with the stragglers that fled Agent and attacked Sarah's bunker. Agent was able to hold his ground against the renegade experiments, but they took no interest in him; it seemed as if they had a singular purpose of destroying the colony. Eventually the soldier sent by Sarah reached his destination. As he set up to launch the missile with the firepower to destroy the damaged ships, he was mysteriously killed. This changed everything, because only he had the special launch sequence codes for the small tactical missile silo. A little while later, with everything looking bleak and Agent running low on energy for his weapon, Sarah contacted Agent with good news. During the time that Agent was able to hold off most of the invaders, the chief engineer of the colony was able to repair the subspace transceiver. Agent headed back inside the colony with Angel, while the defenders braced themselves for more waves of renegade experiments. Quickly Agent contacted the Majestic and briefed them on the new situation: Sarah's problem. Captain Maxwell agreed to beam in more officers from the other squads to help Agent eliminate the threat. The Majestic herself would have destroyed the crashed vessels from orbit, but strange interference prevented weapons-lock yet allowed beam-ins and beam-outs to work. After the Majestic beamed down Delta Force and Alpha Team, Agent and the teams proceeded towards the crashed bio-experiment ships. With Delta Force Directly engaging the aliens, Agent and the officers of Alpha Team stormed the ships and successfully destroyed them. Thanking Agent and his teams for their help, Sarah gave him a data card which contained the necessary codes to enter the science labs. With his job done, Agent contacted the Majestic to beam down relief teams to help repair damages and take care of the wounded. Since they were no longer needed, Alpha and Delta teams beamed back to the ship, and Agent, along with Angel, headed back up the south pass to regroup with Omega Squad. After grouping back with Omega Squad, Agent and the remainder of the away team headed north east towards the abandoned laboratories. When they finally arrived at the laboratories, Agent entered the access codes required to gain entrance to the labs. The away team moved inside, and went down the long hallway. It looked like many of the systems and experiments were damaged in some sort of attack, and there were many bodies of downed rent-a-guards. Apparently the systems were malfunctioning, as Omega Squad was suddenly attacked by the automatic guns. After removing the most of the gun emplacements in the area, Agent and his team made it into the security control room. Using the codes contained in the data card Agent deactivated the rest of the weapons emplacements and opened all the security doors. Proceeding further into the labs, Agent found the laboratory where the experiments that attacked the colony were first designed. Inside he found the first sign of what was going on. In the corner of the lab stood a soldier inside a fully sealed battle armor. He explained that he was from Section 31, an organization that was part of the original Federation charter, yet shrouded in secrecy. Agent did not believe what this soldier was saying, so the soldier gave Agent a verbal code that he said would unlock the files to prove what he was saying. Before Agent could stun him, the soldier suddenly shot himself and was vaporized. Angel ran over and scanned the area, reporting that it seemed that the mysterious soldier completely vaporized himself leaving only a few stray molecules behind. He did this apparently, to disallow the Starfleet officers to scan him further or beam him to the Majestic. Agent pondered the meaning of this, an organization within the Federation that was so completely ruthless that they would sacrifice their own soldiers and use any means necessary to achieve their ends. With their mission completed as much as possible, Agent, Angel, and Omega Squad beamed back to the Majestic. Once onboard, Agent entered the codes that the soldier gave him. Unlocking a wealth of information, Agent learned the truth of Section 31. Apparently Section 31 was part of the original charter of the Federation as a safeguard to protect the interests of the Federation at any cost. Agent was repulsed with this idea, as was Angel. Agent did not tell the rest of Omega Squad, because he felt that this was something that should not be spread around. Because of the deaths of Commander Rab and Tactical Officer Alexi, Agent was promoted to Chief Tactical Officer. After reading the logs of Section 31, Agent talked to Captain Maxwell about who to select for first officer. The best choice for first officer seemed to be science officer Jennifer Riley. Jennifer had been on the ship for four years, serving with excellence and wisdom. The other choice would be Chief Engineer Raymond Duran. Unfortunately, Duran's four years of experience on the Majestic as chief engineer left him as the best for that role. None of his underlings were yet ready to replace him. After much deliberation, Maxwell made his decision. Calling for a senior staff meeting in the main observation lounge directly behind the bridge, Maxwell made his announcements. He explained the current situation, how losing Commander Rab and Tactical Officer Alexi made it necessary for new people to replace those posistions. He also briefed them on how Agent investigated the planet further, saved a settlement, gained access to the labs, and how he discovered a possible threat with the sinister organization Section 31. According to the logs Agent gained access to, Section 31 was part of the original Federation Charter. According to history as it was known, the Federation was formed with 30 charters. The existence of Section 31 showed that one of the charters was kept from public knowledge. This rouge charter was formed as a secret intelligence and operations organization. They would stamp out anything that they conceived as a threat through any means necessary. After briefing the officers present on those developments, Maxwell announced that the new First Officer would be Jennifer Riley. Nobody objected, and Maxwell went back to the current mission. From what was observed, Section 31 attacked the labs with their soldiers and gained entrance. From there, they took control of the experiment ships and crashed them on the planet. Because they could not be completely destroy the heavily armored ships, Section 31 used the cloning facilities onboard the ships and mass produced the experiments for an all out assault on the colony. An interesting thing to note was that Section 31 stole all plans and related files for the experiment attack creatures. This seemed to point out that they planned to use the aliens for their own purposes. Jennifer theorized that if Section 31 was only trying to stop the illegal experiments, then the records and all physical details would have been destroyed. Because of this, Agent was able to recover the information to be used later. With most of the relief complete, and the threat of the experiments eradicated, Maxwell saw no reason to remain at Draxus 4. Although the scientists' experiments were illegal, the planet was not under Starfleet's jurisdiction and they could not do anything about it. Maxwell dismissed the meeting, and ordered the Majestic back on its exploratory mission. He also planned a funeral service for Commander Rab and Tactical Officer Alexi. After the service, the Majestic warped back on course for its continuing patrol mission in the Gamma Quadrant. With everything back in a calm state, Agent and Angel were given the task of analyzing the bodies of the beamed aboard aliens. Studying the bodies carefully, they found that in the creature's brain was an additional lobe. This lobe was tuned to receive a certain frequency that could only be created artificially. The scientists had started work on designing the lobe to control the aliens, but the complexities of the brain proved overwhelming so they had not yet completed the work. Angel theorized that Section 31, or someone else completed the work that the scientists had started. In this way the aliens were used to attack the colony. With that in mind, Agent and Angel began work to find the frequency that the brain lobe responded to. It was thought that if the origin of the beam was located, they would either find the location of Section 31, or at least a base of operations. Before they could get through the preliminary work, they were interrupted by a red alert.</p>
<p><br />
Unfortunately, Draxus 4 was not the only place to be attacked. A planet known as Tyranel sent out a distress call reporting that they too, where under attack by unknown forces.</p>
<p>The aliens here had a higher level of technology, and it should be noted that if they ever decided to feel aggression towards Starfleet they could have wiped them out easily. This thought did not occur to any onboard the Majestic, but this was the mentality of Section 31. Captain Maxwell quickly ordered a course for the planet, and advised Agent to have all teams standing by. Agent chose to lead the primary away team himself and prepped the team personally. When the Majestic arrived, Agent advised the Majestic to scan for the frequency; Agent and Omega Squad then beamed down to the capital city, where most of the damage was occurring. With orders to remove the attacking threat and to find the world leaders, Agent proceeded. When the Majestic received word of additional attacks, Captain Maxwell ordered the other teams to the locations provided. Agent and his squad eventually found the leaders holed up in heavily armored bunker. With an objective completed, Agent contacted the Majestic and updated them on the situation. When Agent questioned the leaders, he found out that the aliens were now objective oriented, attacking the military buildings first. Agent then received word from the Majestic. The last of the military facilities was destroyed and now the aliens were committing suicide. The leaders of Tyranel thanked Agent for his help, and for his effort they gave him a special present. It was a personal cloaking field. Agent was surprised, but thanked them for the gift and because they did not want Starfleet's interference with helping them back on their feet, all the Hazard Teams beamed back up to the Majestic. With another misssion out of the way, and the mystery deepening, Captain Maxwell ordered the Majestic back on course and they warped away. Unfortunetly, the beam that was being transmitted was only partially decoded, and the origin still could not be found. With the addition of the new piece of hardware, Agent ordered his engineers to study the device to see if it could be duplicated. So far though, the systems were too complex. During the high-warp travel back to the coordinates, Agent and his team analyzed the behaviour characteristics of the aliens. The aliens seemed to be gaining more intelligence, and self awareness instead of being mindless drones. When their usefulness was depleted, the aliens commited suicide, sugessting that Section 31 did not want any live samples to be captured. After arriving at the coordinates designated for the next area of patrol, the Majestic began the patrol routine. Mapping stars, planets, and asteroids, the next few days were completly routine. With all the time, Agent's hazard team started work on a device to neutralize brain functions in the creatures, at the same time, they were constructing a specialized containment chamber to house the alien for study. Within a few days the containment chamber was completed, along with the brain neutralizer to stun the alien. All Agent needed was another distress call and an alien along with it.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, no reason was given for the recall. Captain Maxwell surmised that someone within Section 31 knew about the equipment Agent was working on and decided to put a stop to it. When the Majestic finally arrived at starbase 532, the Commander of the base contacted the Majestic about Angel. A special taskforce was moving out to check out an alien ruin with technology surpassing the Federation's. Starfleet wanted Angel to help because of her expertise in exobiology. This was a temporary assignment, so Angel accepted. The Majestic was to stay at starbase 532 and get refitted for the next phase of patrols.</p>
<p>So Angel left the Majestic with the taskforce, to hopefully uncover the mystery behind the alien ruins and the technology they left behind. As the refitting of the Majestic began, most of the crew either went to the starbase, or down to the planet below. This small amount of shore-leave was appreciated, because of the high-stress situtaions they have been getting themselves in to. Agent himself went to the Starbase to check out the ancient Klingon blades that a dealer had informed him about. Angel's taskforce quickly got to the alien planet where the ruins were located.</p>
<p>Angel beamed down to the planet with the away team she was assigned to. She was amazed at what she first saw. Hundreds of strange soldiers in black armor were guarding the ruins. Angel's team leader walked up to one of the soldiers. The soldier led Angel and the away team to the alien portal. They were told to begin work on scanning the structure, to determine how to get it operational again.</p>
