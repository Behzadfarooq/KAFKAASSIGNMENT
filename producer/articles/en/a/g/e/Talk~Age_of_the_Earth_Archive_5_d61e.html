<dd>Of course not&#160;;)</dd>
<dd>I probably wasn't abundantly clear in what I was trying to say. Basically, as written, the revised version suggests that creation science is pretty evenly weighted with rejection of mainstream science. My guess (and this is just that, a guess) is that most people who accept religious teachings about the age of the earth are not people who have actively rejected the scientific view, but rather, people with limited experience to the scientific view. Among those who are aware enough of the scientific view to reject it, the proportion of those who embrace alternative science (creation science or one of its kin) are likely to small. I don't have data to support this, but it feels like common sense to me. I think that to assert otherwise, that creation science is on par with other reasons for rejection, needs some sort of support. In addition, are there other science-like explanations embraced by religious people? How does support for scientology, or UFO-related New Age 'alternatives" compare with support for creation science? <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 03:03, 24 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Sorry; that's not what I intended. I put creation science last because to me that makes it look less important and I used "some combination of" to indicate that views can range from "Scripture is right!" to "Scripture is right and (creation) science proves it!" to "(Creation) science shows the Earth is only x years old." Would something more along the lines of "do not hold views of the age of the Earth that are in line with mainstream scientific estimates due to reasons that may include theological accounts of the age of the Earth, simple lack of exposure to such estimates and the research behind them, and <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_science.html" title="Creation science">creation science</a>" be better?</dd>
<dd>I think creation science deserves some sort of mention from a NPOV, in part because pre-existing religious views aren't the only reason for a YEC perspective, to show that it isn't "science" itself that creationists have a problem with, and because in my experience at least the simplest sorts of creation science have a fair degree of support (but I don't surround myself with YEC material). <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgbert_1074.html" title="User:Ergbert">Ergbert</a> 07:25, 24 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Re "...pre-existing religious views aren't the only reason for a YEC perspective..." -- what else could they be? There's no science in creation science, and the fact that people believe in creationism is likely due to what Guettarda "guessed" at. Generally speaking, the less one knows about science, the more likely one is to believe in creationism. Yes, there are a few exceptions (probably driven by religious zeal), but for the most part, it really is a lack of scienctific knowledge that allows people to accept creation myths. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch">Jim62sch</a> 01:35, 25 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Again, I'm not attributing it to one cause. There are several causes, and they don't all apply to everyone. Some people have religious views that they won't doubt, others have shakier religious views but are reassured by creation science, others don't have a religious background but are swayed by creation science (perhaps more common in kids...I remember a news story from not very long ago that I think mentioned a girl who was getting interested in science but had her education 'intercepted' by creation science, but the article was from long enough ago that it'd take more than just a little digging to find.), et cetera. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgbert_1074.html" title="User:Ergbert">Ergbert</a> 04:51, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Agree with Ergbert, in some cases its simply due to people being poorly educated and/or ignorant and/or stupid also. I think adding the word "generally" should make the statement fine. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 04:56, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Creation science is a reaction by those in the Church congregation who believe that the only way to fight science is with their own version of science; one which starts with a presupposed notion and seeks evidence to support that presupposed notion. It isn't science, at all. Oh, it uses the tools which science invented, but in the manner you can use a wrench to hammer in a nail. Science explains what is there first and foremost, then explains how it has come to be, with evidence. Creation science first describes how it has come to be, then selects evidence to prove it.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So, how should we portray the alternative non-scientific estimates of the age of the Earth? I think the current sentence is fine. Creation science isn't prescientific, it's antiscientific, as anyone who has read both will soon see. Fannying about with weasel words does nothing but distract us from the whole creation science = religion idea. <a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERolinator_4b12.html" title="User:Rolinator">Rolinator</a> 07:45, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's not accurate, though (unless it's my turn to misunderstand&#160;:) ). Though creation science may have originated for such reasons (I'm not defending it, so I don't need a lecture about it. Wikipedia articles aren't the place for such judgements, so I will remove them, but that's a totally different issue.), religious beliefs aren't always the cause of these (in same cases, lack of) views on the age of the Earth.</dd>

<dd>My contribution:<br /></dd>
<dd>"Modern scientific estimates of the age of the Earth are rejected by those who prefer accounts of the origin of the Earth based in scriptural teachings. Theological beliefs in the age of the Earth are investigated by <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_Science_6f40.html" title="Creation Science">Creation Science</a>, which seeks to prove canonical statements of the Earth's age by combining controversial interpretations of scientific data plus scriptural teachings."<br /></dd>
<dd>Note; no POV because I am stating that the belief (not the people) is supported by the intitution (creation science) which uses controversial (which is a defensible statement; if it wasn't controversial we wouldn't be kvetching so much) interpretations and science mixed with scripture. No mention of "pseudoscience", which is a hot-button word and will no doubt see everything come up for discussion yet again.<br /></dd>
<dd>Ergbert - our feedback is;
<ul>
<li>We'd prefer not to mention the word pseudoscience</li>
<li>We'd prefer not to mention "religious people"</li>
<li>We obviously don't support your sentence because we keep coming up with our own ideas.</li>
<li>No matter how much you say 'disbelief of scientific age is not always ignorance or religion' we disagree; we seem to believe creation science is a religious institution and religious movement. Sure you don't have to be a Christian to believe it, but it is a Christian phenomenon.</li>
</ul>

<dd>My only objection to your suggestion is creation science isn't lowercase.&#160;:)
<ul>
<li>I took the pseudoscience part from the creation science article with the hope that existing content would be less objectionable than something I came up with on my own.</li>
<li>Okay.</li>
<li>I didn't ask if you like it; I asked if you had any comments. We should try to work toward a consensus, not say "No, you're wrong/mine is better!" without providing any reasoning.</li>
<li>The belief in creation science has no direct connection to one's religious beliefs, so to say being swayed by creation science is the same as having religious reasons for one's beliefs is not factual.</li>
<li>What's with the "you" and "we"?&#160;:\ This isn't a case of everyone versus me. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgbert_1074.html" title="User:Ergbert">Ergbert</a> 04:07, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Actually, Creation science is not science, it is pseudoscience in that it fails the same criteria that ID does (see <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_Design_39cd.html" title="Intelligent Design">Intelligent Design</a>), and it fails a number of Carl Sagan's famed "baloney detection kit" criteria:
<ul>
<li>Wherever possible there must be independent confirmation of the facts (i.e., peer-review)</li>
<li>Spin more than one hypothesis - don't simply run with the first idea that caught your fancy.</li>
<li>Quantify, wherever possible.</li>
<li>If there is a chain of argument every link in the chain must work.</li>
<li>"Occam's razor" - if there are two hypotheses that explain the data equally well choose the simpler.</li>
<li>Ask whether the hypothesis can, at least in principle, be falsified (shown to be false by some unambiguous test). In other words, is it testable? Can others duplicate the experiment and get the same result?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Also, since I had mentioned "in favor of theological accounts", the use of religious as a modifier of people in my proposed version was clearly redundant. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch">Jim62sch</a> 15:59, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not unless he speaks from beyond the grave. The point being, the man was a highly respected cosmologist and philosopher of science. His "baloney detection kit" is quoted throughout science curricula in high schools and colleges (especially the later). If you compare his idea with the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_method.html" title="Scientific method">Scientific method</a> (with a bit of Philosophy thrown in) they are the same, but his is more accessible to most.</dd>
<dd>So then, since you apparently either aren't sure of Sagan's credibility, or his impact on science, let's go through the requirements of the Scientific method:<br />
<ul>
<li>Parsimonious. Economical in the number of assumptions and hypothetical entities. -- The assumption of a deity or supernatural agent violates parsimony</li>
<li>Pertinent. Describes and explains observed phenomena. -- Only by using the assumption "God made everything look older than it really is" and similar arguments can it explain anything. And given that those arguments violate parsimony, they also violate pertinence</li>
<li>Falsifiable and testable. See Falsifiability and Testability. -- The existence of a deity or supernatural entity is not falsifiable as it is outside the realm of science, thus creationism cannot be a science as it includes a non-falsifiable (neither provable nor disprovable) cause</li>
<li>Reproducible. Makes predictions that can be tested by any observer, with trials extending indefinitely into the future. -- There is no predictive element to creation "science"</li>
<li>Correctable &amp; dynamic. Subject to modification as new observations are made. -- The hypothesis has remained the same since it was first proposed, even in light of evidence contradicting the premises put forth by CS.</li>
<li>Progressive, achieves all that previous theories have and more -- given that it violates most of the tenets of the Scientific Method, it cannot be progressive as its assumption of a supernatural entity ceases any chance to take the hypothesis further</li>
<li>Provisional or tentative. Does not demand absolute certainty. -- Assumes absolute certainty (see Correctable and dynamic).</li>
</ul>

<dd>I should have noted that they were the demarcation criteria needed to achieve the scientific method. I was, unfortunately, in a rush and shorthanded it. Nonetheless, "creation science" does not match the demarcation criteria. Besides, the hypothesis came before the observations (what few there were), and it's supporters claim that it is "correct, period, and there is to be no arguing". That isn't how a true hypothesis, or theory, works. Also, there has been very little real experimentation, mostly there has been a lot of gainsaying of other people experiments because they do not fit in with the theory of CS, which as I said, is "correct, period, and there is to be no arguing". Finally, no matter what the data may show, CS throws out everything that doesn't fit the theory because the theory is "correct, period, and there is to be no arguing", the making the conclusion a foregone conclusion (pun intended). <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 22:47, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, so tell us something we DON'T know abou CS. I also don't know where you cooked up your own baloney about me crediting C.S. with bein a science. I said it used scientific data. Not that it collects it itself or anything. It's bullshit,I totally agree, in fact its an insult against all that human society has achieved, from paper clips to space shuttles. But that's not the point I was making. The wiki aricle should not throw shots across the bow of the Creation Science people by calling it for what it is; tha way we'll be reverting edits by christian fundamentalists every week. But we don't, with parsmonious and pernicious grammar, have to actually credit it with any respect either. I thought my effort was a fairly economical way of maintaining a neutral tone without resorting to "pseudoscience" and "religious people". Not like I care too much, I'm watching this page mainly to keep C.S. loonies under check, not actually, you know, bring better grammar and skills in English to bear. <a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERolinator_4b12.html" title="User:Rolinator">Rolinator</a> 01:49, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If we are going to keep in comments on non-scientific views of the age of the earth, we may want to add in one or two prominent less Western examples, such as Vedic creationism. The extremist hindus have the opposite problem with science as the Young Earth Creationists, namely they need a very old earth(on the order of at minimum 10^10 years, in some interpretations even higher orders of magnitude and they need humans to have been around and largely civilized for most of that time).

<dd>(following edit conflict:-) Er... you're last edit summary: <i>rv: It states the estimate as fact and thus violates WP:NPOV.</i> However, you are the one putting <i>estimate</i> in the paragraph, you are arguing with yourself. Based on abundant scientific evidence the age <b>is</b> 4.55 billion. That is factual per the scientific research it is bases on as stated. How is that POV? It doesn't state that the age is ... beyond any doubt, uncertainty is always a part of science. Do we need to put in the uncertainty range? The fact as stated is valid and it is adequately <i>qualified</i>.

<dd>I'd say it's not so much that I'm putting it in as you're taking it out -- you removed "estimate" 28 March and I'm trying to put it back (because it is an estimate and because of WP:NPOV). I've tried different wording again -- I haven't put "estimate" back in, but I've made it clear that the estimate is that of scientists, not everyone. I'd prefer to replace "evidence" with "research" because the former has an implied POV to me, but I'll leave that as it is for now. I removed "scientific" because IMO it looks bad to have it followed so closely by "scientists". I'm all for providing the evidence and what scientists think of it, but to state your preferred conclusion as fact is to violate WP:NPOV.</dd>
<dd>Quoting WP:NPOV: "The policy requires that, where there are or have been conflicting views, these are fairly presented, but not asserted. All significant points of view are presented, not just the most popular one. It is not asserted that the most popular view or some sort of intermediate view among the different views is the correct one. Readers are left to form their own opinions." <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgbert_1074.html" title="User:Ergbert">Ergbert</a> 21:44, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I read official policies and guidelines, and I do as they say. WP:NPOV clearly forbids SPOV language. Are you going to address that, or just make accusations? <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgbert_1074.html" title="User:Ergbert">Ergbert</a> 06:26, 2 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would suggest you read WP:SPOV. SPOV is not forbidden as you say. In any case, I restored the word "scientific" but replaced "scientists" with "geologists" as that is more accurate.<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 10:13, 2 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure if you noticed, but I've already linked to WP:SPOV in this debate; I have actually read it more than once. WP:SPOV says that SPOV and NPOV are not the same thing, so if you're going by it, writing from a SPOV violates WP:NPOV. I'd suggest one not put too much faith in WP:SPOV, though, as it is neither guideline nor policy.</dd>
<dd>I'm not completely happy with the current status of the sentence, but it's good enough for me to leave alone to avoid an edit war. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgbert_1074.html" title="User:Ergbert">Ergbert</a> 22:52, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For the record, Ergbert's last revert (estimates are not a fact) is correct. We cnnot say the Earth <i>is</i> 4.5Ga, we can only make an <i>estimate</i>. Even if people quote estimates as fact (see George Bush 'estimating' WMD's in Iraq, for instance) the truth is, in science, just as in Wikipedia, it is incorrect to state things as fact unless it is defensible. While it is fact that the Earth is older than 7,000 years, it is an estimate that it is 4.55 +/- 0.01 Ga. Note that quoting error means you are interpreting the age based on a certain degree of uncertainty in your measurements.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And no, I am not advocating we say the Earth is 7001 years old. I'm just being pedantic about clipping the words "estimated" and "assumed" out.

<dl>
<dd>Agree, but the age is given as based on existing scientific evidence - seems adequate without throwing in all sorts of fudgy <i>estimates</i>.

<dd>I'm not sure if you consider me part of that group, but my interest in editing this article is purely in relation to WP:NPOV, so I'm just fixing up POV stuff other people write; I was hoping to quickly find something on Wikipedia, got here after a few links, noticed a WP:NPOV-violating sentence, fixed it, and was surprised when I checked back in and found my edit had been reverted. On another topic, it would be helpful if people would indent replies; this probably should've gone on the bottom, but w/o indentation it would look like I was replying to something other than that which I am. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgbert_1074.html" title="User:Ergbert">Ergbert</a> 23:13, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, fair enough, it might not <i>actually</i> be 6,000 years. Maybe 7,000 or so, come on, it's just an approximation. And besides, the example of the guy calling the rock "satanic" and the ranger's counter-response that it didn't prove faith as a path to salvation was, in a way, absolutly correct. Simply calling a rock satanic doesn't justify a thing, nor does voicing an opinion make it right on its own. As a resident of the Bible belt, I am not really surprised he got a whole lot of responses which didn't have much explanation or reason behind them, believe it or don't, but speaking from my personal experiences, a whole bunch of Christian friends I know just plain don't know much about answering the objections of almost anyone, much less atheists or evolutionists. (Some even chalk it up to "Well, maybe the Bible is full of contradictions...well, maybe Genesis is a big old allegory and God was lying....or whatever) And it's not like we object on the ages or whatever of everything to turn the world into a dangerous theocracy of eating rocks or something, just whenever it conflicts with the Bible, which to my knowladge, isn't that often when its outside the age of the earth or evolution. Like Quantum Physics, that's all fine, had a chapter on it myself last semester, very interesting section, seems to fit the data and observations nicely, I see no problems there. What's the big deal about not trusting facts that contradict the Bible? It's not gonna make someone press that red button one day marked "don't press"...... <a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHomestarmy_5e94.html" title="User:Homestarmy">Homestarmy</a> 01:32, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't say I understand all of it, but we had a good chemistry teacher, I certainly know a good bit about it. My point was that the apparent objection that Christianity is dangerous for "not acknolwadging the advancements of mankind" or whatever doesn't really apply much to anything scientific outside of evolution or age of the earth stuff. Christianity wouldn't, say, create a state where everyone ate rocks, worked on how to blow up the ocean, struggled to destroy all nuclear power plants and then play with the waste, or dangerous things like that which would come from "denying the advancements of mankind" in the understand of such things. Denying evolution and the supposed age of the earth will not make the world contract a termimal "stupid disease" or something, although the responses that ranger was getting were really a bit lazy for the subject matter at hand, laziness alone does not make things "dangerous". <a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHomestarmy_5e94.html" title="User:Homestarmy">Homestarmy</a> 12:31, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, they wouldn't be associated with dangerous things like HIV denial and global warming denial (both associated with fellows of the Discovery Institute, global warming denial is also associated with AiG, Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson), or deny that condoms will generally stop HIV. All of these occur as denial of science for what are either religious reasons or collateral damage from the religiously motivated denials. Not trusting facts because they don't fit ones preconceived notions is dangerous regardless of motivation (the US has lost two spaceshuttles from that for example). Its a very bad habit no matter where its coming from. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 12:44, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But here's where things get messy, you've got to be able to separate the politics from the religion. It's partly why, despite my total fundamentalism, I really don't think I want to get into politics. HIV denial has nothing to do with the Bible, global warming may even technically be supported by end times prophecies since, you know, its bad, as far as I know condoms aren't safe to block HIV an extremely high percent of the time anyway so I don't see why you'd want people to risk it by telling them "Well, you've got good odds of getting away without HIV!", and space shuttle's also aren't really mentioned in the Bible either. All of those things probably have some political motivations behind them, simply because the people participating in such controversies may outwardly seem to be using the Bible or Christianity (perhaps even with gusto) doesn't mean they actually are. This sort of thing goes beyond religion, for instance, elementary school biology books. Im sure you're very familiar with the standard creationist response to evolution as "just a theory, not a fact", which is based pretty much on elementary school biology books, which generally state a theory as some sort of hypothesis which is not a fact. As I understand it, the real definition of a theory is quite a bit more complex than that, so much so that the <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">Evolution</a> article requires an entire section on it, elaborating beyond what people learn in the 1st grade or whatever, because although the elementary school books <i>appear</i> for all intensive purposes to be the modern examples of evolutionary theory, they aren't. So like the people on the right side of politics, the burden of determining whether or not their using Christianity falls upon learning quite a bit more about Christianity than what you see from the political world alone. Furthermore, because of what I have now learned about the evolution vs. creationism debate, I would not trust those elementary school books to tell me about the definition of "theory" anymore because I now have a preconceived notion that whenever someone tells me a theory means "a non-fact", then the book they got that out of was probably lying as to the true nature of what is a theory and what isn't, perhaps for the sake of deceptive simplification. Is this dangerous? <a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHomestarmy_5e94.html" title="User:Homestarmy">Homestarmy</a> 13:01, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
