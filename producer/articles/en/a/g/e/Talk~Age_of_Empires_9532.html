<dd>I don't think there has been such a tournament for a long time - there were around 100 players for each version of the game online at once back in the Zone days, probably fewer now. There is a small ladder at Age of Empires Heaven, but that is all I know of. A mention of the history and current status of online play is important for any game, but I'm not sure the above statement reflects the truth anymore. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard001_655e.html" title="User:Richard001">Richard001</a> 23:45, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I cannot recall gates in the original. AOEII has them. The original always used a set of walls that leave just a little pathway in between. The best defence was to make the entrance a winding entrance and setup some towers around it.

<dd>I've done a search on the AOE help file, and I can't find any references to gates apart from in the history section, which isn't about the game at all.

<p>Do we really need the information about "militarism" and "persuasion technology" in the Expansions section? The information is inaccurate (e.g. priests were actually in the game before the expansion pack), and was explicitly first posted as an effort to put anti-Microsoft material into the article.

<dd>There is a difference from mentioning map/resource cheats ("Pepperoni Pizza" or "no fog", which is of no interest unless the result is strange enough to be notable) and units created or modified by cheats.

<dd>If you read the list I deleted, you would have noticed that almost half of it is of "no interest" nature. Anyway, I'm afraid I cannot still agree with your argument, because <b>normal units are regularly used in game play, while cheat units are not</b>. Not that I'm much fond of keeping detailed information of individual units - it would have been sufficient to describe what type of units the game has, and what types of resources/technologies were supposed to be acquired for game advance. Cheat uniits can be fun for the people who have played the game and want to explore at a time they are bored, but "an outsider" who wants to know about the game would not care much about what type of <i>cheats</i> are available, unless they stand out in some way in computer games in general. True, cheat units are <i>different</i> from game-variable tweaking cheats, but does that fact alone make them <i>significant</i>?</dd>
<dd>If you really feel like that cheat units <i>must</i> be mentioned, I guess just listing and describing those units who are really interesting to a non-AoM player would be ok. My argument here is, an AoM player won't most probably consult <i>Wikipedia</i> to see what kind of cheats are out there. So, listing cheat codes won't be of much use either. We can put a link to the most complete cheat site instead, in case anyone want's to know. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenleaf_48a6.html" title="User:Greenleaf">Greenleaf</a> 09:46, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Half</i>, not <i>all</i>. Still, you are missing the point: the cheat units in AoE are quite a novelty of the game - with the exception of super beefed-up regular units, no other RTS I know about has units that use different sprites and are completely anachronic with the setting of the game - a corvette with a rocket launcher and a trooper with a laser in this case.

<p>Whoever took the cheats off the wikipedia article "Age of Empires" can you please put them back on?

<dd>I don't want to evaluate this article either (having already put down <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Mythology_3a0d.html" title="Age of Mythology">Age of Mythology</a>), but here's a Peer Review for your pleasure:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Absolutely no references. Usually this is enough to fail a GAC outright.</li>
<li><a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a>: <s>In a bizarre twist of fate it has <i>too much</i> blue text (links). You do not need to link to every game in the series. You have templates and series articles and sections in the main article for that.</s></li>
<li><s>Starting the main article off with a list is bad form, imo. It's better than the AoM article as list to prose ratio goes, but it's still too much. Move it somewhere out of the way, prosify it, or get rid of it altogether.</s></li>
<li><s>The first real paragraph talks about how the Shang are overpowered. That's definitely not an "overview", that a detail. Move it elsewhere and cite sources for it, please.</s></li>
<li><s>Fold the "technology" section into the overview; both are short sections and tech is a huge part of RTS gameplay.</s></li>
<li><s>Units - Ugh. I despise unit lists. My ideal is entirely prose: A paragraph or two on basic units (infantry, archers, cavalry, priests, villagers), a paragraph on seige machines, and a paragraph on ships. I wouldn't bother listing <i>every</i> variation on each type; just say there are different types and leave it at that.</s></li>
<li><s>Buildings: Again, prosify and generalize. You don't need to list small walls, big walls, and fortifications (as an example).</s></li>
<li><s>Scenario Builder: Ugh again. I basically don't like this entire section. Too many weasel words, too much fancruft, and too much <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">OR</a>: "Restrictions can also be good for creativity"? WTF?</s></li>
<li><b>What's missing</b>: The real-world importance of the game. Sales, reviews, public reaction. Find interviews with the developers and see if they say anything worth putting in. What made this game so popular that Ensemble Studios decided to make an expansion and sequels?</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope that helps a bit. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 04:53, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Having nominated an article myself (<a href="../../../b/r/%C3%B8/Br%C3%B8ndby_IF_70de.html" title="Brøndby IF">Brøndby IF</a>) I was a little surprised to see AoE on there, but I've tried to improve it a little, incidently that's taken care of some of the bad points listed above, I think:</dd>
<dd><b>Improvements</b>: 3), 4) &amp; 5) - I've rearranged the Overview section, dragging the general gameplay info on top, and made a "Civilization" subsection, while moving "Technology" up as a subsection too. As for the rest - I've formatted the lists cosmetically, but I agree prose is better, and I prefer lists in seperate articles.</dd>
<dd><b>What's missing</b>: I find the expansion really underrepresented, and the Sequels and See also sections are kinda superfluous. Also, the AoE games template could need some work too. Apart from the sections Nifboy missed, a section on historical accuracy (might be difficult) would be a great thing to have as well. <a href="../../../p/o/u/User%7EPoulsen_e5d4.html" title="User:Poulsen">Poulsen</a> 11:43, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I want to thank Nifboy especially for giving a peer review of how to improve this article. I'll admit, I was rather overzealous when I nominated this article for being a Good Article. However, I've been working to make this article better so that it's worthy of that title. The changes I've made so far are:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Removed the "Sequels" section and any references to the other games, since it is in the template and, as Nifboy pointed out, is redundant.</li>
<li>Condensed the units section into a few paragraphs.</li>
<li>Condensed the buildings section into a few paragraphs.</li>
</ul>

<dd>I've been using the article for <a href="../../../s/t/a/StarCraft_11be.html" title="StarCraft">StarCraft</a> as a model since it became a featured article. I noticed that it didn't have any section in the article about the expansion (since it has its own page), so I did likewise on this page. I renamed the "Scenario Builder" section to "Custom Scenarios" and cleaned it up. I also ran the page through a spell checker and fixed everything there. It seems like the only section missing is a section on the real-world importance and how it turned out. References are pretty sparse on the <a href="../../../s/t/a/StarCraft_11be.html" title="StarCraft">StarCraft</a> page. One of them is the manual and the other two seem to be articles from a magazine. My point is that if a featured article about a similar game has hardly any references, should this game be trashed for that reason? Also, I'd love to include the manual for Age of Empires (and it should be included, in my opinion), but I can't find an author and therefore don't know how to cite it. Any help?<a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThunderforge_02c0.html" title="User:Thunderforge">Thunderforge</a> 21:54, 24 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But Starcraft also has eight "notes" in addition to those three references: According to <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> notes are basically references that aren't full citations, although this is the first time I've seen both on the same article. <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Mario_64_2f79.html" title="Super Mario 64">Super Mario 64</a> got in with two references, but when it went on FARC the number went up to eleven. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 23:13, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see the article has been edited a bit recently. It's good to see it's moving towards being a 'good article', and the unit lists were a bit much, but I'm concerned that some of the editors seem to know a lot more about 'good article writing' then the game itself. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy to receive constructive criticism and see the article tidied up a bit, but in the 'Custom Scenario' section there were some comments that make it clear that the author simple doesn't have any idea what he or she is talking about. If they don’t know the game, how can they make comments or edit out what they think is or isn’t important?</p>
<p>With regards to the review of the section ‘Custom Scenarios’, ‘’"Restrictions can also be good for creativity"? WTF?"’’ - This is a rather amateurish comment to make and shows little understanding of creativity. Jack White recently said that the simple combination of guitar and drums helps a lot with being creative. If you have no restrictions, you have nowhere to start, and it becomes to complex. That’s what has happened with scenario editors, and the results are less designers, fewer good campaigns, many ‘noobish’ campaigns by authors who can’t understand the complexity of the editor, and ultimately a general decline in designing as a whole. I’m not going to put the comment back in though, as it would surely be too “ORish”, even if accurate. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard001_655e.html" title="User:Richard001">Richard001</a> 08:05, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Words can't really explain the beauty of some of the best map design we have in custom AoE scenarios. I'd love to upload a picture, though I don't understand all the copyright stuff involved - technically it's both the intellectual property of the design and ES/MS, and if I upload one it will probably be deleted. I think it's very important that we have one in the custom scenarios sections though, so people can see just what is possible. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard001_655e.html" title="User:Richard001">Richard001</a> 08:51, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm no expert on the matter, but since it is a screenshot of the game itself, I'd say it's okay since the other screenshots in this article are fine. First, you should make sure that you have the permission of the scenario author. If that's yourself, then I'd say go for it. Otherwise, ask them first before posting it. If anybody else knows more about this than me, please weigh in. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThunderforge_02c0.html" title="User:Thunderforge">Thunderforge</a> 20:43, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've moved external link related topics into this common area. Regarding cheats, I think we can agree that there shouldn't be an external link to cheats for the game - these can be found easily on google, and the fansite listed has them as well. I'm sure if anyone wants cheats they can be resourceful enough to find them by themselves, besides, I see no point to encourage cheating. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard001_655e.html" title="User:Richard001">Richard001</a> 00:42, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The section on the campaign/expansion ‘Rise of Fiji’ has been taken out (not by me, but presumably a fellow AoEHer). This hardly belongs in the ‘expansions’ section, as it is far from a true expansion of the game. The external link has been left, but this doesn’t warrant a mention in article; the campaign scored poorly, and though the mod had some creative features, it only modified the game in a superficial way, without really changing the appearance of units or anything like that. If this deserves a mention in the article, then to be fair, so do many other campaigns, utilities etc. I would like to make some showcases of the best campaigns, like Martial Emperor, Memories of the Gupta Dynasty, Budonian Tales etc, but given the obscurity of the scenario design area, it would hardly <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard001_655e.html" title="User:Richard001">Richard001warrant</a> the space it would take up.</p>

<p>Recently, the user "Aaron Brenneman" deleted all of the links to Age of Empires Heaven. I'm not exactly sure if that is the right action or not. For example, the <a href="../../../s/t/a/StarCraft_11be.html" title="StarCraft">StarCraft</a> article has four community sites listed as external links.

<dd>Goodness. That's a fantastically condescending and hairsplitting post you've just made. If I may be so bold as to suggest that the differentiation between <i>"a <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fansite.html" title="Fansite">fansite</a> or fan site, is a website created and maintained by a fan(s)"</i> and <i>"A <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanlisting.html" title="Fanlisting">fanlisting</a> is a website created by a fan of a particular subject"</i> is important mostly when trying to avoid the spirit of the guideline. I'd also ask, with eyebrows raised, whom "us" consists of in <i>"discuss with us?"</i> I'd finally suggest that the "consensus" you're claiming consists of a very few posts involving very few people, spaced over a few months. You do notice that there are only two names in this thread?<br />

<dd>The difference is very big - a <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanlisting.html" title="Fanlisting">fanlisting</a> is a site where a bunch of people say that they like something - it's basically a contentless list. The article I've linked to explains this clearly. A fansite can have a lot of useful information and content such as forums, downloads etc. There was several approvals of the site (at least 3 people agreed above) and you're the only person trying to trim the links down to two sites, neither of which have a great deal of content. AoEH is the last major active fansite for AoE and serves as a place for the community of the game to get together and enjoy it. I really can't understand why you're so intent on removing the link, it's there for the good of the article and fans of the game. As quoted, the words (not the spirit) of the policy clearly say that one major fansite (as is the case here) is perfectly fine.</dd>
<dd>Hopefully my attempts to explain the issue have resolved any dispute. I don't see why there should be any further disagreement between us as it seems to me an extremely straight foward issue. If you're still intent on removing the link I ask that you find some other editors to support your case, or cite some policy explicitly stating that it should not be there. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard001_655e.html" title="User:Richard001">Richard001</a> 04:33, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
