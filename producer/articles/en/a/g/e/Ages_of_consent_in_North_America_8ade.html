<p>The <b>ages of consent</b> for sexual activity vary by jurisdiction across <b>North America</b>. The specific activity engaged in or the gender of its participants can also be affected by the law. Below is a discussion of the various laws dealing with this subject. The highlighted age refers to an age at or above which an individual can engage in unfettered sexual relations with another who is also at or above that age. Other variables, for example homosexual relations or close in age exceptions may exist and are noted when relevant.</p>

<p>Although <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> is a <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federation.html" title="Federation">federation</a>, the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criminal_law_in_Canada_60b9.html" title="Criminal law in Canada">criminal law</a> (including the definition of the age of consent) is in the exclusive jurisdiction of the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_of_Canada_fd65.html" title="Government of Canada">federal government</a>, so the age of consent is uniform throughout Canada. The age of consent in Canada is generally <b>14</b> (see below).</p>
<p>Where an accused is charged with an offence under s. 151 (Sexual Interference), s. 152 (Invitation to sexual touching), s. 153(1) (Sexual exploitation), s. 160(3) (Bestiality in presence of or by child), or s. 173(2) (Indecent acts), or is charged with an offence under s. 271 (Sexual assault), s. 272 (Sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third party, or causing bodily harm), or s. 273 (Aggravated sexual assault) in respect of a complainant under the age of fourteen years, it is not a defence that the complainant consented to the activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge. {<a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/C-46/section-150.1.html" class="external text" title="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/C-46/section-150.1.html" rel="nofollow">Criminal Code of Canada, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, section 150.1 (1)</a>, link continuously updated as Act is amended.}</p>
<p>There exists a <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_consent.html#Close_in_age_exceptions" title="Age of consent">close in age exemption</a> in cases where the partners are within two years of age of each other (Section 150.1(2)) or where the person who would be charged is under 14 (Section 150.1(3)).</p>
<p>Section 153 <i>Sexual exploitation</i> mandates an age of consent of 18 years in cases where a person is in a position of trust;</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Every person commits an offence who is in a position of trust or authority towards a young person, who is a person with whom the young person is in a relationship of dependency or who is in a relationship with a young person that is exploitative of the young person...</i>" <a href="http://www.canlii.org/ca/sta/c-46/sec153.html" class="external text" title="http://www.canlii.org/ca/sta/c-46/sec153.html" rel="nofollow">{Sect153}</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Finally, section 159 of the Criminal Code sets the age of consent for anal intercourse at 18 years, with an exception if the two partners are married. This discriminates against unmarried persons.</p>
<p>Section 159 is also a somewhat effective unfettered age of consent for gay men 18 as this is the only method of penetrative intercourse available for gay males.</p>
<p>In the past, courts in Ontario (1995) and Quebec (1998) independently declared Section 159 of the Criminal Code of Canada (Anal Intercourse) unconstitutional.</p>

<p>The unfettered age of consent in <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> is <b>18</b>. In Mexico, criminal legislation is shared between the Federal Government and regional states. Federal law may allow relations between young persons as low as 12, however, there may be local <b>state laws</b> that override the federal law.</p>

<p>Article 261 of the <a href="http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/9.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/9.pdf" rel="nofollow">Federal Penal Code of Mexico (PDF)</a> states that: <i>”Whoever, without the purpose of reaching copulation, performs a sexual act in a person under 12 or in a person that has no capacity of understanding the meaning of the act or that for any reason cannot resist, or demands that the act is performed, will be punished with a term of 2 to 5 years in prison”</i>. If the offender uses moral or physical violence, an extra half term is added to the initial time.</p>
<p>Article 266 refers to the previous article 265, which covers the <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">rape</a> of adults in general and establishes a term of 8 to 14 years in prison for sex obtained through physical or moral violence. Article 266 then states that: <i>"It is equivalent to rape and will be punished with the same penalty: (1st Clause) – who without violence performs a copulation with a person under 12”</i>. The 3rd Clause of this article punishes with the same penalties also “the vaginal or anal introduction of objects, without violence and with lascivious goals”, in a person under 12 or in a person that has no capacity of understanding the meaning of the fact, or for any reason cannot resist. If any of the aforementioned acts is performed with physical or moral violence, the sentence is raised in up to a half.</p>
<p>A further article, 266 Bis, determines an extra penalty of up to a half under certain circumstances – (a) when there are multiple offenders; (b) when the offense is committed by a parent, legal guardian, step-father or “companion” (<i>amasio</i>) of the mother; (c) when there is an abuse of <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authority.html" title="Authority">authority</a> of someone as a <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_service.html" title="Civil service">civil servant</a>; (d) when the crime is committed by a person who has the minor under his or her <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_custody.html" title="Child custody">custody</a>, guard or education, or yet through the abuse of trust.</p>
<p>There is another crime in Article 262 for <b>consented sex with adolescents</b> aged 12 to 18, when consent is obtained through <a href="../../../d/e/c/Deceit.html" title="Deceit">deceit</a>. The penalty is 3 months to 4 years in prison. This crime, however, is only prosecuted through a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complaint.html" title="Complaint">complaint</a> of the minor or his/her parents or legal guardians, as determined in Article 263.</p>

<p>The age of consent in the Federal District of <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico_City_fae1.html" title="Mexico City">Mexico City</a> is <b>12</b>, and the overall criminal legislation of Mexico’s capital is close to that of the federal law regarding this subject, although tougher in some aspects – higher penalties and broader definitions.</p>
<p>According to the <i><a href="http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/10.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/10.pdf" rel="nofollow">Estatuto del Gobierno del Distrito Federal (PDF)(in Spanish)</a></i> (Government Statute of the Federal District), Article 42, Clause XII, the District’s Legislative Assembly has powers to legislate in <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criminal_law.html" title="Criminal law">criminal law</a>.</p>
<p>Article 175 of the <a href="http://www.unifr.ch/derechopenal/legislacion/mx/cp_mexicoNew4.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.unifr.ch/derechopenal/legislacion/mx/cp_mexicoNew4.pdf" rel="nofollow">Federal District Penal Code</a> refers to the previous Article 174, which stipulates a term of 6 to 17 years of prison for the <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">rape</a> of adults, while defining <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_intercourse.html" title="Sexual intercourse">copulation</a> as “the introduction of the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">penis</a> in the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anatomy.html" title="Anatomy">human body</a> through the <a href="../../../v/a/g/Vagina.html" title="Vagina">vagina</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/u/Anus.html" title="Anus">anus</a> or <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mouth.html" title="Mouth">mouth</a>”. Article 175 (<i>violación</i>) then states that: <i>"It is equivalent to rape and will be punished with the same penalty:</i> (1st Clause) – <i>who performs a copulation with a person under 12 years of age or with a person that has no <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capacity_%28law%29.html" title="Capacity (law)">capacity</a> of understanding the meaning of the act or that for any reason cannot resist”</i>; The 2nd Clause defines as committing the same crime whoever “introduces in the vagina or anus any element, instrument or any part of the human body different from the penis”, in relation to these same persons.</p>
<p>Article 177 covers “<a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_abuse.html" title="Sexual abuse">sexual abuse</a>” and punishes other acts referred as “unintentional” acts –“who without purpose of reaching copulation, performs a sexual act with a person under 12 or a person that has no capacity of understanding the meaning of the act or that for any reason cannot resist it, or that demands that such act is observed or performed, will be punished with 2 to 7 years in prison”.</p>
<p>In both Articles (175 and 177), there is an extra half term in case of physical or moral violence. And according to Article 178, there is also a punishment of an extra two thirds of the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Term.html" title="Term">term</a> under the same circumstances foreseen in Article 266 Bis of the Federal Law (see above), added by two new circumstances – (clause V) when the victim is inside a private vehicle or a <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_service.html" title="Public service">public service</a> <a href="../../../v/e/h/Vehicle.html" title="Vehicle">vehicle</a>; and (clause VI) when the crime is committed in a desert or isolated place.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a crime called <i>estupro</i> stipulated in Article 180, which refers to <b>consented sex with adolescents</b> aged 12 to 18, when consent is obtained through <i>any means</i> of <a href="../../../d/e/c/Deceit.html" title="Deceit">deceit</a>. The penalty is 6 months to 4 years of prison. This crime needs a complaint (<i>querella</i>) to be prosecuted.</p>

This subsection is ambiguous on its face, and only seems to apply if you transport a minor across state or international lines to a place where the conduct is already illegal to begin with. <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/ceos/trafficking.html" class="external text" title="http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/ceos/trafficking.html" rel="nofollow">United States Department of Justice</a> seems to agree with this interpretation.</p>

For the purposes of age of consent, the only provision applicable is <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/18C109a.txt" class="external text" title="http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/18C109a.txt" rel="nofollow">{Chapter 109A, 18 U.S.C. 2243(a)}</a>. 2243(a) refers to situations where such younger person is under the age of 16 years, has attained 12 years of age, and the older person is more than 4 years older than the 12-15 year old (persons under 12 are handled under 18 U.S.C. 2241(c) under aggravated sexual abuse). So, the age is 12 years if you're within 4 years of the 12-15 year old's age, 16 under all other circumstances. This most likely reflects Congressional intent to not unduly interfere with a state's age of consent law, which would have been the case if the age was set to 18 under all circumstances.

<p>There is currently controversy regarding Iowa's laws forbidding a person convicted of violation of "sexual abuse" laws to reside within 2000&#160;feet of a school, daycare center, or in home daycare provider. {§692A.2A} This is a lifetime ban. Critics of this law state that it effectively banishes those convicted from living in most Iowa cities. They point out that this law also applies to those unfortunate enough to be convicted on charges brought just outside of the current close in age exemptions, as well as those convicted interstate where age of consent laws may be lower than in Iowa.</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania, a person <b>18</b> years and over can completely escape criminal liability for consensual sex only if their partner is also 18 or over.</p>
<p>The Age of consent in <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania.html" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> is officially 16 years of age, but effectively 18 years of age, due to the interplay of various criminal statutes. A person who is 4 or more years older than a consenting partner who is less than 16 years of age can be charged with the following felony sex offenses: <i>Statutory sexual assault</i> {§ 3122.1} (vaginal or anal intercourse), <i>Aggravated indecent assault</i> {§ 3125} (penetration of the vagina or anus), <i>Involuntary deviate sexual intercourse</i> {§ 3123} (oral sex). A person 18 years or over, who engages in consensual sex with a person between the ages of 16 and 18 can be charged with <i>Corruption of minors</i> {§ 6301}, which is a first degree misdemeanour.</p>
<p>There is no "4 year rule" for the charge of corruption of minors. Additionally, the offense of corruption of minors is nebulously defined, criminalizing any conduct committed by a person 18 years and upwards which tends to corrupt the morals of a person less than 18 years of age. Sex is generally considered to constitute an act which corrupts the morals of a minor.</p>
<p>The corruption of minors statute creates a strange glitch in Pennsylvania law, as illustrated by the following hypothetical. A girl and boy in the same grade could be dating and legally having sex with each other throughout their 4 years of high school. In their senior year, the girl turns 18 in April, while the boy will not turn 18 until June. On their prom night in May, the boy and girl have sex, as they have previously done throughout high school. However, the girl is now committing the offense of corruption of a minor, because she is 18 years old and her boyfriend is only 17.</p>

<p>There is no unfettered age of consent in Virginia according to state Codes. Any penetrative sexual act other than penile-vaginal intercourse is defined in Virginian law as 'sodomy'. <a href="http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+18.2-361" class="external text" title="http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+18.2-361" rel="nofollow">Section 18.2-361</a> of the Virginian Code entitled "<i>Crimes against nature</i>" states in part;</p>

</dl>
<p>The effect of this statute may be invalidated by the US Supreme Court's decision in <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_v._Texas_dbf9.html" title="Lawrence v. Texas">Lawrence v. Texas</a> but the Virginia legislature has refused to revise the sodomy law, nor have the Virginian courts acted upon it. This means that those 18 and above involved in consensual activity in private may have a defense at court.</p>
<p>The current age of consent for penile-vaginal intercourse is adulthood as defined in the Code as 18.</p>
<p>There is debate as to whether the age of consent for penile-vaginal intercourse in Virginia is 15 as stated in <a href="http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+18.2-63" class="external text" title="http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+18.2-63" rel="nofollow">Section 18.2-63</a> of the Code which states in part;</p>

<li>18 - Applies under three different sets of circumstances, enumerated in <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.44.096" class="external text" title="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.44.096" rel="nofollow">RCW 9A.44.096</a>. Foster parents with their foster children; school teachers and school administration employees over their students; The third set of circumstances require all of the following situations occur in tandem: The older person is 60 months or more older than the 16 or 17 year old, the person is in a significant relationship as <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.44.010" class="external text" title="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.44.010" rel="nofollow">defined</a>, and such older person abuses the relationship to have sexual contact.</li>
<li>16 - Under all other circumstances.</li>
<li>Several have reported that the <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.68A.090" class="external text" title="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.68A.090" rel="nofollow">immoral communication with a minor statute</a> exists and places the age of consent at 18 due to the inability to "communicate" to 16- and 17-year-olds about sexual activity. These reports have been alarming in nature, however they are completely anecdotal, and perhaps even urban legend. The Washington Court of Appeals, Division 1 decided in the case of <a href="http://www.mrsc.org/mc/courts/appellate/056wnapp/056wnapp0133.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.mrsc.org/mc/courts/appellate/056wnapp/056wnapp0133.htm" rel="nofollow"><i>State v. Danforth</i>, 56 Wn. App. 133, 782 P.2d 1091 (1989)</a> that such communication has to be for the purposes of committing an illegal act under RCW Chapter 9.68A. Danforth's conviction was overturned by that ruling. However, the Washington Supreme Court in the case of <a href="http://www.mrsc.org/mc/courts/supreme/120wn2d/120wn2d0925.htm#120wn2d0925" class="external text" title="http://www.mrsc.org/mc/courts/supreme/120wn2d/120wn2d0925.htm#120wn2d0925" rel="nofollow"><i>State v. McNallie</i>, 120 Wn.2d 925, 846 P.2d 1358 (1993)</a> overturned the scope of the <i>Danforth</i> ruling (though not the result; Danforth would have still had his conviction overturned under the <i>McNallie</i> standard), applying the communication statute to encompass all sexual misconduct with a minor, not just those under RCW Chapter 9.68A, which deal mostly with illegal child pornography and prostitution. Due to these cases, it is clear that communications with 16- and 17-year-olds just for general sexual activity is legal, as long as such conduct discussed is not about illegal conduct or would be illegal in real life (such as the teacher/student circumstance, the foster parent/foster child circumstance, the significant relationship abuse circumstance, or asking for illegal pictures or attempting to bring such younger persons into prostitution).</li>

<li>18 - Per Wyoming statute 14-3-105 et sq as interpreted by the Wyoming Supreme Court in <a href="http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/deliverdocument.asp?citeid=123717" class="external text" title="http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/deliverdocument.asp?citeid=123717" rel="nofollow">State v.

Moore</a>. Since consent of a 16 or 17 year old (which was thought to be the age of consent for a different set of offences) to non-commercial or non-threatening sexual activity is not an absolute defense to be charged under 14-3-105, and subject to "societal standards" and parental objection, this effectively makes Wyoming's age of consent to be 18.</li>
