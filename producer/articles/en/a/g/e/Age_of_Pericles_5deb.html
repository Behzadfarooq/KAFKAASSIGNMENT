<p>During this century, Athens was governed by 10 <i>strategoi</i> (or generals) who were elected each year by the 10 clans of citizens. These <i>strategoi</i> had duties which included planning military expeditions, receiving envoys of other states and directing political affairs. During the time of the ascendancy of <a href="../../../e/p/h/Ephialtes.html" title="Ephialtes">Ephialtes</a> as leader of the democratic faction, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Pericles.html" title="Pericles">Pericles</a> was his deputy. When Ephialtes was <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassination.html" title="Assassination">assassinated</a> by personal enemies, Pericles stepped in and was elected <i><a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategos.html" title="Strategos">strategos</a></i> in <a href="../../../4/4/5/445_BCE_a162.html" title="445 BCE">445 BCE</a>, a post he held continuously until his death in <a href="../../../4/2/9/429_BCE_6e48.html" title="429 BCE">429 BCE</a>, always by election of the Athenian Assembly.</p>
<p>Pericles was a great <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orator.html" title="Orator">orator</a>; this quality brought him great success in the Assembly, presenting his vision of politics. One of his best moves was to allow thetes (Athenians without wealth) to occupy public office. Another success of his administration was the creation of the <i>misthoforia</i> (μισθoφoρια, which literally means <i>paid function</i>), a special salary for the citizens that attended the Assembly. This way, these citizens were able to completely dedicate themselves to public service without facing financial hardship. With this system, Pericles succeeded in keeping the Assembly full of members. As Athens' ruler, he made the city the first and most important <i>polis</i> of the Greek world, acquiring a resplendent culture and democratic institutions.</p>
<p>The sovereign people governed themselves, without intermediaries, deciding the matters of state in the Assembly. The Athenian citizens were free and only owed obedience to their laws and respect to their <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_mythology.html" title="Greek mythology">gods</a>. They achieved <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_equality.html" title="Social equality">equality</a> of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_speech.html" title="Freedom of speech">speech</a> in the Assembly: the word of a poor person was the same worth as that of a rich person. The <a href="../../../c/e/n/Censor.html" title="Censor">censorial</a> classes did not disappear, but their power was more limited; they shared the fiscal and military offices but they did not have the power of distributing privileges.</p>
<p>The principle of equality granted to all citizens had the danger of constituting a fraud, since many of them were incapable of exercising political rights due to their extreme poverty or ignorance. To avoid this, the Athenian democracy applied itself to the task of helping the poorest in this manner:</p>
<ul>
<li>Concession of salaries for public functionaries.</li>
<li>To seek for and supply work to the poor.</li>
<li>To grant lands to dispossessed villagers.</li>
<li>Public assistance for invalids, orphans and indigents.</li>
<li>Other social helps.</li>
</ul>
<p>These norms should have been carried out in great measure since the testimony has come to us (among others) from the Greek historian <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thucydides.html" title="Thucydides">Thucydides</a> (c. 460 - 400 BCE), who comments: <i>Everyone who is capable of serving the city meets no impediment, neither poverty, nor civic condition...</i></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Pericles_5deb.html" title="Edit section: The magistrates">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The magistrates</span></h3>
<p>The <b>magistrates</b> were people who occupied a public post and formed the administration of the Athenian state. They were submitted to a rigorous public control. The magistrates were chosen by lot, using fava beans. Some black and white beans were put in a box and depending on which color the person drew out they obtained the post or not. This was a way of eliminating all personal influence of rich people and possible intrigues and use of favors. There were only two categories of posts which were chosen not by lot, but by election in the Popular Assembly, that of <i>strategos</i>, or general, and that of magistrate of finance. It was generally supposed that significant qualities were needed to exercise each of those two offices. A magistrate's post did not last more than a year, including that of the <i>strategoi</i> and in this sense the continued selection of Pericles year after year was an exception. At the end of every year, a magistrate would have to give an account of his administration and use of public finances.</p>
<p>The most honored posts were the ancient <i>archontes</i>, or archons in English. In previous ages they had been the heads of the Athenian state, but in the Age of Pericles they lost their large influence and power, although they still presided over tribunals.</p>
<p>The <i>strategoi</i> (generals) were the most important office holders in their capacity as army and navy officers and as diplomats. The Assembly elected 10 every year.</p>
<p>There were also more than 40 public administration officers and more than 60 to police the streets, the markets, to check weights and measures and to carry out arrests and executions.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Pericles_5deb.html" title="Edit section: The Assembly of the People">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Assembly of the People</span></h3>
<p>The Assembly (in Greek, εκκλησια, that is to say, an assembly by summons), was the first organ of the democracy. In theory it intended to bring together in assembly all the citizens of Athens, but the maximum number which came to congregate is estimated at 6,000 participants. The gathering place was a space situated on the hill called Pnyx, in front of the <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acropolis.html" title="Acropolis">Acropolis</a>. The sessions sometimes lasted at from dawn to dusk. They gathered forty times a year.</p>
<p>The Assembly decided on the laws and the decrees which were proposed but relying always on the ancient laws which had long been in force. Bills were voted in two stages: first the Assembly itself decided and afterwards the Council or βουλη gave definitive approval.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Pericles_5deb.html" title="Edit section: The Council or Boule">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Council or Boule</span></h3>
<p>The Council or <i>Boule</i> (βουλη) consisted of 500 members, 50 from each tribe. These were chosen by chance, by the system described earlier, from which they were familiarly known as "councillors of the bean"; officially they were known as <i><a href="../../../p/r/y/Prytaneis.html" title="Prytaneis">prytaneis</a></i> (πρυτανις, meaning "chief" or "teacher").</p>
<p>The council members examined and studied legal projects and, moreover, looked over the magistrates and saw that the daily administrative details were on the right path; similarly, they oversaw the city state's external affairs. This council was like a prolongation of the Assembly. They also met at Pnyx hill, in a place expressly prepared for the event. The 50 prytaneis in power were located on grandstands carved into the rock. They had stone platforms which they reached by means of a small staircase of three steps. On the first platform were the secretaries and scribes; the orator would climb up to the second.</p>

<p>The economic resources of the Athenian State were not excessive. All the glory of Athens in the Age of Pericles, its constructions, public works, religious buildings, sculptures, etc. would not have been possible without the treasury of the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delian_League_d98e.html" title="Delian League">Delian League</a>.</p>
<p>Other small incomes came from customs fees and fines. In times of war a special tax was levied on rich citizens. These citizens were also charged permanently with other taxes for the good of the city. This was called the system of <a href="../../../l/i/t/Liturgy.html" title="Liturgy">liturgy</a>. The taxes were used to maintain the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trireme.html" title="Trireme">triremes</a> which gave Athens great naval power and also to pay and maintain a chorus for big religious festivals.</p>

<p>The Athenians lived modestly and without great luxuries. There were very few great fortunes. The economy was based on maritime commerce. Agriculture was also important, but it did not produce enough to feed the populace, so some food had to be imported. There was also an artisanal industry, whose products were sought after by natives and foreigners alike.</p>
<p>The state oversaw all the major religious festivals. The most important one was the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panathenaia.html" title="Panathenaia">Panathenaia</a> in honor of the goddess Athena, a ritual procession carried out once a year in May and once every four years in July, in which the town presented a new veil (<i><a href="../../../p/e/p/Peplos.html" title="Peplos">peplos</a></i>) to the old wooden statue of Athena Poliada. <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phidias.html" title="Phidias">Phidias</a> immortalized this procession in the <a href="../../../f/r/i/Frieze.html" title="Frieze">frieze</a> of the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parthenon.html" title="Parthenon">Parthenon</a>, which is currently at the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Museum_7dce.html" title="British Museum">British Museum</a>.

<p>The Athenian woman dedicated herself solely to the care of the home. Family homes contained a space, called the <i>gineco</i>, especially for women, where they would spend the day with their servants and young children. Athenian society was a <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriarchy.html" title="Patriarchy">patriarchy</a> in which men held all the rights and advantages, and had access to education and power.</p>
<p>However, some women, known as <a href="../../../h/e/t/Hetaera.html" title="Hetaera">hetaeras</a>, received a careful education so that they could have more complex conversations with men.

<p>Historians consider the Athenian V and VI century BC as the Golden Age of sculpture and architecture. In this period the ornamental elements and the technique employed did not vary from the previous period. What characterizes this period is the quantity of works and the refinement and perfection of the works. Most were religious in nature, mainly sanctuaries and temples. Some examples from this period are:</p>

<p><a href="../../../p/h/i/Phidias.html" title="Phidias">Phidias</a> is considered the greatest sculptor of this era. He created colossal gold plated marble <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statues.html" title="Statues">statues</a> ("chryselephantine statues"), generally face and hands, which were highly celebrated and admired in his own time: Athena, situated in the interior of the Parthenon, whose splendor reached the faithful through the open doors, and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statue_of_Zeus_at_Olympia_fc5e.html" title="Statue of Zeus at Olympia">Zeus</a> in the <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympia%2C_Greece_56fd.html" title="Olympia, Greece">Sanctuary of Olympia</a>, considered in its age and in later ages to be one of the marvels of the world. The Athenians were assured that after they had contemplated this statue it was impossible to feel unlucky ever again.</p>
<p>According to <a href="../../../p/l/i/Pliny_the_Elder_bac4.html" title="Pliny the Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>'s <i>Natural History</i>, in order to conserve the marble of these sculptures, oil receptacles were placed in the temples so that the ivory would not crack.</p>
<p>The other great sculptors of this century were <a href="../../../m/y/r/Myron.html" title="Myron">Myron</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polycletus_%28sculptor%29.html" title="Polycletus (sculptor)">Polycletus</a>.</p>

<p>During this age, the production of ceramic pieces was abundant. Many have survived until the present day, all of which are of high quality, which is a testimony to the skill of the artist who worked meticulously and dedicated the necessary time to each object. They are, furthermore, a testimony that a market existed inside and outside of Greece which was very demanding in terms of the perfection and completion of the work.</p>
<p>It is also known that there were many great painters, but their works are lost, both <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fresco.html" title="Fresco">frescos</a> and free-standing paintings.</p>

<p>The theatre reached its greatest height in the <a href="../../../5/t/h/5th_century_BC_f46f.html" title="5th century BC">5th century BC</a>. Pericles promoted and favored the theatre with a series of practical and economic measures. The wealthiest families were obligated to care for and to sustain the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_chorus.html" title="Greek chorus">choruses</a> and actors. By this means, Pericles maintained the tradition according to which theater pieces served the moral and intellectual education of the people.</p>
<p>Athens became the great city of Greek theater. Until the Age of Pericles, all theaters had been made of stone, but that period saw the beginning of performances in provisional theaters, made of wood, which existed only for the ten days of those productions. Theater session lasted eight consecutive hours and were a type of competition in which a jury proclaimed a winner. The best dramatists of the era entered their works into these competitions. The decor of these theatres was very simple. Each play would be performed by, at most, three actors, who wore masks to identify them with the personage they portrayed; they were accompanied by a chorus who sang, and by <i>recitadores</i>.</p>
<p>The dramatic writers from this era were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/e/s/Aeschylus.html" title="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a> (525–456 BC), who wrote on mythological themes.</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophocles.html" title="Sophocles">Sophocles</a>, whose work constituted a bitter criticism on religious and political problems.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristophanes.html" title="Aristophanes">Aristophanes</a>, who dominated the comic theatre with social criticism and caricature.</li>

<p><a href="../../../d/e/m/Democritus.html" title="Democritus">Democritus</a> (c. 460 BC-370 BC) was perhaps the most interesting of all, with his atomic theory of the Universe (the universe as an immense combination of atoms).</p>
<p>In the second half of the fifth century the name of sophist (from the Greek <i>sophi</i>, expert, teacher, man of wisdom) was given to the teachers that gave instruction on diverse branches of science and knowledge in exchange for a fee.</p>
<p>In this age, Athens was the "school of Greece". Pericles and his wife Aspasia associated with and had not only great Athenians but also foreigners from within Greece and even outside Greece. Among them were the philosopher <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaxagoras.html" title="Anaxagoras">Anaxagoras</a>, the historian <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herodotus.html" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> and the architect <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippodamus_of_Miletus_621c.html" title="Hippodamus of Miletus">Hippodamus of Miletus</a>, who reconstructed <a href="../../../p/e/i/Peiraeus.html" title="Peiraeus">Peiraeus</a>.</p>
<p>Among the most notable were the historians Herodotus (484-425), who described the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greco-Persian_Wars_ae8f.html" title="Greco-Persian Wars">Greco-Persian Wars</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thucidides.html" title="Thucidides">Thucidides</a> (460-395) which left the greatest ancient work written: <a href="../../../p/e/l/Peloponnesian_War_fd52.html" title="Peloponnesian War">Peloponnesian War</a> and <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenophon.html" title="Xenophon">Xenophon</a> (427-335), who although a partial and poorly documented writer, in the opinion of historians left a useful tool to look up information about the first years of the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_century_BC_fb99.html" title="Fourth century BC">fourth century BC</a>.</p>
<p>Athens was also the capital of <a href="../../../e/l/o/Eloquence.html" title="Eloquence">eloquence</a>. Since the late fifth century eloquence had been elevated to an art form. There were the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logographer_%28legal%29.html" title="Logographer (legal)">logographers</a> (λογογράφο) who wrote courses and created a new literary form characterized by the clarity and purity of the language. It became a lucrative profession. It is known that the logographer <a href="../../../l/y/s/Lysias.html" title="Lysias">Lysias</a> (460-380 B.C.), made a great fortune thanks to his profession. Later, in the IV century, the orators <a href="../../../i/s/o/Isocrates.html" title="Isocrates">Isocrates</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demosthenes.html" title="Demosthenes">Demosthenes</a> also became famous.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Pericles_5deb.html" title="Edit section: End of the Age of Pericles">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">End of the Age of Pericles</span></h2>
<p>Pericles governed Athens throughout the <a href="../../../5/t/h/5th_century_BC_f46f.html" title="5th century BC">5th century BC</a> bringing to the city a splendour and a standard of living never previously experienced. All was well within the internal regiment of government, however discontent within the Delian League was ever increasing. The foreign affairs policies adopted by Athens did not reap the best results; members of the Delian League were increasingly dissatisfied. Athens was the city-state that dominated and subjugated the rest of Greece and these oppressed citizens wanted their independence.</p>
<p>Previously, in <a href="../../../5/5/0/550_BC_b7f0.html" title="550 BC">550 BC</a>, a similar league between the cities of the <a href="../../../p/e/l/Peloponnessus.html" title="Peloponnessus">Peloponnessus</a>—directed and dominated by <a href="../../../s/p/a/Sparta.html" title="Sparta">Sparta</a>—had been founded. Taking advantage of the general dissent of the Greek city-states, this <a href="../../../p/e/l/Peloponnesian_League_625a.html" title="Peloponnesian League">Peloponnesian League</a> began to confront Athens. The year <a href="../../../4/3/1/431_BC_8330.html" title="431 BC">431 BC</a> let loose a series of bloody wars the like of which Greece had never seen before. The trigger of the conflict was over the island of <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corfu.html" title="Corfu">Corfu</a> which was in dispute with Sparta's ally <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corinth.html" title="Corinth">Corinth</a>, and Athens who intervened on behalf of the island by offering its support. This is how the <a href="../../../p/e/l/Peloponnesian_War_fd52.html" title="Peloponnesian War">Peloponnesian War</a> began—a war that would last another 27 years.</p>
<p>The Greek city-states entered the conflict even though the weight of the conflict fell on the two rival cities—Athens and Sparta. Athens displayed her military superiority at sea whereas Sparta proved to be invincible on land. The Spartans eventually invaded <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attica.html" title="Attica">Attica</a>, the territory surrounding Athens. Pericles had to bring the people inside the city walls for their protection. The terrible sanitary conditions led to an <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plague_of_Athens_ef72.html" title="Plague of Athens">epidemic</a> that caused the death of thousands of people, including Pericles himself (<a href="../../../4/2/9/429_BC_f2d8.html" title="429 BC">429 BC</a>).</p>
<p>Pericles, being the great statesman that he was, proved to be irreplacable. <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicias.html" title="Nicias">Nicias</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleon.html" title="Cleon">Cleon</a> provided forgettable administrations and in their vacuum of leadership, the influence of the politician and general <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcibiades.html" title="Alcibiades">Alcibiades</a> (nephew of Pericles) grew. After a series of lamentable decisions capped by the disastrous <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sicilian_expedition.html" title="Sicilian expedition">Sicilian expedition</a>, Alcibiades eventually turned sides to Sparta and betrayed his own city. After losing confidence with the Spartans, he returned to Athens and was unexpectedly reappointed as general. However he was subsequently dismissed after more failures and finally sought exile in <a href="../../../p/h/r/Phrygia.html" title="Phrygia">Phrygia</a> where eventually he was assassinated.</p>
<p>The classical period of Athens came to its end. The devastating war with Sparta caused such irreparable damage that the city of Athens finally lost its independence in <a href="../../../3/3/8/338_BC_46ad.html" title="338 BC">338 BC</a>, when <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_II_of_Macedonia_d86f.html" title="Philip II of Macedonia">Philip II of Macedonia</a> conquered the Greeks and subjected them to his supremacy.</p>
