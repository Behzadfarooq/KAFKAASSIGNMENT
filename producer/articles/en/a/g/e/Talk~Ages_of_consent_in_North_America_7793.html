<p><b><span style="font-size:120%">This article is part of the <i>Age of consent</i> group of articles project.</span></b></p>
<p><b>In the interest of accuracy and quality it was decided by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a><sup>*</sup> to hold these pages to a high standard of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> and to avoid ambiguity through the use of prose (not dot points) discussing the relevant statutes, case law or other authorities.</b></p>
<p>To this end all information must be properly referenced. Where writing about legislation or other law, <u>the appropriate statues and similar must be cited</u>. Where appropriate, portions of the legislation can be quoted. Where possible, a link to an up-to-date online copy of the legislation can be included (preferably, but not necessarily, in English). It is preferable to include any such references in-line, rather than in a separate &lt;ref&gt; section at the bottom of the page. This is to make it easier for readers to find the references in context.</p>
<p>The unfettered age of consent should be in bold text, in order that it stand out. No other ages should be in bold text. Any exceptions to should then be discussed afterwards (close in age exceptions, same sex relations etc).</p>

<p>There is a glaring inaccuracy that should be corrected.</p>
<p>Here is the entirety of Section 2423, with my own comments. and I've bolded the pertinent parts.. Transportation of Minors:</p>
<p>(a) Transportation With Intent To Engage in Criminal Sexual Activity. - A person who knowingly transports an individual who has not attained the age of 18 years in interstate or foreign commerce, or in any commonwealth, territory or possession of the United States, with <b>intent</b> that the individual engage in <b>prostitution</b>, or in <b>any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense</b>, shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less than 5 years and not more than 30 years.</p>
<p>This provision deals with transportation of an under 18 person.</p>
<p>(b) Travel With Intent To Engage in Illicit Sexual Conduct. - A person who travels in interstate commerce or travels into the United States, or a United States citizen or an alien admitted for permanent residence in the United States who travels in foreign commerce, for the purpose of engaging in any <b>illicit sexual conduct</b> with another person shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both.</p>
<p>This provision deals with travel to have sex with an under 18 person.</p>
<p>(f) Definition. - As used in this section, the term "illicit sexual conduct" means (1) a sexual act (as defined in section 2246) with a person under 18 years of age that would be in violation of chapter 109A if the sexual act occurred in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States; or (2) any commercial sex act (as defined in section 1591) with a person under 18 years of age.</p>
<p>This actually defines "illicit sexual conduct". Now, my previous discussion before this edit had the Chapter 109A reference directly put into Subsection (b). It would seem that all the US PROTECT Act was put in a new words "illicit sexual conduct", then seperated the definition out into it's own subsection. The only thing really new to this section is that now it's illegal to travel to another state or country to engage in commercial sexual acts with an under 18 person. This is really pretty much a moot point in the US due to prostitution being entirely illegal except in one or two counties in Nevada (and neither of those counties allow any sort of prostitution of under 18's). Again, prostitution is not within the scope of "Age of Consent" either way.</p>
<p>In no case is there anything in there about "avoiding the age of consent statute of a state", nor anything in there about parental permission at all.</p>
<p>2423(f) refers to Chapter 109A as it's bright line standard for interstate and foriegn commerce for "illicit sexual conduct" as far as non-commercial sexual conduct goes. Basically, the entirety of Chapter 109A has to do with sexual abuses of people in general in federal territories (Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, federal prisons). Rather than recreate new statute, Congress basically took 109A by reference and extended it beyond the "federal territories" provision and applied it to interstate and foreign commerce and travel. With US PROTECT, all they really did was shuffle some words around and create a few new subsections. Congress, once again, shows it's ability to pass a bill that allows them to say something, but in reality, does little to nothing.</p>
<p>Section 2423 adopts Chapter 109A's standards as far as travel intent. Since we're dealing with matters of "personal consentual sexual activity" (note I didn't say legal consentual sexual activity), rather than rape and involuntary sexual abuse, the only section in chapter 109A has to do with the general issue of Age of Consent is section 2243(a)</p>
<p>Section 2243(a) (a) Of a Minor. - Whoever, in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States or in a Federal prison, knowingly engages in a sexual act with another person who - (1) has attained the age of 12 years but has not attained the age of 16 years; and (2) is at least four years younger than the person so engaging; or attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title, imprisonednot more than 15 years, or both.</p>
<p>As a hypothetical example, Oregon and Washington. Oregon has an age of consent of 18 for sexual activity (with a close in age exception). Washington has an age of consent of 16 for the exact same thing. 25 year old lives in Idaho and meets a 17 year old online who lives in Portland, Oregon. They decide to get together and the 25 year old from Idaho gets a motel in Vancouver, WA, where the minor can take TriMet and C-Tran bus service up there. He does travel interstate from Idaho to Washington with the intention of engaging in sexual activity with the 17 year old.</p>
<p>As far as the federal law is concerned, did he violate federal law? The answer is no. Now, Idaho Law and Oregon Law may say something different. Idaho may make it illegal to communicate online to a minor in the manner that he did. The same may be the case with Oregon. But the discussion is over Federal law here, not state laws, and they should be addressed in a similar manner that I did with Washington State.</p>
<p>There's nothing in these statutes about parental permission. As for transporting minors in Section 2423(a), I am not sure as to the effects here. They are talking about "criminal sexual activity", or "prostitution". The question here also is somewhat applicable to my Oregonian and Idahoan in Washington situation, except if the 25 year old picked up said 17 year old in Oregon. Now, his intention was to engage in sexual activity in Washington, not criminal sexual activity in Oregon. Is he legal as far as 2423(a) is concerned?</p>
<p>I say yes. I'd done some cursory searching through legal sources, and I can't find any sort of similar situation of "evasion of age of consent" in any of the cases that I've found. Unless someone has access to Westlaw or a similar database that can do some searching, I'm at a loss to prove my thoughts correct on 2423(a), though I believe my thinking on 2423(b)and (f) is completely correct.</p>

<dd>I'm glad you cleared that up somewhat (and possibly opened other cans of worms&#160;;). The intent of my previous edit was to start the process of turning this dot point hell page into prose. So I wasn't doing any actual major fact checking, but something about the PROTECT part didn't sit right with me, that's why I added the {citeneeded} tag. In the hope that someone would come along and sort it out. There were several articles I found via google that were no help (all too old) and then there was the strange little addition to the very end of <a href="../../../p/r/o/PROTECT_Act_of_2003_88d2.html" title="PROTECT Act of 2003">PROTECT Act of 2003</a> under all the external links and so on stateing that it had been over ruled.

<dd>Congress apparently intended the situation to be quite confusing, a lot of it has to do with political cover, and being able to claim "I did this" when in reality it did little to nothing. All it really did is extend extraterritoriality to current laws that effect federal possessions. I also believe communications should also be just as covered as sexual activity in of itself.Gray Coyote 02:35, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Unless this article is only about age of consent for sex, the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> section is <b>wrong</b>. Informed consent etc varies by province.

<dd>Yes the article is only about the AoC for sex. It is a subpage of <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_consent.html" title="Age of consent">Age of consent</a>. Could you please expand what you mean by your statement regarding the Canada section being wrong? That paragraph isn't the best prose and I haven't been totaly happy with it. But it does cite legislation. If you have further insight to the legal situation in Canada by all means update the section.&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You've also removed the request for the format of entries, this wasn't put in lightly. The page was presented this way after a lot of problems with people adding unverified (and often wrong) information. The normal templates were tried as well as talk page suggestions and HTML comments but nothing worked as well as the explicit instruction box.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I can see what you intended and you're entitled to be bold. But you possibly are not familiar with the history of the Age of consent pages and the troubles they have seen. I'm going to reinstate the orange box (yes it's a tad non-wp) as it has worked wonders on the other pages, like <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_consent_in_Australia_and_Oceania_7184.html" title="Age of consent in Australia and Oceania">Age of consent in Australia and Oceania</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_consent_in_Europe_72e6.html" title="Age of consent in Europe">Age of consent in Europe</a>. Eventually the boxes will be removed when the format of the articles is more clear.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I've edited the titles as you suggested and will change that formatting on the other pages eventually. You're quite right that they shouldn't be linked. What REALLY needs help however is the main page <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_consent.html" title="Age of consent">Age of consent</a> it needs a lot more references and so on. --<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonotonehell_775d.html" title="User:Monotonehell">Monotonehell</a> 13:10, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The part about Canada isn't wrong if it's just about sex, but the article needed to be re-named to reflect that it's just about sex.

<dd>I have never heard the term "Age of Consent" used to refer to anything but sex when used without qualifiers. Additionally, searching for just "age of consent" and pressing GO on Wikipedia brings you directly to the page that directly addresses informed consent on sexual matters, of which "Ages of consent in North America" is one of several continent-themed subpages.</dd>

<dd>Last I looked, both this page AND <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Consent_2969.html" title="Age of Consent">Age of Consent</a> also included a link to a disambig.

<dd>The article's focus is on the variance between the Ages that can consent to particular acts. The variable that differs from article to article is not what is consented to, but the difference in ages from state to state. Thus, the proper term for this article is "Ages of consent".

<dl>
<dd>No There isn't an age of consent exactly, as the statute says if one party is under 14 then it's legal if the other is within 4 years of age, and if they are 15 or older then it's legal if they are within 10 years of age. Two 10 year olds are technically legal.<a href="../../../w/e/l/User%7EWeltall42_cbc6.html" title="User:Weltall42">Weltall42</a> 10:10, 25 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The question is, at what age is it that a person can make their own consent to any other person regardless of either's age, under the law. That's the actual age of consent. It may be that there are close in age exemptions and they should be mentioned also.</dd>

<dd>I think the key phase here is "<i>but less than seventeen years of age</i>" in the second point. Which makes the unfetted age of consent in Colorado 17, with a close in age exemption of 4 years for those under 15 and 10 for those between 15 and 16 inclusive. What do you think?</dd>

<dd>I admit continued confusion. I read 18-3-402(e) and it seems to imply that if one party is 16 and the other party is less than 10 years older that it is not a violation. Of course, the part where it says 15 would seemingly be trumped by the Federal law which sets the minimum at 16. So, depending on where you stand in the sand, that is where the line is drawn. All 4 should be listed, AoC for Under 15, AoC for 15 - 17, AoC for 17+, AoC for Positions of Trust. And IMHO (and some kind of footnote regarding the fact that even if it doesn't violate state law for a 15-year-old to have sex with someone who is 19+ it would seemingly violate Federal Law, {Chapter 109A, 18 U.S.C. 2243(a)}). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.58.186.52 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.58.186.52_e449.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.58.186.52">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<p>Similar changes in the law in other Anglo-saxon majority countries has had little effect on Pimps and drug dealers or Priests who exploit young people.Interestingly the USA and Britain who have very similar cultural backgrounds tend to have a higher teenage pregnancy rate than European countries that have lower ages of consent.The only likely effect of this Bill ,for example,will be to stop responsible 25 year old accountants having sexual relations with young people .It will not stop those who already exploit young people,since they are already in breach of the law in many cases eg Pimps,18 year old criminals who care very little for unplanned pregnancies or the transmission of diseases.Increasing the age of consent tends to increase the devision between responsible adults and the young and limits the choice for the young and leaves room for exploiters to step in .One has to question the motivation for such a bill;has it been introduced to statisfy personnal religous views .Has it been introduced by overweight middle-aged men because they fear more attractive ethnic groups having sex ,when they themselves are to grotesque to be found attractive by young people.(The UK tightened their laws in the the 1950's,just before the influx of Blacks and Asians into the country).Of course this bill will not stop wealthy Canadians from going abroad in order to breach the new law and hence it is aimed at the poor.Canadians be Scared be very Scared,you will end up as USA ,high child murder rates ,largest consumer of porn. --<i>The previous unsigned opinion was soapboxed by: |213.48.46.141|22:46, 4 July 2006</i></p>

<p>Quoting the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, there is an exemption in cases where the partners are within two years of age of each other (Section 150.1(2)) or where the person who would be charged is under 14 (Section 150.1(3)). Section 159 of the Criminal Code sets the age of consent for anal intercourse at <b>18</b> years, with an exception if the two partners are married. <b>This makes it the age of consent for gay men at</b> 18<b>.</b> Also, Section 153(2) mandates an age of consent of <b>18</b> years in cases where the other partner is in a "position of trust or authority".</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not sure I understand this, is this saying that gay male teens can't have sex at all? Or does it mean that they (no one, actually) simply can't have <b>anal intercourse</b> until they are 18. Because, there are other ways of having sex than anal. 156.34.211.160 22:38, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes the wording's a little clumsy. The Age of consent is considered to be where an individual is free to consent to any form of sexual activity with another individual. In places like Canada and Queensland, Australia where there are special rules for anal sex it's hard to say the AoC is X when there's a curtailing of a certain activity until Y. --<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonotonehell_775d.html" title="User:Monotonehell">Monotonehell</a> 03:33, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>THere is no information at all here on countries in North America other than Canada and the U.S. There are a great many such countries, though it can be easy to miss them on a map. See <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a>. I can't find any other list that might include them, such as Ages of Consent in Central America, so I'm adding a few headers in to marks where (some of) the missing information ought to go. Fill it in, please, if you know the answers.</p>

<p>I've been trying to keep up with the maintenance of this page but I'd like others to help. The problem is that editors keep adding sections in dot point form where they should be written in encyclopedic prose as per <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMoS_1f61.html" title="WP:MoS">WP:MoS</a>. With the bad examples still in the artice, more editors keep adding to the problem.</p>
<p>You can help, I've moved all the offending sections to here. If you wish to you can do the following;</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. Pick a section, Strike out the part you've icked with &lt;strike&gt; &lt;/strike&gt; to show that you're working on the section</dd>
<dd>2. Verify the information in it, check the references are valid and the interpretation is correct.</dd>
<dd>3. Repair any inaccuracies, add valid references to and possibly quotes of, official legislation where you can</dd>
<dd>4. Rewrite the section in prose, using the correct academic language and format. There should only be one age bolded, the unfettered age of consent. Any close in age exemptions or other variations should be discussed directly after. Look to the entries for Arizona and Colorado for the general format. Remember to add the references inline with each section, not as a ref template at the bottom of the article.</dd>
<dd>5. Add your revision, in alphabetical order to the appropriate place on the article.</dd>

<li>18 - Applies under three different sets of circumstances, enumerated in <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.44.096" class="external text" title="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.44.096" rel="nofollow">RCW 9A.44.096</a>. Foster parents with their foster children; school teachers and school administration employees over their students; The third set of circumstances require all of the following situations occur in tandem: The older person is 60 months or more older than the 16 or 17 year old, the person is in a significant relationship as <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.44.010" class="external text" title="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.44.010" rel="nofollow">defined</a>, and such older person abuses the relationship to have sexual contact.</li>
<li>16 - Under all other circumstances.</li>
<li>Several have reported that the <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.68A.090" class="external text" title="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.68A.090" rel="nofollow">immoral communication with a minor statute</a> exists and places the age of consent at 18 due to the inability to "communicate" to 16- and 17-year-olds about sexual activity. These reports have been alarming in nature, however they are completely anecdotal, and perhaps even urban legend. The Washington Court of Appeals, Division 1 decided in the case of <a href="http://www.mrsc.org/mc/courts/appellate/056wnapp/056wnapp0133.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.mrsc.org/mc/courts/appellate/056wnapp/056wnapp0133.htm" rel="nofollow"><i>State v. Danforth</i>, 56 Wn. App. 133, 782 P.2d 1091 (1989)</a> that such communication has to be for the purposes of committing an illegal act under RCW Chapter 9.68A. Danforth's conviction was overturned by that ruling. However, the Washington Supreme Court in the case of <a href="http://www.mrsc.org/mc/courts/supreme/120wn2d/120wn2d0925.htm#120wn2d0925" class="external text" title="http://www.mrsc.org/mc/courts/supreme/120wn2d/120wn2d0925.htm#120wn2d0925" rel="nofollow"><i>State v. McNallie</i>, 120 Wn.2d 925, 846 P.2d 1358 (1993)</a> overturned the scope of the <i>Danforth</i> ruling (though not the result; Danforth would have still had his conviction overturned under the <i>McNallie</i> standard), applying the communication statute to encompass all sexual misconduct with a minor, not just those under RCW Chapter 9.68A, which deal mostly with illegal child pornography and prostitution. Due to these cases, it is clear that communications with 16- and 17-year-olds just for general sexual activity is legal, as long as such conduct discussed is not about illegal conduct or would be illegal in real life (such as the teacher/student circumstance, the foster parent/foster child circumstance, the significant relationship abuse circumstance, or asking for illegal pictures or attempting to bring such younger persons into prostitution).</li>

<ul>
<li>18 - Per Wyoming statute 14-3-105 et sq as interpreted by the Wyoming Supreme Court in <a href="http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/deliverdocument.asp?citeid=123717" class="external text" title="http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/deliverdocument.asp?citeid=123717" rel="nofollow">State v.

Moore</a>. Since consent of a 16 or 17 year old (which was thought to be the age of consent for a different set of offenses) to non-commercial or non-threatening sexual activity is not an absolute defense to be charged under 14-3-105, and subject to "societal standards" and parental objection, this effectively makes Wyoming's age of consent to be 18.</li>

<p>I am a criminal defense attorney practicing in Pennslyavnia. I corrected the misleading statement under the Pensnylvania section which stated that the age of consent in Pennsylvania is 16. Someone deleted my content and replaced it with the incorrect information which I had removed.</p>
<p>It is important to know that an adult in Pennsylvania absolutely cannot have sex with a person under the age of 18, without possibly facing criminal prosecution. I have defended defendants as young as 18 and 19 who had consensual sex with 16 and 17 year old girls. Because these girls were less than 18 years of age and the boys were over 18, the boys were charged with corruption of minors.</p>
<p>Corruption of minors is a serious offense, which can lead to jail time and prevent one from ever having an occupation which involves interaction with children. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Vonratt (<a href="../../../v/o/n/User_talk%7EVonratt_3d65.html" title="User talk:Vonratt">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vonratt_e63d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vonratt">contribs</a>) 22:16, 7 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>I was looking at this seven continent model, and I have a doubt about Central America - where should information on Central America be added?</p>
<p>I mean, Central America is small but have a lot of countries. In the 7-continent map, it appears in light green together with North America. It seems that the page on North America is not appropriate for the countries of Central America.</p>
<p>There is a source in <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> who provides links for criminal legislation of six Central American countries, plus three more in the Caribbean – a total of 9 countries, all in Spanish <a href="http://www.unifr.ch/derechopenal/ley.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.unifr.ch/derechopenal/ley.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.unifr.ch/derechopenal/ley.htm</a> (Université de Fribourg)</p>

<dd>All up I think there'd be about 20 countries in North and Central America, although with the US having several states you're right that there will be quite a lot of sections listed here. I think for the moment we can keep adding them here as per the 7 continent model. The page is only 31KB long so far and can still grow quite a bit before we have to worry about it becoming too large. If we start making exceptions from the 7 continent model we've adopted it might get confusing. Go ahead and add them here if you want Paulo (in alphabetical country order, please) --<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonotonehell_775d.html" title="User:Monotonehell">Monotonehell</a> 12:30, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
