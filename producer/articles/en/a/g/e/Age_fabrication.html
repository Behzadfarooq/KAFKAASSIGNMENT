<p><b>Age fabrication</b> occurs when an individual deliberately misrepresents his or her true age. It is usually practised with the intent to garner privileges or status that would not otherwise be available to the individual. This can be accomplished by providing false data, verbally, in new documents or altering archival of <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vital_records.html" title="Vital records">vital records</a>.</p>
<p>For example, up until the early <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> in <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>, it was extremely common for <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actresses.html" title="Actresses">actresses</a> to subtract at least one year from their actual age. On some occasions, age is increased so as to make cutoffs for minimum legal or employable age in <a href="../../../s/h/o/Showbusiness.html" title="Showbusiness">showbusiness</a> or <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_sports.html" title="Professional sports">professional sports</a>. Sometimes it is not the people themselves that lower their public age, but others around them such as <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publicist.html" title="Publicist">publicists</a>, parents, and other handlers. Using original source material such as <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birth_certificate.html" title="Birth certificate">birth certificates</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage_license.html" title="Marriage license">marriage licenses</a>, the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Census.html" title="Census">census</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Security_%28United_States%29_305c.html" title="Social Security (United States)">Social Security</a> applications, <a href="../../../i/d/e/Identity_document.html" title="Identity document">identity documents</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_certificate.html" title="Death certificate">death certificates</a> usually provides the correct date and year. Most causes involve taking or adding one or two years to their age. However, in more extreme case such with <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Lewis_8836.html" title="Al Lewis">Al Lewis</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charo.html" title="Charo">Charo</a>, a decade has been added or subtracted to their ages.</p>

A <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sports_Illustrated_9f1c.html" title="Sports Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a> writer discovered the discrepancy when Almonte's <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominican_Republic_1b44.html" title="Dominican Republic">Dominican</a> <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elementary_school.html" title="Elementary school">elementary school</a> records gave his correct birth year.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></li>

<li>Many other baseball players, mostly from Central America, have recently had their ages corrected.

<li>Romanian gymnasts admitted in 2002 their ages were fabricated in order to compete in events which they were ineligible because of their age. Alexandra Marinescu, Gina Gogean, Monica Zahiu, and <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniela_Siliva%C5%9F_6949.html" title="Daniela Silivaş">Daniela Silivaş</a> admitted Romanian authorities fabricated their ages to compete in senior competition. Silivas, born May 9, 1972, admitted in 2002 her passport had been changed to May 9, 1970 in order for her to compete at the 1985 FIG World Champinships while 13. (Until 1986, an FIG rule mandates the minimum age of a gymnast be at least 14 in senior competitions. That rule was changed to 15 from 1986 until 1996, and since 1997, the minimum age is 16.) <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/more/news/2002/04/18/romania_ap/" class="external autonumber" title="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/more/news/2002/04/18/romania_ap/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>
<li>There have been many alleged cases among cricketers, especially from Pakistan. This practice partly reflects a lack of formal birth records in parts of Pakistan, and also the desire of young cricketers and their associates for them to make a big impact in age group cricket by playing when overage. The claim that <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shahid_Afridi_7c5e.html" title="Shahid Afridi">Shahid Afridi</a> was fifteen when he made his <a href="../../../t/e/s/Test_cricket.html" title="Test cricket">Test match</a> debut is widely dismissed, but has not been positively disproven. <a href="../../../w/a/q/Waqar_Younis_1827.html" title="Waqar Younis">Waqar Younis</a> is sometimes said to have been born in 1969 rather than 1971. However unlike with the American examples above it may be that the claimed ages cannot be disproven with certainty because authoritative documentation is not merely concealed but actually non-existent.</li>

He claimed the year as <a href="../../../1/9/0/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a> when speaking in public, although he used <a href="../../../1/9/0/1901.html" title="1901">1901</a> for his <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Security_%28United_States%29_305c.html" title="Social Security (United States)">Social Security</a> and other papers filed with the government. Using Roman Catholic Church documents (at the time Armstrong was born, the birth certificate was not compulsory), jazz historian Tad Jones gave his birthday as <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_4.html" title="August 4">August 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1901.html" title="1901">1901</a>.</li>

Every official document issued by the government lists his birthday as February 7, 1887, including the 1900 Census with February 1887, his 1917 World War I draft registration, 1920 passport application, and 1936 Social Security application.</li>

At the beginning of his musical career he was a 25 year old man going on 26, he was told to drop five years off of his age, so he could have more "sex appeal" for teenage girls.
