Personal Relto Age</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Creatures</b>: None, but butterflies can be brought through a Relto page and fireflies can be brought from Eder Kemo<br />
<b>Geography</b>: An island high in the clouds which can have other islands added around it as well as a dock and a waterfall. A hut stands in the centre of the Island.<br />
<b>Inhabitants</b>: Age written for Atrus and Katran, but given as a gift to the player<br />
<b>Vegetation</b>: Pine trees and small bushes<br />
<b>Written by</b>: Yeesha</p>
<p><b>Relto</b> (which, according to <a href="../../../y/e/e/Yeesha_%28Myst%29_f6c5.html" title="Yeesha (Myst)">Yeesha</a>, means "the high place") is an Age originally Written as a gift for her parents, and resembles <a href="../../../a/g/e/Ages_of_Myst_6552.html#Myst_Island" title="Ages of Myst">Myst Island</a>. (Although Myst Island was an island in an ocean, whereas Relto is a lonely mountain peak above clouds.) The Book itself has the previously unheard of ability to follow its owner (and only its owner) through the link when it is used, and is also capable of linking to itself. This defies several rules of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_%28Myst%29_105e.html" title="Art (Myst)">the Art</a> which were previously held as absolute.</p>
<p>Another unique feature of the Relto Book is that it is capable of adding new items to the Age, through the addition of pages scattered throughout other Ages. These pages do not appear to contain any D'ni writing; rather, they are pictographic depictions of the item that is added. Additionally, these items can be turned off and on by touching the symbol itself.</p>
<p>Yeesha has said that Relto will change as an explorer's explorations continue, reflecting who they are: becoming the "soul" of the explorer. It is presently unclear to what extent Yeesha intends this, and speculations on this subject also extend into the Book's ability to somehow identify who is using it when linking.</p>
<p>In reality Relto appears to be based on <b>Rialto Beach</b>, in <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forks%2C_Washington_a8b4.html" title="Forks, Washington">Forks, Washington</a>, <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a>. The beach has rocky outcroppings which strongly resemble the Relto "island", and at certain days the mist completely obscures the sea and beach, just as Relto is a lonely peak above the clouds.</p>

The Age of Teledahn</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Creatures</b>: Many; two main species are flat brown creatures and giant feathered bird-like animals.<br />
<b>Geography</b>: A long, mountainous ridge, with a swampy interior, dotted with large mushroom-trees, popularly called shrooms.<br />
<b>Inhabitants</b>: no inhabitants shown; apprearantly once inhabited by Douglas Sharper for about six years, probably unknown inhabitants living before that.<br />
<b>Vegetation</b>: Largely populated by mushrooms; no more vegetation shown.<br />
<b>Written by</b>: Writer's Guild Grand Master Mararon in the year 8990 DE</p>
<p>The age of <b>Teledahn</b> was Written by the <a href="../../../d/27/n/D%27ni.html" title="D'ni">D'ni</a> in their year 8990. The largest of the mushrooms are several dozen meters in diameter. One is hollow; inside it is a hut, the main link-in point. From there, it connects to a number of long catwalks, which go to the source of power for this Age, a large, solar antenna, which feeds off the rapidly orbiting sun. From this power, lights are maintained, as is a gondola system, which connects to a processing chamber above the hut (and then to an office even higher up). Under the hut is a passageway that leads to some prison-rooms. From here, it leads to a back-side walkway, which connects to a little cliff that over-looks the back bay of the area. Another little tower built into the cliff suggests a secluded study, or perhaps a trading port (boxes still dot the area).</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Ages_of_Uru_0f22.html" title="Edit section: Age History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Age History</span></h4>
<p>The history of this Age is revealed in a link to an office in The City: the office of Douglas Sharper. He kept detailed journey entries from 1997 up to the present, exploring his rebuilding of Teledahn and his research thereof. From his research, it appears that it was a gift for the Lord of Caterers, Hinahsh, on his 250th birthday, in the D'ni year 8990. When Hinahsh died in 9000, control of it passed to the Guild, and subsequently, Guild Captain Ventus. Ventus began the industrialization that is currently seen on the Age. After some amount of time, a man named Manesmo bought the island, and kept it in good shape, though he apparently started dealing in slaves, a nasty underbelly to the D'ni civilization. The underground tunnel and prison cells were used for this, and they would be transported to <a href="../../../d/27/n/D%27ni_Ages_9dc7.html#D.27ni_Restoration_Council_.28DRC.29" title="D'ni Ages">Rebek</a>, where games for sport would be played out with the slaves, much like the <a href="../../../g/l/a/Gladiator.html" title="Gladiator">gladiatorial</a> games of <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Rome_6564.html" title="Ancient Rome">ancient Rome</a>. Major inspections into this slave trade were being performed just prior to the Fall.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Ages_of_Uru_0f22.html" title="Edit section: DRC Age History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">DRC Age History</span></h4>
<p>Douglas Sharper spent a good deal of time in this Age; much like Hinahsh, it is suspected, he became quite endeared with its quirky environment (and rich history). Despite taking numerous leaves of absence, mostly during Christmas time, this is where the bulk of Sharper's DRC work occurred (though towards the end he had to work on The City). Sharper kept his knowledge of the slave aspect of this Age hidden from his superiors, like Dr. Richard Watson (and others). Befriending the translator Nick, he learned as much as possible about Teledahn (and then Rebek) without the consent of the DRC. Some of his notes in fact support Zandi in his outright ignoring of DRC wishes. Douglas also met the forty-foot animal, that would swim in the waters (but also breathed normal oxygen, he later found out). He named this animal 'Shroomie' (and all of its kind) because they liked to feed on the giant mushroom-trees. As Sharper had finished much of the restoration process needed on Teledahn by 2002, he had been recalled to work on The City, and only took brief visits to Teledahn after that (he also notes later that Rebek was subsequently shelved by the DRC — something that did not surprise him).</p>

The Age of Gahreesen</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Creatures</b>: Large, terryfing creatures are said to inhabit the forests outside the main structures on this Age.<br />
<b>Geography</b>: Two rotating fortresses stand out in a natural landscape.<br />
<b>Inhabitants</b>: None, D'ni Maintainers may have inhabited the fortresses some time ago<br />
<b>Vegetation</b>: Dense vegetation surrounds both rotating fortresses on this Age.<br />
<b>Written by</b>: Unknown (D'ni)</p>
<p>The Age of <b>Gahreesen</b> was Written by the <a href="../../../d/27/n/D%27ni.html" title="D'ni">D'ni</a> in the year 8500 D.E. (D'ni Era), to be used as the <i>"Home Age"</i> for the Guild of Maintainers, a highly secretive group, of which the construction of the buildings within the Age reflect. The buildings were designed to constantly rotate, so that writing a Linking Book from the Age would be impossible; one needs a stationary position within an Age to write a Linking Book.</p>
<p>The huge buildings were used as the training center for the Guild of Maintainers, evidence of that fact being the huge "Training Wall" one finds within the bowels of one of the buildings. The rest of the Age surrounding the Guild complex seems to be jungle, in which dangerous carnivorous creatures are believed to live.</p>
<p>Gahreesen was also used at one point as a prison by the D'ni, though little is known about this aspect. A system of prison cells in the upper levels of the larger fortress were designed to be accessible only by the precisely timed use of a linking book.</p>
<p>There is also evidence pointing to the fact that the Guild was opening up certain parts of the buildings to the rest of the D'ni civilization towards the end of their fall, to dispense to the populace devices known as <i><a href="../../../d/27/n/D%27ni_items.html#High_technology" title="D'ni items">KI's</a></i>.</p>
<p>Gahreesen is sometimes referred to as Garrison by the DRC.</p>

The Age of Kadish Tolesa</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Age of <b>Kadish Tolesa</b> is full of gargantuan trees, that seem to stretch forever into the sky. A purple hue permeates the Age. The Age itself seems to be a large island of forest surrounded by a sea of clouds. Throughout the Age can be found ancient looking stone structures, most of them broken and crumbling. Most of the Age appears to be suspended in the gigantic trees, far above ground level.</p>
<p>Further exploration of the Age reveals that the stone structures are actually part of a very intricate puzzle devised to protect the treasure vault of the Age's owner, a <a href="../../../d/27/n/D%27ni.html" title="D'ni">D'ni</a> known as Guildmaster Kadish. One can find the skeletal remains of Guildmaster Kadish within the vault itself, clutching one of the many precious items that lay within. A note laying beside the skeleton brings to light his dementia and paranoia at the time of the fall of the D'ni civilization, in which he writes of his love for his treasure, how he values it more than anything else, and how he would rather die with it, than return to his people.</p>
<p>This facet of greed and love of things unimportant exhibited by Kadish is a lesson <a href="../../../y/e/e/Yeesha.html" title="Yeesha">Yeesha</a> uses to explain to those who partake of <i>"The Journey"</i>, in part, why the D'ni fell.</p>

(The rest of the Age cannot be reached, but appears to be much more green and lush.) A number of awkward bone structures dot the landscape, and a series of inter-connected dark passageways run through the back ridge, behind the waterfall. Small, manta-ray-like creatures can be found swimming in the pond below the falls, and baskets arrayed around the caves in the rear of the Age indicate that at one time this Age may have featured fishing as a distraction from everyday life in the Cavern. The focus of this Age is the linking book to its sister, Eder Kemo.</p>

<p>Garden Ages such as Eder Gira were known to have been placed in D'ni Neighborhoods throughout the Cavern as a way to escape the pressures of everyday D'ni life and get a breath of fresh air. This Age was written during what the DRC has labeled a "Garden Binge" period around 8100 DE. The latest information from the DRC in this regard has definitively closed the debate on whether Gira and its sister Age, Eder Kemo, are Ages which date back to the time of King Shomat, who ruled in the early 300's.</p>

<p>The DRC has made very little impact on this Age visually, and records are very sparse as to their opinions on the Age or its general status. A strange Linking Stone - likely placed there by either Yeesha or one of the Least, connects this Age to the DRC research station atop the Tokotah Rooftop in D'ni, but beyond that, the DRC seem to have no connection to this Age.</p>

Garden Age of Eder Kemo</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Eder Kemo</b> is the sister Age to Eder Gira, and is a very lush and wet Age. Featuring a few separate areas, this small area is host to a number of alien flaura and a couple of strange living creatures. One of the living creatures is a swarm of buzzing fireflies (almost), which buzz about a small orchard; a few will even follow you if you get close enough. The other living creatures are strange, small scorpion-looking animals called keanulits, which hang onto the walls, looking down, almost sloth-like in their movements. Thunderstorms pass through about once every fifteen minutes, but only last a minute or so. While walking around during the dry moments, you'll notice a large number of wall-carvings, all of which are very interesting. Some seem to show an enslavement, of black figures being herded around by black-figures with red bands. Next to that picture is a strange depiction of a giant mechanical structure, possibly even a spaceship. Walking around more, some of the other pictures appear to display a battle between a large monster and a giant robot, and an exodus, maybe, or a large celebration. Yet more wall carvings appear to hint at the hidden inner workings of the age of Ahnonay.</p>

<p>Research Engineer Phil Henderson disappeared in this Age in 2002, through what the DRC could only assume was the Age's "Journey Door", which the DRC themselves have been unable to open. Prior to his disappearance, Rand Miller and Dr. Richard Watson took a fairly large group of visitors on a tour of the Age during Mysterium 2002. Beyond this, however, there appears to be very little DRC activity in this Age.</p>

The Nexus book machine</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Nexus is a small Age which contains a machine with Linking Books. Based on the authentication provided by the <a href="../../../d/27/n/D%27ni_items.html#Miscellanious" title="D'ni items">KI</a>, it offers a list of Ages and locations to the user. The Nexus can be accessed through a Nexus station, which is placed in several City locations.</p>
<p>The Nexus idea dates back to the development stage of <i>Myst II</i> (eventually <a href="../../../r/i/v/Riven.html" title="Riven">Riven</a>), when it was planned <i>Myst II</i> would start on an <i>Equiquay</i>. This eventually became Gehn's <a href="../../../a/g/e/Ages_of_Riven_6344.html#Age_233" title="Ages of Riven">233rd Age</a>, which serves as the Nexus for Riven Island. Uru's Nexus recycles many textures from Riven.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, it is possible, with some very tricky jumping, to get down into the D'ni caverns and find the Nexus book without getting "To D'ni", although it is very hard.</p>

<p>The Age of <b>Ahnonay</b> <i>appears</i> to be made up of numerous small islands within a vast ocean. In the sky above, pinkish clouds float through a somewhat overcast sky. In the middle of the largest island is a small lake, which holds the structure called "The Clocktower", for lack of better description. But there is much more to this little Age ...</p>
<p>Different versions of this odd age exist, one in an ocean, one in a sea of mist, and one in space. This creates the illusion that time travel is used. Odd machines allow the manipulation of this age from a stone tower. The ocean's current can be stopped, and further investigation eventually reveals odd machinery that seems to exist outside the Age. The islands are not actually real. It is all an illusion controlled by moving spheres that contain the false ages, exploiting the fact that linking involves sending you to a specific point in space, at least in relation to that world; by moving the false island away from that point in space and replacing it with another, similar and yet modified, the illusion of continuity was formed. A fourth "age" shows the inside of these without the illusions: a cold metal construct. Current speculation was that this fourth sphere was another island that was under construction at the time of the Fall.</p>
<p>The age was designed by Kadish, who also created the age of Kadish Tolesa and the Great Tree Pub. It was intended to deceive other D'ni into believing that Kadish was, as he believed, the Grower foretold in prophesy. One of the prophesied powers of the Grower was the ability to alter the flow of time.</p>
<p>Ahnonay was on Phase 3 of its restoration when the cavern of D'ni was closed to explorers.</p>

<p>The Age of Er'cana was one of many written by the <a href="../../../d/27/n/D%27ni.html" title="D'ni">D'ni</a> to serve as harvest, or "food" Ages, meant to feed the civilization of the D'ni in the Great Cavern. Its architecture is mainly representative of Industrial usage, with large storage buildings, as well as what appears to be a transportation system for what would have been the huge amounts of food grown on the Age.</p>
