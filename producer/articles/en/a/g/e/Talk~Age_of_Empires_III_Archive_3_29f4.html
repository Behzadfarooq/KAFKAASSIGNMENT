Kanyenke complains that "your uncle sees a shadow in the forest and calls for help" and he reasons that the cherokee live far from Uncle Stuart's lands, but John says he trusts his uncle if he says the colony is in danger.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Age of empires III military units</span></h2>
<p>Why was this article deleted, it is NOT a game guide, it just lists the units in the game, a game guide tells strategies and how to use the units.</p>
<p>I agree, there is no reason to delete the article.</p>
<p>The article was deleted using the prod tag. If left uncontested for 5 days, the article is deleted. Unfortunately, there isn't anything we can do. And the fact that the article was left alone for 5 days signifies that not much traffic goes to it.

<p>We can restore it, saved it, and would you rather fill this article up with a huge amount of units [superchad]</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nope, that would not be the wisest thing to do. Under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">What Wikipedia is not</a>, Wikipedia isn't a collection of data. If you were reading about AOE3, but didn't have the game, would you want to read about every single unit there was?

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Then, what is the wisest thing to do? I didn't give much to the article myself, but it would not be fun to have written a lot about units and then get it deleted. The article about <a href="../../../t/h/e/Age_of_Empires_II%7E_The_Age_of_Kings_b212.html" title="Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings">Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings</a> icludes a list of units as well.

<p><i>More expensive settlers that work faster and double as light infantry, best at forging alliances with Native Americans, two forts can be sent, Explorer can heal, starts the game with a Native American scout</i></p>
<p>In the civilisations section of the article, It is said that the settlers double as light infantry when this is not true. The couriers have improved health and damage but are still no where near the power of light infantry. So i have taken this off. It would be much better to use them to gather and train infantry than use couriers as soldiers.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">References section</span></h2>
<p>Looks good, except they should be listed in order of appearance in the article. For example, the very first line of the article points to source number 4, which should actually be number one. Small nitpick, fairly big difference.

<p><u><i><b>This discussion is from Archive 2. It was incorrectly added to the top of the talk page on Aug. 25th, so I am reposting it here as there has been no reply</b></i></u><br />
I really don't know what graphics card to get. In a screenshot at the article it showed a screenshot with the Nvidia 6600 at the highest settings. If logic serves me correctly the numbers should represent how powerful a graphics card is, correct? The problem is I found at a shop the Nvidia 7300 was much cheaper than the Nvidia 6X00.I looked at the back of the boxes and they both agree that the 7X00 is much better than the 6X00.However though the price difference confuses me. The 6X00 could have been a bonus package. So in short, what graphics card should I get? Does it even have to be a Nvidia product? <a href="../../../7/2/2E/User%7E72.197.133.100.html" title="User:72.197.133.100">72.197.133.100</a> 23:26, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The difference between the 6xxx series and the 7xxx series is the technology used. A good guideline is using price to determine performance. Yes, the 7300 utilises newer technology, but it may be lacking in other areas, such as available VRAM or transfer pipelines, hence contributing to a lower net performance. The 6800GT is at the top (I believe) of the 6000 series cards, and should perform very well.</dd>
<dd>For reference, I have a 6800 (non-GT). It runs aoe3 at moderate settings, and anti-aliasing cannot be turned on as performance suffers too much. However, it does the job very well.</dd>
<dd>As for your question regarding whether to go for ATi or nVIDIA, that's entirely up to you. Both developers' cards work equally well. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKareeser_8b5c.html" title="User:Kareeser">Kareeser</a>|<sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKareeser_7817.html" title="User talk:Kareeser">Talk!</a></sup> 17:03, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the replies!I will take your suggestions into consideration but I have to work with a tight budget.So I guess I'll get more suggestions from professionals and decide which graphics card is right for me!

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Coin or Gold?</span></h2>
<p>So far, there appears to be no consistency in the article over whether the 'money' resource is called coin or gold. In all previous incarnations of the game, this resources has been gold, but in AoE III it is always <b>coin</b> when it is a stockpiled resource. (The mines themselves can be silver or gold).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Age/civilisation details</span></h2>
<p>Both peer reviews have commented on our use of tables. I believe that (in the AGE section) the brief description of each Age is appropriate, but that we don't need a list of the new buildings that are available. Perhaps a general comment about the style of building available would fit into the description better?</p>
<p>However, I don't know what to do about the table for the civilisations. I like it, but I suspect that it is too detail for our purposes. Perhaps we should replace it with a list of the civilisations and a basic description of their advantages and disadvantages in the style of the differents age listings. Again, any suggestions would be welcomed. <a href="../../../c/k/_/User%7ECk_lostsword_60ea.html" title="User:Ck lostsword">Ck l</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><font color="green">o</font></a><a href="../../../c/k/_/User%7ECk_lostsword_60ea.html" title="User:Ck lostsword">stsw</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><font color="green">o</font></a><a href="../../../c/k/_/User%7ECk_lostsword_60ea.html" title="User:Ck lostsword">rd</a>|<sup><a href="../../../c/k/_/User_talk%7ECk_lostsword_0878.html" title="User talk:Ck lostsword">queta!</a></sup> 14:50, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Personally, I don't think we need any more information than is given in the manual. Germans have Settler wagons, Spainiards get earlier shipments, etc etc. So a trim would be a good idea. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKareeser_8b5c.html" title="User:Kareeser">Kareeser</a>|<sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKareeser_7817.html" title="User talk:Kareeser">Talk!</a></sup> 03:02, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I inserted a new table sorting the 8 civilizations into the 3 architectural styles; note that this has also been done in the articles of AOE1 and AOE2... So why not in the one of AOE3? I think that if a table of the civilizations is to be inserted, it should be this one.</p>
<p>--<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomasBat_d8b7.html" title="User:TomasBat">TomasBat</a> 03:51, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I also inserted a new table table with the civilization details (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Age_of_Empires_III&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101915288" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Age_of_Empires_III&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101915288" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>); but this table is better than the previouse, since:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is more basic; without <b>too many</b> details</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It is not so unstable; it has better appearance and is shorter, not so gigantic.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The flags are the <b>real</b> game flags, and not other flags which are similiar.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It is similiar to the one in the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Age_of_Empires_III%7E_The_Warchiefs_a7d5.html" title="Age of Empires III: The Warchiefs">Age of Empires III: The Warchiefs</a> article, which recieves no negative critism.</li>
