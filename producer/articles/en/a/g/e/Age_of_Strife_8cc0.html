<p>The Dark Age of Technology is the name given to the period of human history that began in the 2nd millennium and ended in the 26th millennium, during which huge advances occurred in science and technology. The Dark Age of Technology saw the development of the specialised <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutant_%28fictional%29.html" title="Mutant (fictional)">mutants</a> known as Navigators and the earliest use of the <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immaterium.html" title="Immaterium">Warp</a> for space travel by human beings, with the greatest extent of space exploration and colonisation taking place during this period. Other notable developments include the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_Template_Construct_8827.html" title="Standard Template Construct">Standard Template Construct</a> (STC) system and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robot.html" title="Robot">the Iron Men</a>.</p>
<p>Much of human civilisation underwent a catastrophic collapse at the end of the Dark Age of Technology, known as the <strong class="selflink">Age of Strife</strong>, and very few records of the period survive in the 41st millennium. The <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adeptus_Mechanicus_f94b.html" title="Adeptus Mechanicus">Adeptus Mechanicus</a>, original caretakers of the STC systems, have been trying to find a functional system and are willing to go to any lengths to find even the smallest printout from an STC.</p>
<p><a name="Causes_and_Beginning" id="Causes_and_Beginning"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Strife_8cc0.html" title="Edit section: Causes and Beginning">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Causes and Beginning</span></h2>
<p>At some point during the 26th millennium, humanity was nearing the end of a period of great success, the so-called "Dark Age of Technology"; human-kind had reached its technological peak. The "<a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_Template_Construct_8827.html" title="Standard Template Construct">Standard Template Construct</a>", or STC, had been perfected by human scientists and was being used on a large scale. Despite an apparent lack of central authority, humans inhabited vast portions of the galaxy, and their civilization was largely free from difficulties with external factions--namely, other races. This success was about to come to an end.</p>
<p>One of the reasons humanity was so succesfull at conquering large part of the galaxy, was the development of the artificial constructs now only known as the "Iron Men". These powerful and fully autonomous battle robots won many wars for humanity, but for some reason turned against their masters at the end of the Dark Age of Technology. The war was eventually won by humanity, but at a great cost. The damage was catastrophic and had shattered much of humanities' power. Unfortunately, this was only the beginning.</p>
<p>At that time, the ancient <a href="../../../e/l/d/Eldar_%28Warhammer_40%2C000%29_5be4.html" title="Eldar (Warhammer 40,000)">Eldar</a> Empire began its <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fall_of_the_Eldar_62ea.html" title="Fall of the Eldar">decline</a>; the great success of the advanced Eldar race had led to decadence and <a href="../../../h/e/d/Hedonism.html" title="Hedonism">hedonism</a> on a great scale. This rampant corruption, which would eventually cause the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaos_%28Warhammer%29_1d1d.html" title="Chaos (Warhammer)">Chaos</a> God <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slaanesh.html" title="Slaanesh">Slaanesh</a> to be born, led to a great increase in <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immaterium_%28Warhammer_40%2C000%29_f4d3.html#Warp_Storms" title="Immaterium (Warhammer 40,000)">Warp Storms</a>. Parts of the galaxy inhabited by humans became isolated by these storms, cutting of all forms of travel and communication, leading to revolts and civil wars. Many isolated and vulnerable human-inhabited systems also became prey to unfriendly alien forces, such as the <a href="../../../o/r/k/Ork_%28Warhammer_40%2C000%29_0360.html" title="Ork (Warhammer 40,000)">Orks</a>.</p>
<p>However, by far the worst event of this period for humanity was the spectacular rise in the occurrence of human mutation, especially the mutation leading to <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psykers.html" title="Psykers">psykers</a> and the psychic powers they wielded. Prior to this, humans had had little experience in dealing with the forces of the <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immaterium_%28Warhammer_40%2C000%29_f4d3.html" title="Immaterium (Warhammer 40,000)">warp</a>, and the unexpected appearance of humans who could draw upon its energies led to riots, witch hunts and lynchings. Many psykers themselves were driven insane, either by the great power they suddenly possessed, the fear of persecution, or both.</p>
<p>Many psykers were overwhelmed by <a href="../../../d/a/e/Daemon_%28Warhammer%29_2065.html" title="Daemon (Warhammer)">Chaos entities</a>, and were possessed. These possessed psykers, as well as other selfish (or insane) psykers who learned to control their power, would cause even more havoc, leading to mass hysteria and devastating wars. Horrific weapons invented previously during the era of technological achievement were unleashed, turning verdant worlds such as Baal Secundus into barren, <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radioactive_contamination.html" title="Radioactive contamination">irradiated</a> desert planets--or worse.</p>
<p>In a relatively short span of time, the galaxy-spanning human civilization was brought to its knees, and was forced to endure nearly five millennia of anarchy, terror, war and slavery. Other than tales of great suffering, little information has survived this dark time.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Strife_8cc0.html" title="Edit section: Earth and Mars">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Earth and Mars</span></h2>
<p>Control of the Sol System shifted constantly between Earth, Luna and Mars during the first half of the Age of Strife. By the 28th Millennium all traces of civilization on Earth were long gone; instead, techno-barbarians battled one another over the scraps of the ancient culture. Little information remains from this dark time, but it is known that tyrants such as Kalagann of Ursh (northern Asia/Russia), Cardinal Tang, and Narthan Dume of the Panpacific Empire ruled during this age. According to the novel <i>Horus Rising</i> by Dan Abnett, Dume was opposed by the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">Yndonesic</a> Bloc, while the Urals remained a centre of industry.</p>
<p>Mars underwent a very different transformation. After brief anarchy, the tech-priests of the <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adeptus_Mechanicus_f94b.html" title="Adeptus Mechanicus">Adeptus Mechanicus</a> emerged victorious over the mutants and unified their homeworld. The tech-priests then visited Earth but were appalled at the destruction there and saw nothing worth saving. Instead, the Martians studied the <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immaterium_%28Warhammer_40%2C000%29_f4d3.html" title="Immaterium (Warhammer 40,000)">warp</a> and after many lifetimes learned to detect 'lulls' in the warp storms. At the same time the immense fighting machines known as <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titan_%28Warhammer_40%2C000%29_a748.html" title="Titan (Warhammer 40,000)">Titans</a> were created.</p>
<p>For over a thousand years the Cult Mechanicus watched and waited. Whenever a break in the warp storms occurred, an expedition was sent, complete with a full Titan Legion and thousands of servitors and tech-priests. Some of these expeditions were lost in the warp or died on faraway worlds. Others succeeded in establishing '<a href="../../../p/l/a/Planets_of_Warhammer_40%2C000_ff04.html#Forge_Worlds" title="Planets of Warhammer 40,000">Forge Worlds</a>' - replicas of Mars. Broken messages were transmitted to Mars, but it was not until the time of the Great Crusade that the Forge Worlds and Mars would be reunited.</p>

<p>Eventually, an immensely powerful human leader and <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psyker.html" title="Psyker">psyker</a> known as the <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor_of_Mankind_%28Warhammer_40%2C000%29_b654.html" title="Emperor of Mankind (Warhammer 40,000)">Emperor</a> divined that the final birth of Slaanesh was nearing, as well as the effect this birth would have. He made preparations for this galaxy-changing event; he gathered military forces, began his conquest of Earth, and started the processes necessary to create his genetically tailored super-warriors, the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primarch.html" title="Primarch">Primarchs</a> and then, from the Primarchs' <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene.html" title="Gene">genes</a>, created the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Marines_%28Warhammer_40%2C000%29_a931.html" title="Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)">Space Marines</a>.</p>
<p>Upon the birth of Slaanesh sometime in the early 31st millennium, the crippling warp storms were swept away (which allowed for easier galactic travel), the Eldar race was nearly annihilated, and the Emperor began to carry out his plans to reunify humankind under <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperium_%28Warhammer_40%2C000%29_7b95.html" title="Imperium (Warhammer 40,000)">his rule</a>. With the Emperor's ascension, the Age of Strife was finally over and a new age had begun. This brief age of conquest, heroism and unity would be known as the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Crusade_dbb1.html" title="Great Crusade">Great Crusade</a>, and it would in turn end with the tragedy of the <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horus_Heresy_77e3.html" title="Horus Heresy">Horus Heresy</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Strife_8cc0.html" title="Edit section: Legacy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Legacy</span></h2>
<p>The Age of Strife had a tremendous impact on human civilization. Humanity barely survived the period, and most of the knowledge of the previous golden era was lost, much of it irrevocably; in particular, the loss of the STC system is seen as a serious setback for the advancement of the Imperium. The <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adeptus_Mechanicus_f94b.html" title="Adeptus Mechanicus">Adeptus Mechanicus</a> constantly searches for STC technology, and jealously guards what little it finds— in fact, it treats each STC as a holy relic, virtually worshipping them. This focus on re-attaining and worshipping the ancient STC rather than inventing new technology, as well as the centralization of this knowledge in the hands of the Adeptus Mechanicus, has led to a stagnation of Imperial science.</p>
<p>Humanity as a whole became more superstitious and distrustful, something which the Imperial government goes to great lengths to encourage. In particular, the Imperium distrusts mutants, aliens and psykers; this distrust runs so deep that the Imperium has a complex secret police force, known collectively as <a href="../../../i/n/q/Inquisition_%28Warhammer_40%2C000%29_ce3d.html" title="Inquisition (Warhammer 40,000)">the Inquisition</a>, devoted to finding and destroying all aliens, <a href="../../../d/a/e/Daemon_%28Warhammer%29_2065.html" title="Daemon (Warhammer)">daemons</a>, mutants, unsanctioned psykers and "heretics" (anyone deemed to be straying from official Imperial doctrine) existing within the Imperium. Despite the general distrust of psykers, many critical functions of the Imperium, notably the maintenance of the <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronomican.html" title="Astronomican">Astronomican</a>, are performed by them, so they are often rounded up by Imperial agents and forced into service. The Adeptus Ministorum (aka. the <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesiarchy.html" title="Ecclesiarchy">Ecclesiarchy</a>), the official religious hierarchy of the Imperium, enforces a strict dogma including absolute devotion to the Immortal Emperor (who is treated as a god), closed-mindedness, xenophobia, and blind dedication to one's duty.</p>
<p>In short, the authoritarian Imperium of Man is the way it is in large part due to the great suffering endured during the Age of Strife.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Strife_8cc0.html" title="Edit section: Why the &quot;Dark Age&quot; of Technology?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Why the "Dark Age" of Technology?</span></h2>
<p>During the Dark Age of Technology, humanities' power and technology were at its zenith. Yet, the people of the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperium_%28Warhammer_40%2C000%29_7b95.html" title="Imperium (Warhammer 40,000)">Imperium</a> invariably refer to it as a "dark age". The main reason for this is that during this time humanity began to rely more and more on its technology, in particular its <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_Intelligence_4365.html" title="Artificial Intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a> agents like the Iron Men. Eventually, man became so dependent on its creations that (according to Imperial mythology) it became unclear who was the master and who was the slave. Eventually this culminated in the war with the Iron Men.</p>
<p>With the rise of the Imperium of Man, humanity swore never to repeat the mistakes of the Dark Age of Technology by relying on "Abominable Intelligences" or technology in general. Instead it would rely on on the strengths of humans and humanity itself, where technology would merely complement it. For example, instead of autonomous war machines, the Emperor relied on his (bio-engineered, heavily armed and armoured, but still human) <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Marine_%28Warhammer_40%2C000%29_4e27.html" title="Space Marine (Warhammer 40,000)">Space Marine</a> Legions to reconquer the galaxy. This has continued up to the 41th millennium, where AI's are considered technoheresy even by the <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adeptus_Mechanicus_f94b.html" title="Adeptus Mechanicus">Adeptus Mechanicus</a>. Even technological constructs with a limited form of autonomy (often referred to as a <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machine_Spirit_96cc.html" title="Machine Spirit">machine spirit</a>) will either have very limited intelligence (like a hunter-seeker missile), human biological components (servitors), crew to control it (titans) or combination thereof.</p>
