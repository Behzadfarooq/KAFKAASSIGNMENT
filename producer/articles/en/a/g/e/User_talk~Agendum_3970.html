<p>Thanks. If you have any suggestions or corrections, let me know. It was not an easy map to do and I am not entirely happy with the result. At some stage, I intend to do another version that is a bit less wasteful of space so that I can zoom in a little. I was also thinking of doing custom maps for each of the clan articles with the corresponding clan region coloured in. <a href="../../../g/s/l/User%7EGsl_d00e.html" title="User:Gsl">Geoff/Gsl</a> 04:10, 15 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the comments, Bruce. I will make the changes you suggested and consult the sites you mentioned when I revise the map.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I use <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_GIMP_defb.html" title="The GIMP">The GIMP</a> for all my maps. My maps are all traced so my "original" contributions are limited mainly to colouring. I am a bit nervous about the copyright issues. While each pixel I produce is original, the designs are largely derivative. Most of the military maps are taken from fairly old sources under Crown Copyright which are probably pretty safe. The clan map at the moment is pretty faithful to the source so I'll be happy to see it revised away from the original.</dd>

<dd>I am happy to make my source file (in GIMP's XCF format) available if you or anyone else wanted to make use of it. <a href="../../../g/s/l/User%7EGsl_d00e.html" title="User:Gsl">Geoff/Gsl</a> 01:53, 16 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree the map is superb. I've now deleted the original clan list, transferring legitimate links up to the chart of Scottish Clans. Some links were not to clans but to placenames, etc, so I've ignored those. I've included the Stewart Clan (aware that there are several who claim to be the 'real' Stewarts - or Stuarts - but it needed to be represented.</p>
<p>Which article in the Glasgow Herald? - I had a look on the website but couldn't find anything, apart from a fascinating article entitled 'The remarkable tale of Indian Peter'.... <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgendum_46fd.html" title="User:Agendum">Bruce, aka Agendum</a> | <strong class="selflink">Talk</strong> 00:48, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>apologies, meant I'd read it, just my little jape about the lamented daily Herald before the dreaded Murdoch Sun got to it. However, by coincidence the Sunday Herald yesterday had a supplement with the "top 50 clans" - clan Brown at no. 2 and clan Smith at no. 1!

<dd>Not a problem. It seems to have been almost universally forgotten except as the paper that ultimately spawned <i>The Sun</i>. Very sad indeed.

<p>Thanks for including the link to Eric Gill's headstone. I noticed that you got the inscription just slightly wrong - 'Stone Carver' not 'cutter'.

<dd>Also a good catch. To be fair, it was the anon before me who found the link. It didn't occur to me that the correction would also be wrong, but I guess the misdirection comes from the caption next to the photos on that link. I'm afraid I don't know whether Gill carved any of his own headstone - <a href="http://www.gillianjason.com/pages/artistinfo/7.html" class="external text" title="http://www.gillianjason.com/pages/artistinfo/7.html" rel="nofollow">this link</a> suggests it was at least his own design. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 07:06, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>apologies for adding back the deleted list, my error in editing offline. I did notice Armstrong wasn't on the new list, it's in the Collins book (it's a borders family): there are some odd omissions from the new list, and I did add in Hamilton.

<dd>That wasn't too painful, have now tried to restore the list with careful checking to avoid errors. I do try to make sure that any changes don't overwrite recent edits, but it went wrong that time. Did omit the link to Wallace and Gromit, apologies of that was your joke. As to separate lists, as discussed on the Scottish clan talk page this is a bit of a minefield, with Lord Lyon Court apparently not seeing any distinction. A quick google gave several <a href="http://www.webscot.co.uk/clans/armstrong.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.webscot.co.uk/clans/armstrong.htm" rel="nofollow">Clan Armstrong</a> pages, including one with the proud claim <a href="http://www.armstrongclan.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.armstrongclan.org/" rel="nofollow">Acknowledged by Lord Lyon</a>. Another case is Hamilton, who are a major lowlands family and also appear as a clan with territory in <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isle_of_Arran_b9c8.html" title="Isle of Arran">Arran</a>, safely into the Highland area. Both have their tartans, of course. The column with (I'd suggest) H, L, H+L or L+H seemed a good compromise, still empty at the moment. Will try to have a look at this clan talk bit, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a> 22:50, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look forward to the page - I wouldn't worry about the overlap, agreed there's a significant difference between Highland clans and Lowland/Borders clans/families, but they're all Scottish and obviously a lot from completely lowland families want to think of it as a clan with a right to tartan. The side column should clarify the Highland/lowland distinction on the Scottish clan page, the Families page can expand on their particular histories etc. .<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a> 00:32, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi - noticed your changes to Armigerous families. Jardine has a Chief and is correctly placed on the Scottish Clans page. I note that Veitch doesn't feature on the myclans list of armigerous families - is there evidence it was ever had a chief and therefore should be considered armigerous? I suspect not, in which case it should probably be removed. Best wishes <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarknesbitt_5453.html" title="User:Marknesbitt">Mark Nesbitt</a> 16:30, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't suppose you have any fotos of the interiors of Holkham that are not copyright? Just a long shot, I don't bother usually too much about interiors, but the ones at Holkham are quite important architecturally. Next time you take a dog for a walk (hire one if necessary) a photo of the whole composition of Holkham would be nice too. Thanks for your comments on Palladian architecture, it seems to read now, much as it did before the 50 odd edits! <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> 21:48, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>your stated almost two years ago that you needed a translation of janteloven. well, it happened to be in my calender so I will translate it for you, it might sound strange cause i'll try to do the translation as precise as possible. The Jante Law 1. You shall not think, you are anything 2. You shall not think, that you are just as much as us 3. You shall not think, that you are wiser than us 4. You shall not delude yourself, that you are better than us 5. You shall not think, you know more than us 6. You shall not think, you are more than us 7. You shall not think, that you are (good/usefull) to anything 8. You shall not laugh at us 9. You shall not think, that anyone cares about you 10.You shall not think, that you can teach us anything (notes: you can replace think with believe since both means "tro". But since it is my impression that "believe" is majorly a word used in fairy tales and religion, I'll go with "think". In verse 7 I had a problem with the word "dur" since it's un-translateable, atleast in one word, but I think "are usefull" is the best shot.. so, now... don't get to depressed.</p>

<p>Most of the stuff at the notice board (at least on the bottom half) is actually WikiProject material anyway, and the Talk page is really being used as a WikiProject talk already! The notice board should be just that: for bunging up brief notices and signposts. I am thinking of launching a Wikiproject and correspondingly radically clearing out, and chopping down, the noticeboard (a re-launch if you like). The <a href="../../../s/c/o/Portal%7EScotland_042a.html" title="Portal:Scotland">Scotland Portal</a> concept is fine (but currently mediocre/undynamic content), but in stasis: it needs a good kick up the jacksie.</p>

<p>I'm also at a loss on what thread or query this came up on as I don't remember it, but if you're asking how articles get the Biography tag that shows on the Talk page, that gets added in one of two ways. Individual editors like yourself add it to the Talk page themselves (See <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Biography_Project_banner_01ea.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Biography/Project banner">Wikipedia:WikiProject Biography/Project banner</a> for instructions on how to add). Another way it gets added is when one of our bots auto-adds it. We <i>just</i> started doing the latter and so have only finished tagging any article that was in the category <a href="../../../l/i/v/Category%7ELiving_people_7259.html" title="Category:Living people">Category:Living people</a>. We started going through the politician category, but it's slow going as there's only one person with a bot account, and then just a couple of us doing it manually using AWB. See <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Biography_Automation_694b.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Biography/Automation">Wikipedia:WikiProject Biography/Automation</a> for a list of which categories we've hit and ones that are "on the plate", etc. Hope this answers your questions! If not, let me know. --<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlange_d466.html" title="User:Plange">plange</a> 23:58, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As I hope you may have seen I am attempting to tidy up <a href="../../../s/c/o/WP%7ESCOWNB_3220.html" title="WP:SCOWNB">WP:SCOWNB</a> by removing old notices and the duplication that has emerged since the creation of <a href="../../../s/c/o/WP%7ESCO_6951.html" title="WP:SCO">WP:SCO</a>.
