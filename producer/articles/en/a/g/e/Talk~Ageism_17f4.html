<p>What needs to be included in this article is that whether "ageism" is an invidious form of discrimination is not something on which a consensus has been reached, at least not to the extent that there has been on <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a>.</p>
<p>For example, P.J. O'Rourke on ageism being a silly concept:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"A person who failed to discriminate between a six year old and a twenty six year old would be insane in almost all circumstances and arrested in some." --<i>All the Trouble in the World</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>However, there has been enough of a consensus that the article should include a link to the <b>Age Discrimination in Employment Act</b> in the US and whatever other legislation exists. <a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EEllsworth_11a3.html" title="User:Ellsworth">Ellsworth</a> 16:17, 10 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Has there been any research/criticism about the bias towards recognising success in younger people rather than older? It seems that someone who attains, say, a PhD in their late teens is more praisworthy than someone who attains it later in life when, all things being equal, all PhDs should held in similar regard. Would something to this effect be worth mentioning in the article? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 206.248.132.73 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_206.248.132.73_c434.html" title="Special:Contributions/206.248.132.73">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>Well it's understandable that someone who accomplishes something at 19 is more praised than the one who does a similar thing with 10 more years of experience and time. It's like comparing someone who does task X in 10 minutes compared to the other who does it in 15 minutes. This is not a way of judging a person, but when judging this accomplishment the younger person is more impressive. It doesn't mean he's more intelligent or "superior". --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESheep_Select_5df3.html" title="User:Sheep Select">Sheep Select</a> 00:53, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I visited this article for the first time a few minutes ago and found it to be full of absurd statements. Going back through the history, I find that it was reasonably encyclopedic before about 29 November 2006, when it began acquiring statements like "This <i>(meaning Ageism)</i> includes any assumption of <a href="../../../f/a/m/Familiar.html" title="Familiar">familiarity</a> or <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sameness.html" title="Sameness">sameness</a> due to one's age" and "...Parents, by assuming their disconnectedness and Adultist tendencies" (this one was reverted and changed to a statement about ageism against middle-aged people) and "Automatically assuming that infants and small children are helpless, incapable, and ignorant" (that last one is the most absurd -- it is <b>not</b> ageism to assume that infants are helpless, thank you, because infants <b>are</b> helpless). This has gone from an article about the real and invidious phenomenon of discrimination against people on the basis of age to a silly essay that asserts that it is a terrible thing to think that any person's age has any relationship to any other attribute of that person. I am tempted to revert to the revision as of 12:05, 29 November 2006 by KPalicz, which appears to be the last sensible version, but I suppose a few of the changes since then might be justified. --<a href="../../../o/r/l/User%7EOrlady_761e.html" title="User:Orlady">orlady</a> 03:24, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with your assessment, mostly because I made the statements that you dislike. However, I would suggest that there is value in leaving the concepts introduced in those statements, e.g. pedaphobia, ephebiphobia, and geronphobia.

<p>orlady, is it not YOUR POV that is creeping in? By asserting the possible absurdity of such statements because YOU feel it is, thus injecting your POV into it, aren't you making the same mistake you assert freechild to have made?

<p>I feel that the administrators are ageist to many of the youth who edit wikipedia. Every thing i have added has been deleted, most likely because of my age.</p>

<dd>

<dd>I would agree, although expand on that by saying that instead of ageist, Wikipedia is <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adultism.html" title="Adultism">adultist</a>. Adultism is favoring the perspectives of adults, thereby excluding those of people who aren't identified as adults, either <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conscious.html" title="Conscious">consciously</a> or otherwise. By way of evidence, check out the talk suffered upon the articles about <a href="../../../a/d/u/Talk%7EAdultism_6a62.html" title="Talk:Adultism">adultism</a>, <a href="../../../e/p/h/Talk%7EEphebiphobia_fc14.html" title="Talk:Ephebiphobia">ephebiphobia</a>, and of course, the now marginally famous <a href="../../../p/e/d/Talk%7EPedophobia_8e73.html" title="Talk:Pedophobia">pedophobia</a>, the topics of which all focus on people who are seen as other than adults. It leaves me wondering what do ya do? <b>Word to the Youth</b> - don't quit, don't leave, and keep on truckin - you've got a powerful <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youth_voice.html" title="Youth voice">voice</a> and you need to use it <b>here</b>. - <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreechild_f239.html" title="User:Freechild">Freechild</a> 03:46, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree. How could the administrators be ageist - if they don't know how old you are? Unless you tell them, how will they know? On balance, I suspect it may be more likely due to one or more of:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>poor use of English</li>
<li>inappropriate, misplaced, inaccurate or unsubstantaited comments</li>
<li>partisan viewpoints or a non-encyleapediac tone</li>
<li>non-adherence to Wikipedia standards, norms and conventions</li>
<li>illegal use of copyright or similarly restricted material</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>that cause posts to be moved, deleted or amended. I have seen many posts that appear to come from younger editors that remain, and many from older people (including myself) that have been amended in some way for reasons such as these. This is a collaborative effort, and as it says on every edit page: <i>If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it.</i> Regards, <a href="../../../l/y/n/User%7ELynbarn_2dff.html" title="User:Lynbarn">Lynbarn</a> 23:52, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Lynbarn</b>, note that I wrote, "either consciously or otherwise". Adultism works through subversive discrimination such as routine dismissal and infantalization, as well as overt measures like putdowns and alienation. That means that routinely questioning the validity of articles that address the issues of youth without routinely questioning the validity of other, more absurd articles is adultist behavior. <b>Its not just about saying what age you are.</b> Instead, it is what topics you address, and what attitudes you represent. I would suggest that most youth who are active on Wikipedia have to actively cloak their age, unlike their adult counterparts' profiles that talk about their kids, their locations, or their degrees and occupations. I think it would shock (and awe) Wikipedians if they knew just how many under-21s and under-18s and under-15s there are among us... but we'll never know, because those users are savvy enough not to expose their age, for fear of <i>adultist</i> treatment as a consequence. - <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreechild_f239.html" title="User:Freechild">Freechild</a> 00:33, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
