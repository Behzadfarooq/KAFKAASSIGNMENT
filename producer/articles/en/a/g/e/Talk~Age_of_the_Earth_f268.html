<p>Removed the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Note: That whilst certain parts of Christianity (Christendom) may teach that the Earth has only been here for a number of thousand years, the Bible's account of Creation is held as a symbolic period of "Days". This by no means suggests, as later found in the bible, that a day here means a thousand years but merely represents seperate periods or stages within God's creative time. There is no argument between the bible and general science as to how long the Universe or the Earth has been here as the Bible simply does not tell us how long the Earth has been here. - 43</dd>
</dl>
<p>as it seemed a bit out of place - or ... <a href="../../../v/s/m/User%7EVsmith_d492.html" title="User:Vsmith">Vsmith</a> 14:25, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed, it is out of place: creationism is for other articles which are linked. But, since <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Earth_Creationism_a76b.html" title="Young Earth Creationism">Young Earth Creationism</a> is already there, seems fair to add <a href="../../../d/a/y/Day-Age_Creationism_17c4.html" title="Day-Age Creationism">Day-Age Creationism</a> to the "See also" section too. <a href="../../../b/c/a/User%7EBcasterline_8fb5.html" title="User:Bcasterline">bcasterline</a> <a href="../../../b/c/a/User_talk%7EBcasterline_273f.html" title="User talk:Bcasterline">t</a> 14:39, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes, the Bible says so, however, science is a much more reliable source, and the Bible does not state precisely the amount of time that the world has gone through, it merely indicates the word, "Days," which does not specify the amount of "days" in which the Earth has gone through.</p>

<p>How is it that this entire article is on the scientific views of the age of the earth? Yes, usually "nonscientific" views or views otherwise rejected by the scientific community tend to be "mentioned at the bottom" or pushed aside (as perhaps it should be in an encyclopedia), but in this case -when polls have repeatedly shown that a majority of the polled doubt or reject this notion- the opposing views should definitely be given a lot more "screen time."</p>
<p>This article isn't called "Age of the Earth as Told by Atheist Geologists" it's "Age of the Earth" and should reflect the fact that the scientific view is only one among a sea of views. Keep in mind that Wikipedia is a collection of knowledge, and the fans of hard science that wrote this article need to understand that their Science does not comprise the whole of Knowledge, and information about nonscientific theories is just as valid in Wikipedia as information about scientific theories (if a bit less practical - thats why more time is usually given to document science). This invective is born of the haughty attitude I see in the discussion page, not just of noticing the paltry mention of nonscientific views in the Article.</p>
<p>Also, this article reads like a report, or a chapter out of a history book. Each section should be separate, not continue a narrative.</p>
<p>I'm marking this NPOV (because of the almost mocking way the nonscientific views are presented, and the forward way in which the scientific views are <a href="../../../n/e/u/WP%7ENeutral_point_of_view_15f3.html" title="WP:Neutral point of view">asserted</a> - though I do applaud your efforts to make that as neutral as possible- as well as the extreme bias towards one view) and In Need of Wikification. I understand this is a "hot" issue, but understand that if this was anything else, the <a href="../../../n/e/u/WP%7ENeutral_point_of_view_15f3.html#Bias" title="WP:Neutral point of view">bias</a> would have been immediately decried. The NPOV page (linked to twice already in this paragraph) is exceptionally well-written and I'd encourage you to read the section <a href="../../../n/e/u/WP%7ENeutral_point_of_view_15f3.html#Reasoning_behind_NPOV" title="WP:Neutral point of view">Reasoning behind NPOV</a>; it's almost exactly what I'm trying to say (it startled me when I saw it!). To ensure the application of that policy here I'd like to point out that alternative views (specifically the young earth view) are most certainly "significant views" and, if described, provide the opportunity to prove NPOV by detailing the requisite alternative view.</p>
<p>I also cite <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">Undue Weight</a> in my NPOV mark; this article is a blatant violation of this very important policy. Remember, the body of scientific knowledge represents only one view, though science as a whole is in the clear majority (whether science as a whole or science on this particular matter should be addressed can be contested). In the latter parenthesized case, alternative views hold the <i>vast majority</i> and I'm almost tempted to cite <i>If a viewpoint is held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority, it doesn't belong in Wikipedia (except perhaps in some ancillary article) regardless of whether it's true or not; and regardless of whether you can prove it or not.</i> But in the former case, alternative views at least represent a "significant minority" and deserve more representation in this article. Fortunately for the writers, wikipedia has a policy to address the accepted scientific views as the "majority" - whether or not they're actually in the majority (see again the NPOV page). However, opposing views are explicitly required, especially if they represent a "significant minority."</p>
<p>I encourage you to write "facts about opinions" in regard to alternative earth age views, and to keep in mind that the scientific views are "facts about opinions" too. Remember to write "with fairness and in a sympathetic tone," which is missing entirely from this article and the nothing-less-than vicious talk page. I exhort you to remember that wikipedia has adopted a "neutral point of view" <b>not</b> a "scientific point of view."</p>

<dd>"<i>but in this case -when polls have repeatedly shown that a majority of the polled doubt or reject this notion</i>". Please note: although Young Earth Creationism is enjoying resurgence in the USA, but as was highlighted in the recent Miller, Scott and Okamoto paper <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/bigphotos/21329204.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/bigphotos/21329204.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, this is not a trend that is observed more generally.

<dd>It is quite clear that the article is about the scientific view and is for the most part a description of the history of scientific understanding of geologic time. The <i>other views</i> are clearly linked to in the disamb. notice at the top of the article - right there upfront for everyone to see. In addition the prescientific concepts section presents some of these views as a prelude to the historical development that follows. I don't really think the content of the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_beliefs.html" title="Origin beliefs">Origin beliefs</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/t/Dating_Creation_d668.html" title="Dating Creation">Dating Creation</a> articles needs to be reproduced here. Is that what you are proposing? Or should we rename this article to more specifically address the scientific content - perhaps Scientific evidence for the age of the Earth? Your <i>...as Told by Atheist Geologists</i> comment above really says quite a bit about the POV you are pushing here and I would highly reccommend a close reading of the lengthy debates above on this page.</dd>
<dd>As to the format. The development of the science is presented in chronologic order which seems a most logical approach. No doubt there is room for improvement, always is, but I see no need for the wikify tag as your brief sentence on that doesn't convince me.</dd>

<dd>Tags removed. The neutrality bit has been hashed over at great length previously and we don't need to rehash every time someone wants to push a YEC POV. The wikify tag was an unneeded detriment to the article. If the sections need a better transition then do it, don't just slap a tag on and expect someone else to fix things. <a href="../../../v/s/m/User%7EVsmith_d492.html" title="User:Vsmith">Vsmith</a> 00:53, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I am primarily suggesting merging all of these articles to give alternative views fair hearing in the "main" Age of the Earth article. I requested discussion before the tag removal, a reasonable request especially since that's wikipedia policy, unless the tag was frivolous or arbitrary, which it wasn't. Anyway, your reply ("The neutrality bit has been hashed over at great length previously and we don't need to rehash every time someone wants to push a YEC POV") tells me at least that this is a continuing problem and an NPOV tag needs to be present at least to warn readers that the content is disputed. Again, a little disclaimer at the top <i>is not sufficient</i>, and the article needs to thoroughly discuss all views on the argument. I'm also encouraged by RoyBoy's skeptical acceptance of my argument, and you should realize that you aren't the owner of this page, and you cannot remove NPOV tags at will; the point of them being there is that if nobody agrees, nobody can remove them.</dd>

I am in favor of a controversy sub-section that summaries alternatives; but as they are minority views they will be given appropriate weight and space. Consequently a merge is against policy. Allow me to clarify, policy favors mentioning other notable/verifiable views, but does not favor giving them equal attention; by, for example, merging them into an established article. Examples abound, such as <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_assassination_755d.html#Assassination_theories" title="John F. Kennedy assassination">Kennedy assassination theories</a> and <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_moon_landing_hoax_accusations.html" title="Apollo moon landing hoax accusations">Apollo moon landing hoax accusations</a>. These minority views are mentioned (I actually had to add the hoax section to <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon_landing.html" title="Moon landing">Moon landing</a>).</dd>

<dd>Point is, these minority views should be mentioned; but not elaborated on in the article. Your NPOV tag was appropriate in as much as alternatives are not mentioned sufficiently in the modern context, but the NPOV tag cannot simply be levied because you believe policy isn't being followed as per your precise interpretation. It can be levied if there is a systematic/pervasive problem with the article, there is not; as the article (as I've explained) is not required to detail every alternative. If the NPOV tag could be used in this way, every controversial article could be so tagged; such as <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">abortion</a>, because some people don't agree with "death" in the opening sentence. (this has happened, as I frequent the article and have participated in editing the lead; however such disagreements aren't defacto against policy, rather against ones POV) I am by no means perfect in interpreting Wikipolicy; but I am experienced on how articles (especially controversial ones) handle minority views, and that Wikipolicy follows common sense. It is not common sense to give a minority view a detailed hearing on a main article; NPOV requires us to present majority and minority views accordingly. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 04:46, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Reading the article, one would be under the impression there is no dispute over the Age of the Earth.

Most importantly having that in the "prescientific" section gives the impression this occurred only in the past (despite "Today", which actually makes it ill fitting for the section).

<p>I think the problem (a minor one) with this article is that the first section is entitled 'pre scientific concepts' - which seems to suggest that anything before scientific method is obsolete?. Perhaps the 'religious' age concepts should be given their own section rather than being treated as simply leaing up to the scientific explanation?</p>
<p>An alternative would be to disambiguate, the "age of earth (disambig.)" page would link to "age of the earth (scientific method)", "age of the earth (biblical) <a href="../../../d/a/t/Dating_creation.html" title="Dating creation">dating creation</a>" etc etc with a see also to "<a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_belief.html" title="Origin belief">origin belief</a>"?</p>
<p>Would anyone object to such a disambiguation page replacing the note at the top of the article? HappyVR 23:17, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>However if someone is looking for a scholarly analysis of the age of the earth based on the bible or other religious text they would be directed here if they search for say "age earth". Clearly there is a link to the <a href="../../../d/a/t/Dating_creation.html" title="Dating creation">dating creation</a> page but I can't help thinking both pages should be given parity via a disambiguation page. This would solve many problems.

<dd>I disagree with a disambiguation page. I think users would expect if they wanted to look for an analysis of the age of the earth based on their religious text of choice they would incorporate that in the search parameters, and I don't think they would be surprised to find a scientific treatment here instead of their particular religious mythology. I fail to understand your comment about RoyBoy's comment expressing a non-neutral viewpoint; I believe it's neither expected nor desirable for talk page comments to conform to some adaptation of NPOV. Mine certainly don't; I violated it in that sentence itself. Furthermore, you are conflating holding a religious view with non-acceptance of the scientific model. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 02:29, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well I still say calling holding the 'religious' view a minority view isn't right - I don't think either of these viewpoints is sufficiently minor to be called minority. And sorry about any conflation - I was using 'religious' (note I've started putting it in quotes) to refer to the young earth theories - sorry for causing that confusion. HappyVR 13:23, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'd like to suggest that users searching for 'age of the earth' might expect or want to find links to all possible methods of dating the earth not just scientific - they might not have a preset religious viewpoint or text - people aren't neccessarily searching for confirmation of their views or only within there current belief system - thats why I think a search for what seems to be the most obvious term "earth age" should lead to links to all the relavant articles. Currently this seems to require disambiguation.HappyVR 13:36, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, obviously nobody is required to have a neutral point of view but to reject a disambiguation page on the grounds that the other pages have minority views goes beyond the scope of this (scientifically based) page. If your viewpoint is biased can you really give a fair opinion on whether or not disambiguation is required - I suggest not.HappyVR 13:52, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you come across anything indicating Young Earth creationism are not in a minority (dare I say even significant minority), please point it out. Having a religious view of Earth and the Universe is quite different than believing its only a few thousand years old; and its prevalance in the U.S. need not be overemphasized. I don't like the disambig message as it is. While I don't have a problem with one generally speaking; this one reiterates the obvious in the first sentence. I understand how that can shortcut POV edits in the future, but I don't see such disambigs on other science focused articles.

<dd>Sorry, this talk page is a real minefield. I terms of belief of the two systems I can't comment - however what I am suggesting is that the page <a href="../../../d/a/t/Dating_creation.html" title="Dating creation">dating creation</a> is not irrelevant - in fact it's a good and interesting article (as is this one) and it is relevant to the queston "what is the age of the earth". The 'dating creation' article does not follow a 'fundamentalist' viewpoint but is a wide ranging article comparing the date of creation based on mostly religious texts - to a scholar of these things this would be the relavant article - what I was trying to say that in terms of looking for info on the age of the earth the dating creation article is relavant - whether or not the reader believes any or part of it. I'm not arguing here on which viewpoint is most believed but that both articles are equally relevant to the question 'what is the age of the earth (according to different sources)'. Realistically I'd describe this article as having a scientific bias - the dating creation article covers the historical aspects of this subject in far more depth.HappyVR 15:13, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In terms of formatting I think the article is a bit wrong - I'm suggesting lumping all the sections on the radioactive method into one section and having the section headings as subsections - In other words this:</p>
<p>4 Discovery of radioactivity 5 Invention of radiometric dating 6 Arthur Holmes establishes radiometric dating 7 Modern radiometric dating 7.1 Why meteorites were used 7.2 Why the Canyon Diablo meteorite was used</p>
<p>becomes this:</p>
<p>4 Radioactive dating (or similar suitable title) 4.1 Discovery of radioactivity 4.2 Invention of radiometric dating 4.3 Arthur Holmes establishes radiometric dating 4.4 Modern radiometric dating 4.4.1 Why meteorites were used 4.4.2 Why the Canyon Diablo meteorite was used</p>
<p>In general the radioactive method takes up a lot of the article - I would suggest that the current section order would be suitable in an article labelled "history of scientific dating of the earth" but makes the radioactivity sections look overblown in this article.</p>
<p>I also am thinking that the article lacks an explanation relating to rocks becoming 'contaminated' with traces of foreign elements due to decay - eg non lead containing rocks containing lead due to decay of other elements - this seems to be the essence of the dating but isn't clearly explained in the article. I'm suggesting that the article is quite technical and would benefit from a simplified 'overview' in each case of a different method for dating. Any thoughts?HappyVR 23:48, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocks.html" title="Rocks">Rocks</a> and minerals naturally contain certain <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elements.html" title="Elements">elements</a> and not others. By the process of <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radioactive_decay.html" title="Radioactive decay">radioactive decay</a> of radioactive elements occuring in a rock non native elements can be introduced over time. By measuring the concentration of the end product of the decay coupled with knowledge of the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half_life.html" title="Half life">half life</a> and initial concentration of the decaying element and estimate of the age of the rock can be calculated. Typical radioactive end products are <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helium.html" title="Helium">Helium</a> from <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_decay.html" title="Alpha decay">alpha decay</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/a/Lead.html" title="Lead">Lead</a> from <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thorium.html" title="Thorium">Thorium</a> decay.

Thus the age of a terrestial rock gives a minimum for the scientific estimate of the age of the earth."</p>
<p>Would this be suitable as an introduction to the radioactive dating section? - I really think this (quite technical) section needs an introduction that introduces the reader to concepts used further on.

<p>(User Bcasterline - we seem to be editing at the same time - apologies if what I've just done seems inpolite) I've no real problems with the changes to the disambuation line - However this sentence "The age of the Earth is an area of study in geology which attempts to determine the point in history when the planet Earth first formed, by means of geochronology" is not good.</p>
<p>Sorry to be pedantic but 'geochronology is an area of study in geology' is right , 'the age of the earth is an area of study in geology ' is not really the right description - it sounds dumb in the context of this sentence. Hope that makes sense.</p>
<p>Other than than please keep in mind when changing the 'disambig intro' that the alternative page is one relating to the study of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theology.html" title="Theology">theology</a> (and the analysis of religious texts etc) and is not necessarily a 'religious viewpoint page' - analysis of religious texts can be just as scientific as science. Sorry for all that.HappyVR</p>

<dd>Analysis of religious texts can be scientific, but the viewpoint they provide is still religous. I don't really see the problem with that (former) first sentence, but perhaps it's redundant anyway.

<p>Whatever, the original disambig. line was more accurate - "<i>This article describes the historical development of the estimation of the age of the Earth, concentrating on <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geochronology.html" title="Geochronology">scientific dating methods</a>..." - that's what the article does - including a short sentence on pre science methods. But the change "this article details scientific methods.." is not as accurate. User:Stevertigo's edit 'this article focusses on scientific methods" is better than the current state.</i></p>
<p>I don't know exactly why it was changed since it 'wasn't broke' before - now it's not as good for apparently the sake of being one line shorter. That's no good. I'd like to just change it back.HappyVR 21:25, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Because of its length, it was broke. The goal of the disambiguation line is not to summarize the article in one sentence; it's too give the reader a quick choice they can understand. The current version (science vs. religion) is fine. If you think "focuses on" is more accurate than "details", you can change it, although I'm not sure I see the difference. -- <a href="../../../b/c/a/User%7EBcasterline_8fb5.html" title="User:Bcasterline">bcasterline</a> • <a href="../../../b/c/a/User_talk%7EBcasterline_273f.html" title="User talk:Bcasterline">talk</a> 21:34, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article is very informative and I am glad it has been created, however there seems to be a problem with its context. It presents the most common scientific ruling of Earth's age as the necessarily correct, whilst discluding the other more religiously-slanted ideas. I, for one, am a promoter of the "Young Earth" theory, which is only mentioned in the article once in the short paragraph on "Creationist objections". The Creationist/Young Earth theories are very well developed and scientific, yet have recieved virtually no acknowledgement in this article. I have gotten into some trouble for trolling, recently, and thus my articles have been repeatedly deleted. For this reason, I don't want to risk wasting time by adding to this article, since my addition could appear too controversial, and would possibly be removed. I would have liked to add to this article a more extensive section on the objections, though, in an attempt to bring to level the common-scientific and religious-scientific theories.</p>

<p>Vsmith: I see the disambiguation notice, and I do not think that it applies. The Creationist/Young Earth theories are as scientific, if not more so, than the more common conclusion. What is mentioned about them on Wikipedia.org may not be, but the wikipedia articles are not the final say on these theories. There are other articles online, but those are usually not reliable, so I don't recommend them. There is a book called The World that Perished by John C. Whitcomb, which is an introduction to biblical catastrophism, and a sequel to his other great work, The Genesis Flood. These both are very scientific, showing the problems with modern theories of Earth's age, and promoting the sciences that illustrate the Young Earth theories. There are numerous resources, including books and seminars, available to show these theories and compare them with the more common scientific theories, and they show that your statement, "The 'Creationist/Young Earth theories' are not scientific" is entirely ignorant. 71.50.236.210 20:43, 8 August 2006 (UTC)Dmar198</p>

<dd>Royboy and JPotter, your objections are fallacy. The manner in which John C. Whitcomb writes his book does not subtract anything from its credence. The point of the book was not to say what scientists say what on the matter, it was to show that there is scientific evidence in both directions on the Age of Earth matter. For Whitcomb to write a good book on scientific matters, he does not have to be a well-respected scientist. For someone to write intelligently on a matter of great importance, they do not have to dedicate their entire life to it. He wrote intelligently, he checked his resources, he wrote a good book that still holds great credence in this matter.<a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDmar198_1137.html" title="User:Dmar198">Dmar198</a> 17:44, 9 August 2006 (UTC)Dmar198</dd>

<dd>Dmar, for it to be 'scientific evidence' it must be research which roduces original data which is '<i>verifiable</i>, <i>repeatable</i> and meets the standards of science; if all that Whitcomb does is clip holus bolus quotes from other publications and comes up with some justification of his owwn theory without actually addressing anything in a <i>scientific</i> manner (ie; addresses the hypotheses and conclusions of those articles and tenets he finds wrong), then it is hardly 'scientific evidence'.

<dd>Sure, he may cite a bunch of references. It is easy to find 1,000 quotes from 1,000 papers which, taken individually, may be construed as contrary to the gist of each paper or as a whole. But this isn't science; this is just reviewing, a base form of journalism. Sure, he may not have devoted his life to "science" or "geology", but that hardly makes him an expert on the subject. And if we are to place his work alongside that of respected and learned scientists who have studied geology - not just geology as it relates to the age of the Earth - then we are basically elevating him to undue prominence. See, when I went to university, I earned my right to say Bachelor. I earned it by proving a mastery of the science of geology. It took effort. It didn't simply take a few years of bible school, a word procssor and a bunch of arm waving.</dd>

<p>Upon reviewing my above comments, I have realized that I my comment about Vsmith's statement being ignorant may be seen as a personal attack. If this happens, my comment may be removed, which I do not want to happen, so I am going to clarify what I meant by "ignorance". I was not trying to insult Vsmith by saying that he himself is ignorant; I was saying that his <i>statement</i> was ignorant. The purpose of the above comments are not to declare that my position on the subject matters is any better than anyone else, specifically I am not saying that the Creationist/Young Earth theories are any better or any more accurate than any other theories. I am stating that this article on Earth's age deals entirely with theories, since the age of Earth has <b>not</b> been scientifically <b>proven</b>. As such, the article should accurately reflect all theories on subject matter, including those theories (I.E. the Creationist/Young Earth theories)that are not generally accepted by the mainstream scientific community. Especially so since all of the mentioned theories are scientific and well developed. 71.50.236.210 22:58, 8 August 2006 (UTC)Dmar198</p>
<dl>
<dd>So because it hasn't been proven with direct measurement (requiring direct observation), it is not scientific? What we are saying is they are not scientific alternatives; that is well established through the scientific community rejecting them and debunking <b>attempts</b> to poke holes in established scientific theories. <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equivocation.html" title="Equivocation">Equivocation</a> is a tired creationist tactic (re: scientific theory = just a theory = creationists have theories too), and undermines rather than helps your position. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 06:05, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Royboy, I'm afraid your objection is as much fallacy that which you condemn. What you regard as equivocation is not so. The word "theory" has only one real meaning, and is used in the same context when refering to the <i>common</i> scientific theories and the <i>religious</i> scientific theories. When the open-minded refer to the religiously slanted theories, they are refering to the same kind of theory (i.e. An assumption based on limited information or knowledge) as the more common scientific theories represent. I did not say anywhere in my comments that the scientific theories in question are not scientific. Neither the religious nor the uniformitarian have direct observation, thus they are both equal. Since this is true, they should both be discussed in the article equally.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That is a gross oversimplication, I hope in time you will recognize it as such. Because both concepts share <b>one</b> quality does not make them equal in the least. The amount of evidence for a scientific theory outclasses religious explanations. Uniformitarianism is supported by the evidence, from eroded mountains to DNA variation and inheritance. Nothing contradicts it. So there is no reason to seek an alternative theory, nor is there any reason to elaborate on alternatives on this article. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 17:14, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I have said is in no way a "gross oversimplication". Both theories have powerful evidence in their direction, giving them equal credence. There are contradictions to the "eroded mountains, DNA variation, and inheritance", and a simple example of this can be found in the article on <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_science.html" title="Creation science">creation science</a>. What reasons there are for "alternative" theories is irrelevant. The purpose of this article is not to say which theories are correct and which are not, or which theories are more accepted by whom. The purpose of this article is to represent the theories on the age of the Earth, and thus all theories should be equally represented, whether scientists have preferences or not.</dd>

<dd>To do as you suggest, Dmar, would be against Wikipedia policies. They state that we must not give undue weight to fringe ideas such as young earth creationism. The article fairly represents the level of mindshare that exists within the scientific community dedicated to YEC. YEC is an extreme minority position within the relevant field, earth science. Moreover, you are incorrect in your assessment of what is and what is not a theory. A theory, in science, is a well documented, explaned and observed phenomena, representing the highlest level of certainty within science. A theory also must be testable, falsifiable and natural. YEC is none of those things and cannot even be rightly called a hypothesis. It is a conjecture based on religious scripture. Currenly scientific evidence yields that the Earth is ~4.55 billion years old and this article represents that science. Please see <a href="../../../d/a/t/Dating_creation.html" title="Dating creation">Dating creation</a> for religious ideas regarding the matter.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Jpotter, the policies clearly state that the writer of an article should: "Avoid bias. Articles should be written from a neutral point of view, representing all views on a subject, factually and objectively, in an order which is agreeable to a common consensus. (This is a Foundation issue that applies to all Wikimedia Foundation projects.)" The YEC theories are definately and unarguably strong views on the subject, and they should be discussed as objectively and as much as the other theories. YEC is <b>not</b> a "frnge idea". It is not widely accepted by the mainstream scientific community, true, but it is still an essential theory, and "Science" has not yet reached a concensus on the actual age of Earth. You are correct, it is a minority in the Earth Science field. However, it is still based on scientific views, even though it has been misconceived that it only exists because of scripture. Being based on scientific views, and being a relevant and widely debated topic places it on a comparable level to the uniformitarian views. As such, it should be discussed in this article as much as its rival view. The fact that the majority of the <i>examined</i> "scientific evidence yields that the Earth is ~4.55 billion years old" (not to be confused with the <i>only</i> scientific evidence, but the most commonly <i>examined</i>) is not relevant. The fact of the matter is that both views exist, both are widely accepted, and both are equal. Being that this is the case, this article is biased toward the uniformitarian view, and must be changed.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Your statement about the definition of a scientific theory is also flawed, wheras mine is not. A scientific theory explains scientific observations; both theories do this. Both of the groups of people who work on this "Age of Earth" subject observe the science involved in the subject and draw a conclusion from it. Also, each theory has been tested, each theory is falsifiable (though neither has been verified), and both theories are natural. Therefore, both theories are scientific theories. <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDmar198_1137.html" title="User:Dmar198">Dmar198</a> 17:00, 9 August 2006 (UTC)Dmar198</p>

<dd>JPotter, my suggestion conforms completely with wikipedia policy. According to the very article you entered a link for, "...though a view may be spelled out in great detail, it should not be represented as the truth." This article, The Age of Earth, clearly states in the first sentence that "...the age of the Earth {is} around 4.567 billion years (4.567x109 years)." This has not been proven, and is not known to be the truth. As to the rest of your comment, as I have said before, the YEC theories are not in the minority position. The current concensus on Wikipedia may be that it is, but, also as I have said before, Wikipedia.org is not the final say. What I am attempting to do through this very talk page and my comments <i>is</i> to show that it is not in the minority position. Therefore, I demand that this article be changed to bring to level the uniformitarian and YEC views.</dd>

<dd>You've been told and shown repeatedly that YEC is not an extreme minority position. Authors such as John C. Whitcomb and his constituents, speakers such as Dr. Kent Hovind and his followers, etc. all clearly show that the Age of Earth issue is still in question. YEC is a minority in the firld of Earth Science. This field is not the only criteria by which "we" measure. It is a great one, but not the only. Secularists, of which I am aware that you are, JPotter, may draw exclusively from this resource, but not every editor on Wikipedia is a secularist, myself included. Thank you.</dd>

<dd>Yes, you have told us that YEC is not an extreme minority position, but you have yet to show it. Earth scientists are the folks that study and who are qualified authorities on the age of the earth: what percentage of Earth scientists hold to the YEC viewpoint? That is the criteria that must be used on Wikipedia as per the links above. Whitcomb and Hovind are not scientists and this is a science article. There is already a separate article for the religious views of the age of the Earth.

<p>Also it seems that YEC is out of favor even in Catholic cicles these days: The current Pope says the Earth is 4.5 billion years old. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Potter_73b9.html" title="User:Jason Potter">JPotter</a> 18:42, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Evidence for Evolution and an Old Earth, a Catholic Perspective "According to the widely accepted scientific account, the universe erupted 15 billion years ago in an explosion called the 'Big Bang' and has been expanding and cooling ever since. Later there gradually emerged the conditions necessary for the formation of atoms, still later the condensation of galaxies and stars, and about 10 billion years later the formation of planets. In our own solar system and on earth (formed about 4.5 billion years ago), the conditions have been favorable to the emergence of life. While there is little consensus among scientists about how the origin of this first microscopic life is to be explained, there is general agreement among them that the first organism dwelt on this planet about 3.5 - 4 billion years ago. Since it has been demonstrated that all living organisms on earth are genetically related, it is virtually certain that all living organisms have descended from this first organism. Converging evidence from many studies in the physical and biological sciences furnishes mounting support for some theory of evolution to account for the development and diversification of life on earth, while controversy continues over the pace and mechanisms of evolution. While the story of human origins is complex and subject to revision, physical anthropology and molecular biology combine to make a convincing case for the origin of the human species in Africa about 150,000 years ago in a humanoid population of common genetic lineage. However it is to be explained, the decisive factor in human origins was a continually increasing brain size, culminating in that of homo sapiens. With the development of the human brain, the nature and rate of evolution were permanently altered: with the introduction of the uniquely human factors of consciousness, intentionality, freedom and creativity, biological evolution was recast as social and cultural evolution." (From the International Theological Commission, headed by then Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger now Pope Benedict XVI, statement "Communion and Stewardship: Human Persons Created in the Image of God," plenary sessions held in Rome 2000-2002, published July 2004)</p>
<dl>
<dd>JPotter, this is not quite true. The Pope does not say one way or the other, if you examine the article a little more closely. He is saying here the Old Earth/Evolutionary theories have some merit toward them, and he is clarifying that the Church does not hold preference one way or the other, allowing its members to choose for themselves their own side on the issue.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, JPotter, and thank you for your cooperation. I think that a more accurate representation of the theories is necessary. (50-50 or not, I think that the YEC theories are deserving of more say in this article.) I think that, especially in the first sentence, the article should soften the effect of the statement, "geologists have determined the age of the Earth to be around 4.567 billion years" so that it states more along the lines of, "the mainstream theory, receiving the most general concensus among prominent scientists, is that Earth is around 4.567 billion years old". I think that the current statement goes against Wikipedia policy by presenting the information as fact. Wikipedia's policies clearly state that "...though a view may be spelled out in great detail, it should not be represented as the truth." I thusly think that the mispresentation of theory as fact should be rectified. Being that the YEC theories are not mainstream in the scientific community, it probably should not be quite as fully represented. But it is still a valid theory, and this article makes it seem as if the theory has been debunked. The change I mentioned is a minor one; I think this article needs more major revision (not total, mind you. As I said in my first comment, I am glad this article is here and so well-developed.) I will further outline the changes I would like to see a short time in the future; as of now, I am happy that I am getting some cooperation.</dd>

Not to pile on, but I'm of the impression that the section entitled 'Creationist objections' is sufficient weight to give this viewpoint, and it properly characterises the validity of the argument. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font style="color:#DC2163;">Z</font>iggurat</a> 22:18, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alright, "nearly all scientists" would be fine with me. However, the section on "Creationist Objections" is not, as I see it, sufficient enough. I think that the YEC theories are more prominent than most of you think (no offense, sincerely). This is because, as I have said before, the first sentence of this article violates Wikipedia policy, as I see it, and this must be corrected. Thus, a replacement sentence must be put in place. How about I make a "replacement" article, which I will only post on my userpage, and when I am done we can see if anything can be arranged? - <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDmar198_1137.html" title="User:Dmar198">Dmar198</a> 22:38, 9 August 2006 (UTC)Dmar198</dd>

<dd>I think people have rightly asked for evidence of them being more prominent above, and I haven't seen any yet. Every piece of literature I have seen or found on this subject says the opposite, characterising YEC as a 'manufactured controversy' (there was a great article on this subject in the Quarterly Review of Biology back in 1985, available <a href="http://www.jstor.org/view/00335770/dm994747/99p1514d/0" class="external text" title="http://www.jstor.org/view/00335770/dm994747/99p1514d/0" rel="nofollow">here</a>).

<dd>Heh, ironically challenging the prominence (or notability) of YEC is the most reasonable argument you've made thusfar. (though as Ziggurat points out, you still need present compelling evidence) Notability is always a difficult thing to quantify and reflect in articles, and over time it even changes requiring us to tweak things a bit. So that is an issue that can be looked at, but your assertions that YEC is entirely natural, scientific and just as good as scientific theories are offensive to those of us who are scientifically literate and have debated this issue extensively in the past. Not only because we personally find that to be wrong, but those assertions <b>do</b> go against Wikipedia policy which takes the scientific communities view as the current mainstream view. (and those views explicitly contradict your assertions) Your intepretation that policy requires "equal" or "50/50" treatment of YEC in this article is simply incorrect.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On the issue of notability itself, please be aware Wikipedia tries to reflect a global viewpoint in its articles. This means, that although YEC may appear prominent in your area/state/country; this is not necessarily reflected in the world and reality. Bare this in mind as you work on an article "replacement". - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 23:26, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Following edit conflict&#160;:-) You leave out an important part of that first sentence: <i><b>Based on extensive and detailed scientific evidence,</b> geologists have determined the age of the Earth to be around 4.567 billion years</i>. It does not state that as <i>truth</i>, just as the current state of scientific understanding which is based on current research and evidence. And yes, they may revise that if new evidence is found, that is the way science works. Scientists work to find evidence to understand nature. YECers seek to find evidence to support their preconceived ideas or religious beliefs - and that is not science. YEC <i>theories</i> are simply pseudoscience.

<dd>metorites and heavy elements were not created in this solar system according to current star life cycle theories so what does a metoritec have to do directly with the age of the earth? The "star stuff"(sagan) metorites are made of has to have been part of at least 2 other solar systems if the "big bang" is correct. Many biblical scholars and schools of thot (crime) exist besides the perjoritive prejudice expressed in the charactorization of "creationists". Science is constantly undergoing revision, creationists and views of the old testament language also are prone to a wide range of readings not just the 6000 solar/human years view.

<dd>The isotopic ages we get from meteorites merely record the point at which the meteorites <i>cooled</i> to such a state that the isotopic systems were locked in. This is different from when the Earth formed as a planetary clot on the disc, and different from when the sun ignited, etc. So...there appears to be a few dozen million years of difference between the oldest zircon and the ages of meteorites of various compositions. One records the disc <i>cooling</i> after its formation, the other records the Earth cooling to the point a zircon could grow.

<p>This section is flawed in a significant way by failing to come to grasp with the influence that dates calculated from the Bible had on scientists in the 19th century. For example, the statement that, when presented with Lord Kelvin's estimate that the Earth's was soemwhere between 20 &amp; 400 million years, "Geologists had trouble accepting such a short age for the Earth" -- this completely ignores the fact that many establishment men of science thought it was <i>too long</i> because calculations based on the Bible provided a date of 4004 BC (to offer the year most commonly repeated in the US at the time). The resistence that Lord Kelvin faced from his audience was far more complex than this statement implies.</p>
<p>It took many years -- at least a generation or two -- for educated Western people to accept that the Bible <i>might</i> be mistaken in some details. This belief that the Bible accurately reported the date came under attack not only from science, but from archeology: as information gradually was recovered about the history of ancient Egypt &amp; Mesopotamia, historians had to wrestle with the conflict between the Biblical dates of Creation &amp; the Flood, with undeniable evidence that the historical record stretched back beyond these dates. In other words, <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_inerrancy.html" title="Biblical inerrancy">biblical inerrancy</a> was the unquestioned belief of all Western educated men until the second half of the 19th century, when the contradictions between observed phenomena &amp; this sacred book were increasingly acknowledged, &amp; educated people found themselves forced to accept the results of scientific research, the literal statements of the Bible or find some kind of compromise between the two (for example, silently ignoring the 4004 BC date for the Creation). I'm sure it's obvious from disputes over this article that this contradiction has still not reached a consensus. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 21:03, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I picked the year "4004 BC" only as an example. And while people have argued from earliest times over the <i>interpretation</i> of the Bible, its statements were accepted by the vast majority of educated people as indisputable fact without question until the 20th century. This is illustrated by the scarcity of critical analysis of the composition of the Bible until the late 19th century, when it seems that a floodgate was opened: before that point, every book of the Bible was naively accepted as being written by one specific author; after that point, many scholars (of whom many were sincere &amp; devout in their faith) analysed these works for clues to their sources and how they were written. There was an evolution of thinking about not only the evidence of the physical world, but also about sacred writings. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 00:28, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you leap too soon; <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> is as right as you are in saying people in the 1800's did not believe one thing as much as you are in saying they did. Or vice versa. Both of you weren't alive back then and you are <i>both</i> making an interpretation about past events from, and this is my interpretation, incredibly limited research and flawed understandings. I would actually agree with <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> simply because "Geologists had trouble accepting such a short age for the Earth" is not really accurate on several points;</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>There were decidedly few actual geologists in England in the 1800's; most educated men of that era were naturalists and would have studied botany as heavily as geology and archaeology or classicism. On this point it would be <i>fairer</i> to say "Those who studied the geological age of the Earth considered that more time was required to explain the known facts and relationships within the Earth's geological record."</li>
<li>There were also those who, as said, did not accept the scientific facts before them; indeed they argued wheher these were facts or not. This is not a slight on their faculties, it is just that geology qwas in its nfancy in the early 1800's and even until the end of WWI and up to WWII a great amount of geology was purely descriptive without great amounts of theorisation and models.</li>
<li>It is true, also, to say that the age of the Earth and conceptions of the interpretation that it could not be 20Ma or even 400Ma old, were borne out by not only geological (ie; <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stratum.html" title="Stratum">stratigraphic</a> relationships such as the law of superposition etc, but also by archaeology which conflicted with the biblical Flood, and also with naturalism and Botany.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>So, I tend to think that <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> is not wrong. The development of geological theories is not as clear cut as we like to think, empowered with hindsight. It took until the 1940's for thrust faults to be recognised, after all, and until then vast amounts of the fossil record and statigraphy were uninterpretable. In 1920, people thought it mad to drill into the ground for oil. And the age of the earth problem was solved in the 1930's, but wasn't accurately confirmed beyond a reasonable amount of error, until much later. This isnt about free thinking and suppositions about who believed the bible was inerrant or not; the barest interpretation of the facts is that debate was vigorously carried on <i>at the time with</i> the best of then-modern science and then-novel ideas, tempered by the orthodoxy of biblical interpretations and an orthodoxy of the previous scientific conceptions. <a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERolinator_4b12.html" title="User:Rolinator">Rolinator</a> 04:38, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, there was a fairly sizable group of geologists in the 1800s: the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geological_Society_of_London_0fd3.html" title="Geological Society of London">Geological Society of London</a> was created from the reorganization of an earlier body, &amp; their earliest most important act was to exclude <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Smith_%28geologist%29_d2ce.html" title="William Smith (geologist)">William "Strata" Smith</a> from joining their group. But, Rolinator, you've grasped my point: knowledge is very often advanced in fits &amp; starts, with many cases of politically-motivated half-measures.

<dd>Scientific evidence is not ignored, I'll grant you that. It is just plastered over with so much philosophical bullshit it ceases to have any relevance. For exmple, the Grand Canyon is dealt with in most CS websites as a great rambling story about how it was formed in a flood; then they go on to show evidence which proves it was formed in a flood, and reject out of hand any other explanations. In fact, evidence which to most other scientists would discount flood hypotheses is not presented at all.

<dd>Scientific point of view is not Neutral point of view. IIRC in the early days of wikipedia there was a big uproar over whether these articles should be written from a scientific point of view or a totally neutral point of view, and obviously neutral won. The rule, if I may paraphrase, ended up being "Science <i>always</i> gets the 'feature' position in an article, but all other notable views must be fairly presented". And regardless of scientific consensus, there are more people that identify Christian than Atheist so it's certainly a "significant minority". Joshua you cited notable dissent, that's within science, not science vs other.

<dd>Perhaps, but the point is that regardless of how much people dislike the way Creationists interpret the evidence in Creationism's favor, is that it is still interpreted in fashion, which the article currently asserts is false. <a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHomestarmy_5e94.html" title="User:Homestarmy">Homestarmy</a> 23:57, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>: <i>Wikipedia is a general encyclopedia, which means it is a representation of human knowledge at some level of generality. But human beings disagree about specific cases; for any topic on which there are competing views, each view represents a different idea of what the truth is, and insofar as that view contradicts other views, its adherents believe that the other views are false and therefore not knowledge. ... A solution is that we accept, for the purposes of working on Wikipedia, that "human knowledge" includes all different significant theories on all different topics.</i></p>
<p>Religious views are <i>undeniably</i> a "significant minority" and it's inappropriate to write them off with "Today some religious groups ... reject scientific evidence which contradicts their beliefs."</p>
<p>I'm also editing "They provide alternative explanations through flood geology, which is a theory based on biblical inerrancy that ignores evidence from meteorites, the Moon, and Mars, and has been rejected by scientists. The scientific community characterises such efforts as pseudoscience." to make it at least civil. Come on.</p>

<p>The little section at the beginning about creation science has been polished up to my great satisfaction- I think we've done a perfect job of achieving a neutral, nonconfrontational balance. Technically WP articles have license to assert science as a stated/assumed fact in sentence structure, for example saying "young earth creationism is pseudoscience" rather than the gracious "the scientific community classifies it as pseudoscience"--<a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFroth_72db.html" title="User:Froth">⁪froth</a><sup><b><a href="../../../f/r/o/User_talk%7EFroth_2eda.html" title="User talk:Froth"><small>T</small></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Froth_e2c7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Froth"><small>C</small></a></b></sup> 06:51, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your edit from fable to narrative was very good. I changed 'many' (religious groups) back to 'some'. If you'd like, we could break down the % of the worlds population believe what, in the intro. What American YEC's believe is VERY different than what Hindus believe - so to lump all 'religious believers' together is fallacious, IMHO. - <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">Fairness And Accuracy For All</a> 06:59, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And replaced. Your analogy fails. <i>The scientific community characterises this explanation as religious-based pseudoscience.</i> is quite factual. note that it doesn't say the reli views are pseudoscience, but that the scientific community <i>characterises</i> is as such.

<p>That sentence strikes me as being a needlessly cruel barb tacked onto the end of what is otherwise a fine summary of religous concepts. I don't think we need to document scientists' opinion of these religous concepts any more than we should add YEC commentary to the end of paragraphs about, say, radiometric dating results. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESheffieldSteel_5db9.html" title="User:SheffieldSteel">SheffieldSteel</a> 03:13, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The current introduction for this page lists the age of the earth as 4.567 billion years, but the uncertainties stated further down are 1%. It would be more appropriate to give the numbers in the introduction to 3 significant figures: 4.57 or 4.04 billion years since 1% uncertainty is 0.04 billion years.

<p>There is a great deal history and background information on Radiometric Dating here - more, in fact, than there is on that page.
