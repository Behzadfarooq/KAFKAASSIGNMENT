<li>Your <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr._Mod_a36a.html" title="User:Mr. Mod">Mr. Mod</a> page and basic wiki info are virtually interchangeable.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">German Rex</span></h2>
<p>I made a new entry for the cat breed - <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Rex_09df.html" title="German Rex">German Rex</a>. You made some changes to it that I would like to comment on. By the way, the source material is from Dr Rose Scheur-Karpin herself. She is 95 years old and unfortunately cannot now see or hear very well. A few years ago she donated all her archive material to the German Rex Cat Club, of which I am a founder member and the database maintainer.</p>
<p>But before I comment, I have to tell you that this is my first entry, and my first attempt at a talk or discussion. My apologies if it is unnecessarily long, or outside the accepted protocol. I have read the Introduction and some of the cross-linked help pages, but there are so many of them that I have probably missed something!</p>
<p>I was very surprised to get your edits only about 30 minutes after I saved the entry - amazing - is it usually so fast? I see the reasons for most of them, so have no problem there, but there are two changes to the textual content that I want to re-edit as follows:</p>
<p>1. The paragraph that now ends "but they were castrated early." still needs to have the sentence that followed in my original "Munk spread his genes plentifully through the town's beautiful lady cats, but for his owner his value was as himself, not for his curly coat."</p>
<p>Although picturesque, it is still true and is an essential contribution. Perhaps you would prefer that 'beautiful lady' is replaced by 'female'?</p>
<p>2. The phrase that you have modified to "In the summer of 1951, Dr Rose Scheur-Karpin". I assume that you did not like the word 'doctor' to be followed by 'Dr.'. Normally I would agree with you, but in this case the original phrase "In the summer of 1951 a doctor, Dr Rose Scheur-Karpin," was written that way for two very good factual reasons.</p>
<p>In the first place, 'a doctor,' is stating that the person involved was NOT a cleaner, orderly, nurse or whatever. Stray cats in many hospitals are normally looked after by other than a doctor! If it had not been Dr Rose Scheur-Karpin, then it is likely that the breed would never have been established.</p>
<p>In the second place, the title of Doctor in Germany is very important. Dr Rose Scheur-Karpin always signs herself as that - it is part of her <i>complete</i> public name even nowadays, let alone in 1951.</p>
<p>I hope this now makes sense to you? I await your reply before making further edits.</p>
<p>Now a couple of questions where I can't find the appropriate help page. I see that at the moment there are boxes on the entry page for Verifying and Expert. How do I change things to remove those?

<li>Welcome to Wikipedia, Tony. First things first, you should refer to the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Help%7EContents_22de.html" title="Help:Contents"><b>Help Page</b></a>, which will get you started. You will also see that you have a "Welcome" message on your <a href="../../../t/a/m/User_talk%7ETamstudi_89f8.html" title="User talk:Tamstudi"><b>talk page</b></a>, which includes links to some very helpful tips for someone starting out.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As for the specific edits you refer to, I will not make specific comments addressing each one. Instead, I will provide some general comments. First and foremost, no one <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN"><b>owns</b></a> an article on Wikipedia. Once you create an article, other editors may contribute and work to try to improve the article, using their <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF"><b>own good judgment</b></a>. While it's much more blunt than I would say, at the bottom of the edit page you'll see the message, "<b>If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it.</b>". Hopefully, you did not find my contribution to be merciless! My only goal was to try to improve an article that looked like was off to a good start. If you do not like the changes I made, that is fine, I don't mind. Just be careful that if you choose to <a href="../../../r/e/v/Help%7EReverting_1fd5.html" title="Help:Reverting"><b>revert</b></a> the changes I made. Wikipedia policy does not allow anyone to revert any one article more than three times in the same day (the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree-revert_rule_1a38.html" title="Wikipedia:Three-revert rule">"Three Revert Rule"</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Two final comments. First, I saw your article because Wikipedia generates a list of <b>New pages</b> (click on "recent changes" on the navigation box on the left of your screen). Second, <b>always</b> remember to sign comments you make on talk pages with four tildes (~~~~).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Have fun and I look forward to seeing your future contributions! <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 17:08, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your comments. I have looked around as you suggested, tried various searches and so on but still cannot find any answer to my final question - "I see that at the moment there are boxes on the entry page for Verifying and Expert. How do I change things to remove those?" <a href="../../../t/a/m/User%7ETamstudi_59c6.html" title="User:Tamstudi">Tony</a> 17:29, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The boxes appear because I added <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_c546.html" title="Wikipedia:Template messages"><b>templates</b></a> when I was in the edit page for the article. If you go into the edit page for the article, you'll see <b>{{<a href="../../../v/e/r/Template%7EVerify_1f97.html" title="Template:Verify">verify</a>}}</b> and <b>{{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpert_3e75.html" title="Template:Expert">expert</a>}}</b> at the very top. When the article is saved, the wiki software substitutes the two boxes you see on the article. I added "expert" because I was simply a copy-editor. I don't profess to know anything about German Rexes and from the article it looked like someone in the know should deal with the substantive matters. As for "verify", while I was simply copy-editing, I wanted to know the very basics and what I read about German Rexes wasn't entirely consistent with the article. It appears that you know something about this breed, so if you can cleanup the article in those respects, simply add the new information and delete the {{<a href="../../../v/e/r/Template%7EVerify_1f97.html" title="Template:Verify">verify</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpert_3e75.html" title="Template:Expert">expert</a>}} from the top of the edit page. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 17:50, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, now the explanation clears up the question. I have dealt with the Verify by adding references, and the Expert, because I am one - on the history of the breed now that Dr Rose Scheur-Karpin cannot help. <a href="../../../t/a/m/User%7ETamstudi_59c6.html" title="User:Tamstudi">Tony</a> 15:51, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, my name is Benjamyn McKay, Deputy Premier of the TUXIS Parliament of Alberta, and I was curious as to why you decided to switch it from TUXIS to TPA. From the perspective of someone in the organisation its very confusing to read TPA when in common practice we refer to ourselves simply as TUXIS. Write me if you want at benjamyn.mckay@gmail.com, Cheers <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 142.59.210.207 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_142.59.210.207_9cbb.html" title="Special:Contributions/142.59.210.207">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<ul>
<li>The article is not to be read from the context of someone inside the organization, it is meant to be read by those outside the organization. Calling the Alberta parliament "TUXIS" when the context of the article makes it clear there is (or was) a larger "<a href="../../../t/u/x/TUXIS_fabf.html" title="TUXIS">TUXIS</a>" organization could be confusing to the reader, who may not be able to readily able to differentiate when it is the parliament or the larger TUXIS that is being referred to. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 22:29, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry I also forgot to mention how it is how the organisation is referred to outside of it as well. Ask anyone if they've heard of the "TPA" and they'll give you a blank look, they would however connect simply "TUXIS" with youth parliament of Alberta.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 142.59.210.207 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_142.59.210.207_9cbb.html" title="Special:Contributions/142.59.210.207">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>Again, the article isn't just for those familiar with the organization. Articles should be written in a way so that readers unfamiliar with the topic can understand and learn about the topic. I think if you were to ask anyone outside of Alberta about TUXIS, "TPA", or anything related to the Alberta parliament you'd get equally blank looks. I am not saying "TPA" is the "official" abbrieviation used by the organization. It's simply used for clarity so those unfamiliar with the topic won't have to sort out when the article is referring to the youth parliament or the TUXIS movement. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 23:17, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Everyone puts a bit of themselves into their contributions, but you can't think of them as "my article" once you do (you should read <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> - it can provide you with some guidance).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">P-1500 AFD / Barnstar</span></h2>
<p>Thanks so much! Honestly, I don't often go around doing this. It all started with a content dispute on P-1000. I wanted to remove some extremely iffy unsourced information, but an editor found a source: some guy's site on Tripod. I said that it didn't count as a reliable source, and he said that according to the reliable source criteria, NONE of the article's sources were reliable. I said "you're right" and listed the article for deletion. I doubt that was his intent.</p>
<p>I didn't do it as revenge; I was honestly very reluctant. I've heard of the P-1000 and P-1500 many times, and so I took them for granted, but when I stepped back and looked at the situation from a standpoint of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, I realized the articles didn't belong. I had never seen them anywhere but Internet tank fan sites. I wanted to find them described in reliable sources, because I am sort of a tank fan and I'm interested in German monstrosities, even their back-of-the-envelope sketches. I do think the P-1000 and P-1500 projects existed. However, I have a feeling that if/when a reliable source is found, it will have almost nothing in the way of detail; I'm thinking that most of the "information" on the Internet is fanboy speculation that gets embellished more as time goes on.</p>
<p>I've done a few other serious trips to the library to verify iffy claims, but none of them involved AFDs; they generally had more to do with verifying one or two claims in an otherwise good article. Superweapon stuff just tends to rub me the wrong way, and I found that, for example, some folks on an aircraft article were deliberately misrepresenting a source in order to make a plane look better. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 17:19, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>I have never voiced any objection to different categorizations; in fact, my point is that there needs to be clear criteria in the article so one can tell if a particular person fits or does not fit within the term. However, I don't think being a "supermodel" precludes being a "fashion model" precludes being a "playboy model" precludes being a "lad mags model". Some fit within more than one (i.e. I'm sure Cindy Crawford would fit under both "supermodel" and "playboy model"). The article just needs to objectively set out who is or is not a "fashion model" or "supermodel". <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 02:08, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"fixing" top-sorting</span></h2>
<p>I was rather puzzled by the scattering of Canada stub sub-categories through the several listings pages, and had re-top-sorted a number of them before noticing that they seem to have been <i>un</i>top-sorted by yourself, in considerable numbers. What's your thinking here? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 05:00, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I had observed that for other parent categories, the sub-categories were sorted so that they were under proper alphabetical order. I also noticed that some of the Canada stub-subs had already been done in a similar manner, but others were not (i.e. in some cases the sort was done so that "Canada ABC topic" would sort under "A" (for ABC) and others, like "Canada XYZ" would sort under "C" (for "Canada")). It was internally inconsistent so I chose one way and sorted them accordingly, in the manner I had seen other categories sorted. (I know I could have said that all better, but I made the mistake of trying to be articulate at midnite) <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 06:06, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>On further investigation, I think I see what your question was, and if so, I edited the sub-stub categories to be consistent with changes someone else had done to the BC stub category. Either way, I was trying to be consistent with prior stuff others had done. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 06:10, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ah, OK, I didn't check all the histories, so I wasn't sure if this was a change initiated by you, or otherwise; fair enough. They're shockingly inconsistent currently, as I stopped halfway through, but assuming we're not rowing in opposite directions on this, I'll finish sort-keying "Canadian bacon stubs" (sorry!) as "*Bacon", as it appears under Canada stubs, so that they appear one the first page of the listing, alphabeticised by topic; that sound alright? I agree it doesn't make any sense for them to appear under "C" for Canada, in an all-Canadian category... <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 06:33, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You're probably right. I'm actually just going through electoral districts <i>already marked as stubs</i> and tagging them with the applicable province. I've actually removed stub tags from a few articles (similar to these); however, given the task I've undertaken I'm probably erring too much on the side of caution by leaving the articles as stubs. I've left a few "borderline" cases marked as stubs because they're missing quite a number of elections in comparison to other ridings that have info going back to the creation of the riding. Maybe I'll be a bit more judicial in <i>not</i> so as to not leave faux-stubs marked as stubs. Thanks for the input. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 21:51, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Fair enough. You might want to hold off on doing any federal ridings, though. I will be destubifying all of the remaining federal riding stubs over the next couple of months as I load the election results for those ridings into the articles. I have done much of the work already off-line, but it will take some time to load it. I won't be working on provincial ridings, though.

<li>Geez. I saw your adding these this morning and it gave me pause to wonder, as in many cases I've wished there was a BC-hist-stub and/or BC-poli-stub to go with the geo stub; and other categories of stub, too, for BC; not that you guys have signed on to the idea of a WikiProject BC, but just partly fielding that again and also to suggest that the huge bulk of BC entries kind of suggests that there should be different varieties of stubs. No? <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 22:03, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>It crossed my mind that instead of there being one catch-all {{<a href="../../../c/a/n/Template%7ECanada-constituency-stub_fa6c.html" title="Template:Canada-constituency-stub">Canada-constituency-stub</a>}} that there ought to be constituency stubs by province. There is currently a discussion<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Stub_sorting/Proposals/2006/July#Cat:Canadian_politician_stubs_split" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Stub_sorting/Proposals/2006/July#Cat:Canadian_politician_stubs_split" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> for creating separate stubs for politicians by province. The same should go for constituencies by province. However, having recently gone through and flagged a zillion articles with their respective provincial-stub templates, I know that would be a huge undertaking, so I haven't made the proposal. It would certainly do away with having to use two stub templates on a constituency article when one would do. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 22:11, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

He's got a politician category listed, and if that's a valid category it maybe should have a poli-stub added; but he's not a politician, rather a senior bureaucrat/official. Wondering about some kind of category for BC officials/bureaucrats; as a magistrate/gold commissioner he's theoretically a justice, i.e. in the law category. Not sure what to do here, and seeking input from other BC editors, e.g. you, Ground Zero, Usgnus, Fishhead64 and so on; posting this here and will ref to this off the other ed's talk pages.

<p>The new edits on the supermodel page are great. It was getting to such a deadlock with no headway. Thanks for being bold. My only concern at present, is the fair use on the Vogue cover. A bit more may be needed in discussing the specific cover for it to hold water as fair use if you feel that it contributes to the page. That's a big concern with many editors just now.

<li>Absolutely, well done. I too didn't have the time and the whole controversy with Lil Flip has worn me out. I spend an hour or two just covering his tracks on edits. He almost always adds new names to the bottom of an alphabetical list, seldom uses edit summaries unless he is SHOUTING trying to make a point and he repeats himself without understanding of the issue at hand. He has repeatedly claimed himself to be the expert here without giving us any background. He has energy that could be useful if it were just possible to direct that energy in a helpful direction.

<li>Yes and no. As I had mentioned, I had more or less scrubbed continuing with making this list because I decided real life was more important, so all I have is was what the "autosave" on my wordprocessor had kept.

The worst part is he does so many edits without seemingly thinking or reflecting on what he has been guided on before, he, by the way, used no edit summary on the above edit. This was on the Supermodel article, by the way. He also continues on any article of someone that at any time modelled to add the line "former fashion model" in the first summary paragraph where often it is inappropriate. I have put this in edit summaries time and again and posted to his talk page. Any suggestions? <a href="../../../d/_/c/User%7ED_C_McJonathan_b121.html" title="User:D C McJonathan">Doc</a> ♬ <a href="../../../d/_/c/User_talk%7ED_C_McJonathan_3332.html" title="User talk:D C McJonathan">talk</a> 00:48, 2 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I assume you're referring to the {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} template regarding Tyson Beckford. I noticed that earlier today, but it seemed such a minor infraction that I decided not to worry about it. Flip has been doing much better as of late (not great, but better), and I don't want to be wikistalking him or her. I noticed a more serious exchange between Flip and <a href="../../../h/o/t/User%7EHotwiki_4fcf.html" title="User:Hotwiki">Hotwiki</a> on Flip's <a href="../../../l/i/l/User_talk%7ELil_Flip246_843e.html#Deleting" title="User talk:Lil Flip246">talk page</a>, so it looks like a relapse happens now and again. As to what to do, I don't think any drastic steps need to be taken other than to continue to encourage Lil Flip to work constructively with others. But for the relapses, he or she seems to be getting it. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 01:36, 2 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, exactly. No, I agree that drastic measures are not called for. I too saw the discussion with <a href="../../../h/o/t/User%7EHotwiki_4fcf.html" title="User:Hotwiki">Hotwiki</a>, in fact he left a message on my talk page asking for help and then retracted the request before I got it. What I find so frustrating is that he never does anything once, but a dozen times, then I post a message to him trying to be low key and helpful, I get not response and a day or two later he does the same thing to another dozen pages. i.e. puting "former fashion model" in the opening paragraph of multiple actors or broadcasters. I feel at times that I'm hitting my head on a brick wall. I wish he had an active email so that I could try to be more direct without seeming to wash his laundry in public. If he stayed to his other area of interest, the Simpson's etc. I would just ignore it, but the volume of his edits concern me when he doesn't seem to get the message or follow usual MOS. Sorry to lay this on you, but I just don't know how to get through to him and much of his editing is on namespace articles I care about. He has stared to put models names in alphabetical order within model agencies, although still pays no attention to column lengths...that's an easy one to fix, but it's upsetting to need half and hour or more to clean up his edits each day instead of working on what I might wish to. <a href="../../../d/_/c/User%7ED_C_McJonathan_b121.html" title="User:D C McJonathan">Doc</a> ♬ <a href="../../../d/_/c/User_talk%7ED_C_McJonathan_3332.html" title="User talk:D C McJonathan">talk</a> 01:58, 2 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No worries about "laying it on me". I might be feeling a bit less frustrated because the problems are occurring outside of an area I personally take serious interest (I just saw an article that needed some help!). Lil Flip might benefit from some sort of voluntary <a href="../../../m/e/n/Wikipedia%7EMentorship_190c.html" title="Wikipedia:Mentorship">wikimentorship</a> (I just did a quick help space and wiki space search for mentoring and found that). It might be worth suggesting that. If you wish, I am willing to make the suggestion, but not serve as the "mentor" (it should be someone who hasn't been involved previously). <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 02:13, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Thanks, well, your efforts with the supermodel article are greatly appreciated. Yes, I think that the mentor program sounds great. Looked at the page, but not sure how to propose, so if you'd be willing to that would be great. If he didn't do such "mass" edits at one time, it wouldn't be as much of a problem, but once he is off and running he'll make an edit to as many as twenty pages, with almost everyone of them being slightly off base. I do believe that he is well intentioned, but if one follows the thread of his logic it can get frightening at times. Thanks again. <a href="../../../d/_/c/User%7ED_C_McJonathan_b121.html" title="User:D C McJonathan">Doc</a> ♬ <a href="../../../d/_/c/User_talk%7ED_C_McJonathan_3332.html" title="User talk:D C McJonathan">talk</a> 03:47, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hello <a href="../../../a/g/e/Agent_86.html" title="Agent 86">Agent 86</a>! I am emailing you regarding the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_of_some_common_Hindustani_words_6b78.html" title="Origin of some common Hindustani words">Origin of some common Hindustani words</a> article that you put up for deletion. When the discussion is closed, I am wondering if you can inform me. I will be glad to take action to move the article (if decided) and fix all the redirect pages. The renaming you suggested seems like a good idea. Currently, there exists a grammar page: <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindust%C4%81n%C4%AB_%28Hind%C4%AB-Urd%C5%AB%29_grammar_7ddc.html" title="Hindustānī (Hindī-Urdū) grammar">Hindustānī (Hindī-Urdū) grammar</a>. If the consensus is to rename the article, I think modeling the new name of <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_of_some_common_Hindustani_words_6b78.html" title="Origin of some common Hindustani words">Origin of some common Hindustani words</a> after the grammar article would be a good idea: "Hindustānī (Hindī-Urdū) word etymology". This way pages are consistent. As a member of the <a href="../../../l/a/n/WP%7ELang_9ea3.html" title="WP:Lang">WikiProject:Languages</a>, specifically Hindustani-Hindi-Urdu, I would be happy to do this. Please let me know if this can work out. Thank you very much sir. Jdas07 02:10, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I liked <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman's</a> idea of Hindi-Urdu word etymology. You could simply use the "move" feature to make that change.

<ul>
<li>Yes, I also agree that it is a good idea. I know how to move and redirect pages, I am just wondering when would be the appropriate time be to do so? I think after the AFD discussion would be the best time. Do you know when the discussion is going to be closed? Jdas07 01:30, 4 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I personally would wait until the AfD is closed, but that is just how I would conduct myself. You may edit articles during an AfD and even rename them <i>as long you make sure the page still links to the discussion page</i> (see <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion</a> for the applicable policy and more detailed instructions). The AfD usually runs for five days. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 02:55, 4 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Alright thanks. I will wait till the AfD is closed. Do you think it will be possible for you to tell me when this occurs? Thanks. Jdas07 03:43, 4 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I could, but you could just add the discussion to your watch list. Alternatively, just check the page. If it survives the AfD, the closing admin will remove the AfD template and put a note on the talk page. If it fails, the article will be gone. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 05:24, 4 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thanks, I added it to my watchlist. So according to the AfD guide for deletion, this discussion should be done in 1 to 2 days. Right? Jdas07 06:04, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">SSSI stubs</span></h2>
<p>Hi - can you let me know what improvements you'd like to see at the SSSI pages you've updated with the context tag, and I'd be happy to make them if I can - thanks. <a href="../../../s/p/-/User%7ESP-KP_2816.html" title="User:SP-KP">SP-KP</a> 21:36, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>It took me a minute to figure out which articles you were talking about, which is part of the problem. Unless you're already in the know on this topic, to a casual reader the article provides no information as to what it is about (you have to follow the links to start to figure it out). There's nothing wrong with a stub article, but the introduction should make it clear what the topic is about. It is not readily apparent that this is a biology article or a geography article. I suppose I can't say more than what the {{<a href="../../../c/o/n/Template%7EContext_4c09.html" title="Template:Context">context</a>}} template says without being repetitive. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 21:44, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, thanks, but I'm still not clear what changes/improvements you have in mind. Can you be more specific - which terms caused you the biggest problems of understanding, for example? Thanks <a href="../../../s/p/-/User%7ESP-KP_2816.html" title="User:SP-KP">SP-KP</a> 21:49, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not so much the terms, it's the lack of terms. There is also insufficient context to indicate what a "Site of Special Scientific Interest" might mean, unless one looks at that article as well. I must admit that I had never heard of an SSSI before, and while I'm familiar with a "down", it's not a word that has much use in North American english (I have no idea if it's used in Australia or New Zealand). There just isn't anything in the stub to tell a reader who knows nothing about the subject what the article is even about. I don't mean to be obtuse, but the article is somewhat unclear without reading a bunch of other articles. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 21:57, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So, a couple of thoughts then - a) instead of saying "XYZ is an SSSI", I could say "XYZ is a [something descriptive about the site e.g. hill, meadow, lake]" and b) instead of just saying "it has been notified as an SSSI" I could say something like "because of its [reason why it has been notified], it has been notified as an SSSI". If I did those two things would that solve the problem, or do you think I need to do more than that? <a href="../../../s/p/-/User%7ESP-KP_2816.html" title="User:SP-KP">SP-KP</a> 22:06, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think there's any magic wording to be employed and I'm not saying do away with the references to SSSIs. I'm just suggesting that you provide some sort of context so that the uninitiated can tell what the article is about. Pretend you're dealing with...me. I know nothing about the subject. What would you tell someone like me who knows little of the subject so I would know what you're writing about? Just provide enough information so as to make it clear what the topic is about. Your suggestion of describing the subject as a kind of generic geographic area/formation that is preserved or being studied is a good one. You might also add a couple of words stating what an "SSSI" is. I'm not asking for a fully developed article, just suggesting you might want to write it in such a way that it's apparent within the stub what the subject is about. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 22:18, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How does <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burcombe_Down_5589.html" title="Burcombe Down">Burcombe Down</a> look now? Can you let me know if I need to do anything more. Eventually, I do intend to expand all biological SSSI articles to a more reasonably fully-fledged state (Someone else can do the geological ones as I'm out of my depth there). <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yanal_Bog_8a8e.html" title="Yanal Bog">Yanal Bog</a> will give you an idea of what I have in mind - I'd be interested in comments on that too if you have any.

Thank you for taking part in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_GHe_3dbd.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/GHe">my RfA</a>! Unfortunately, it ended with a final result of <b>(62/23/7)</b>, and with only <b>73%</b> support, no consensus was achieved. Nevertheless, I'd like to thank you again for your trust and support and better luck to me next time!&#160;:)<br />

<p>Are you nominating all lists of actors by nationality/ethnicity or just the ones you list? If all, you should probably list them all as to not confuse people etc..

<li>Good sleuthing there. I would have nominated them along with all the others had I known about them. That being so, I'll probably let the AfD on the current nomination run its course and then, depending on the outcome, nominate these remaining lists. If you want to nominate these yourself before the current AfD completes, feel free to do so. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 17:18, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>We should probably wait for this one to end first like you said. Plus I'm working on a few other AFDs at the moment. But if it works out, then there's not reason to delete Iranian ones and not Pakistani ones if you know what I mean. <a href="../../../2E/2E/2E/User%7E...And_Beyond%21_c96c.html" title="User:...And Beyond!">...And Beyond!</a> 17:28, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>By the way, Quebec and Montreal don't have categories but all the others do and essentially they're just Canadian actors anyway. Also, what's your take on the more specific ones? <a href="../../../2E/2E/2E/User%7E...And_Beyond%21_c96c.html" title="User:...And Beyond!">...And Beyond!</a> 20:57, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'd nominate them all, for same reasons as the others. As for categories, see <a href="../../../q/u/e/Category%7EQuebec_actors_84f0.html" title="Category:Quebec actors">Category:Quebec actors</a>. For the list of Montreal actors, I'd either ensure they're included in the Quebec actors category or create a Category:Montreal actors and add that template to all the people on the Montreal list. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 23:42, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Bengali_actresses_506f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Bengali actresses">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Bengali actresses</a></span></h2>
<p>Hi, fellow procrastinator. I think <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Bengali_actresses_506f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Bengali actresses">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Bengali actresses</a> is not the right place to discuss German actors, so I'm doing it here.</p>
<p>The List of German actors (from 1895 to the present), much more appropriately titled "Liste der Darsteller des deutschsprachigen Films" on the German Wikipedia (<a href="../../../a/u/s/User%7EAustronaut_086a.html" title="User:Austronaut">User:Austronaut</a> actually suggested renaming the page "List of actors in German movies" or "List of German speaking actors"), was compiled there and then imported. Since then it has been carefully maintained, expanded and updated by a relatively small number of contributors. Now, for some reason I cannot even start to fathom, you want it deleted. "For consistency", as you put it? Is consistency your, or Wikipedia's, ultimate goal?</p>
<p>You say that "no consideration had been given to the encyclopedic value of these lists." Well, that depends on how you define "encyclopaedic". If the word means "providing information to those who seek it", the list in question certainly is "encyclopaedic". It offers users at a glance a survey of chronologically ordered names, even specifiying whether actors active during the Weimar years later worked in the <a href="../../../b/d/r/BDR_5ae0.html" title="BDR">BDR</a> or the <a href="../../../g/d/r/GDR_bf47.html" title="GDR">GDR</a>. What is more, it gives potential contributors a chance to see, also at a glance, which articles are still missing (and there are lots and lots!)—something the <a href="../../../g/e/r/Category%7EGerman_actors_31ba.html" title="Category:German actors">Category:German actors</a> can never achieve.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't mind if this particular list is deleted—I've made a copy, so I can access, and use, it any time I want. But I think that's beside the point. I'd want all users, including future and potential ones, to be able to benefit from that list. The simplest argument against deletion would be that it doesn't do any harm, but there is much more to it really, as I've tried to point out.</p>
<p>Also, though I'm not really in favour of <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slippery_slope.html" title="Slippery slope">slippery slope</a> arguments, I'm afraid more and more lists which do serve a purpose will be nominated for deletion. (Just some months ago, someone even nominated the alphabetical List of people.) Finally—but that's another matter altogether—I'm against the deletion procedure where "Keep"s and "Delete"s are simply counted but no attention is paid to the weight of the arguments presented.</p>
<p>I'll take the liberty to create a link to this message from the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Bengali_actresses_506f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Bengali actresses">Bengali actresses</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you for voting in my RfA. I would especially like to thank those 18 people that supported me. But I'd also like to thank those that may have not voted for me, but gave me advice to make me a better wikipedian. Once again, I thank you all. Unfortunately, the final result was 18 supporters, 32 opposers, 9 nuetrals, therefore I wasn't promoted to sysop. I hope to see you vote in my next RfA in late 2006, early 2007.
