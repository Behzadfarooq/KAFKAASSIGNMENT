<p>Soooo, ((AgentSeethroo)) you work for the air force? Tell us about that! - ((Heir_of_Lindeen))</p>
<p>Weeeeeeeellll... the Air Force is pretty nifty, they treat us way better than the army and marines treat their peoples... My job is Contracting, which means I basically buy supplies and services to be used on the base I'm stationed at. Pretty cushy job actually...I gots my own desk and whatnot...</p>
<p>I SWORE when I was younger that I'd NEVER join any military branch, but I guess I had to grow up eventually...</p>
<p><br />
OH and a little more about myself, I co-own a little Manga production company with my wife and best friend, and we're working on a hilarious little series.</p>
<p>If you folks have any Air Force questions (yeah right) or anything else, I'm the guy to come to!!!</p>
<p>((AgentSeethroo))</p>
<p>Do you ever get bored of your job?- ((SBZ22))</p>
<p>Not really, I mean my job is to buy stuff ya know? there's a process to it that can get old sometimes, but it changes all the time, and I've bought some pretty cool stuff...Some pretty EXPENSIVE stuff too ... I think my job's pretty cool...how many 21 year olds do you know that get to spend thousands of dollars on a daily basis? lol it would suck to be deployed to Iraq or something like that, but any time you get deployed, you never come back home without some kind of positive change in your life...you really appreciate your family, or your wife/girlfriend (whichever the case may be lol). it's just overall a good thing to experience.</p>
<p>((AgentSeethroo))</p>
<p>My best friend dreams of being in the Air Force. Have any advice for her? PrincessofStrongBadia</p>
<p>For basic training, just learn to do pushups...for the REAL Air Force, just do your job the right way and you'll win more awards than you can imagine. Trust me, I know for a FACT! lol</p>
<p>OH one of the MOST important things to know is always get a good supervisor...if you have a crappy one you can always talk to your first sergeant and get a different one. You'll never succeed if your supervisor hasn't.</p>
<p>This is fun! ((AgentSeethroo))</p>
<p>I was just wondering because my uncle was in the Air Force and he resigned because he thought it was boring. I'm not sure whay part of the Air Force he was in, though.- ((SBZ22))</p>
<p>So it seems as if you spend a lot of your time on the computer... - ((Heir_of_Lindeen))</p>
<p>true, true....everything I do with my job is on the computer...like...the whole shebang...so I can surf while I work. YEEHA! It kinds sucks when the communications squadron blocks websites though...they even blocked homestarrunner.com for a couple weeks...but now just the games, downloads, and store is blocked....*sigh* ((AgentSeethroo))</p>
<p>That must suck, but man, I've always wanted to join the Air Force (but I would DEFINATELY be workin on the computers - I love 'em) But I told my Mum and she pretty much crushed my hopes and dreams, thinks I won't pass the physical coz of my heart murmur, stuffed back and non-ulcer dispepsia!!! AAARGH! That shouldn't matter!! I'll be on the computers!!! Did you have to do a physical to get your job? I'm in great physical shape and all, (best runner in the class) but I just have a few things stuffing up. Please help. - ((M.J))</p>
<p>Well, what you need to do first is talk to a recruiter. I promise you they'll do EVERYTHING they can to get you in the Air Force. They'll also help you get whatever job you want. Make SURE you get a job you want, or else you could be stuck with a crappy poopoo job. If that medical stuff has no effect on your physical fitness and ability to do a 1.5 mile run, situps, or pushups, you could just not disclose certain information to your recruiter. Even if you do, they'll probably just tell you not to say anything about it when you go to get your physical. Got any more questions? I like this game! - ((AgentSeethroo|Agent "A1C" Gentry))</p>
<p>Don't mean to barge in here, but I just have to say that the <a href="http://www.defence.gov.au/raaf/" class="external text" title="http://www.defence.gov.au/raaf/" rel="nofollow">Royal Australian Air Force</a> and the <a href="http://www.defencejobs.gov.au/airsite.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.defencejobs.gov.au/airsite.htm" rel="nofollow">Airforce Recruiting</a> web pages are really cool. I was also able to find some pretty specific physical requirements <a href="http://www.defencejobs.gov.au/careers_explorer/AddInfo3.html" class="external text" title="http://www.defencejobs.gov.au/careers_explorer/AddInfo3.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. -- ((Tom))</p>
<p>Woah. I was reading the RAAF recruiting page...in their basic training you get "a big comfortable bed" and "a big screen tv". Dangit. I wish I was Australian. - AgentSeethroo</p>
<p>Woot! I'm an Aussie all the way. Yeah, I should be able to do all that training stuff, but it's been a while since I've tried to do a sit-up! lol. - ((M.J))</p>

<p>You remind me of a kangaroo. - ((FireBird))</p>
<p>well...you remind me of...a...bird? that's like...on fire? so THERE! ((AgentSeethroo)) *hop hop hop*</p>
<p>A kangaroo?!! What the crap about Mr.Seethroo over here reminds you of a kangaroo? - ((Heir_of_Lindeen))</p>
<p>The last two o's in his name remind me of a kangaroo. I'm sorry for posting my thoughts Heir_of_Liddean, I guess I should have asked you first. - FireBird</p>
<p>Oh his name reminds of a kangaroo. I was thinking you ment like him as a person. I was thinking what did this guy do that reminded you of a kangaroo. Sorry offense was not intended. - ((Heir_of_Lindeen))'</p>
<p>Oh, ok. Sorry. - FireBird</p>
<p>{Said in Steve Irwin's voice} G'day mates! CRIKEYS! I've seen a few Kangaroos in my day, but never before have I seen such a rare species such as the "Agent Seeth Roo." Ahh! Isn't he a beauty! Well, I think I'll go wrestle another alligator! CRIKEY!! - ((M.J))</p>

<p>I noticed you asked a question on DeeDee's userspace about putting a pic of yourself on this page. If you need space to host an image, I'm happy to do so right here on the wiki itself (it's definately better than Yahoo!). You can shoot me the image attached to an email if you'd like. --JoeyDay</p>
<p>You sound like Detective Alex. My friend made him up when we were talking about what people in our school would be like as adults, and he said that a kid named Alex would be a detective in some army-type division. Alex (in real life) is a really technological guy, so we said that Detective Alex would do all of his work on the computer! -((Lord Karkon))</p>

<p>do do doot. do do doot. do do doot. duh nuh nuh.</p>
<p>$10 for the sucker who can figure out what song that came from!! sounds impossible, no? IT IS! but seriously. give 'er a try. - ((AgentSeethroo))</p>
<p>It sounds familar. James Bond, or Mission Impossible perhaps. - ((Heir_of_Lindeen))</p>
<p>Nope, sorry. Not from a soundtrack...think of recent singles...like within the last couple years. Keep trying! this is fun! ((AgentSeethroo))</p>
<p>Are the doot's and duh's vocal or heavy metal, or what? -((The Brothers E))</p>
<p>Third eye blind Semi-charmed Life? - ((Heir_of_Lindeen)) Or maybe Strong Bad's Techno song? - ((Heir_of_Lindeen))</p>
<p>the doots and duhs aren't vocals, they're like...geetarz. It's a bit newer than Semi-Charmed Life, but it's not 3EB. and it's not SBTechno.</p>
<p>hmm...maybe this'll help...it's the first track on the band's cd... uhh...it has to do with someone...gettin hit? yeah...gettin hit. seriously! you can do it! ((AgentSeethroo))</p>
<p>What band was it? - ((Heir_of_Lindeen))</p>

<p>I've got an air force question. What's it like in the air force? ((dillon))</p>
<p>Yo dillon. it really depends on what job you have. but generally, it's great. pretty laid back, people joke around all the time...It's really like an everyday job, except you wear cool camo stuff and you never have to worry about being laid off.</p>
<p>OH and your promotions are like...Definite. like you get promoted every so often no matter what, and you get pay raises every year. like...at least a hundred more dollars a month.</p>
<p>geeze...I'm startin to sound like my recruiter...yeah but anyway, I like the job security. and LEAVE ROCKS! I can take days off any time I want, as long as I have enough leave built up...in fact...I might take next week off...FOR FUN!!!!!</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is my intention to play video games for several hours.</p>
<p>if ya have any more questions, I don't mind answerin'. but please don't belittle what I do. ((AgentSeethroo))</p>

<p>Random crap, huh??</p>
<p>"Hypocrisy is the vaseline of social intercourse."</p>
<p>If you say "3.141592657" you have cited pi to nine decimal points. After that just start saying whatever numbers you want, and say them with authority. People will think you are a genius.</p>
<p>I need more coffee.</p>
<p>-!TallAndMerciless</p>
<p>Uh, isn't that ninth decimal place incorrect? (The seven.) Shouldn't it be a four? -- ((Tom))</p>
<p>The internet says: 3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679</p>

<p>Air Force Question: What's at Area 51? --((Buz))</p>
<p>Sorry dude, don't have the security clearance to even know. and if I DID know...and I told you...I'd have to kill you! ((AgentSeethroo))</p>
<p>If you do not even have clearance to know about it, how do you know you will have to kill us if you told? - ((Heir_of_Lindeen))</p>
<p>well if I was to "accidentally" stumble onto Area 51, the Security Forces in the area would have NO problem with either 1) knockin' me down on my face and immediately placing the muzzle of an M-16 assault rifle against my head OR 2) just shooting me. So therefore I gather that if whatever they have there is so important that they can kill me cause they know what's there and I don't, then who's to say I couldn't kill you if yadda yadda yadda?</p>
<p>and by the way, getting a Top Secret security clearance SUCKS. you even have to have perfect credit! ((AgentSeethroo))</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, you wouldn't want someone in 100K of debt being blackmailed or bribed to give information. I wouldn't. But then again, I'm betting I'll never have top secret clearance unless it's required for some job in politics. --((Buz))</dd>

<p>So they told you it existed? - ((Heir_of_Lindeen))</p>
<p>Well, Area 51 DOES exist. it's in Nevada, some 40 miles north of Vegas.</p>
<p>But what goes on there is completely mysterious. Some say it's alien stuff, some say it's aircraft testing, but no one really knows except the people who work on that base. There are theories, of course. you can check out <a href="http://www.Area51.net" class="external free" title="http://www.Area51.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.Area51.net</a> to check out stuff about aliens, and then there's <a href="http://users.cihost.com/ata/aircraft.htm" class="external free" title="http://users.cihost.com/ata/aircraft.htm" rel="nofollow">http://users.cihost.com/ata/aircraft.htm</a> that shows aircraft that were developed at area 51.</p>
<p>on a related note, I tried getting a Top Secret clearance because my original job was going to have something to do with nuclear bombs and whatnot. But luckily, I couldn't get my clearance, and now I'm in a different job called Contracting. Much better. Much safer. and my wifey feels much better about it.</p>
<p>AgentSeethroo</p>
<p>I have some insider information! Area 51 is actually A.R.E.A. 51. Area, Rea, Ea, Aerodynamic 51! But if I told you that, I'd have to crap you. Wait... oops. --((Lord Karkon))</p>

<p>Irony: The millatary's job is to defend (sometimes by risking their own lives) other people's rights to spit in their faces and try to get rid of their jobs. They also defend the right for people to vote for the person who decides whether they have a job or not. -((CE5))</p>
<p>um. you misspelled military. And I know exactly what I got myself into. What's your frickin' point, kid? Who's trying to get rid of my job? Who's going to replace the military? Wal-Mart associates?? You think it's a possibility that a president might dissolve the Department of Defense? Not to be rude, but you have a lot to learn about the real world.

<p>One of the planes on that one plane link you gave us, AgentSeethroo, looked remarkably like the plane in the X-men movies. - ((Heir_of_Lindeen))</p>
<p>Which one? the SR-71 blackbird? That plane's been around for quite a while. It's no surprise that they look similar really, the Blackbird is one of the USAF's best spy planes. And it's wicked cool lookin. I saw one in San Antonio. Mucho intimidating.((AgentSeethroo))</p>

<p><b>On Dag</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I think "Dag" is synonomous with "cool" or "awesome." At least, that's the only context I've ever heard it used in... if you don't count TGS but I think it may have been used out of context there. Like she was using a popular catch phrase to try and be cool even in her throes of death. -((Hobophobic))</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I personally think it means something close to "woah, dude" or something like that. But that's just me. ~ AgentSeethroo</p>

<p>What is your opinion on the war in Iraq? Before the Abu Ghraib scandals, my motto on it was "Support our troops, don't support the people who sent them over there", which meant that I respected the military, but I didn't like the President and his cronies.</p>
<p>I don't think we should be led into war by big-business idiots who avoided actually fighting and are only going in to get the oil, but the people who are in the military, I appreciate them as they don't act like cowards when they're asked to go to fight but they send others to fight for the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I salute you ((AgentSeethroo)), but I will not salute the Republicans in the White House who are lying, cheating, and stealing simply to get oil from Iraq.</p>
<p>Really hoping that Kerry gets elected- ((William S.))</p>
<p>Wow. Excellent comment and question, ((william s.|Will)). Here's what I think: The war could have been handled in a different manner, yes. I also believe that the war was inevitable. Saddam had to be taken care of one way or another, and since we can't legally snipe him, this will have to suffice. I stand by the decisions of my superiors, all the way up to the Commander in Chief. Possibly because I have NO choice, but that makes no difference.</p>
<p>The Abu Ghraib situation hurts me at a really deep level. Before, I could walk down the street in my uniform and I would get looks of respect from whoever I came across, adult and child alike. But I fear that these ignorant lower enlisted soldiers who carried out the abuse at the prison may have soiled our image. Many of the people we protect constantly spit in our faces, call us baby killers, protest our very jobs, and hate us. This scandal does NOT help. The excuses those soldiers are giving the press/investigators/whoever else are all GARBAGE. Unlawful orders can be refused. With no legal/punitive repercussions. The Law of Armed Conflict states that.</p>
<p>This war was never about oil. Desert Storm, sadly, was. This is about the freedom of a country that has been oppressed by a single man for years upon years. The same man threatens our own safety as well.</p>
<p>Did we find those "weapons"? Doesn't look like it. Did Bush have "permission" from the U.N. to start the war? No. Do I want to be deployed? No. Not at all. Am I willing to fight for the freedom of each and every American on this Wiki? Absolutely. Give me an M-16, throw me in the desert. I'll do whatever I can.</p>
<p>I appreciate your support. It really means a lot to me.</p>
<p>After reading all this, it seems kind of incoherent...oh well. Any other questions?</p>
