<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Agent_47.html" title="Edit section: Creation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Creation</span></h3>
<p>47 is a genetically enhanced <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_cloning.html" title="Human cloning">clone</a>, the culmination of more than thirty years of research into human cloning and genetic augmentation, created by a cabal of criminal masterminds in an attempt to create the perfect soldier.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a>, five men of various nationalities served in the same unit of the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Foreign_Legion_46d8.html" title="French Foreign Legion">French Foreign Legion</a>. After their stint in the Foreign Legion was finished, four of the men returned to their home countries and founded vast criminal empires. One, Dr. Ort-Meyer, worked in a mental institution, which was only a cover for experiments in genetics. In exchange for research funding, Ort-Meyer provided these criminals with donor organs harvested from clone bodies, with which they significantly extended their longevity. (By the events of <i>Hitman: Codename 47</i>, the "five fathers" were well into their 60-70s, but appear to be in their mid 40s or 50s.)</p>
<p>47's "Five Fathers," the men whose DNA went into his creation, were:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Dr. Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer</b>: A discredited German scientist living in Romania, whose radical theories were significantly ahead of his time, Ort-Meyer believed that genetic recombination and human cloning could be used to produce a perfected version of humanity, possessing superior physical abilities and unburdened by morality or a conscience. His ultimate goal (unbeknown to his partners) was to create an army of unbeatable and unquestioningly obedient supermen with which to conquer and repopulate the world. In the end, however, 47 managed to defeat his next batch of clones and subsequently broke Ort-Meyer's neck.</li>
<li><b>Lee Hong</b>: A Chinese crime lord, he eventually rose to head of the Red Dragon triad, becoming the most powerful criminal in <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>. Even in his advanced age, Lee Hong proved extremely spry and dexterous with a sword.</li>
<li><b>Pablo Belisario Ochoa</b>: A Latin American drug dealer, Pablo formed his own drug cartel by violently eliminating his rivals, but his methods earned him great animosity and he was eventually forced to flee to a secret compound deep within the Colombian rainforest. Pablo was able to survive and continue fighting even after being shot a couple dozen times in the chest with an <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assault_rifle.html" title="Assault rifle">assault rifle</a> (although this feat could partially be attributed to the large quantity of cocaine he had consumed moments earlier). Pablo appears to be heavily-inspired by <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Montana_c206.html" title="Tony Montana">Tony Montana</a> in "<a href="../../../s/c/a/Scarface_%281983_movie%29.html" title="Scarface (1983 movie)">Scarface</a>".</li>
<li><b>Franz Fuchs</b>: A former member of the <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler_Youth_095a.html" title="Hitler Youth">Hitler Youth</a>, Franz always resented the collapse of <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">Fascism</a>. He developed a career as a professional terrorist-for-hire, organizing attacks such as the attempted chemical bombing of the <a href="../../../g/7/_/G7.html" title="G7">G7</a> leadership.</li>
<li><b>Arkadij "Boris" Jegorov</b>: A staunch anti-Communist, Boris became a world-wide arms dealer who smuggled weaponry for his older brother; Russian mafia boss Sergei Zavorotko, and even trafficking in nuclear weapons. Boris was able to detect 47's presence from several rooms away.</li>
</ul>
<p>From a secret laboratory beneath his privately-owned asylum in Romania, Ort-Meyer spent thirty years combining and manipulating <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_396c.html" title="DNA">DNA</a> taken from each of the five conspirators in an attempt to create life. Free from any moral or ethical boundaries, Ort-meyer's research produced many failed attempts and aborted monstrosities, but ultimately several successful genetically augmented clones were created. 47 was one of several clones in Ort-Meyer's 4th series, possessing a 47th <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chromosome.html" title="Chromosome">chromosome</a>, which, combined with his exceptional criminal lineage, endowed him with levels of strength, speed, stamina, and intelligence significantly above the human norm. (In real life, possessing an extra <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chromosome.html" title="Chromosome">chromosome</a> can lead to problems such as <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infertility.html" title="Infertility">infertility</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/w/Down_Syndrome_9e17.html" title="Down Syndrome">Down Syndrome</a> and premature death.)</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_Money_72ee.html" title="Blood Money">Blood Money</a>, it is revealed that 47 was the first, and only perfect human clone in existence, and that Ort-Meyer's extensive research made successful human cloning a reality. 47's DNA is said to be the basis for cloning labs all over, and nothing has yet to parallel 47; a sample of 47's <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bone_marrow.html" title="Bone marrow">bone marrow</a> is needed to produce a top-grade clone, even with all of Ort-meyer's research. While there are attempts that have come close, they have problems such as <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albinism.html" title="Albinism">albinism</a> and lifespans that cannot last longer than 18 months after <a href="../../../p/u/b/Puberty.html" title="Puberty">puberty</a>. It is mentioned however, that these clones have had their growth vastly accelerated, whereas 47 developed naturally from birth.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Agent_47.html" title="Edit section: Training">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Training</span></h3>
<p>Born on September 5, 1964, and tagged with the identity 640509-040147 (the barcode ID tattooed on the back of his head), 47 was "raised" with the other "Series IV" clones by the asylum's staff. From the very beginning, Dr. Ort-Meyer identified 47 as his most promising creation. While maturing, 47 was quiet and showed little social behavior, his only display of affection being toward a runaway laboratory rabbit he adopted (much to Ort-Meyer's displeasure). 47 also had a fairly negative relationship with the asylum staff, due to the regular medical checkups and frequent painful injections. It is documented that 47 stabbed a doctor with several needles, prompting Ort-Meyer to double the guards assigned to him.</p>
<p>Along with the other clones, 47 was trained from youth to be a tool. Instructed in the use of firearms, military hardware, and the many tools of assassination. During his training, 47 was noted for his exceptional marksmanship, as well as for attacking the asylum staff with homemade <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slingshot.html" title="Slingshot">slingshots</a>.</p>
<p>After 30 years of relentless training under the tutelage of Dr. Ort-Meyer, 47 eventually found a gap in the asylum's security. Killing a security guard and disguising himself in the guard's uniform, 47 managed to escape from the asylum. Unbeknownst to him, 47's escape was deliberately orchestrated by Ort-Meyer himself, in order to see how 47 would perform in the outside world.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Agent_47.html" title="Edit section: The Agency">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Agency</span></h3>
<p>47 is soon employed by the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Contract_Agency_%28ICA%29_4796.html" title="International Contract Agency (ICA)">International Contract Agency (ICA)</a>, a clandestine organization providing assassination and <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercenary.html" title="Mercenary">mercenary</a> services. With a lifetime of training and genetically augmented physical abilities, 47 soon rose to become the Agency's top performer. He was retired between the events of <a href="../../../c/o/d/Hitman%7E_Codename_47_806e.html" title="Hitman: Codename 47">Hitman: Codename 47</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/l/Hitman_2%7E_Silent_Assassin_6ef4.html" title="Hitman 2: Silent Assassin">Hitman 2: Silent Assassin</a>, a span of roughly two years, before returning to work there. As the events of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Hitman%7E_Contracts_bfa5.html" title="Hitman: Contracts">Hitman: Contracts</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/o/Hitman%7E_Blood_Money_1261.html" title="Hitman: Blood Money">Hitman: Blood Money</a> overlap and occur between 2004 and 2005, it is unknown what happened in the life of 47 during 2003.</p>
<p><a name="Mr._47.27s_UPC_Barcode_Tattoo" id="Mr._47.27s_UPC_Barcode_Tattoo"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Agent_47.html" title="Edit section: Mr. 47's UPC Barcode Tattoo">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mr. 47's UPC Barcode Tattoo</span></h2>
<p>The tattoo on the back of the protagonist's head 6-40509-04014-7 is actually <a href="http://www.upcdatabase.com/item.asp?upc=640509040147" class="external text" title="http://www.upcdatabase.com/item.asp?upc=640509040147" rel="nofollow">registered</a> as a product of <a href="http://www.mayaudio.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.mayaudio.com/" rel="nofollow">May Audio Marketing Inc</a>. It is unknown if there is actually any connection between the company and the game. The barcode's description is listed as Mr. 47 and its size/weight is listed as 210 pounds.</p>
<p>Also, the final number in the code (the check-number) is actually valid in respects to the rest of the code. The final number in UPC codes are determined by adding the odd-sequenced numbers, multiplying that by three, then adding that product to the sum of the even-sequenced numbers. Whatever number is needed to bring that total to a multiple of ten is the check-number. So in the case of Mr. 47's 6-40509-04014-7:</p>
<p>[3x(6+0+0+0+0+4)+(4+5+9+4+1)] = 53</p>
<p>53+7=60</p>
<p>Hence "7" is rightfully the final digit of the code.</p>
<p>At one point during the first Hitman game (for the PC), the player sees a laser scanner which is housed in a ceiling panel. Apparently the scanner reads the barcode on the back of the clones' heads.</p>
<p>The barcode is a reference for 47's birthdate and designation: 19(64), (05) 5th day of (09) the 9th month (September); Series Number (04), Class Number (01) Batch Number (47). The Mark number is gleaned from the project name: Mark IV (and that earlier clones are detailed as Marks I-III). The Batch Number is surmised from the fact that the cloned assassins he fights in Hitman:Codename 47 are designated "Agent 48".</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Agent_47.html" title="Edit section: Abilities">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Abilities</span></h3>
<p>47's unique genetic makeup gives him exceptional physical abilities, including increased strength, speed and endurance. While not quite superhuman, 47 is at the extreme end of what a human being is capable of, and may even exceed humanity's natural abilities by some degree. Notably, he can endure multiple bullets to the chest without dying, although a headshot with a rifle or a couple of shotgun blasts at close range would kill him (in <i>Codename 47</i> and <i><a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_Money_72ee.html" title="Blood Money">Blood Money</a></i> it is shown that he wears a <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flak_jacket.html" title="Flak jacket">flak jacket</a> for protection). He is also able to easily outrun everyone else in the games, and is strong enough to wield a <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minigun.html" title="Minigun">minigun</a> as a man-portable weapon, albeit fairly awkwardly. Finally, 47 is very athletic; able to mantle over ledges, climb pipes, and jump across balconies.</p>
<p>47 also has been rigorously trained in the art of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassination.html" title="Assassination">assassination</a>. He has an extensive knowledge of murder and of the means to accomplish it. He is skilled in all forms of <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firearm.html" title="Firearm">firearm</a> use, and has nearly perfect aim, limited only by the mechanical inaccuracy inherent in any firearm he uses. This makes him an excellent sniper, as well as a peerless pistol marksman. He is even able to wield two guns at once without any of the usual decrease in accuracy such behavior normally creates. He is also skilled in strangulation, throat-slitting, smothering, poisoning, and the use of improvising deadly weapons from objects he finds on his missions (shovels, pool cues, fire pokers, etc.).</p>
<p>47 has shown proficiency in operating a large variety of vehicles on more than one occasion, most often being when he has to extricate himself after all objectives are accomplished. These range from common <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile.html" title="Automobile">automobiles</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/n/Van.html" title="Van">vans</a>, small watercraft such as <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorboat.html" title="Motorboat">motorboats</a>, and even aircraft like <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seaplane.html" title="Seaplane">seaplanes</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helicopter.html" title="Helicopter">helicopters</a>.</p>
<p>In <i>Blood Money</i>, 47 is also shown to be highly skilled in <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hand-to-hand_combat.html" title="Hand-to-hand combat">hand-to-hand combat</a>. He can knock out a full grown man with a single punch to the face, <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disarm.html" title="Disarm">disarm</a> an opponent at close range and shoot them with their own weapon, head-butt an enemy to stun them, and seize people from behind to use as <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_shields.html" title="Human shields">human shields</a>.</p>
<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Warning</a>: <i>Solution details follow.</i></b></div>
<p>While he is more than capable of using brute force to mow down a couple dozen armed men, 47 is also an extremely creative individual, capable of devising cunning and stealthy ways of eliminating his targets without creating a commotion. Notable creative hits include locking a target in a <a href="../../../s/a/u/Sauna.html" title="Sauna">sauna</a> to stimulate a heart condition and cause <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiac_arrest.html" title="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</a>, disguising himself as a chef and poisoning a target's meal by improperly preparing his <a href="../../../f/u/g/Fugu.html" title="Fugu">fugu</a> sushi, disguising himself as a doctor and sabotaging a surgical operation on a target, and replacing a prop <a href="../../../m/a/u/Mauser_C96_80c9.html" title="Mauser C96">Mauser C96</a> handgun with a real one during a break in an opera rehearsal, causing an actor to unknowingly kill the target.</p>

<p>47 also appears to have a rudimentary understanding of several foreign languages (based on the fact the player perceives subtitles during several conversations between individuals speaking non-English languages), but not to the point where he is conversant in any of them.</p>
<p>Finally, 47 is a master of disguises, often donning the uniforms of dispatched guards or civilians in order to blend in and infiltrate an enemy stronghold without being detected. The fact that he is a multi-racial clone aids him in this considerably. He may not look exactly like the people of the country his target is in, though he usually looks close enough to not arouse too much suspicion (at least from a distance).</p>

<p>Due to his exceptional talents, 47 is usually given the Agency's largest and most difficult assignments. 47 completes all of his assignments with unwavering accuracy, fulfilling all of his objectives and always eliminating his targets without hesitation. 47's stealth and cunning are legendary; he is regarded in the criminal community as an <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_legend.html" title="Urban legend">urban legend</a>, and few even know what he looks like.</p>

<p>47 is completely bald. No hair grows on his head, although whether this is from natural <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hair_loss.html" title="Hair loss">hair loss</a> or genetic design is unknown. The only visible sign of hair on his body are his eyebrows, which are brown. A barcode tattoo is prominently displayed on the back of his head (though it is never noticed by NPCs) containing information about his date of creation and clone series identification number (640509-040147). 47 also has rather piercing, blue eyes. His facial features are quite imposing, with a long face, large cheekbones, prominent brow, and recessed forehead. 47 is also taller than average, although not exceptionally so (based on information in <i>Hitman: Blood Money</i>, he is slightly over 6 feet tall).</p>
<p>It has been stated by the game's developers that 47 was designed to physically resemble <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bateson_ecc8.html" title="David Bateson">David Bateson</a>, the veteran stage, film and voice actor who has provided his voice in every "Hitman" game yet. His facial appearance has moderately altered in between the first three games, however Hitman looks dramatically and obviously different from all the other games in <a href="../../../c/o/d/Hitman%7E_Codename_47_806e.html" title="Hitman: Codename 47">Hitman: Codename 47</a>.</p>
<p>On his missions, 47 almost always shines in a well-tailored, silk-lined black suit, with a red tie and white shirt underneath. With this suit he wears a pair of black leather gloves. <i>Blood Money</i> reveals that this ensemble costs $5000, or it is possible that the Agency has the cleaners they send retrieve a suit left in the field while deducting $5000 from his pay. Thus, the actual price of his outfit is unknown. The exceptions to this outfit rule are the Columbian missions from Codename:47 and the Mid-Eastern missions from Silent Assassin. In Codename, he wears guerilla camoflauge in the jungle, while in Silent Assassin he wears a common black outfit, complete with turban.</p>

<p>Although 47 owns a large and varied <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arsenal.html" title="Arsenal">arsenal</a>, he is well-known for carrying a couple of 'trademark' <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weapon.html" title="Weapon">weapons</a>.</p>
<p><a name="The_Silverballer" id="The_Silverballer"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Agent_47.html" title="Edit section: The Silverballer">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Silverballer</span></h3>
<p>The Silverballer is a <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semi-automatic_firearm.html" title="Semi-automatic firearm">semi-automatic</a> .45 caliber <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handgun.html" title="Handgun">handgun</a> (<a href="../../../a/c/p/ACP_%28ammunition%29_4fd6.html" title="ACP (ammunition)">.45 ACP</a> ammunition). In the original <i>Hitman: Codename 47</i>, 47 could carry one Silverballer (here referred to as '<a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardballer.html" title="Hardballer">Hardballer</a>' instead, and also seemed to have no real significance for 47: it could be purchased like any other weapon at the start of a mission). To hold two, he would have to pick up another first. In later installments, 47 would mostly wield these guns two at a time, yet starting from <i>Hitman: Contracts</i> he would also be able to carry a single Baller equipped with a <a href="../../../s/u/p/Suppressor.html" title="Suppressor">suppressor</a>. An unlockable weapon in <i>Hitman: Silent Assassin</i> was two suppressed Silverballers. In <i>Hitman: Blood Money</i> 47 can extensively customize the Baller, attaching silencers, scopes, laser sights, and other upgrades to improve performance. It is also possible to modify it with an extended magazine and full-auto modification, essentially converting it into a <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machine_pistol.html" title="Machine pistol">machine pistol</a>.</p>
<p>The weapon regularly has immense firepower; a pair of them can send bodies flying several meters. The only exception is <i>Hitman: Contracts,</i> in which the power of the weapon was toned down noticeably. The earlier installments granted the weapon a seven-round magazine, but the capacity was increased to nine <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartridge_%28firearms%29.html" title="Cartridge (firearms)">cartridges</a> in <i>Hitman: Blood Money,</i> and could even be upgraded to eighteen by the choice of the player.</p>
<p>Interestingly, noting that the given name of these pistols is the <i>Silver</i>baller, the <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atomic_number.html" title="Atomic number">atomic number</a> for <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver.html" title="Silver">silver</a> is 47.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Agent_47.html" title="Edit section: The Fiber Wire">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Fiber Wire</span></h3>
<p>The Fiber Wire is a form of <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garrotte.html" title="Garrotte">garrotte</a>, consisting of a synthetic cord attached to two handles that is used for <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strangling.html" title="Strangling">strangulation</a>. 47 almost always carries this weapon because it will not trigger metal detectors and ensures a quiet, swift kill when properly employed. Typically, 47 will approach his target from behind and slip the weapon over its neck, crushing the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trachea.html" title="Trachea">windpipe</a> and slicing the <a href="../../../j/u/g/Jugular_vein.html" title="Jugular vein">jugular vein</a> with a swift jerk, then wrestle the victim to the ground. (In the latest installment it was also used to strangle victims from above when in an elevator. He would carefully bring his trusted 'weapon', lower it to the unsuspecting target's neck and lift him up onto the top of the elevator using his exceptional strength. The target would be strangled to death by the time he is fully lifted.)</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Agent_47.html" title="Edit section: Walther WA2000 Sniper Rifle">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Walther WA2000 Sniper Rifle</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walther.html" title="Walther">Walther</a> <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walther_WA_2000_d086.html" title="Walther WA 2000">WA2000</a> is a rare <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullpup.html" title="Bullpup">bullpup</a> <a href="../../../s/n/i/Sniper_rifle.html" title="Sniper rifle">sniper rifle</a>. It comes in <a href="../../../s/u/p/Suppressor.html" title="Suppressor">suppressed</a> and non-suppressed versions.</p>
<p>The rifle was not clearly considered a trademark of 47 until <i>Hitman: Contracts</i>, in which the gun is carried as a default weapon on several missions. In the earlier games it is more of a 'weapon among others'. Even so, it is obvious that the developers thought highly of it as a weapon, to the extent that it became a staple weapon early on. For <a href="../../../c/o/d/Hitman%7E_Codename_47_806e.html" title="Hitman: Codename 47">Codename 47</a>, the WA2000 was featured prominently in the rendered artwork assiociated with that game. In <a href="../../../s/i/l/Hitman_2%7E_Silent_Assassin_6ef4.html" title="Hitman 2: Silent Assassin">Hitman 2: Silent Assassin</a>, there was a customized version of the weapon simply called the "Custom Rifle" alongside the normal WA2000.</p>
<p>The model carried by Agent 47 in <i>Hitman: Blood Money</i> is a special carbon-fiber and polymer model that can be broken down and stowed in a special foil-lined briefcase so it can defeat metal detectors. It can also be upgraded with suppressors, variant ammo, scopes, etc.</p>

<li>Syringe Sedative: Contains a powerful tranquilizer, which can knock out a full-grown man in an instant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally an alternative to the fibre wire, the syringe can be used much quicker than the fiber wire. For instance, you can run up to a target from behind and quickly deploy the syringe, while the fiber wire requires a much slower and stealthier movement. They can also be used to inject their contents into food or drinks to sedate or poison targets indirectly. The sedative syringe is essentially used to avoid unnecessary casualties in order to perform a perfect stealth mission. The Syringe was first introduced in Hitman: Contracts, appearing in its sedative form. 47 was equipped with one by default, which changed to two of each type in Hitman: Blood Money.</p>

<p>A small, undetectable mine (the acronym RU-AP stands for Remote Undetectable Anti Personnel Mine) that can be placed in certain areas, or dropped on the ground. It has a detonator that can be used in a certain range. The range can be increased by buying an upgraded detonator before the start of a mission.</p>
<p>The RU-AP was not introduced until <i>Hitman: Blood Money</i>. Although several types of explosives (remote controlled included) were featured in the earlier games, they were not quite as versatile, primarily designed to be used on vehicles. In <i>Blood Money</i>, the mine is carried on all missions, and can be placed in briefcases, or in specific points of interest on the map (such as a chandelier in the Paris Opera House) to trigger unfortunate "accidents". The RU-AP mine can also be strategically dropped anywhere on the map. Intelligent <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-player_character.html" title="Non-player character">NPC's</a> will pick them up and transport them to the nearest security checkpoint, having recognized them as an unidentified object that doesn't belong there. If properly hidden, or at least out of sight, the mine can be a great distraction or direct killing tool.</p>

<p>On the surface, 47 is quite introverted, cold and callous, and seems able to feel compassion only toward himself. He will kill anyone should they fall on his hitlist. He is able to remain calm, controlled, and emotionally detached even in the tightest situations, and always speaks in a formal, controlled manner (with the exception of <a href="../../../b/l/o/Hitman%7E_Blood_Money_1261.html" title="Hitman: Blood Money">Hitman: Blood Money</a>, where he shouted "Bitch!" at Diana when she forcibly injected him with a needle from behind). While 47 is not without charm should the situation call for it (notably to manipulate others in order to get closer to his target), in his natural setting he is quite reserved, and normally speaks only when absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>One of his mottoes appears to have become "Trust no one." His behavior toward others is generally cold and suspicious, with a few exceptions.</p>
<p>He demonstrates a high degree of devotion to Father Padre Vittorio, the Sicilian priest who gave him shelter in <i>Silent Assassin</i>, going so far as to rescue Vittorio from Russian mafia kingpin Sergei Zavorotko even though there was no monetary reward in it for him. He also seems to place at least some trust in his Agency contact, Diana Burnwood, such as being willing to meet her face-to-face, but he is most likely armed. However, on rare occasions, he can also show a surprisingly warm side to his personality. When being raised by Dr Ort-Meyer he befriended a rabbit, and even held a small funeral service after its death. A recurring character in the series, he has shown Lei Ling/Mei Ling (her name was changed to "Mei Ling" in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Hitman%7E_Contracts_bfa5.html" title="Hitman: Contracts">Hitman: Contracts</a>, for unknown reasons) considerable forbearance, rescuing from sex slavery in the first two games, in the second game despite there being no benefit in doing so (in the third game he recollected the events of the first game; as such it might be more accurate to say he has only rescued Lei Ling twice). In <i>Hitman: Blood Money</i> he picks up a small canary during his travels. Though 47 cares after the canary, he swiftly kills it in one of the last cut scenes in order to have quiet and the surprise advantage when he thought he was being attacked. He kills the bird with a look (albeit brief) of regret.</p>

<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<p>With regard to <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morality.html" title="Morality">morality</a>, 47 can put his <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moral.html" title="Moral">morals</a> aside at any given time, and appears willing to kill anyone the Agency offers him a contract on; as he says in Hitman: Blood Money: "I can do whatever I'm paid to." While he has been known to show mercy to those he does not have specific orders to kill, he has also demonstrated a willingness to kill innocent civilians if the Agency specifies he should do so (for example, in a cutscene early in <i>Hitman: Contracts</i>, after interrogating a thug 47 knocks him unconscious rather than killing him outright. Yet in <i>Hitman: Blood Money</i>, a cutscene shows 47 murder a seemingly innocent mailman due to the CODE RED scribbled on the package.) In most missions, it is ultimately the player who decides whether 47 will only kill his assigned targets, or slaughter every innocent civilian in sight. Yet, the games generally encourage the player to be stealthy and to minimize civilian and law enforcement casualties. In Contracts, 47's reaction to one single gunshot wound probably indicate he has never been shot before in the official story, thus strengthening his stealthy nature.</p>
<p>In <i>Hitman 2: Silent Assassin</i>, 47 confesses his sins of murder to Father Vittorio, and performs an act of Christian symbolism by making the sign of the cross before performing his first hit coming out from retirement. These actions seem to demonstrate that Agent 47 is not entirely devoid of human emotions and ethics. He has, however, not displayed any sign of a religious bias after the events of <i>Silent Assassin,</i> and came to consider leaving such matters behind him in the end.</p>
<p>47's targets are almost always criminals or morally guilty individuals - he has gone after Columbian drug dealers, Sicilian mafiosi, Chinese triads, Japanese yakuza, Russian gunrunners, doomsday cult leaders, international terrorists and child molesters. He is usually not assigned to kill innocent individuals, the closest being an assignment to kill a private detective who had failed in his mission and ended up kidnapped by bikers.</p>
