None of this was meant to be "salesmanship" but rather an effort to describe his style, since AFAIK his cartoons are all copyright; some may be public domain, I'll check with VPL and the <i>Sun</i>.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 22:11, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi; saw your recent notice on the AFD re going to the Talk:AFD; I shouldn't have bothered responding to Omar Jack; I'm sure these guys are just trying to bait me to get me banned again; so I'm "disengaging" although will perhaps be taking the abuse I'm receiving here to <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> as it's extremely inappropriate on an AFD, especially the suggestion that I'm one of those charged in the case. No doubt there will be more attacks on me during this AFD; I've got to learn to ignore them by not responding them, but figure out where to "take them to". Not that blocking a sockpuppet or SPA has any point at all, as it doesn't hurt them one little bit and another one will pop up for whichever gets shut down. Enough intelligent people have seen this page by now to know who's what and the ridiculousness of the Skookum-bashing coming from Rich_H and Omar Jack and, soon enough, yet someone else who thinks being a sockpuppet is a way o "win friends and influence people" (if you reocgnize the phrase; it's from <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Vincent_Peale_cf4d.html" title="Norman Vincent Peale">Norman Vincent Peale</a>'s famous book by almost-that-title; a book I doubt Bornmann has read).

<p>Made a stab at a userbox; check 'er out: <a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser_WikiProject_British_Columbia_2ba5.html" title="Template:User WikiProject British Columbia">Template:User WikiProject British Columbia</a> (use {{User WikiProject British Columbia}} ). Fudged around with the colours and borders for a while, tried to use colours taken from the dogwood but wound up blue-adjusting the background, not quite happy with the bkgnd colour but it's better than the grey-transparent on the Vancouver userbox. Trying to think which stubs are needed; I think one for mountain and moutain range stubs (there'll be hundreds of these...), though the dogwood won't do for that; could use it for parks stubs, though, no? There's already a protected area stub that has a thing from the US Southwest on it; might as well replace it with the dogwood (d'ya like the dogwood? It's from Wikimedia Commons...I thumbed it down though). Trying to remember which other stubs are needed....bio-stub I guess for biographies, I'm thinking one for communities/settlements, have to think what else.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Your support of my RFA</span></h2>
<p>Hey</p>
<p>I jus noticed that you added a weak support to my <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Budgiekiller_df91.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Budgiekiller">RFA</a> but stated that the comments in the oppose gave you 'plenty of food for thought'. Besides the clear low wikispace edits which to some equate to lack of policy understanding, what else, if you don't mind me asking, were you referring to? Cheers! <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBudgiekiller_c362.html" title="User:Budgiekiller">Budgiekiller</a> 18:41, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the oppose comments speak for themselves, and you've identified exactly what the oppose commentators have been saying. I also have to agree with the commentator who noted your habit of responding to every oppose&#160;!vote on the RfA page. Taking it to the talk page (as you did here) is the better way to go. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 18:44, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>So you agree that despite making 10000 edits before vandal hunting that I haven't contributed enough content? Also, note that one oppose stated that he found it confrontational that I hadn't responded to him. Cheers for the discussion though. <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBudgiekiller_c362.html" title="User:Budgiekiller">Budgiekiller</a> 18:51, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please noted that I <i>supported</i> you (albeit hesitantly). I simply said that the oppose voters had a valid point and did not want to be dismissive of their opinion, which they're entitled to. However, you are coming across as a bit confrontational, which makes me wonder if my support was misplaced (and what you may have said if I had actually <i>opposed</i> you). <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 19:21, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Okay, well thanks for letting me know what you think. Sorry if I appear to be confrontational, no intent meant. The RFA doesn't look promising, I just can't see why so many people are suggesting I haven't made any real article edits, so I'll keep quiet for the time being, no more replying on the RFA page and see how it pans out. Cheers! <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBudgiekiller_c362.html" title="User:Budgiekiller">Budgiekiller</a> 19:39, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't want to tell you what to do, but I wouldn't worry so much about how your RfA is going. The fact is that, at present, you've got about 81% support (ignoring for the moment that it is not a simple tallying of&#160;!votes), which is certainly promising. I see you've left comments in various places with self-deprecating statements about your RfA. That kind of attitude might hurt your chances. I don't think people would object to you responding or commenting when necessary and at the appropriate place, but I can see people not liking the defeatist attitude. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 19:48, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I had looked at TPF's contributions and did see that his or her main contributions have been pretty much limited to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ex-officio_delegates_to_the_Liberal_Party_of_Canada_leadership_convention%2C_2006_465a.html" title="List of ex-officio delegates to the Liberal Party of Canada leadership convention, 2006">List of ex-officio delegates to the Liberal Party of Canada leadership convention, 2006</a>. (In fact, having discovered that list, I <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_ex-officio_delegates_to_the_Liberal_Party_of_Canada_leadership_convention%2C_2006_8dbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of ex-officio delegates to the Liberal Party of Canada leadership convention, 2006">nominated it for deletion</a> because I didn't find it all that encyclopedic.) Despite that, I didn't think it necessary to draw any attention to that fact or make any further comment in the AfD. The record pretty much speaks for itself and the applicable policies are cited. I figure the {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENot_a_ballot_89d1.html" title="Template:Not a ballot">Not a ballot</a>}} template will cause the closing admin to consider those issues that might not otherwise be apparent.

<p>Good idea; also should be placed for Titus Pollo and rascalpatrol; Randy3's been at the main page again, but between Mkdw and Langara College on the lookout as well as Bobanny and msyelf and yourself and KenWalker, I'd say it's a round-up now, ropin' in the heifer that almost got away, as it were.

<li>The AfD has been closed. It's now pretty much a one line stub, as all unsourced statements have been removed (do note that despite the many citations in the talk page and AfD, none were in the article itself).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">RfA questions</span></h2>
<p>Could you please provide a diff to where I said that? I can't recall saying that I waited for the three questions to be asked. I think what I said was I typically applied them to RfAs where <i>only</i> the three standard questions were answered. What I meant and what I probably should have clarified is that I don't apply the questions to RfAs where the nominee has been asked several optional questions. I don't want to contribute to the nominee being bombarded with optional questions. I also have been attempting to rotate the questions I'm asking (see <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_rqv2_d0d5.html" title="User:Malber/rqv2">User:Malber/rqv2</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_rqv3_b413.html" title="User:Malber/rqv3">User:Malber/rqv3</a>). I don't feel my questions should be considered <i>de facto</i> questions and my development of additional questions is an attempt to avoid this. However, I notice that <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">User:Badlydrawnjeff</a> has seen fit to adopt my <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> question which makes it difficult for me to apply <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_rqv1_6067.html" title="User:Malber/rqv1">User:Malber/rqv1</a>. Another user also asked about IAR in a slightly different context. I think there may be some community support to add this as a standard question, but I think it would be too controversial to gain widespread consensus. FYI, I also generally avoid applying this question if the nomination is already <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> in either direction. I've also tried to up my participation in voting. I hope this addresses your concerns. â€”<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_d5cd.html" title="User:Malber">Malber</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalber_7564.html" title="User talk:Malber">talk</a> <small>â€¢</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malber_b734.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malber">contribs</a>) 21:22, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

The other concern I had was that you added your not-standard standard questions to an unaccepted RfA. Doing so was contrary to the impression I believe you were trying to convey that you don't post your questions blindly on each and every RfA.</dd>
<dd>Please let me re-iterate that I do not object to asking optional questions. One of my concerns is that the habit by some editors of asking the same "optional" questions on (seemingly) every RfA effectively creates a new set of "standard" questions. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 02:09, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well I was pretty excited about my new questions and couldn't wait for a new RfA nom to try them out. I wanted to get them in before someone else posed a question, but I suppose I jumped the gun as the nominee hadn't yet accepted and eventually declined. Also please know that when I have seen an otherwise acceptable candidate give an extremely poor answer to one of my questions I have tried to coach them in the right policy direction.</dd>
<dd>I can see where my statement, "â€¦where only the three standard questions have been answered," might have been misleading. But if you read the next sentence where I say, "If I see one where other users have asked their own questions, or the questions would be redundant, I don't apply the questions." it should be more clear as to what my personal standard for asking questions is. I hope my explanation above clears this up. â€”<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_d5cd.html" title="User:Malber">Malber</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalber_7564.html" title="User talk:Malber">talk</a> <small>â€¢</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malber_b734.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malber">contribs</a>) 03:46, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>No, thank you for drawing this to my attention. I completely did not see the merger tag when I removed the AfD template. The AfD template is quite long when you look at it in the edit screen and it must have all blurred together on me.

<li>Never mind, seems that they all fell foul of an AfD anyway. I can't say I agree with the outcomes of one of the AfDs, so I may <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">be bold</a> and create a good referenced article, relating to all halls (as opposed to one for each), pointing out the notability of these halls (as I believe there is some, however it was blurred by irrelevances) and then get a concensus on merging later.

I've been blown away by the level of interest taken in my RFA and appreciate the time and energy dedicated by all the editors who have contributed to it, support, oppose and neutral alike.

<p>Hello there. I'm replying with a note here as I don't think it would be proper to reply to that point on the RFA. You noted that you thought that the WNP added an unneccesary level of bureaucracy to Wikipedia. May I ask you to expand your thoughts on that a little?

<dd>The primary concerns are that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#BUREAUCRACY" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy</a> and that special "elite" groups do more to divide than bring together. When I began participating, I thought things like CVU, Esperanza, and all these other wiki-clubs were "official" parts of wikipedia and that the editors there had some sort of privileges or extra authority. However, after I started getting into wikispace and other areas, it dawned on me that these were just groups of editors who set themselves up with an extra air of authority. I am now never surprised when these pages are nominated for deletion, and the divisiveness they cause often comes to be apparent at those times.</dd>

<dd>If certain editors want to focus on some sort of task that needs to be taken care of, like <a href="../../../c/a/t/Category%7ECategory_needed_86cb.html" title="Category:Category needed">categorizing</a> articles, taking care of <a href="../../../d/e/a/Wikipedia%7EDead-end_pages_9f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Dead-end pages">dead-end pages</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/l/Category%7EAll_articles_needing_copy_edit_09b0.html" title="Category:All articles needing copy edit">copyediting</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_articles_needing_factual_verification_4aa5.html" title="Category:Wikipedia articles needing factual verification">verifying</a> content, or taking care of the many things one can find on <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a>'s <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_Category_tracker_b0c5.html" title="User:Dragons flight/Category tracker">category tracker</a> then that's all well and good (and needed). What we don't need are special clubs that have an air of authority to do what any editor is entitled to do.

<p>Agent86: Thanks for the note. Whichever template you think is more appropriate, please go ahead and apply it. The "POV" tag is there only because it's what was on the page last night; I didn't do anything more than a straight revert. I'm hoping (hoping hoping hoping) that with a lot of patience, I can get some sort of compromise to work, both at "Runaway" and at "Hollywood North". Both are (IMHO) valid topics, and both article could also use some fleshing out. HN needs to be more than just a definition - it could benefit from a bit of history and industry reaction so that it doesn't get tagged as a "yay us" piece. "Runaway" could use some input from the "other side" - what other nations think about incentives, and why they use them. It could also use some exploration of the other reasons for productions leaving Hollywood - it's not all about cost, as there are issues such as location burnout that factor into it as well.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Discussion of content - dealing with specific cases</span></h2>
<p>I read through your prior comments on both talk pages; other than procedural concerns about the merger etc., there is a common thread of including some very specific criteria for what is notable, based on some measurable objective criteria:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>number of people involved,</li>
<li>age of organization,</li>
<li>financial size: budget, assets, transactions</li>
<li>formation: corp, trust, foundation etc.</li>
<li>scope of operations: local, regional, national, worldwide,</li>
<li>notability of activities and events,</li>
<li>notability of achievements</li>
<li>notability of sponsors, participants, spokesmen</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
This is laudable, but the logistics of avoiding the "one size fits all" concern could be insurmountable. Take the analogy of a shoe store -- it has a tiny showroom and cavernous stock rooms in order to address every anticipated length, width, color and style that they dare to carry, and of course they need to ignore very special cases as being impractical to stock, and handle them on a case-by-case basis through special orders. Another example in the extreme is the US Tax Code, which has taken on a life of its own, thus generating an entire industry of tax specialists, tax shelters, and tax bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m not opposed to being specific or putting in some hard work, in fact I generally encourage it, but the scope of the project you propose could be overwhelming and never ending. How can we provide objective guidelines without getting bogged into the minutia? Iâ€™d be willing to work with you on the project. Could we start it somewhere such as an essay where we could collectively brainstorm a bit?</p>
<p>I see four major challenges: (1) the more rules that we generate, the more debate that we will ignite about the details and this process will never end, (2) this creates another issue of maintaining the comprehensive text and protecting it from vandals, special interests, etc., (3) confusion from contradictions as the permutations begin to cross each other's purposes, and (4) creating arbitrary and rigid numeric borders for example a charity with 1,000 members might be notable but 999 is not. I've done this type of thing before with volunteer organizations, policy manuals, etc., so I'm game if you are.</p>
<p>Perhaps a simple solution is to include the folowing:</p>
<p>An organization is notable if any of the following aspects of it are notable:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>number of people involved,</li>
<li>longevity of the organization,</li>
<li>financial size: budget, assets, transactions</li>
<li>scope of operations: local, regional, national, worldwide,</li>
<li>notability of activities and events,</li>
<li>notability of achievements</li>
<li>notability of sponsors, participants</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Clearly I see flaws in this too and can imagine the oposition. But it's an idea.</p>

<li>I don't think its as complicated as you make it sound. The current merged format (assuming it's unchanged - I haven't looked at it since yesterday) is capable of setting forth an objective set of criteria. I don't think anyone's looking for an entire checklist of every permutation or a tax code. However, the guideline <i>must</i> consider that there are different criteria for different types of organization. That's probably why there were separate guidelines to begin with. In any event, I'm willing to work on it, but it's not my pressing priority at the moment, so I won't be able to sit down today and draft out anything major. It has waited this long, a few more days won't hurt. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 19:27, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Nearly everything you've restored he/she had deleted before; it's persistence from that end, and I'm still intent on my notion that the systematic replacement of "film production centre" with "location" or "production location" is a designed rebranding effort from someone serving a client who wants to undermine the Canadian film industry and, granted, its own image machine (sp. in TO's case). But the effective rewrite this guy/gal is accomplishing by persistent and repeated edits and deletes is truly aggravating, ain't it? The original opening is now the last paraphraph in the Canada and Runaway Productions section (which he/she created) and it's interesting, isn't it, that any mention of Canada, either TO or Vancouver, is omitted in the opening paragraph? People are putting up with this s**t but it's time to call someone's bluff, or rather call in the cavalry. That an American film industry advocate is attacking Vancouver's/TO's earned/adopted usages of Hollywood North (respectively) and is intent on downplaying Vancouver's/TO's role as film <i>centres</i>, downplaying them to only "locations", is clearly p.r./lobbyist firm activity. And the trail of crumbs leads in only one direction; point is that Wikipedia articles, and battles for them, have a certain newsworthiness; especially when it's an attack on the Canadian film industry <i>per se</i> in cyberspace, certainly from a rabid and even paranoiac L.A. booster if not actually a paid p.r. shill. These aren't accusations, they're observations, spun off the reality that Yellowsnow is getting his/her way through sheer doggedness, to the point where the original content/context, and which is the primary context, has become submerged in a sea of irrelevancies about Stockton and SF and the bizarre omission of any mention of Canada in the opening (now reduced to "up north"). I don't think Katherine Monk would dirty her hands by wading in her, nor anyone else who works in the industry (whom Yellowsnow would condemn for being territorial/self-promotional no doubt), such as half-a-dozen "Hollywood North veterans" I know who would certainly have an opinion, but in true biz fashion wouldn't want to be quoted on it. What's got me going on spin doctor thing here, by the way, is the resemblance of the rhetoric and word-games and outright hostility going on is reiminiscent to me of spin doctors I saw re the SHARE BC thing as well as in the course of the softwood lumber dispute and related stuff. It's a particular mix of invective/confrontation and the rejigging of particular words and phrases that stinks of the pros; rabid fans would either be fanatically detailed with good references, or rely only on the confrontation and paranoia....<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 08:30, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Sorry, I wasn't online earlier. I really had nothing to do with this AfD other than relisting it to get further discussion.

<p>Thanks anyway&#160;:) I'm not going to cause more work for other editors over an article which was added with a stack of others which were all deleted (seems like promotion), just that I could see the hammer falling without further discussion. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 09:59, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I also am new to this process. I don't know why there is a problem with this article. There doesn't seem to be any substance to the criticisms, at least not under the rules. So I don't know how to respond to them. What about the article is makes in inappropriate under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#SOAP" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#SOAP</a>? No one has said. All the page does is have criticism and response.</p>
<p>I also don't know where to discuss this. You deleted a lot of content, and didn't put it back on the discussion page.

I'm going to ask that you stop DELETING wiki content that this editor has provided. Please stop reverting my edits. I have cited the references and you keep removing the content which damages Wikipedia. You are removing content simply because you don't agree with it and NOT because it doesn't have references. If you don't have the logic or the argument or the sources to provide your OWN counter-argument, then please do not delete mine.

<li>As unwarranted as your "warning" may be, I will leave it put as a record of the baselessness of your claim. Your unwarranted accusations of vandalism and warnings without a basis in fact can, in and of themselves, constitute personal attacks and vandalism. Please kindly show me the diffs where I made the personal attack you allege. As for the block after your violation of the 3RR, your actions were amply set forth in the report by Ckatz and applied after consideration by an admin. The record clearly speaks for itself.

<p>It has been proposed that the following criteria be removed from this guideline: 1. The commercial organization is listed on ranking indices of important companies produced by well-known and independent publications.3 2. The commercial organization's share price is used to calculate one or more of the major managed stock market indices.4 Note this is not the same as simply being listed on a stock market. Nor is it the same as being included in an index that comprises the entire market. The broader or the more specialized the index, the less notability it establishes for the company.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Redirects on Les Miserables Characters</span></h2>
<p>I (and others) have been working on getting the characters their own entries. Many notable novels have entries on their characters, and there is no reason Les Miserables should be an exception that I can see. It is true that the entry on Javert once redirected to the novel's entry, but that was before an entry was created. Comparing it to the Valjean redirect doesn't make sense to me as that only means an entry for Valjean should be created. (And I plan to, if no one else does first.)</p>
<p>If there is some reason that the characters from the novel, Les Miserables, don't justify their own entries, I would like this explained. Especially when it comes to the primary antagonist.</p>
<p>Thank you. I also modified the redirect you created on Monsieur Madeline, as I agree that the pseudonym alone doesn't justify an entry, but it should redirect to the future entry on Jean Valjean, and the information should be included in that entry.</p>
