	    <p>The section entitled <i>The Age of Aquarius according to Spiritual astrology</i> does not seem to fit with the rest of the article. It repeats content given earlier and seems to be a promotion of a particular society. I suggest the section is removed. Any thoughts to the contrary? <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcturus_dd0a.html" title="User:Arcturus">Arcturus</a> 23:18, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

I have rewrited the article combining the old texts. Hope it is fine. English is not my mothertongue so it is possible some sentences might not be so clear as I intended. The section entitled <i>The Age of Aquarius according to Spiritual astrology</i> was not intended as promotion but to present notions (commonly accepted by studious astrologers) backed on one of the proeminent schools, through all 20th century, of astrology in the western countries. Calculus of <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">Astrology</a> are based on <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronomy.html" title="Astronomy">Astronomy</a> motions of sun and planets, etc, which require study and lots of maths! The Astrology (Solar) Ages are based on Astrology calculus, if one does not accept Astrology there is no point for this person talking about the Age of Aquarius or any other since it only can be identified, targeted and its effects described through Astrology notions and calculus.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Talk%7EAge_of_Aquarius_7e7f.html" title="Edit section: about Common belief">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">about Common belief</span></h2>
<p>I removed the initial line:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>This article refers to a common belief, to read about the song or album; see <a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquarius_Let_the_Sunshine_In_3c9a.html" title="Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In">Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In</a>, or the album <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Age_of_Aquarius_%28album%29_a942.html" title="The Age of Aquarius (album)">The Age of Aquarius</a>.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>As it is stated in the article, the Ages work also as astronomical units: a few <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constellations.html" title="Constellations">constellations</a> in the sky - with distance measured and borders among them defined by the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Astronomical_Union_54bc.html" title="International Astronomical Union">International Astronomical Union</a> in the 20th century - through which the Sun 'moves' (due to the movement of <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precession.html" title="Precession">precession</a> of the Earth); on the other hand, according to Astrology each time the Sun is moving through a constellation there is a related meaning in human and world development (the movement and the effect both make possible to say there is an Age).</p>
<p>If one does not understand <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronomy.html" title="Astronomy">Astronomy</a> or disregard <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">Astrology</a> it is one's problem; but we must not hide the fact that there are groups of stars, each group in an amount of space as seen from Earth (defined as constellations in astronomy) and there is a kind of movement of the Sun through some of them, giving the name to the Ages. On the other hand, its effects are studied by astrology, giving meaning to the Ages.</p>
<p>Yet there are different calculus for the starting of the Age since the borders between constellations are an artificial delimitation and, on the other hand, these calculus to Astrologers may also depend on the evaluation of a real starting point of the effects of the Age upon the Earth and its life forms, which may not agree with the standard (astonomically defined) delimitations of constellations.</p>
<p>This means the Age itself is not a belief but a fact (since the Sun nowadays 'moves' through the constellation Pisces and later on, as explained in the article, will move through Aquarius); the existence of effects from this movement and its related ages is interpreted as:</p>
<ul>
<li>according to those who disregard astrology: <i>belief</i> of those who study it;</li>
<li>according to those who study astrology: <i>ignorance</i> of those who disregard it.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the removed line I put the internal links in the section "See also". --<a href="../../../g/a/l/User%7EGalaazV_bd81.html" title="User:GalaazV">GalaazV</a> 13:13, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.S. - I wrote earlier:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Astrology (Solar) Ages are based on Astrology calculus, if one does not accept Astrology there is no point for this person talking about the Age of Aquarius or any other since it only can be identified, targeted and its effects described through Astrology notions and calculus.</li>
</ul>
<p>It might seem a contradiction, but as I see it, although the Ages are named through Astronomy (calculus based on astronomical elements and motions), the notion of Age can only be fullfilled or acquire a real meaning if understood as time periods affecting us on earth and not the constellations by themselves in the sky, which can only be known through Astrology; so, all in all, I still think these Ages have to be seen as Astrological references (time periods).</p>
<p>Astronomy is accepted as an official branch of the «positivist-reducionist science» and Astrology is not accepted. Yet, astrology, which always included astronomy, is some thousands years older, crossing civilizations, than this last centuries (XIX-XX) accepted science and it requires a mind and conception of man and universe far beyond the limited materialistic-reducionist of our present civilization. Many may regard these wider conceptions as illusion, but the one's who study it can understand the how and why the illusion is among the majority who reduce their perspectives - views - knowledge (naming it 'nonsense' without further investigation). This was well explained in brief words by Neal Grossman (PhD History and Philosophy of Science),<a href="http://www.noetic.org/publications/review/issue61/r61_Grossman.html" class="external text" title="http://www.noetic.org/publications/review/issue61/r61_Grossman.html" rel="nofollow">Why NDE Evidence is Ignored</a>, in 2002 (related to the <i>Near Death Experiences</i> but also correct to apply to this subject here):</p>
<p>«&#160;<b>Resistance to paradigm change</b>: Ever since the publication of Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, the concept of a paradigm has been a familiar, useful, albeit sometimes controversial, tool. The concept of a paradigm helps us considerably in understanding scientific revolutions, when dramatic changes occur involving deep-rooted assumptions about how things are or how things must be. All academics matriculate within the context of a specific discipline that trains its practitioners to think in terms of the currently operating paradigm. Once the operating paradigm has been internalized in the mind of the individual, other competing paradigms appear wrong and/or foolish.</p>
<p>To one who has internalized a paradigm, this way of approaching things appears to be right, reasonable, objective, and sensible. The paradigm itself is rarely questioned. It is the very water in which the academic philosopher swims, which is why it is so difficult for one who is immersed in the paradigm to see it as a paradigm, rather than as the way things "must be." Someone operating out of a different paradigm appears to be out of touch with reality, irrational, and so on.»</p>

<p>The information giving the starting date of the Age of Aquarius says it will start around 2600 AD. However, this is in direct contradiction with the Age of Pisces article. Information from the Astrological Ages article says that each age lasts 2,100 years, and that the Age of Pisces began in the 5th century. Fine, that agrees with the 2600 estimate. However, the article on the Age of Pisces says that it began in 100 BC. That would place the dawning of the Age of Aquarius right about... now. So which is it? I'm confused. 172.140.6.240 06:04, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Interestingly ages of Pisces, though two fish, brings to mind the Christian fish symbol. The age before was the age of the ram (and fire), which brings to mind the even older religions of sacrifice on the fire. Not sure if this has been gone in to in more detail.</p>

<p>Redirecting to <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrological_age.html" title="Astrological age">Astrological ages</a> article since there is not enough data to separate article. On the other hand, users can read in the same article about how astrolgical ages, as the Age of Aquarius, are determined.</p>
