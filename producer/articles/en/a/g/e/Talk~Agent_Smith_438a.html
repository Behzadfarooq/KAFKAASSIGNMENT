<dd>There's a certain irony to what he says: "I can <i>taste</i> your <i>stink</i>, and every time I do, I fear that I have somehow been <i>infected</i> by it." After all, he winds up infecting all of the Matrix himself.

<p>One thing I noticed about Smith that's definitely not important enough to go in the article, but I thought I'd mention it here because it's kind of amusing - In all the fights Agent Smith get into, he starts out not fighting very intensely, but then, early on in the fight, gets his sunglasses broken, and <i>that's</i> when he starts fighting all out.

<p>I didnt know where to put this, so dont get mad at me but there should be more on the specifics of smith's deletion.....it just kinda skips over WHY hes destroyed when he absorbes neo....like how the matrix could delete him because neo was connected to the source and thus so was smith after the absorption......thats the part ive had the most trouble finding information on and its totally ignored in the article...someone other than me should revise it</p>
<dl>
<dd>the reason that you are having so much trouble finding information on that particular question is very likely the same reason that it is not covered well in this article. that reason being, that it wasn't explained well in any source that can be considered canon. all we know is that, neo goes to the machine city, he meets with the deus ex, they make a deal and noe gets plugged in, back in the matrix, neo meets smith, they fight in a rather dragon ball z maner, neo gets thrown into the ground is looks rather defeated while smith is prepairing for the final blow, smith says something that doesn't sound right, overwrites neo, the new smith says that its finished, then back in the machine city, deus ex zapps ol' neo's body, and back in the matrix all the smiths turn into white light and everything is back to normal. its never really explained as to what exactly deus ex did to neo, or what neos plan was, or if deus just jumped on an opertunity, or what. many theories of an unencyclipedic nature cluttered this page up pretty badly until most of them were removed. sorry to be long winded, but long story short, its not on there because we don't know, untill "the matrix: tying up lose ends" comes out, then your guess is as good as anyone's. --<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManwithbrisk_2534.html" title="User:Manwithbrisk">Manwithbrisk</a> 00:40, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some fan you are. It's from the scene in the hallways just before Neo meets the Archtitect. But it does stink - my personal favorite image of him would be when he's approaching Neo in the Burly Brawl scene. Hbdragon88 07:16, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does anyone want to mention the Path of Neo "Monster Mega-smith" ending? Even as a small note? i agree the meag smith monster was rubbish perhaps by allowing u 2 run at him then fly etc it probably could have been a lot harder big dissapointment in the matrix path of neo game</p>

<dd>1'd guess the Matrix was defragged, then restored and the humans were all put back into their real bodies for a moment (Which is why the programs were left inside the matrix while the defrag happened) and re-introduced into the program quickly with their "digital self-images" and their minds erased of the weird events. It's as good as any guess. <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajinPalgen_53bb.html" title="User:MajinPalgen">MajinPalgen</a> 20:11, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I don't think it's explicitedly stated anywhere (except possibly in the Matrix Online, which I've never played.) But judging from the fact that the process would involving <i>rewriting their brains,</i> my guess is that it'd be irreversible. If I recall correctly, in Revolutions, there was a scene talking about all kinds of damage to Banes head when he was being examined by Maggie. Coupled with Neo's quote "It felt like dying," I'd say the overall intent was to imply that the original mind is basically dead.--<a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFoot_Dragoon_9bb4.html" title="User:Foot Dragoon">Foot Dragoon</a> 06:46, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Should it be mentioned that Smith's "everything that has a beginning has an end, Neo" is exactly the same as what the Oracle said to Neo once? In my opinion that's why he got up, the fact that Smith was somehow being slightly controlled by the Oracle somehow made him realise thats how to defeat him - from the inside...</p>

<dd>OK, so let's start by taking some of them out... What's with that one saying the agents are possibly former "the Ones"? That's absurd. Well, <i>It's a theory</i>, you say.

<dd>I can only agree. The weasel words really need to go. Too much work has gone into an article over 3 years old for it to be degraded by such phrases. Work on it and the tags can go and the article be greatly improved.

<p>Someone removed Smith from the 'fictional personifications of evil' category, saying that "This character does not seem to act as a embodiment of evil as a concept, or as a metiphorical symbol of evil, although this is debatable." Does anyone besides me totally disagree with this? Noneofyourbusiness 23:10, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I totally disagree with you. I previously removed this article from that category (it had been vastly over-populated), because I think that Smith <b>isn't</b> a 'personification of evil'. He doesn't represent evil as a concept, which is what would be required as a personification. If you disagree, it might be worth saying <b>why</b> you disagree... <a href="../../../w/i/b/User%7EWibbble_d9eb.html" title="User:Wibbble">Wibbble</a> 23:28, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Because he's the archetypal villain and representation of evil in the Matrix films, just as Neo is the archetypal hero and representation of humanity. Smith is the personification of an all-consuming hatred and destructive (ultimately self-destructive) impulse that would eradicate both humans and Machines. I agree with you that the category has been somewhat overpopulated with characters that are just villains and not personifications of evil, but Smith is <i>the</i> figure of evil in the Matrix. Noneofyourbusiness 17:41, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But he isn't really a <i>symbol</i> of evil, just a villain. And he's sympathetic, in his way-confused and angry. GuesssWho 07:37, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Talk%7EAgent_Smith_438a.html" title="Edit section: Original research">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Original research</span></h2>
<p>I've tagged this article with the {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}} tag and the {{<a href="../../../o/r/i/Template%7EOriginal_research_d526.html" title="Template:Original research">original research</a>}} tag. The reasons are that the article is written as if most of the information, except for the LOTR joke and the Directors' quote, was compiled from just watching the three Matrix movies. I think that qualifies as Original Research. I mean, anything other than a description of the movies' plots should include sources, such as character interpretations, analyses, and descriptions. For example, check out the following excerpts from the <a href="../../../a/g/e/Agent_smith.html#Stylistic_genealogy" title="Agent smith">Stylistic genealogy</a> section:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"The look and manner of Smith and his fellow Agents <b>seem to be</b> drawn from the common pool of paranoia and American pop culture. One influence <b>appears to be</b> the popular image of federal law enforcement agents as ruthlessly efficient automata who carry out their duties with cold precision and General American accents."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The phrases in <b>bold</b> are not objective, as are the determinations of the character's symbolism, and therefore should be verified and referenced with an outside reliable source, and not from one editor who just saw the movie. Another example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"In addition, the name "Smith" <b>is explicitly attributed (as "IS 5416" on the license plate of Smith's car in Reloaded) to the Book of Isaiah 54:16 from the Old Testament</b>:</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>In creating such a program to carry out menial tasks, <b>the Machines lay the foundations for their own destruction, a direct parallel to the creation of AI by humankind</b>.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>And finally, another example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The two later films in the series make much of the dialectical opposition of Smith and Neo. Smith is pitiless and single-minded, focused on finality, conformity and "inevitability." As such, <b>Smith represents determinism</b>. By contrast, Neo, with his unpredictable, emotional, human nature, <b>represents unbounded free will and the power of choice</b>. Neo's solitary role as The One is contrasted by Smith, who, by replicating himself, becomes 'the many'. When Neo asks the Oracle about Smith, the Oracle explains that Smith is Neo's opposite and his negative.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This information is not explicitly expressed in the movie, it is actually a determination of the editor. Although the license plate does appear in the movie, the explanation of the plate's link to the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Isaiah_06a3.html" title="Book of Isaiah">Book of Isaiah</a> may not be interpreted in the same way by other users. Also, the interpretation of the characters' representation is subjective. Therefore, for the sake of verifiability, original research, and NPOV guidelines, any determinations, assertions and interpretations should be referenced with an outside source.</p>
<p>If you disagree, let's talk about it. Post what you think. - <a href="../../../m/t/m/User%7EMtmelendez_3e38.html" title="User:Mtmelendez">Mtmelendez</a> 20:04, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The following are suggestions for references:</p>
<ul>
<li>Citing interviews with the Wachowski brothers, whether it be in DVD special features, magazines, news channles, etc.</li>
<li>Citing interviews with the actors and producers</li>
<li>Citing verifiable analyses made by movie critics, experts, etc.</li>
<li>Specify the location of the source (i.e. where the interview can be found, news article date and author; movie review weblink, etc.)</li>
