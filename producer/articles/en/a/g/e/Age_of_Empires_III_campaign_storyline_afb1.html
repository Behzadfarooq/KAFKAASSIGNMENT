<p>Set in around 1650, the first act of the single-player campaign begins with the player in the role of Morgan Black of the <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knights_of_Saint_John_1137.html" title="Knights of Saint John">Knights of Saint John</a>, defending the last stronghold on <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malta.html" title="Malta">Malta</a> from Sahin "The Falcon" of the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> (in an extremely contrived telling of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Siege_of_Malta_69ca.html" title="Great Siege of Malta">Great Siege of Malta</a>). The player must light a signal fire to call in supporting <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavalry.html" title="Cavalry">cavalry</a> led by Morgan's superior, Alain Magnan, who fend off the Turks. Morgan and Alain drive the Ottomans from Malta, and when they detonate Ottoman weapon caches in the nearby caves, they discover a hidden stone library telling the story of the "Lake of the Moon" and the secret society called the "Circle of Ossus" who seek it out. Morgan travels to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_World_a493.html" title="New World">New World</a> seeking the lake, but on his way he experiences a small intermezzo with Lizzie, a pirate queen who attacks Morgan's fleet. At <a href="../../../y/u/c/Yucatan.html" title="Yucatan">Yucatan</a>, the player runs into Sahin once again, and must destroy the Ottoman fort, though Sahin claims he just wants to keep the "The Circle of Ossus" from reaching the lake (though he says this when he is on the shore with a few Janissaries while he is watching Morgan's flagship about to land shortly before fleeing into the jungle, so Morgan does not know this). While Morgan's troops are resting and he is being briefed that the few Turks who survived the night battle and the mopping-up in the morning were captured by Spanish troops, a scout is chased and killed by a pure white leopard before Morgan's aid (a Highlander) kills it. Morgan explains that he saw this kind of beast on the stone library. Morgan Black and his men continue into the rainforests to protect the Aztec temples from the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spanish</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conquistadors.html" title="Conquistadors">conquistadors</a>, and Morgan finds a large stone map in the village which directs him to <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a> where the Lago Del Luna (The Lake of the Moon) resided. When a <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane.html" title="Hurricane">hurricane</a> drives Morgan and his men off course to Lizzie's stronghold on Cuba, she promises to transport the Knights of Saint John to Florida if Morgan and his men prove themselves by helping the beleaguered settlement. Once at Florida, the player meets up with Alain Magnan, and while Alain travels inland, Morgan is assigned the task to capture the Spanish treasure galleys. In the following battle the Spanish commander, Delgado, and most of his men are killed and the rest either retreating or captured, Morgan Black finds Sahin and the remaining Turks in the holding areas of the seized ships. Alain gives the order to kill Sahin and the <a href="../../../i/n/c/Inca.html" title="Inca">Inca</a> prisoners. Sahin tells Morgan that the "Circle of Ossus" believe the lake to be the "<a href="../../../f/o/u/Fountain_of_Youth_9791.html" title="Fountain of Youth">Fountain of Youth</a>" which grants eternal life, and that he has been tricked by Alain, who is the actual leader of the circle. Seeing Alain with Boneguard, the Circle's elite soldiers, it was enough to convince Morgan that Alain had betrayed the Knights of St. John. With fire ships and a great cannon, the player sets out to destroy the "Lake of the Moon". As the story ends, Sahin knew that the Europeans would make empires in the New World. He also knew that the Ottomans were relics of the past as well as the Knights of St. John. Sahin returns to <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>. Lizzie had lost all of her Spanish gold, and it will be several years before she really forgave Morgan. The female narrator (Amelia Black, whose story is told in Act III, Steel), a descendant of Morgan Black, tells that Lizzie might be her ancestor as well, as she has the temper of a pirate. After Lizzie returns to Cuba, Morgan begins drinking but his canteen is empty. He looks at the ruined Fountain. He then walks to the water's edge as a leaf falls. Was the Fountain's water really important and special? The Circle will return to find out.</p>
<p>During Act I, instead of playing as one of the civilizations normally available, the player plays as the Knights of Saint John. The civilization is modeled after the Spanish civilization, except without being able to train <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skirmishers.html" title="Skirmishers">skirmishers</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musketeers.html" title="Musketeers">musketeers</a>, or any <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artillery.html" title="Artillery">artillery</a> except <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortar_%28weapon%29.html" title="Mortar (weapon)">mortars</a> and their unique unit: Hoop Thrower, which are available in the fortress age. The Knights of Saint John can never advance to the Industrial Age, and have the same <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architecture.html" title="Architecture">architecture</a> as the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portugal.html" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a>, Spanish, and Ottomans. Their home city is Valetta, the capital of both ancient and modern Malta. Their flag is a simple white cross on a blue background.</p>

<p>In around 1757, Morgan's grandson, John Black, and his Native friend Kanyenke are on their way to Black's uncle's town, as he has called for help. When the town is saved from <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherokee.html" title="Cherokee">Cherokee</a> attacks, they attack the Chrerokee war camps and try arranged a peace settlement. When they reach the village, they are attacked by British who also take the town. They planned a counter attack and found that John's uncle Stuart was kidnapped. John concluded that the Circle of Ossus had returned. Kanyenke realized that his sister, Nonahkee was in danger too. They save the <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iroquois.html" title="Iroquois">Iroquois</a> village where Kanyenke's sister lives in New England, and it was revealed that she and John were secretly in love. John's army fights alongside France against Warwick in the <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_Years%27_War_9fe6.html" title="Seven Years' War">Seven Years' War</a>. They meet the English <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">Colonel Washington</a>, who says Warwick is a traitor to England. Later they defeat them at the Great Lakes where they have Boneguard stationed there. John finds the corpse of his uncle there, with his head on a long stick stuck into the ground. After then, the voyage is too dangerous for Kanyenke's sister. John and Kanyenke travel across the Great Plains and build an army at some Lakota villages. They must gain the respect of the Great Plains Indians before all their chiefs are killed. The duo then steal resources from wagons heading towards Warwick's fort. They see a <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russian</a> army traveling through the mountains directed by the Boneguard and realise this was the Circle's idea: to conquer the New World with the British and French at war and the colonies defenseless (the exact details of the deal brokered with the Russians remains unknown, and technically the Russians and the French were in a loose alliance, as both were fighting Prussia in Europe). Helpful miners cast down bridges to redirect the Russians while John places explosives on the mountain. He is confronted by Warwick but manages to detonate the explosives, blowing up part of the mountain and starting an avalanche. The Russian army is buried in the snow, along with John and Warwick. At springtime Kanyenke returns to his village. Life goes on for the Iroquois. However, Kanyenke's sister gives birth to John's son. Even though the Russians were gone, other white men would follow. But until then, Kanyenke will help raise his sister's son, Nathaniel. The story of Nathaniel is shown in <a href="../../../t/h/e/Age_of_Empires_III%7E_The_War_Chiefs_59d8.html" title="Age of Empires III: The War Chiefs">Age of Empires III: The War Chiefs</a>.</p>
<p>During Act II a player plays as John Black's <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercenaries.html" title="Mercenaries">Mercenaries</a>, which is modeled strongly after the German Civilization with German units and mercenaries. However its architecture is the same as the British, Dutch and French except for houses which are modeled on German and Russian architecture. John Black's Mercenaries' home city is Boston.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Empires_III_campaign_storyline_afb1.html" title="Edit section: Act III: Steel">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Act III: Steel</span></h4>
<p>Amelia Black, granddaughter of John Black, says that now comes her part of the story. It is now roughly 1819, and she owns a <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railroad_company.html" title="Railroad company">railroad company</a> left by her father Nathaniel, The Falcon Company (possibly in honour of the Turk, Sahin), which wants to build the new railroads in the USA.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the fortune given by the British and Americans from John Black's sacrifice had dried up. They must build Trading Posts at a number of sites to get the contract. One is already built, but the enemies also have one which must be destroyed.</p>
<p>After that, Amelia and the leader of the work, Major Cooper, come into a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort.html" title="Fort">fort</a> that is attacked by the Mexicans. There are not many resources in the region, so the player must build Trading Posts, improve them, and choose which resource they shall gather.</p>
<p>Amelia meets a <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">French</a> prospector called Pierre Beaumont, who tells her he has a mine in the North that she can mine for half of what they dig up. When they come to it Amelia's granduncle, Kanyenke comes with a group of Major Cooper's men and tells Amelia that Beaumont leads the Circle of Ossus. Beaumont escapes into the caves and they hunt for him. When he is gone, they seek and find a map showing the way.</p>
<p>On their way, they come to the old site Lake of Moon, which has become a vast swamp. The player must destroy some Spanish outposts and collect Spanish gold from ships. Later in the swamp, Cooper meets Beaumont and gets killed.</p>
<p>After learning from the Seminoles that during the time of the knight Morgan, Inca prisoners took many barrels of the Fountain's water to their last city in Pacamayo Valley. Amelia and Kanyenke come to <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a>, in <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Bolivar_82dc.html" title="Simon Bolivar">Bolivar's</a> revolution against the Spanish. They help him to free villages and he gives them men for their journey.</p>
<p>The way across the <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andes.html" title="Andes">Andes</a> is cold, so the men constantly lose a trickle of hitpoints. They must go into warm caves along the way to survive. They are followed by the Circle's army and if a riding scout comes to them, they move closer.</p>
<p>In the last Inca city, eight artillery weapons must come to the base before the three Inca temples are destroyed. After that, Amelia, Kanyenke and some men travel to Havana, Cuba, where there is the Circle's base with the temple-styled Ossuary.</p>
<p>They can't sail past the Circle's navy so they land on the south side and must walk through the land. The leader of the Spanish Colonial Administration says they have lived in the shadow of the Circle for a long time, and are ready to risk everything to rid themselves of it. They agreed to help Amelia.</p>
<p>Eventually, three big ships come from the USA to help Amelia. The Circle's fort has double walls and three big cannons that must be destroyed, and the Ossuary too. The story ends, and Amelia and Kanyenke walk into the fort. However, Beaumont jumps down from the top of the entrance. Kanyenke pushes Amelia out of the way. Beaumont lands on Kanyenke, but doesn't kill him. He jumps at Amelia. She kicks Beaumont but he comes back. Amelia manages to roll over, grab her gun and shoot Beaumont. They find out there were a lot of treasures in the Ossuary. Kanyenke says they shouldn't profit from the Circle, but most of the gold came from the Spanish treasure fleet. Finally, Amelia is at a train station and meets an old man she met in the beginning of her journey. He tells her that her family must have been so proud. The New World belongs to her and others like her. He speaks with a heavy Scottish accent much like Morgan Black's and tells her that she defeated the Circle of Ossus, "and in just one lifetime too." Amelia is startled and asks what he means, but he just walks away and says: "Don't miss your train." Many players suspect that the old man is Morgan Black because of his knowledge of the Circle, the certain words that he uses and the suspicion he drank the Fountain of Youth's water after the end of Act I's ending cutscene.</p>
<p>During Act III a player plays as the U.S. civilization, which strongly resembles the British civilization. Its musketeers are even upgraded to <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redcoat.html" title="Redcoat">redcoats</a> in the royal guard upgrade, just like the British. Also, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congreve_rocket.html" title="Congreve rocket">congreve rockets</a> can be built from Artillery Foundries, which is unique to them, although normal heavy cannons are created out of factories. Their architecture is the same as the British. The Home City is <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis%2C_Missouri_7f9c.html" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</a>.</p>

<p>By around 1783, Nathaniel Black, son of John Black, has grown up in an <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohawk_tribe.html" title="Mohawk tribe">Mohawk</a> village in the <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iroquois.html" title="Iroquois">Iroquois</a> Confederacy with his mother, Nonahkee, and his uncle, Kanyenke. He seems to always be trying to live up to his father's name.</p>
<p>The story starts with the <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohawk_nation.html" title="Mohawk nation">Mohawk</a> traitors and the <a href="../../../s/e/n/Seneca_nation.html" title="Seneca nation">Seneca</a> tribe allying with the British in the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Revolution_bd44.html" title="American Revolution">American Revolution</a>. Nathaniel and Kanyenke travel to the two tribes' village to counsel them to stay out of the fight. Instead, the Mohawk and Seneca ambush them and in the ensuing battle capture Nonahkee. <a href="../../../h/e/s/Hessian.html" title="Hessian">Hessian</a> commander, Colonel Kuechler, takes Nonahkee and the other captives and locks them up, only to have Nathaniel and Kanyenke arrive with the Oneida tribe arrive and rescue them.</p>
<p>With that, the Iroquois Confederacy breaks and Nathaniel leaves his village to go to <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a>, to fight alongside the Americans. After holding off the British at <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breed%27s_Hill_a64e.html" title="Breed's Hill">Breed's Hill</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlestown%2C_Massachusetts_59a7.html" title="Charlestown, Massachusetts">Charlestown</a>, he and his <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militia.html" title="Militia">militia</a> meet up with <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a>, who's been driven from <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trenton%2C_New_Jersey_d2cd.html" title="Trenton, New Jersey">Trenton</a>. Nathaniel helps Washington cross the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delaware_River_6e02.html" title="Delaware River">Delaware</a>, where they then must sneak around, destroying Hessian tents while avoiding the Hessian patrols. Once they are all destroyed, Nathaniel lights fires around the town to trick <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Cornwallis_820d.html" title="General Cornwallis">General Cornwallis</a> into thinking they were staying the night there. The militia then leave Trenton and capture the northern garrison. After gathering a large enough army, they head down to Trenton again and wipe out the British and Hessians.</p>
<p>Near <a href="../../../s/a/r/Saratoga%2C_New_York_f3d3.html" title="Saratoga, New York">Saratoga</a>, Nathaniel's men ambush British Fort Wagons. Once enough are taken down, Nathaniel uses the Black family fortune to buy some fort wagons, and he must race the British to build three forts. When all his forts are up, the Americans win a great victory against the British, but General Washington's troops are forced to stay the winter at <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valley_Forge_a32e.html" title="Valley Forge">Valley Forge</a>, where many of his men die. The Americans start building some huts to keep them warm, while Nathaniel uses more of his fortune to pay for a large amount of food to feed the troops. The rest of the men last the winter, and Washington informs Nathaniel that Colonel Kuechler is on the move again, preparing to attack <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morristown%2C_New_Jersey_0b6a.html" title="Morristown, New Jersey">Morristown</a>. Nathaniel leads his soldiers against them, along a dangerous path full of Hessians. He finally reaches Kuechler, and in a large battle, kills him.</p>
<p>With Kuechler dead, Nathaniel catches up with Washington, who is ready to attack Cornwallis at <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorktown%2C_Virginia_4d15.html" title="Yorktown, Virginia">Yorktown</a>. With the help of the French and their leader, the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marquis_de_Lafayette_b682.html" title="Marquis de Lafayette">Marquis de Lafayette</a>, the Americans capture several British redoubts and a fixed gun and finally destroy the British force, and with that, the war is over. After the war, Nathaniel returns home. He is now a poor man, as he has used up all his fortune outfitting his militiamen. But he is still considered a hero, and is one of the 'best men the Black family had ever produced.' He dies in 1814.</p>

<p>It is roughly 1866, and Chayton Black, the half <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lakota.html" title="Lakota">Lakota</a> <a href="../../../s/i/o/Sioux.html" title="Sioux">Sioux</a> son of Amelia Black, is planning to establish some new train stations around <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Laramie_3970.html" title="Fort Laramie">Fort Laramie</a> for the Falcon Company. He meets up with the Quartermaster, Billy Holme who helps him set them up. While doing this however, the Sioux led by <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Cloud_717c.html" title="Red Cloud">Red Cloud</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crazy_Horse_cdf2.html" title="Crazy Horse">Crazy Horse</a> keep raiding them, so after building the stations, the two attack the Sioux's two encampments. The Sioux then pursue some miners, cutting them down. Chayton and Billy have to escort the miners back to the fort, which is under constant attack. After <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Cloud%27s_War_f69e.html" title="Red Cloud's War">Red Cloud's War</a>, an uneasy truce between the Sioux and the Settlers starts. Amelia arrives at one of the Falcon train stations to meet up with Chayton, where he wonders why the Sioux are so angry. Amelia hands the Falcon Company down to Chayton a few years later, who is so busy making new railways, he almost forgets about the Sioux. Years later, Chayton is called back to a small town where he finds Billy Holme again, who's now the sheriff. The reason Holme got Chayton to come there was to show him the gold they've found in the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Hills_3670.html" title="Black Hills">Black Hills</a>. But Sioux and bandits arrive to take the gold. Chayton and Billy defend the mines successfully against the raiders, and regroup. Chayton realises that the Sioux don't want the gold, but they're attacking because him and the miners are in their land. Chayton travels across the west through all perils to meet with Crazy Horse and discuss a peace treaty. Crazy Horse tells Chayton that the miners broke the truce first, but before peace can be arranged, Billy Holme and the miners ambush the Sioux and kill many. Chayton, furious is forced to join with Holme as the Sioux are now gunning for them. Chayton and some outlaws protect the settlers gathering wood from Sioux raiders so that Holme can finish building a fort. After doing this, Holme tells Chayton to go and kill the women and children at the attacking Sioux village. Disgusted by this idea, Chayton refuses and instead joins with the Sioux, who now has to take down the fort he had worked so hard to build. Billy Holme escapes while the fort is taken down and <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Custer_eac9.html" title="General Custer">General Custer</a> arrives on the scene, ready to stop the Indian raids. Chayton asks Custer for one day to find Holme and stop a war from breaking out. Holme has gathered a large amount of bandits and miners and has built a small base when Chayton arrives, so he must earn the respect of Crazy Horse and <a href="../../../s/i/t/Sitting_Bull_4e0b.html" title="Sitting Bull">Sitting Bull</a> in a nearby village. Once he has done this, he and the Sioux destroy the base and the outlaws within and enter a cave, where Billy is holed up. Chayton confronts Holme and asks him why he started everything. Holme said he wanted all the gold he found and he wouldn't have cared if the land belonged to the settlers, he would have slaughtered them too. Chayton orders him to come to Custer and stop him from butchering the Sioux. Holme refuses and reaches for his pistol, but before he does, he is shot by Chayton. He falls down a mine along with few barrels of gunpowder and is blown to pieces. Chayton gallops to Custer's camp, only to find Custer ready to assault the Sioux and <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheyenne.html" title="Cheyenne">Cheyenne</a> at <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Big_Horn_49b8.html" title="Little Big Horn">Little Big Horn</a>. Chayton tries to tell Custer that Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull are willing to negotiate, but Custer doesn't care, and demands Chayton to choose a side, white or Indian. Chayton choses the Indians, rides to the Sioux camp and gets ready to defend the Sioux village. He builds some trading posts at the Cheyenne villages, allying with them and then charges and destroys the buildings nearby supplying Custer's <a href="../../../7/t/h/7th_Cavalry_1073.html" title="7th Cavalry">7th Cavalry</a>. Then Custer arrives with a large army just as Crazy Horse and the rest of the Sioux ride in. Chayton and the Sioux massacre the U.S. army and kill Custer. Amelia never saw her son again. Some say he died at <a href="../../../w/o/u/Wounded_Knee_39c1.html" title="Wounded Knee">Wounded Knee</a>, where it took a dozen cavalrymen to take him down, while others say he lived on, and established a family. But in the end, he made the right decision.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Morgan Black</dt>
</dl>
<p>A knight of St. John stationed on Malta. Morgan is clearly <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> and is proud of his heritage and very loyal to the knights. Morgan was born in Scotland in <a href="../../../1/6/1/1613.html" title="1613">1613</a>. He moved to Malta when he was 20, and since then, has visited his parents in Scotland at least twice a year. After the destruction of the Lake of the Moon, Morgan remained in the Americas for 20 years, before returning to Malta, where he stayed for 50 years. It is implied that he married Elisabet Ramesy, but it is known for certain that he had four sons, no known daughters (two of them stayed with Morgan; the other two stayed with Lizzie). It is strongly implied that he took some of the Lake's water in a hip flask and used it to gain <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immortality.html" title="Immortality">immortality</a>, probably to ensure that the Circle of Ossus would never achieve their goal, even after his "death". After his stay at Malta for 50 years, he wanted to spend his last days in the New World, so that's where he went, along with his sons. One night, Morgan went hunting in a forest, but never came back. Some people think that he died of old age (107 years); others think that he was killed by the animals or squashed by a tree. Or, if the Fountain's water works, he might have tried to hide from everyone (until the beginning of act III, where the old man (complete with Scottish accent) is probably him, and if so, he has been keeping tabs on them ("Amelia Black, the girl that owns Falcon Company. Is it true that your grandmother was a Mohawk?). Also in the scenario editor Old Coot's icon is Morgan Black with silver embroidery around him, which possibly indicates old age, and in the sound files, Old Coot's dialogue is included with Morgan's dialogue.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Elisabet Ramesy</dt>
</dl>
<p>Fled to the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caribbean.html" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> to escape an arranged marriage. She sailed with British and Dutch pirates/privateers, and became a pirate queen later in life, using the Spanish colony of Havana as a headquarters (despite the fact that she had a habit of attacking Spain's shipping). Though their first meeting was less than civil (she attacked him and destroyed at least two Maltese ships and in turn he destroyed most of her fleet and killed a great deal of her crew). She was impressed by Morgan Black's courage and tenacity, and it is implied that she became his wife and/or lover and bore him four children.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Sahin the Falcon</dt>
</dl>
<p>Despite not being a member of Black's family per se, he was a constant in Morgan Black's quest to stop the Circle from seizing the Fountain of Youth, though in very contradictory roles. He was Commander of at least part of the Turkish army invading Malta, who was charged with taking a fort defended by Morgan Black. Despite taking heavy losses, he failed to seize the fort. However, when entrenched in his camp in the cave system, he apparently discovered the stone library, and having some knowledge about the Circle's intent and composition beforehand, set sail with most of his command for the New World, but not before obscuring the stone passageway by building munitions depots at its entrance. He later fought with Morgan from a fort in the New World's Jungle. However, he failed to curry favor with the natives and Morgan took advantage of that, and despite Sahin's strong defenses, he was defeated, his fort destroyed, and most of his men killed in the night battle. Most of the few survivors were killed in mopping up actions by the knights. Sahin and a few of his men were "luckier." They were found by a large Spanish force commanded by Delgado (who was in charge of the Spanish Treasure Fleet at that time) and were in no shape to resist.</p>
<p>They were captured and when they refused to cooperate in the interrogation, the Spanish decided that after making the usual rounds with the treasure fleet that they would head back to their homeland and "give him (Sahin) a burning back in Spain." Fortune, however, was kind to Sahin. The Spanish had a run-in with the Pirates of Elizabeth Ramsey, aided by Morgan Black, and in the resulting struggle the fleet was seized and Delgado and most of his men were killed. Despite orders to kill him and his fellow Turkish and Inca prisoners by Alain, Sahin managed to convince Morgan that he was being betrayed and that Alain had been behind the circle all the time. He proved this when he showed Morgan and his knights that Alain was with "his troops" who had secured the Fountain, and it turned out that they were the boneguard. He personally fought in the final battle against Alain and the Circle with much distinction, and afterwards he mentioned that he knew all along that both the Knights and his Ottomen were things of the past, and that the future was in Europe and America. It is implied that he and Morgan remained on friendly terms.</p>
<p>In most of his confrontations with Morgan he calls him Frenk (a term implied in this game to mean <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">French</a>, though the Turks knew the Crusaders as Franks, as the Frankish empire in what is now France was one of their biggest supporters) though mysteriously he addresses Morgan by his first name in the opening cutscene supposedly without having any time to have learned it, thus leading some to suspect he and Morgan knew each other previously. His name is repetitive, as Sahin in the Turkish language translated literally means "Falcon." Thus, it is possible that Nathaniel (Morgan's great-grandson) named the Falcon company after him.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Philip Black</dt>
</dl>
<p>One of Morgan Black's sons and the father of John Black. Clearly the favored of Morgan's four children.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Stuart Black</dt>
</dl>
<p>The most tragic and luckless member of the Black family, Stuart was the youngest and most neglected son of Morgan Black. He clearly had not inherited any of his father or supposed mother's courage, but made up for it with his skills on the "political" battlefield, becoming the governor of Brunswick. He was not completely estranged from the family; he frequently hired his nephew John Black's mercenaries and he and John developed a strong relationship. Stuart was captured and killed by Warwick, his head put on a pike.</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Black_6168.html" title="John Black">John Black</a></dt>
</dl>
<p>The son of Philip Black. John became the leader of a mercenary group situated in Boston. He befriended an Iroquois called Kanyenke and the two became the best of friends, though they shared a friendly rivalry. Like his grandfather Morgan, John is brave, good, and skilled. John fell in love with Nonahkee, Kanyenke's sister, but he and Kanyenke set off after Warwick and John ultimately sacrificed himself to destroy a Russian army allied with the Circle of Ossus in an <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avalanche.html" title="Avalanche">avalanche</a> before their son was born.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Kanyenke</dt>
</dl>
<p>Kanyenke is a Mohawk and John Black's best friend. He is second in command of John's mercenaries. When the Circle of Ossus threatened his and John's families, Kanyenke was ready to help John deal with them. He later found out that John and Nonahkee, his sister, were lovers, and while he thought his sister should have someone more settled as a husband, he still respected his sister's choice. After John's death, he continued to hunt the Circle. But he also looked after his nephew Nathaniel. He accompanied his grandniece, Amelia Black, when she went after the Circle's leader, Beaumont, and was present when the Circle was beaten for good.</p>
<p>Until the release of The War Chiefs, it was thought that he drank the Fountain of Youth's water. But this has been proved false. He dies sometime between the events of the Steel and Shadow campaigns of old age. He is the only campaign character to appear in 3 acts.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Nonahkee</dt>
</dl>
<p>John Black's Iroquois lover and the sister of Kanyenke. She is a skilled healer and she has healed John on numerous occasions. The two eventually fell in love and after John's death, she bore him a single son, Nathaniel. In the brief demo for the Warchiefs expansion Nonahkee was captured by Hessians, but was rescued by her son Nathaniel. Though in the original game her nationality within the Iroquois was a Mohawk, this is thrown into doubt as the Warchiefs demo shows her son Nathaniel and Brother Kanyenke fighting an alliance of Pro-British tribes (the Seneca and the Mohawk) and she was captured by Hessian mercenaries backed up by a Mohawk Auxiliary.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Nathaniel Black</dt>
</dl>
<p>The son of John Black. Using the reward money from the British and American governments, Nathaniel founded the Falcon railroad company. However, circumstances worked against him, and his money dissolved through a combination of ineptitude and patriotism. When he openly sided with the rebels/patriots in the American Revolution, the British understandably cancelled the payments for John's sacrifice in stopping the Russian Army. He furthermore had to help use it to support the Patriots through out the war, and after the war it turned out he was a far better soldier and commander than he was an entrepreneur and accountant. He died when visiting London, five years prior to the "Steel" campaign, and apparently after the US government, which had apparently taken up the payments for John's sacrifice, had stopped paying. He is featured in the expansion pack, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Age_of_Empires_III%7E_The_War_Chiefs_59d8.html" title="Age of Empires III: The War Chiefs">Age of Empires III: The War Chiefs</a>. In the War Chiefs demo, Nathaniel saves his mother Nonahkee, after she is captured by Hessians.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Amelia Black</dt>
</dl>
<p>The daughter of Nathaniel Black, Amelia inherited the Falcon Company and set out to keep it alive. She is a skilled markswoman, never far from her rifle. She is known to be in her late twenties and after the defeat of the Circle of Ossus, she used toe gold recovered from the Spanish treasure fleet to refinance the Falcon Company. She had a brief friendship with <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_Cooper_9da7.html" title="Major Cooper">Major Cooper</a>, who was killed by the Circle's <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Inquisitor_c643.html" title="Grand Inquisitor">Grand Inquisitor</a>, Pierre Beaumont. She also had a relationship with an unknown Lakota Sioux Indian and this produced Chayton Black.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Chayton Black</dt>
</dl>
<p>The son of Amelia Black. He is included in <a href="../../../t/h/e/Age_of_Empires_III%7E_The_War_Chiefs_59d8.html" title="Age of Empires III: The War Chiefs">Age of Empires III: The War Chiefs</a> during the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Cloud%27s_War_f69e.html" title="Red Cloud's War">Red Cloud's War</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Bighorn_2756.html" title="Little Bighorn">Little Bighorn</a>. He inherited the Falcon Company from his mother. When he heard that the US government had been attacking the Sioux, and he was ordered to participate in the slaughter, he defected to the Sioux. He was present at the battle of Little Bighorn, where he helped defeat General Custer. It is unknown what happened to him after the Wounded Knee massacre.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Empires_III_campaign_storyline_afb1.html" title="Edit section: The Circle of Ossus">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Circle of Ossus</span></h3>
<p>The Circle is a secret society. They were thought to be <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alchemy.html" title="Alchemy">alchemists</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientists.html" title="Scientists">scientists</a>; others say they are the most powerful men in Europe. They seek a means for eternal life. The Circle has enclaves in many parts of Europe. They are looking for a structure in the New World called the Lake of the Moon, in other words, The Fountain of Youth. An Ottoman named Sahin the Falcon was trying to stop the Circle from reaching the lake. In the New World, the Circle had tamed pure white animals. They had control of the Lake, thanks to traitorous knight Alain Magnan. But, they were defeated when Morgan Black of the Knights of St. John destroyed the Fountain.</p>
<p>A few generations later, the Circle returned, and their new leader Warwick kidnapped Morgan's descendant, Stuart Black, to find out the location of the Lake of the Moon. But Stuart didn't know so they were going to question his nephew John. They failed and when they had a Russian army marching towards the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colony.html" title="Colony">colonies</a>, it was buried by a mountain.</p>
<p>Another few generations later, the leader of the Circle, Pierre Beaumont, was going to question Amelia Black, the owner of Falcon Company, but failed when her granduncle, Kanyenke, came to the rescue. He and his minions fled to Florida, where the old site of the Fountain had turned into a swamp. After digging up much Spanish gold, the Circle learned from the <a href="../../../s/e/m/Seminoles.html" title="Seminoles">Seminoles</a> that Incas took many barrels of the water to their last city. The Circle's army was behind Amelia's forces through the Andes. None of their scouts made it back. When they reached the city, Beaumont took many barrels of the water and fled back to Cuba at the infamous Ossuary near Havana, with the help of his unwitting allies the Spanish colonial administration on Cuba. After being betrayed by the Spanish Colonial Government, the Circle was overwhelmed by both the US and Spanish forces. Beaumont took one last strike at Amelia but met his end at her shotgun.</p>
<p>The most notable members of the Circle were Alain Magnan, Warwick and Pierre Beaumont.</p>
<p>The Circle of Ossus is based on the <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> civilization, although on some levels based on the Russians. Their architecture is the same as that of the Germans and Russians. Their elite soldiers are Boneguard and White Cougar, although they often use unique German units such as <a href="../../../d/o/p/Doppelsoldner.html" title="Doppelsoldner">Doppelsoldners</a> and <a href="../../../u/h/l/Uhlans.html" title="Uhlans">Uhlans</a>. They have also been seen having used <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landsknecht.html" title="Landsknecht">landsknechts</a>, also unique to the Germans.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Colonel Kuechler</dt>
</dl>
<p>A Hessian mercenary commander. He worked for the British during the American Revolution. During one occasion, his men raided Nathaniel's village and abducted many villagers, including Nonahkee. Nathaniel rescues the villagers, but Kuechler escapes. During the revoultion, Kuechler's men faced Nathaniel many times, like at Trenton and Saratoga. Finally, near Morristown, Kuechler led his mercenaries against Nathaniel's militia and was defeated. Nathaniel personally killed him.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Billy Holme</dt>
</dl>
<p>Once Chayton Black's friend, Sheriff Holme began to stir up trouble with the Sioux when he ordered miners to mine in the Black Hills, which was the Indians land by right of a treaty with the US government. When he tried to get Chayton on his side, he made a serious mistake in ordering him to slaughter the women and children of the Sioux villages. After telling Chayton he was either with or against him, Chayton joined the Sioux and massacured his men and destroyed his town. Holme fled and Chayton pursued him with the help of Crazy Horse. Cornered in a mine, he told Chayton that he wouldn't have cared who the land belonged to, he would have killed the owners to get all the gold. He tried to shoot Chayton, but Chayton shot him and he fell down the shaft with several barrels of gun powder and was blown to bits.</p>

<p>General Custer showed up when Chayton led the Sioux in destroying Holme's town. He gave Chayton one day to find Holme, but went back on his promise and attacked the Sioux. Chayton returned and Custer told him he was going to fight the Indians and told him to choose a side. Chayton chose the Sioux and helped slaughter his forces at Little Bighorn. Custer died in the battle.</p>
