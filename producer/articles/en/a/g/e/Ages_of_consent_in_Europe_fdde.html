The specific activity engaged in or the gender of its participants can also be affected by the law. Below is a discussion of the various laws dealing with this subject. The highlighted age refers to an age at or above which an individual can engage in unfettered sexual relations with another who is also at or above that age. Other variables, for example <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> relations or close in age exceptions may exist and are noted when relevant.</p>

<p>Until 1998, homosexual acts between men were entirely forbidden under Section 171 (1929). In 1989, Alecos Modinos, president of the Cypriot Gay Liberation Movement, brought a case to the European Court of Human Rights. In 1993, the Court held that the prohibition of homosexual acts was a violation of Article 8. In January 1995, the Cypriot Government introduced a Bill in the Cypriot Parliament which would have abolished the ban. Strong opposition from the Church meant the Bill stalled when referred to the Parliament's Legal Affairs Committee. The European Commission repeated its warning that Cyprus must follow the Court's ruling. In May 1997, again a government measure to repeal the ban failed because of the strength of the opposition. In April 1998, the Council of Europe set a deadline for compliance of <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_29.html" title="May 29">29 May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> and on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_21.html" title="May 21">21 May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, the House of Representatives voted 36 to 8 in favour legalising homosexual acts.

<p>Male homosexual acts were illegal until 1791 when the ancient sodomy laws were dropped from the Criminal Code of that year. This continued to be the case under the Napoleonic Code of 1810. In 1942, an age of consent for homosexual acts was set at 21, as opposed to the heterosexual equivalent of 13. The latter was increased to 15 in 1945. In 1978, the age of consent for homosexual acts was lowered to 18, and later, in 1981, it was further lowered to 15, in line with heterosexual acts.</p>

<p>Homosexual acts are covered by Article 175 of the Portuguese Criminal Code: "<i>Whoever being of the age of majority, practices homosexual acts with minors of 14-16 years of age or incites other persons to such acts can be punished by imprisonment of up to 2 years or a fine.</i>" The same types of acts do not constitute a criminal offence when the persons involved are of different gender.</p>
<p>There is also a crime for sexual acts obtained through the abuse of inexperience with adolescents of 14-15.

<p>The age of consent for heterosexual acts was set at 12 in 1275 and remained so for six centuries. A concern that young girls were being sold into brothels led Parliament to raise the age of consent to 13 in 1875 under the Offences Against the Person Act 1875. 10 years later, the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criminal_Law_Amendment_Act_1885_bbe2.html" title="Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885">Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885</a> further raised the age of consent to 16; and also criminalized male homosexual acts. It is common <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folklore.html" title="Folklore">folklore</a> that an amendment which would have criminalised lesbian acts was rejected by Queen Victoria who refused to believe that some women did such things. However, it is more likely that those presenting the amendment excluded it (as did the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Lords_efb8.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a> 40 years later) on the assumption that it would "give women ideas".<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Male homosexual acts were decriminalised under the <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_Offences_Act_1967_1d99.html" title="Sexual Offences Act 1967">Sexual Offences Act 1967</a>, Section 1, although the age of consent for such acts was set at 21, whereas the age of consent for heterosexual acts was 16. However, the legislation only applied in England and Wales.</p>
<p>In 1994, on the second reading of the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criminal_Justice_and_Public_Order_Act_1994_6bc8.html" title="Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994">Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994</a>, the Conservative MP, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edwina_Currie_9962.html" title="Edwina Currie">Edwina Currie</a>, introduced an amendment which would have lowered the age of consent for such acts to 16, in line with heterosexual acts, however the amendment was defeated by 308 votes to 280. A compromise amendment which lowered the age of consent to 18 was, however, accepted by 427 votes to 162. (Also during the readings were motions to equalise the age of consent to 17 for all, to reintroduce an age of consent for homosexual acts to 21, and a further attempt to lower the age of consent to 16. All of these were rejected.)</p>
<p>In 1997, the European Court of Human Rights case of <i>Sutherland</i> v <i>the United Kingdom</i> held that a higher age of consent for homosexuals than for heterosexuals was a breach of Article 8 of the Convention. In response, the Government introduced the Crime and Disorder Bill which contained a provision lowering the age of consent for homosexual acts to 16. Though accepted by the House of Commons, the provision was rejected by the House of Lords. The Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill, introduced in 1998, contained a similar provision, but once again it was rejected by the House of Lords. The Bill was reintroduced in 2000 and, despite opposition from the House of Lords, was passed under the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_Act_1911_1f03.html" title="Parliament Act 1911">Parliament Act 1911</a> (which allows the House of Commons to overrule the House of Lords under certain circumstances). As the Scottish Parliament had been established prior to the reintroduction of the Bill, and the relevant legislation was a devolved issue, the consent of that Parliament under the Sewel Convention was required - had that consent not been granted, the Scottish provisions would have had to be removed and it would not have been possible to use the Parliament Act. The <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_Offences_%28Amendment%29_Act_2000_b00b.html" title="Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000">Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000</a> thus equalised the age of consent at 16 for all sexual acts (including, for the first time, lesbian acts).</p>

<p>In Scotland most sexual offences are contained in the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 , which replaced the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 1976. For heterosexual acts the age of consent is 16, with increased penalties for offences involving girls under 13.</p>
<p>Male homosexual acts were illegal in Scotland until 1980 when they were decriminalised by the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980, Section 80, which specified an age of consent of 21. The Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 Act lowered the age of consent of 18 and this was further lowered to 16 by the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000 described above.</p>

<p>Male homosexual acts were illegal in Northern Ireland until 1982, when they were decriminalised by the Homosexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 1982, which specified an age of consent of 21. The change was a result of the judgment in the European Court of Human Rights case of <i>Dudgeon</i> v <i>United Kingdom</i> (1981) in which the ECHR held that a prohibition on homosexual acts was a breach of Article 8 of the Convention. The age of consent was lowered to 17 for male homosexual acts - putting the age of consent in line with heterosexual acts - by the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000, Section 1.</p>

<p>Sodomy was illegal in Jersey for both men and women until 1990 although the age of consent for homosexual acts other than sodomy was the same as for heterosexual acts. In 1990 the age of consent for sodomy between consenting males was set at 21 (the UK at that time maintained the age of consent of 21 for all homosexual acts between males). In 1995 this was further lowered to 18. In 2007 the age of consent was lowered to 16, regardless of the gender of the participants, and sodomy was legalised between men and women.</p>
