<p>Could the origins of the term "May/December romance" be explained? I used to think the term applied to the length of the relationship, and it was a term for short courtings (though I guess 7 months isn't all that short).

<p>I suggested (though anonymously, before logging in this morning) that the increased social acceptability of a seven-year age difference as partners get older may be related to the proporation of the age difference to the age of the younger partner.

<dd>"Few people are willing to defend extreme cases of age disparity such as pedophilia."</dd>
</dl>
<p>This line is not NPOV and needs rephrasing or something. "Extreme" is a value judgement and merely the opinon of the writer (though commonly held, admittedly). "Few people" is also rather a vague weasle term. What consitutes "many" or "few"? Also, there is a vocal minority who do defend "extreme" cases (see <a href="../../../c/h/i/Childlove_movement.html" title="Childlove movement">childlove movement</a>) as those involving pedophila, who could be mentioned as the exception. Also some freethinkers, as represented by sites like logicalreality.com, and other groups, such as certain pagan groups, and so on. This dismissive line makes it seem as if no other opinion exists. --<a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.93.21.71.html" title="User:195.93.21.71">195.93.21.71</a> 03:30, 13 July 2005 (UTC)(Katey)</p>
<ul>
<li>I support the phrasing as it stands. The age difference often =is= extreme, if 'extreme' is a description of a deviation from the norm. While people might, for instance, accept a difference of seven years between partners, a value which falls near the norm, they would be less inclined to accept a difference of twenty-seven years, which lies at the extreme end of the difference scale. As for "few people", I think this is a generous overestimate. The more correct term is probably "virtually no one". <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 00:12, 2005 July 14 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone is missing a more basic point. There are extreme age-disparate relationships that are also not pedophilia. When Tony Randall was 75 he married a 25-year-old woman. If anyone thinks that is "pedophilia", he simply does not know what the word means. Nor was it pedophilia when Bill Wyman and Woody Allen wooed and married much younger women. If a relationship does not involve a prepubertal child, it is not pedophilia, PERIOD.</p>
<p><b>What are people not getting here? A five or six year age difference CAN represent a pedophilic situation, if the younger party is, say, 8--despite there not being an extreme age difference. A 50-year age difference as between (superannuated adult) Tony Randall and his (adult) wife is NOT pedophilia.</b> --<a href="../../../d/j/a/User%7EDJac75_637e.html" title="User:DJac75">DJac75</a> 03:08, 8 August 2005 (UTC) (Placing comment in proper chronological order <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a>)</p>

<p>Does it match up with the common notion of it; that is to say that a gold digger is a woman who marries or gets with a man, regardless of age, just to spend his money while feigning intrest in him?</p>
<p>Absolutely. This article, equating golddigging with age disparity, is outrageously inaccurate and misleading.</p>

I agree. The term "gold digging" really is independent of the respective ages of the partners.</p>

<p>Ever since the Internet began, pedophiles have been increasing their level of organization and implicitly trying to seize control of discourse about this topic. They seek to define separate, pseudoscientific terms such as "pedophile," "ephebophile," and "infantophile," but in reality, there are just two phenomena: attraction to sexually-mature individuals, and attraction to sexually-immature individuals. It legitimizes pedophilia to pretend that attraction to a seventeen year old girl is somehow a scientific phenomenon worthy of a special term, somehow on the same level as attraction to a seven year old girl. So take pedophile terminology with a grain of salt, knowing that they are seeking to advance their own interests with the promulgation of their terminology. - <a href="../../../n/a/i/User%7ENaif_1ab2.html" title="User:Naif">Naif</a> 02:27, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Though I agree that we should be careful about pedophiles taking control of this topic, I object to the fact that "pedophile," "ephebophile," and "infantophile," and pseudoscientific terms created by <strike>sex offenders</strike> pedophiles. As a student of Psychology (working on my Master's as we speak), I can tell you that pedophilia is listed in the <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders_5c59.html" title="Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders">DSM-IV</a> (302.2), which is used to diagnos mental disorders. Looking over your Userpage <a href="../../../n/a/i/User%7ENaif_1ab2.html" title="User:Naif">Naif</a>, it appears that you are a student of philosphy, not psychology. Perhaps more research should be conducted before such a broad statement is made like you did above. It implies (at least to me), that you consider members of the psychological community as <strike>sex offenders</strike> pedophiles, since it is the psychological community and not the pedophiles that invented the terminology.--<a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzathar_4a0a.html" title="User:Azathar">Azathar</a> 06:19, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It is a shame I cannot participate in this discussion under my logged-in name, for fear that some lunatic will cave my head in because of my sexual orientation. Neither one of you have a clue what you are talking about, in part because I'm guessing neither of you are pedophiles. To address Naif first (Naif being French for naiive, which seems to fit perfectly under the circumstances), how is it that if I'm attracted to an eighteen year old girl, I'm alright, mate, but if she's seventeen, I'm suddenly a pedophile? How is it that I'm 25 and attracted to an eighteen year old girl I'm alright, unless I'm 50 and then I'm a pervert? How is it that in many societies past and present, there are social parameters which allow for sexual contact between adults and children, with no stigma and hence no suffering attached, for either party? To get to the point, you're damn rights I'm attempting to "advance (my) own interests" - and where's the crime there? Do you not attempt to advance yours? To Athazar, you suffer from the same insanity which appears to have overtaken popular Western thought in linking pedophiles and child molesters. I have grave difficulties in believing you are a student of anything when you use this kind of language. The facts speak for themselves in that most pedophiles never have sexual contact with a child, and most sexual predators of children are firmly in the heterosexual (and not pedophile) camp. The DSM-IV may list pedophilia as a mental disease, but I suggest you not place too great a degree of credence on a document which in the past saw homosexuality as a mental illness until just recently. Both of you should get a grip on yourselves, prepare to open your minds to rational thought just a little, and visit <a href="http://isbweb.org/o/content/view/67/74/" class="external text" title="http://isbweb.org/o/content/view/67/74/" rel="nofollow">Puellula</a>, where rational adults discuss what it is to be a pedophile.

<dd>I think I know a bit more then you think, Mr./Ms. Anon, as I am related to a sex offender, my cousin is one. He was caught, arrested, tried and pled out, and goes to counseling now, so please don't try and tell me that you know anything about me. BTW, I am still close with my cousin, he made a mistake, has come clean and admitted what he did, knows it was wrong, and is working on making himself a better person. The family knows, and we are all giving him the benefit of the doubt, though, to answer the question that is probably forming in your head, would I trust him alone with my kids? My answer is I don't know. It will depend on his record since his crime, and how he has been living his life. Since I don't have any kids yet, I am not even worried about that at this time. As in all scientific pursuits, as knowledge is increased, changes are made to the texts of a science. Yes, the DSM (not version IV, btw) once listed homsexualality as a mental illness, but as our scientific knowledge has increased, it was removed. Please don't try to lecture to me and tell me to "get a grip" and that I "ain't got the balls" when you are afraid to use your real name in this discussion. And for the record, I do know the difference between a child molester and a pedophile. One is a person who acts on his sexual attraction to children, in disregard to current taboos, mores and laws, and the other is one who is attracted to children, but may or may not act them out. It's not illegal to be a pedophile, but it is illegal to act on those tendencies. Western society has tended to merge pedophile and child molester together, and I typed too fast and didn't seperate them. I have fixed my comments above by striking out the incorrect words and rewriting the correct words. But my point hasn't changed. If you don't like the fact that pedophilic feelings (and possibly child molesting activities) are wrong, then I suggest that you move to a new place where the culture is more in tune to your attitudes.--<a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzathar_4a0a.html" title="User:Azathar">Azathar</a> 05:49, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Azathar, you claim to be studying for your MS in psych and at the same time you make a statement claiming that feelings can be "wrong"?! May I suggest that in that direction lies a dangerous discourse filled with internal conflict and its repercussions? But I think your slip is telling, not so much of your own state but of the problems in dealing with this sensitive topic.

<dd>I object to being accused to attempting to pull some kind of joke. I admit my "rant" was a bit emotionally written out, but I stand by its essential truth. Being attracted to a seventeen year old girl is entirely normal and indeed healthy. (Not being attracted is also fine.) Being attracted to a seven-year old girl is disgusting, and anybody who acts on it deserves exile to some barren desert island in the middle of the ocean. -<a href="../../../n/a/i/User%7ENaif_1ab2.html" title="User:Naif">Naif</a> 11:14, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Were it not such a serious issue, I would find it laughable that you criticise my unwillingness to use my real name in this discussion. Do you really think I'm interested in having my windows smashed and my tires slashed? I laugh at your suggestion that homosexuality was removed from the DSM-IV because "our scientific knowledge has increased." Rubbish. It was removed because <i>our attitude has changed</i>. I'm pleased you understand the difference between a pedophile and a child molester, because this is a rare thing in the common perception, where I am as good as dead even though I have never had sex with a child. I would suggest, however, that you reexamine your thought processes in light of your suggestion that my feelings are somehow wrong. Feelings are neither right nor wrong. They are feelings, end of sentence. And as you your suggestion that I move to a different place, thanks, but I like it here, and I have just as much right to be here as you do. You may wish to focus some of your learned research on such cultures as the ancient Greeks or the modern Mekinahu, where prepubertal sex was/is not only accepted, but common, and where it did not bring about the end of the world. 68.148.196.162 01:51, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Obvious prepubertal sex doesn't bring about the end of the world. Neither does homicide--doesn't mean homicide is OK. Homicide is also very common/accepted in a war zone, and again, doesn't mean it's not a social evil. I am very skeptical about these claims that because a social phenomenon existed in one particular culture, should it be imported into our own. In those ancient cultures, people lived and died within twenty miles of their birthplace and were tightly woven into one village's social fabric. If you slept with a fifteen year old girl, you pretty much had her for life. In today's world, such behavior can be escaped relatively easy, and our codes need to be more strict. - <a href="../../../n/a/i/User%7ENaif_1ab2.html" title="User:Naif">Naif</a> 02:31, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>To spell things out further, I believe "pedophile" is a legitimate scientific term. "Ephebophile" is a neologism advanced by organized pedophiles to presume that attraction to late adolescent girls is somehow a scientific phenomenon worthy of a term. "Infantophile" is also a dangerous concept because, again, organized pedophiles are seeking to define a practically non-existant community in order to make themselves look less sick. -<a href="../../../n/a/i/User%7ENaif_1ab2.html" title="User:Naif">Naif</a> 11:14, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>"Practically nonexistant" is pretty much wishful thinking on your part. Both Masters and Johnson and Kinsey suggest that the percentage of pedophiles in society is higher than you might wish to believe. I would also suggest that the "sick" part of adult-child sexual relations is in the non-pedophile component of offenders who rape children against their will, often violently, as opposed to the pedophiles who seek an honest, balanced, and caring relationship with their young partners. Genuine pedophiles seek to do no harm. We can be content with a relationship which consists merely of hugs and the holding of hands if that is all that the relationship can sustain. We are very protective of our young friends. But perhaps you do not care to know that. 68.148.196.162 02:03, 23 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just for the record, I'm pointing out that "infantophilia" is a pretty much nonexistant community, not pedophilia. All sex researchers have a strong bias to overstate deviance because that is their career: to document it. So take their statistics with a grain of salt. Yes I agree child-rape is far more sick than a non-informed consentual pedophilia relationship. But children <i>cannot</i> give informed consent to sex. Deal with it. How can you believe that children cannot give informed consent to contracts but, wow, amazing, they can do so for sex? The contradiction is obvious to even the most sickly mind. I am glad that you are confining yourself to hugs and holding hands. But watch out for that slippery slope, and for how desire builds on itself when it is fulfilled. - <a href="../../../n/a/i/User%7ENaif_1ab2.html" title="User:Naif">Naif</a> 02:31, 23 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have had an instance when a child readily gave consent. I chose not to accept. It was not the first time I could have moved forward to sexual gratification had I wished to do so. How can children understand about sex? This is the 21st century, and rock videos hold the whole answer to your question. Children also understand masturbation, as I did at an early age. Children also talk about sex games such as "pickle tickle". They are not without interest ort awareness. I speak from experience. You obviously do not. 68.148.196.162 02:47, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The very fact that you bring up this incident shows that deep down inside, you know that self-discipline is something to be proud of. I've worked with people who are close to death, and they always talk about things they've denied themselves in life, not times when they indulged. I guarantee you on your own death bed when you are facing eternal nothingness, you, too, will be glad that you did not proceed. The only other thing I need to say is that if you constantly tempt yourself, you may slip up sooner or later. Perhaps avoid these situations entirely. -<a href="../../../n/a/i/User%7ENaif_1ab2.html" title="User:Naif">Naif</a> 05:54, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With this I am completely in accord with you. I have no idea how many times I've read and heard of situations where "abused" children begged and pleaded that their "abuser" not be punished. All for naught, of course. Authorities have destroyed families on the presumption that they were doing good. So where is the abuse here? I agree that children should not be exposed to this risk, but it would also be nice if the authorities would act on understanding and compassion rather than on hatred and prejudice. 68.148.196.162 23:42, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All of you make pretty good arguments, that at the same time seem to be confusing. There is 1 thing that I think, all of you have lost site of &amp; that is the life of the child involved. What happens to the child emotionally can be devastating it's like their childhood has been killed/murdered lost forever never to be re-gained, they lose their childhood and are dragged into an adult world many years too early, when they are not emotionally &amp; physically ready. It also controls the childs future emotional relationships, regardless of how many years passes or how many visits to a Psychologist. How do I know, by 1st hand knowledge, I was abused sexually by a member in my family when I was about 8-10yrs old, and even though I don't hate/dislike my abuser it did affect me to the point it was a major controlling contribution factor in all my adult relationships. To the child concerned, they really don't care if you are a 'child molester' or 'pedophiles' you screw up not just their childhood but their whole lives!!! Yes, most Authorities have destroyed the family but if it wasn't for the sick person who abused the child in the 1st place the family wouldn't have been destroyed. (ps) apologies for any spelling mistakes. INsaneity (2:40am 03/03/2006)</p>

<dd>No one has lost sight of that, it is wrong to assume that. First of all, I don't think anyone would support the involvement of children in illegal activities. Sometimes wrong laws can be broken in protest of their unfairness as a message to the state, but this is generally something adults do. In this case, only those who would engage in it should it be legalized should have their views heard.</dd>
<dd>The concept that sex must necessarily emotionally devastate a child, murdering their childhood (what exactly IS a childhood?) and losing it forever (when you grow up, do you lose your childhood?) aren't concepts that would apply by default. One must look at the source of such trauma. If it is indeed the authorities, then while the adult would share blame for putting the child in an illegal situation that demands that, the situation would not exist if it were legal. Kind of like, if prayer were illegal for children, you would traumatize them by having the authorities interrogate you both if you prayed together, but that would not mean there is inherantly anything harmful about prayer. Such actions should be judged by their own merits: the reason it is outlawed is to prevent rape. All child sex is classified as child-rape because no agreement has come about on how a child can give consent, and if they have the faculties for it. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETyciol_011d.html" title="User:Tyciol">Tyciol</a> 17:12, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This article is about sexual relationships, not platonic (romantic?) like Alice and Carroll.

<p>OK, so skip Lewis Carroll if we must (though I personally would make a distinction here between "platonic" and "unconsummated"), but what about Chaplin's series of marriages to much younger women, and Nabakov's <i>Lolita</i>, which is probably the most important fictional work about an inappropriate, consummated sexual relationship between a middle-aged man and a girl?

<p>I don't believe that the term Lolita comes from the relationship between Charlie Chaplin and Lita Grey. Nabokov gives a different explanation in the notes of The Annotated Lolita. Can anyone verify for certain how Nabokov came up with the name Lolita? <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 24.249.254.72 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.249.254.72_a4db.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.249.254.72">contribs</a>) 9 Jan 2006.</small></p>

<li>there's Kenneth Anger's <i>Hollywood Babylon</i> (which I don't have handy so I can't give you a page number, but it's where I first read this, maybe 20 years ago). Anger goes into quite a bit that came out in the course of their divorce trial, and on the whole it fits the picture.</li>

<li>At <a href="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/chaplinbib.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/chaplinbib.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> there is a mention of a short note in an academic journal by Bill Delaney "Nabokov's 'Lolita.'" (similarities of the characters in Vladimir Nabokov's to Charlie Chaplin) <i>Explicator</i> v56, n2 (Wntr, 1998):99 (2 pages). <i>Explicator</i> is, I believe, pretty much the leading newsletter for scholars of Nabokov. Again, I don't have access to that, but their abstract is "Vladimir Nabokov's book 'Lolita' presents the lead character, Humbert, who is interestingly observed to possess several similarities to the silent comedian Charlie Chaplin. For instance, Humbert and Chaplin were observed to be particularly attracted to young girls. Furthermore, Chaplin, who played the role of 'Verdoux' in 'Monsieur Verdoux: A Comedy of Murders' attempts to murder the proud Annabella while in a rowboat on a lake, but fails. Humbert, in 'Lolita,' also fails to achieve his plans to drown Lolita's mother in Hourglass Lake." Not the most compelling of arguments based on the abstract, but probably of interest if you really want to follow that up.</li>
<li>If you just search on <i>Lolita "Charlie Chaplin"</i> you'll find lots of stuff on miscellaneous film criticism sites, but nothing I'd call definitively citable. Of these <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1808716675/details" class="external autonumber" title="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1808716675/details" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> on movies.yahoo.com is typical. <a href="http://www.filmsite.org/loli.html" class="external text" title="http://www.filmsite.org/loli.html" rel="nofollow">Tim Dirks</a> might be more citable, though he says merely, "The well-known scandal at the start of the century of actor Charlie Chaplin's second marriage and subsequent divorce to under-age actress Lolita McMurry may have been the original reference point for Nabokov's novel." Which means he doesn't even have his date right on the scandal.</li>

<p>IMO, there is no reason to have MILF spelled out completely "uncensored." That's not good taste; Britannica would never do that. It's not withholding info to have it say "F——" instead. If someone is really confused on that, they can click the MILF link! This article could be referenced by a certain scholar or someone, but perhaps be (a) blocked for containing the word "F-ck" and (b) be considered less authoratative for the same reason.</p>

<dd>It looks to be a valid folk formula. It should go back in. Only 98 Google hits (ten for version with numerals) for that exact phrase, but they seem to show it as a widespread if not A-list meme. I can see why, it works pretty well: it approves a 14-year-old dating a 14-year-old, 16→15, 18→16, 20→17, 22→18... 26→20, 30→22, 40→27, etc... that seems to match about the usual limit before people (or the minor's mom) will give you THAT LOOK... In other words, its a pretty good objective description of the limit of what's considered proper, which I would think would be pretty darn useful to a reader... Obviously we are talking about the United States and/or the West in general... if necessary that could be stated... in the English Wikipedia there are many articles which assume that you are talking about the West unless otherwise stated. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 01:23, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Without a doubt the lifespan of an organism is broken down into stages. As for beings of sentient capacities, supposedly human beings have a "mental age." Could it not be shown as well that people have a hormonal, neurological, and mechanical equivalent? In that, these varaiations should be with the "average" being bear a common synchronization. By "mechanical," I refer to physcial attributes or perhaps appearance of the organism but not "physical age" in the sense of actual (usual) space and time. The advancement of mental, hormonal, neurological, mechanical, or other capabilities/structures do not always fit into the common paradigm regarding the correlations between theses capabilities.</p>

<p>Whild not necessarily questioning the truth of (most of) the statements in this section, I tagged it because because there are number of statements that I think need verifaction, these being:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"Historically, unequal pairings are quite common, if not the rule.</i>"</li>
</ul>
<p>The "quite common" is almost certainly true (so cites should be easy to find), the "if not the rule" I'm less sure is true, cites would be especially welcome on this.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"In <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_Greece_4866.html" title="Classical Greece">Classical Greece</a>, men would typically marry around the age of thirty, and would take wives in their mid-teens, around half their age."</i></li>
</ul>
<p>OK. If true, cites should be easy.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"Similarly, women of influence have also initiated relationships with younger men."</i></li>
</ul>
<p>This last seems especially problematatic. The word "often" is not used, so by strict logic the statement would be true if two such pairings existed in history, but obviously that is not what is meant. Individual anecdotal cases being of some, but relatively little, value in my opinion, I think some cite(s) of this being a widespread <i>social</i> phenomenon would be useful here.</p>
<p>Second paragraph, all presumably true, cites would be welcome though.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"<a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchs.html" title="Monarchs">Monarchs</a> have traditionally exercised the freedom to choose younger spouses"</i></li>
</ul>
<p>I would be somewhat surprised if this <i>is</i> true. Marriages of ruling monarchs are often <i>not</i> made for reasons of personal preference, but for reasons of state. The needs of the state as expressed through the monarch's advisors carry a lot of weight, and marriages were often arranged through court diplomacy. Fecundity being a prime asset for a queen, I would not be suprised if older kings <i>were</i> often paired with younger brides, but not to satisfy the king's personal wishes. Cite or redaction definitely needed here.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"Other historical examples..."</i></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm kind of unsure ahow useful are a handful of individual anecdotes. If they highlight a general trend, them OK I guess, but <i>statistical</i> evidence is far better as a rule. If no such evidence exists, one must question how fitting a given assertion is to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 15:25, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The section "Modern times" consists of an anecdote about one couple. I don't think we want to overload Wikipedia articles with anecdotes, besides which the marriage noted was over a half-century ago, so I'm not sure how "modern" that is, besides which speculation as motive is made (maybe they just thought it was romantic).

<li><i>"They view the generation gap as an obstacle to overcome, especially if they feel they have "missed out"."..</i></li>

<li><i>"Younger partners may be searching for someone who is their superior, either socially or financially more secure, or to provide critical life guidance."</i></li>

<p>Can we get some citations here? There must be some surveys or research or <i>something</i> that this is based on. Also, is all this as equally true (if true at all) of females as males?</p>

<p>Again with the life guidance. The parent figure thing is interesting... I've heard that expressed (colloquially) in terms of <i>type</i> of partner sought, but not so much in terms of age of partner sought. Surveys, citations? This is beginning to read like someone's general speculation.</p>

<p>I redacted this entire section. The whole section looks fishy to me. To start with, <i>"<b>Daddy-Daughter Dating</b> refers to younger women going out with older men.</i>" caught my eye.</p>
<p>That would strike me as pretty odd... so I looked it up. Remember, pop-culture stuff like slang is likely to be <i>over</i>represented on the web, if anything. I got three Google hits. One was this article... one was a porn site... one was a Japanese discussion forum, which contained a copy-and-paste of this entire section.

<p>Please don't do that, editors.</p>
