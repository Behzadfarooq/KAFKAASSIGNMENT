<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Agency_%28Mormonism%29_3c49.html" title="Edit section: Pre-existence">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pre-existence</span></h2>
<p>A major difference, and a key insight to Mormons' understanding of free agency, between mainstream Christians and Latter-day Saints involves the belief of a life before mortality, called the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pre-existence.html" title="Pre-existence">Pre-existence</a>. Latter-day Saints believe that before the earth was created, all mankind lived in a pre-existent life as spirit children of God.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[7]</a></sup> Here Heavenly Father nurtured, taught and provided means for their development. This preparation would allow them to later become the men and women of Earth, to be further educated and tested in the schoolhouse of mortality in order to return to God's presence and become like Him. Thus the pre-existent life is believed to have been an indefinitely long period of probation, progression, and schooling. Mormons believe that there came a time when we could not progress further without being born in to a body and experiencing earthly life.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to Mormon beliefs, God the Father proposed a plan whereby further progression could take place, a <i><a href="../../../p/l/a/Plan_of_salvation.html" title="Plan of salvation">Plan of salvation</a></i>. Because agency would allow all people to fall in sin (and, in fact, scripture teaches that all people will sin), a <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savior.html" title="Savior">Savior</a> was necessary to <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atonement.html" title="Atonement">atone</a> for the sins of each person so that they could return to live with their Father in Heaven. <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> volunteered to follow the plan as outlined, which preserved agency, accountability for action and the necessary result that some of Heavenly Father's children would never to return to Heavenly Father as a consequence of sin. The second volunteer, <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucifer.html" title="Lucifer">Lucifer</a>, attempted to amend the plan by proposing that all mankind would return to Heavenly Father despite their sins - essentially, defeating agency and the divine principal of accountability for action. God the Father chose the plan that he proposed with Jesus as the Savior. Lucifer and his followers rebelled against this plan and were eventually cast out of Heaven and became <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">Satan</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Agency_%28Mormonism%29_3c49.html" title="Edit section: Foreordination">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Foreordination</span></h3>
<p>Mormons further believe that another aspect of agency occurred during the pre-existence. Some of the spirit children of God, so exercised their agency and so conformed to Godâ€™s law as to become "noble and great". This doctrine is called "<a href="../../../p/r/e/Predestination.html" title="Predestination">foreordination</a>". God <i>foreordained</i> men to particular stations in life in order to advance His plan to lead humanity back to His presence. These were foreordained before their mortal births to perform great missions for the Lord in this life as described in the Book of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Abraham_c04c.html" title="Book of Abraham">Abraham</a> in chapter 3, verses 22-23.</p>
<p>Mormons believe that these foreordinations were not unalterable decrees, but rather callings from God for man to perform specific missions in mortality. Even these who were foreordained for greatness could fall and transgress the laws of God. Therefore, mortality is simply a state wherein progression and testing is continued from what began in the pre-existence.</p>
<p>LDS doctrine states that God's plan includes the foreordination of prophets and teachers who have gifts and callings among men to teach and re-teach correct principles so that agency can be used wisely. (Jeremiah 1:5) God's plan includes the important role of parents to teach their children the path of righteousness and happiness (Deuteronomy 6:7), and the blessing of the holy scriptures to give a foundation of gospel knowledge, including the knowledge of the saving role of Jesus Christ and the importance of ordinances and covenants of the gospel.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/e/Agency_%28Mormonism%29_3c49.html" title="Edit section: Earth life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Earth life</span></h2>
<p>In essence, <b>agency</b> is the ability to make choices for oneself, as well as the ability to learn the difference between right and wrong and to make ethical and moral decisions. Most non-human life is not believed to possess this gift, and such life is believed to live in a state of eternal innocence.</p>
<p>David O. McKay, former prophet and president of the Church, stated, "It is the purpose of the Lord that man become like him. In order for man to achieve this it was necessary for the Creator first to make him free."<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[10]</a></sup> Without free agency, mortality would be useless. Men are ultimately responsible for their own destiny, through their faith and obedience to the commandments of God. "Free agency" therefore should not be interpreted to mean that actions are without consequences; "free" means that it is a gift from God and consequences must necessarily come as a result of choices made. Thus free agency and accountability are complementary and cannot be separated.</p>
<p>This principle holds that it is wrong to deny someone of his/her free agency unless they have (criminally) abused it to infringe against the agency of another, as it would bind a person from their own choices. Such offenses logically include crimes such as <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder.html" title="Murder">murder</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">rape</a> and <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slavery</a>. Furthermore, a person who prevents an individual from doing what they have been commanded to do (e.g., force them to do something they believe is wrong) will be held responsible for any offense.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>LDS doctrine teaches that many men and women since the beginning of mortal time have used their agency unwisely, limiting their own progress and their opportunity to receive light and knowledge. Beginning with Cain, some have used their agency to inflict harm, abuse, tyranny, slavery, or death upon others, contrary to the will and commandments of God.</p>
<p>The fact that God allows these actions does not mean that He condones them. LDS doctrine holds that agency is an eternal principle, and that God has provided the way through the atonement of Jesus Christ whereby men and women can repent of their wrongful acts of commission or of omission, and come back into the path of receiving further light and knowledge through making right choices. The atonement of Christ and the plan of compassion among men also provides a way whereby those who have been harmed by the sinful actions of others may be healed in a spiritual sense, although this may take great patience and long-suffering, and often requires the help of others.</p>
<p>The Pearl of Great Price, one of the scriptures of the LDS church, states that Satan, the great deceiver, sought during premortal life to destroy the agency of man (See Moses 4:3), and that he continues to seek to enslave men, women and children in whatever ways that he can in this world, to "lead them captive at his will." (Moses 4:4) LDS doctrine teaches that whatever leads in this world to enslavement, addiction, or forced behavior is ultimately instigated by Satan. God allows these conditions because of the agency He has given to man, but He expects men to overcome evil by doing good among the society in which they live. God holds men and women responsible and accountable in relation to the light and knowledge they have. Every person born into the world is given the light of Christ, also called conscience, to guide each person in choosing good from evil.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>LDS doctrine also holds that whenever gospel knowledge has been lost or limited among portions of mankind, this has come about because of the unrighteousness of the people and their leaders, as described by the prophet Isaiah in the Bible.</p>
<p>LDS leaders teach that family and societal relationships are a part of mortal life for many purposes, including the need to learn to show love, acceptance, and compassion in ways that continue to allow agency. They teach that unrighteous dominion is never acceptable to God, and that with the agency given to men is the expectation that when they marry, they will treat their wife and children with love, respect, tenderness, and material and emotional support. LDS leaders teach that men should treat women as equal partners in all decisions in the family.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

<p>The term free agency is commonly used, and has traditionally been interpreted as meaning that individuals have the ability to choose their actions freely. The term "free agency" should not be interpreted to mean that agency does not have consequences, but rather that agency is fraught with risk and choices (the result of the exercise of agency) determine eternal destination. Some church manuals avoid the term "free agency" and instead say simply "agency."<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

<p>The LDS doctrine of agency holds that the transgression of <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_and_Eve_6ed9.html" title="Adam and Eve">Adam and Eve</a> in eating of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was a necessary part of the Plan of Salvation. If Adam and Eve had not chosen to disobey this particular commandment (given by God to preserve their right to choose), they would have lived in eternal innocence in the Garden of Eden and never known true right and wrong, nor true happiness nor sadness, nor been able to bear children. (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Mormon_f6c8.html" title="Book of Mormon">Book of Mormon</a>, 2 Nephi 2:22-25) As a result of the Fall, Adam and Eve (and their children) learned sadness and remorse, making it possible for them to appreciate the opposite feelings of happiness and peace. (Moses 5:11) Accordingly, while Eve may have been deceived into disobedience, as a result of the Fall the serpent's sabotage was turned against it and the natural expansion of human agency was ensured.</p>
