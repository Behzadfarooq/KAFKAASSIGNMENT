<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fansites</span></h2>
<p>To stop the constant add and revert process from fansite owners, I suggest others should request that their fansite be included from here first. If it is robust enough and there are no objections, we can put it on the main page. We don't want to let these users be a google whore. I included the heavengames fansite since heavengames has been the definitive "age of..." fansite since the original.--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill2k_85ea.html" title="User:Will2k">Will2k</a> 16:47, May 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Honestly, I don't any use to fansites until the game is released. Considering we're threading on sites with potentially duplicate content (as most news are done with press releases, magazine exclusives and speculation), until sites carry unique features such as maps, mods, strat guides and demos they have no place in the article. However, exceptions can, and even should be made with sites large and notable enough, and heavengames is one of them. My suggestion is keeping a collection of links <i>in here</i>, and include in the article as soon as they become more than a collection of gossip/PR or have unique content. <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfenSilva_4751.html" title="User:WolfenSilva"><sup>w</sup>S</a> 16:58, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>HeavenGames, while being a long-standing AoE fansite, is actually limited in its content. If a fan were looking for information on Age of Empires III, there are other sites that do a better job providing content, providing summaries, and providing other sources of information. Yes, there is little room for variation between AoE3 sites at this moment, but the difference between HG and those other sites is that those sites have the necessary information and HG does not. (SoggyFrog 22:32, 26 May 2005 (UTC))</p>
<dl>
<dd>I beg to differ. HeavenGames' AoE3 counterpart has the latest content available on its website. If a fan was looking for information on AoE3, he would be able to find the same general content available at HeavenGames, as well as other fansites (including your own). It's community, while larger, is equally just as important as other fansite communities. I do believe that until the game is released, the Age of Empires III page at Wikipedia should only allow the official links. This way, there would be no partisan, nor repetitive links. No fansite, whether small or large, would gain any larger attention by Wikipedia than any other. Afterall, hasn't the same general information been summed up in AoE3's Wikipedia page? I do believe Wikipedia's policy on external links, particularly fansites, does agree with this stance. Xunny</dd>

<p>AgeSanctuary- new "expert" competitiove recorded games added daily, from the people at the top of the online ranking system. although lacking in hard statistical content, the quantity and quality of the recorded games will teach you more about the game than any amount of number crunching/stats analysing will. users range from 30 to 100+ on at any one time, with several discussions on the game active at any one point(although usually about game balance and specific players/popular strats and less about game content and comparison).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">For Windows 2000</span></h2>
<p>Even though Age of Empires III works perfectly on 2000, Microsoft has made it impossible to install. (Some say this has been done on purpose, to force everyone to upgrade to Win XP) But some people have found a way to go around this.</p>
<p><b>Credit:</b> Following instructions were put together by Timooo</p>
<p><b>To install the full retail version of AOE3 on a win2k system</b>, you must use the <b>command prompt:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Start &gt; <b>Run</b>...</li>
<li>Type in <b>cmd</b> and press <b>OK</b></li>
<li>When the Dos window appears type in <b>D:</b> or which ever letter your cd/dvd rom drive is; then press Enter.</li>
<li>Type in <b>setup /a</b> and press <b>Enter</b>.</li>
<li>Wait for the installation wizard to appear, and press <b>Next</b>.</li>
<li>Then type in the destination as to where you want it to be installed. I recommend using the default path, which is <b>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Age Of Empires 3</b></li>
<li>Press <b>Install</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>(During installation, you might NOT see the install progress bar. Or get an impression of "freezing," but DON'T worry just wait it through!)</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Once you have the game installed and try to run it, you may get an error about a d3dx9_25.dll if this is the case, then you can either download the D3DX April Update from <a href="http://www.toymaker.info/Games/html/d3dx_dlls.html" class="external free" title="http://www.toymaker.info/Games/html/d3dx_dlls.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.toymaker.info/Games/html/d3dx_dlls.html</a> or reinstall DirectX9 completely.</p>
<p>(There is also a folder on cd 1 called DirectX9, you may use that to reinstall.)</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Once you have that done, you may also get another error about <b>MSXML 4</b>; if this is the case then you should install <b>msxml.msi</b> from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displayla%20ng=en&amp;familyid=3144b72b-b4f2-46da-b4b6-c5d7485f2b42&amp;displaylang=en" class="external text" title="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displayla%20ng=en&amp;familyid=3144b72b-b4f2-46da-b4b6-c5d7485f2b42&amp;displaylang=en" rel="nofollow">MSXML 4.0</a></p>
<p><b>How to install The Age of Empires 3 1.01 Update</b></p>
<p>Open up your registry (type "regedit" in the command prompt), navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Microsoft Games/Age of Empires 3/1.0, right click on the right portion of the window and select Add String Value. Name it "SetupPath", then right-click it and Modify it, typing in the full path of your Age of Empires III folder.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Windows XP Problem: Fixing D3dx9_95.dll not Found Error</span></h2>
<p>Due to some issues with latest versions of Windows XP, when you launch AOE3 game, some people often get "The application has failed to start because d3dx9_25.dll was not found. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.". If you have Direct X 9.0b preinstalled, no matter how many times you update to Direct X 9.0c, it wont update at all. This is the most notorious problem often pop up with many people. I found a very useful site, where you can fix this problem here: <a href="http://gamecrashes.com/4-29-30.htm" class="external text" title="http://gamecrashes.com/4-29-30.htm" rel="nofollow">GameCrashes.com - Age of Empires 3 D3dx9_95.dll Fix</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">More Controversy</span></h2>
<p>Has anyone mentioned the outrage over Ensemble hocking video cards from NVIDIA and how superior cards don't work as well because they made some sort of deal with NVIDIA?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Seems to me like a supporter for another video card company wants to put down the video card he doesn't like. I mean, I have a Radeon 9200, and I'd suggest it to other people... even though I've never tried an nVidia card, it's the same thing with this dude, except he's taking it a step further. Sad people should be shot, really&#160;:P</dd>
<dd>As for the controversy, it's just rumour, so far, and so I doubt it should be in wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKareeser_8b5c.html" title="User:Kareeser">Kareeser</a> 05:23, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I'm not supporting another card, just pointing out that it only seems to work with NVIDIA. It says right in the back of the guide that only certain features work with NVIDIA. Also, check out the online forums and you'll hear from plenty of people with their own experience.</dd>

<dd>Oh, no, no, I wasn't blaming you or anything, I was just trying to explain it as best as I could understand it. I did a brief look-through of the user's manual, with no results.</dd>
<dd>Also, it is very likely that Ensemble decided to build upon technologies that were not invented yet. In fact, I <i>think</i> that's what Bruce Shelley said in his interview (don't quote me on that). In that case, perhaps nVidia let Ensemble know what they had planned, while ATI or others didn't think that sharing their up and coming technology was the right idea... would you give away an abstract of your secret invention if somebody asked for it?&#160;;) <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKareeser_8b5c.html" title="User:Kareeser">Kareeser</a> 02:50, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In any case, i think it's unfortunate that the game was designed <i>primarily</i> for the computers of tomorrow. The game will be great in 2 years when all our systems can handle it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Interesting thought... but I suppose that ESO is taking a risk in investing in the technology of tomorrow.</dd>
<dd>If they can get past the rocky ground (now) where most computers can't handle the game, then the game will still be a hit in the future. A lot of games have high hopes, but they just don't quite get there because they become outdated way too quickly... <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKareeser_8b5c.html" title="User:Kareeser">Kareeser</a> 08:06, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Game Cards examples</span></h2>
<p>I have written the entire Home City and Game Cards section (sections 7 and 7.1 respectively).</p>
<p>If you see any errors or clarifications, feel free to update them as needed.</p>
<p>Some points of interest:</p>
<p>1) I have no idea how many experience points it takes for the spanish to earn a shipment. If you play spanish, can you take a look at the "mercantilism" upgrade and update the page for us? =)</p>
<p>2) The examples for the game cards are very stilted towards the British, mainly because I play the Brits. Musketeers, Longbowmen, musketeer upgrades, etc... If you want to add some variety (Rodeleros, doppelsoldners, whatever), feel free, but in the interest of conciseness, please keep it to two examples per category (technology, resource, etc).</p>

<dd>I reworded it a little bit, but there's one part I'm still unclear of.

<dd>Just a very small point - not all of the ships are techincally part of a navy. According to the <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_English_Dictionary_872c.html" title="Oxford English Dictionary">OED</a>, a navy is "the branch of a state’s armed services which conducts military operations at sea." Whilst this applies to galleons and monitors (for example), it does not apply to fishing ships. I would agree with Kareeser and say that we need another name for it. Whilst "seafaring units" or plain old "ships" would be best, I'm sure naval units would be acceptable.

<dd>As far as I know, the formations exist under "advanced formations" in the options menu. The formations are practically useless, but there's one that helps avoid cannon fire (I guess splash damage doesn't apply?), and one that helps against ranged units...</dd>

<p>HMAS= Her Majesty's Australian Ship. Pretty sure the Endeavor wasn't Australian though, because it was Cook's ship on the journey when he actually discovered Australia. So it'd probably be HMS Endeavor.</p>
<p>It was definitely HMS <b>Endeavour</b>. (<i>Journals of Captain Cook</i> - Cpt.

<p>I believe it constitutes an <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> violation due to its biased nature. It was implied that Ensemble Studios purposefully made the game that way, and that simply isn't a proven statement.</p>

<p>Secondly, the facts were wrong. Once players in a game room in ESO begin their game, all players disconnect from ESO immediately and connect directly to the host server. It is the host server's responsibility to keep information fed to the slave computers. In many cases, because of slow processor speed or slow internet speed, this cannot be done (perhaps a 1.4 GHz in an 8 player game!), and an out-of-sync error occurs, which is what your "intermittent disconnections" are. I've corrected this in the article. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKareeser_8b5c.html" title="User:Kareeser">Kareeser</a> 17:13, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have tested this game and it's demo on my <a href="../../../d/e/l/Dell%2C_Inc._253d.html" title="Dell, Inc.">Dell</a> lattitude laptop. It ran fine on a P4 1.8 GHz processor and an ATI Mobility <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radeon.html" title="Radeon">Radeon</a> 7000 card with 32 megabytes of onboard memory. I was able to run the game fine upto 1400×1050 <a href="../../../d/i/s/Display_resolution.html" title="Display resolution">resolution</a>. This was very surprising for me, because I got decent framerates, the game was playable. The laptop was running Windows XP.</p>
<p>Could this be verified by somebody else and included in the main article? --BorisFromStockdale 23:43, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think it's alright, because I've already included a notice that the game will run, though not at optimal speed. My friend has a laptop with 8MB of graphical memory, and it'll run... =P <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKareeser_8b5c.html" title="User:Kareeser">Kareeser</a>|<a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKareeser_7817.html" title="User talk:Kareeser"><sup>Talk!</sup></a> 06:25, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This is great, but in the main article it says "One does not have to meet the above requirements (except for using Windows XP)". My laptop WAS running Windows XP, so I think this comment about meeting the requirements in XP should be taken out. --BorisFromStockdale 20:45, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I believe that the game won't install unless the computer is running Windows XP... copying the game folder/registry entries into other Windows OS' doesn't seem to be factual enough for me. How exactly did you install your copy, and what operating system do you have? <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKareeser_8b5c.html" title="User:Kareeser">Kareeser</a>|<a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKareeser_7817.html" title="User talk:Kareeser"><sup>Talk!</sup></a> 00:20, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think you misunderstood my prior comment. I was running this game under Windows XP. What I am suggesting, is to take the comment "(except for using Windows XP)" out of the requirements section of the main article. In my oppinion this comment suggests that the requirements have to be met in XP, but do not need to be met under other operating systems. In my oppinion the game runs even if the minimum system requrements are not me under Windows XP (I have actually tested this). What are your Suggestions? --BorisFromStockdale 02:12, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The command responses are usually gibberish based on their language of origin. This is used throughout the series. It is, however, possible that they use archaic forms of the modern language. One example that is not gibberish is 'Je le ferrais' for the French villagers - 'I will do it'. <a href="../../../c/k/_/User%7ECk_lostsword_60ea.html" title="User:Ck lostsword">Ck lostsword</a> 17:08, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Graphics Card</span></h2>
<p>I really don't know what graphics card to get. In a screenshot at the article it showed a screenshot with the Nvidia 6600 at the highest settings. If logic serves me correctly the numbers should represent how powerful a graphics card is, correct? The problem is I found at a shop the Nvidia 7300 was much cheaper than the Nvidia 6X00.I looked at the back of the boxes and they both agree that the 7X00 is much better than the 6X00.However though the price difference confuses me. The 6X00 could have been a bonus package. So in short, what graphics card should I get? Does it even have to be a Nvidia product? <a href="../../../7/2/2E/User%7E72.197.133.100.html" title="User:72.197.133.100">72.197.133.100</a> 23:26, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_size_0593.html" title="Wikipedia:Article size">Wikipedia:Article size</a> for more info.

<dd>I second that. It'd be for (almost) everyone's interest if we can actually move all of the unit/building/civ information to WikiBooks or at least to other sections. Those looking for detailed information (hp, attack, bonus damage) about one unit aren't going to be satisfied with what's in the article and those who come here to check out some general information like who made this game aren't going to be flabbergasted by the fact that Germans have another kind of settlers. If there are no objections I plan to make these adjustments myself in the near future.
