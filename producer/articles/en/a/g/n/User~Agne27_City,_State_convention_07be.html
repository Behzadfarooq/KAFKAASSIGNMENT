<p>The City, State convention was developed for a reason and has served the Wikipedia community well. It covers all practical needs that an article title should fill. In contrast to the alternative, the City, State conventions offers several benefits including...</p>
<ol>
<li>Consistency and Stability</li>
<li>History and Precision</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="Consistency_and_Stability" id="Consistency_and_Stability"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_City%2C_State_convention_07be.html" title="Edit section: Consistency and Stability">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Consistency and Stability</span></h3>
<p>First consider the <i>Inconsistency</i> and <i>Instability</i> of the alternative.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is virtually impossible to have no ambiguity issues with every US City and most likely even the <i>majority</i> of the US cities will have ambiguity issues, especially with fellow cities. Therefore, the convention is at the mercy of potential subjective standards for "exceptions" that have CITYNAME only titles. This creates inherent and broad scale inconsistency among all articles as we have unambiguous names like <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assawoman%2C_Virginia_0587.html" title="Assawoman, Virginia">Assawoman, Virginia</a> and ambiguous names like <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portland%2C_Oregon_1e41.html" title="Portland, Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portland%2C_Maine_d298.html" title="Portland, Maine">Portland, Maine</a>. Consistency with exceptions is for all practical purposes an <a href="../../../o/x/y/Oxymoron.html" title="Oxymoron">oxymoron</a>.</li>
<li>With the potential "subjective" standard for creating "exceptions", the whims of a changing editor base on any given City article (or outside philosophically driven editors) could fashion new or demolish old standards on what qualifies as an exception endlessly. <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia.html" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> maybe considered an exception now but 6 months from now it may not. Yes, it is the nature of the wiki but the fundamental question is whether this instability is beneficial to the article, much less the project?</li>
<li>The standards for "Ambiguity" could change as well. While <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assawoman%2C_Virginia_0587.html" title="Assawoman, Virginia">Assawoman, Virginia</a> is currently the only <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assawoman.html" title="Assawoman">Assawoman</a> article on Wikipedia, there very well could be another use of the name that comes along that supplant Assawoman, VA for "primary use" of that name. (A porn star, a band, a Suzanne Summer's exercise device?) This would require another page move request. Unlike redirects and top billing on a disambig page, article titles are bit more serious of a deal and shouldn't be at the whim of changing "primary topic" consideration.</li>
</ol>
<p><br />
The City, State convention is the <b>ONLY</b> convention that has the potential to be a consistent and stable naming convention. Obviously, this consistency and stability needs a strong affirmation in the Naming Convention Guideline that would discourage "philosophical" page move request. But evaluating the matter on a purely practical scale, the consistency and stability is evident.</p>
<ol>
<li>Every city can conform to the City, State standard with no need for exceptions.</li>
<li>An article titled <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston%2C_Texas_c0fa.html" title="Houston, Texas">Houston, Texas</a> leaves no doubt at to what the article is about. Furthermore, the likelihood of <i>another</i> "Houston, Texas" appearing to cause confusion is exceedingly slim.</li>
<li>There is only two instability threats-that either the city or the state change their name. The "city" name change threat is shared equal with the "CITYNAME-only" convention and is MUCH MORE likely to every happen then if an entire State changes it name.</li>
<li>There is no practical need for a shorter "CITYNAME only" title since the practical use of redirects prevents a reader wanting to search for or link to the city article from having to type any extra keystrokes. Hence, there is no practical need for a page move request, only philosophical ones.</li>
</ol>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_City%2C_State_convention_07be.html" title="Edit section: History and Precision">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History and Precision</span></h3>
<p>At the risk of offending any <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federalist.html" title="Federalist">Federalists</a> among us, the US is a composition of STATES that belong to a union. While Americans (and residents of any US city) do think of themselves in the broad context of their country, they are first and foremost citizens of their state. Conversely, a city is first and foremost a location within a state. History lays the groundwork of the intimate connection between a City and the State, almost to the extent of a FIRST NAME and LAST NAME relationship. To everyone that is familiar with Bob Smith, he is known as Bob. However, the intimate connection to his last name "Smith" is always present and he will always be Bob Smith. Chicago is known by those familiar and referring to it in an informal sort of way as Chicago, but it will <i>always</i> be <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago%2C_Illinois_2106.html" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago, Illinois</a>. The argument that a CITYNAME-only is the most common name for a city presents a context that the City, State name is <i>uncommon</i> which is obviously not the case.<br />
Furthermore, the benefit of precision can not be understated. A City, State name leave no doubt of what the article is about. This serves the <b>PURPOSE</b> of a title to a "T" and is of the most service to the reader. Ideally, a reader with an initial awareness of a subject (i.e. that there is a City named Chicago) should be able to look at an article title and be confident that they are at the right page instead of having to read the article BODY to know if that is the case and they didn't end up on one of the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_%28band%29.html" title="Chicago (band)">other "Chicago"</a> pages. A title like <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago%2C_Illinois_2106.html" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago, Illinois</a> does the trick MUCH better then a singular CITYNAME only title like <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> ever could. Additionally, for those not even familiar with a city like <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assawoman.html" title="Assawoman">Assawoman</a> will be more aware of the fact that it is a city when it's connected to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assawoman%2C_Virginia_0587.html" title="Assawoman, Virginia">Assawoman, Virginia</a>. (For more on this and potential strawman response see the faulty argument section below).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_City%2C_State_convention_07be.html" title="Edit section: Ambiguity and Disambiguation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ambiguity and Disambiguation</span></h3>
<p>The vast majority of US City have another city or item that shares the same name. The existence of a disambiguation page shows <i>some level</i> of ambiguity. So what level of "ambiguity" do we care about? Ambiguity with another location? Ambiguity with an American object/concept/person?<br />
This is a bit different from a cut and dry application of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html#Primary_topic" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Wikipedia:Disambiguation#Primary_topic</a> because an article title does more then just convey the "notability" or "primary usage" of a subject. In contrast, consideration made in where redirects go or what gets top billing on a disambig page <i>DO</i> make ample use of what the primary usage is or how notable each use is. But an article title is meant to convey, above all else, <b>PRECISELY</b> what the article is about.<br />
<i>So how well does the CITYNAME only title convey the subject matter of the article?</i> Or to put it another way, how likely will a "Random Article" search reader be able to discern what the article is about based on the CITYNAME alone? To that extent, we have to consider WHO that reader might be. Considering the diverse readership of the English Wikipedia we need to keep in mind a couple prudent points.</p>
<ol>
<li>The reader is not always going to be American. There is a stereotypical "American arrogance" in the assumption that every relatively large American city is as intimately familiar to those abroad as they are here. The Wiki-effect, we see can be shown in a demonstrated <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">US centric bias</a> that we need to avoid at all cost.</li>
<li>Even if the reader is American there is always the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Tonight_Show_with_Jay_Leno_a4a6.html" title="The Tonight Show with Jay Leno">"Jaywalking Principle"</a>, which (loosely and crudely stated) is the ignorance of the average American should never be underestimated. What might be "obvious" and "familiar" to you might not be so obvious and familiar to the average American surfing Wikipedia.</li>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>Reply</b> The "Common Names" is not the predominant naming convention that trumps all others. It is improper and a complete misrepresentation of that guideline to quote it in such a manner. In fact, WP:NC (CN) explicitly says in the nutshell summary <i>"Except where other accepted Wikipedia naming conventions give a different indication, use the most common name of a person or thing that does not conflict with the names of other people or things"</i> These other naming conventions include the existing <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28settlements%29_904f.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (settlements)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (settlements)</a> and the <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28precision%29_9b4a.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (precision)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (precision)</a> which also notes the particular purpose of an article title to begin with. <i>"Article titles give the reader an idea of what they can expect within an article."</i> Ideally, a good title can convey precisely what the subject of an article is about. Consider the effectiveness of a title when a reader, hitting the "Random Article" button comes across <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a> versus a CITYNAME alone <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a> title which could mean anything from the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_%28band%29.html" title="Boston (band)">band</a>, the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_%28Hasidic_dynasty%29_161f.html" title="Boston (Hasidic dynasty)">dynasty</a>, the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_%28dance%29.html" title="Boston (dance)">dance</a>, or even the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Lincolnshire_00fb.html" title="Boston, Lincolnshire">original city</a> or one of the several other cities with the name "Boston". Of course, as soon as you read the article you "hopefully" begin to realize what the article is about but the effectiveness of the title is diminished with the CITYNAME only title while the City, State title does the trick perfectly.

<dl>
<dd><b>Reply</b> Those are good examples but I think we then hit the fundamental difference between a LOCATION and a thing or concept which the examples are. The geographic coordinates 41°54′N 87°39′W refers to the <i>location</i> of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago%2C_Illinois_2106.html" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago, Illinois</a> and not just the city of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> and it is very unique in it's own right. The state of Illinois has every claim to that land as the city itself. In contrast the concept of a "game", the mathematical concept, the color concept, the myth and the measurement do not hold such connection to above examples. It does not make the article title anymore complete or precise to include those concepts. The City, State convention <i>does</i> make the title of any US city more complete and more precise.
<dl>
<dd><b>Strawman Alert</b> <i>"Well if you really want to precise how about Chicago, Illinois, USA, North America, Planet Earth?"</i> The connection of a City to its state (especially in the United <i>States</i>) is a stronger, more intimate connection then the farther reaching disambiguation. Plus, again going back to the "Random Article" reader, coming across an article titled <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago%2C_Illinois_2106.html" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago, Illinois</a> is going to convey <i>precisely</i> what it is about--just like its purpose as a title is to do. There is no need to go further.</dd>

<dd><b>Reply</b> <a href="../../../o/p/r/Oprah.html" title="Oprah">Oprah</a> redirects to the article <a href="../../../o/p/r/Oprah_Winfrey_92a2.html" title="Oprah Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a> and is probably even the most common name that she is referred by. There is also no known disambiguation issue. However, it is not the most appropriate title for the article. The issue is not really about ambiguity (either the presence or the absence). The issue is about what is the most appropriate title. Furthermore, The existence of a redirect is not a motivating reason to move the page to that title. We could use the same level of validity in the above argument and try to contend that the page on the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican Party (United States)</a> be move to the redirect title of <a href="../../../g/o/p/GOP_7607.html" title="GOP">GOP</a> or <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> to the redirect direct title of <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a>.

<dd><b>Reply</b> The article is about a location which happens to be located at CITY, STATE like <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wenham%2C_Massachusetts_3639.html" title="Wenham, Massachusetts">Wenham, Massachusetts</a>. It requires a significant degree of ignorance on the reader's behalf to think the "CITYNAME" is Wenham, Massachusetts (with the subsequent postal address being Wenham, Massachusetts , MA 01984). However it would be accurate for the reader to determine that the <i>location</i> name is Wenham, Massachusetts. In contrast to confusion, the City, State convention can actually lessen confusion for the reader in that the addition of the potentially more recognizable statename can help the reader immediately recognize that the article is about a location. With the previous example, how many readers would stumble upon an article titled only <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wenham.html" title="Wenham">Wenham</a> and wonder "What the heck is a Wenham?". Or "What is an <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assawoman.html" title="Assawoman">Assawoman</a>?", "What is a <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smackover.html" title="Smackover">Smackover</a>?", or "What is a <a href="../../../b/u/c/Bucksnort.html" title="Bucksnort">Bucksnort</a>?" etc. The article's subject being a location is much more clear when it is labeled as <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assawoman%2C_Virginia_0587.html" title="Assawoman, Virginia">Assawoman, Virginia</a>, <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smackover%2C_Arkansas_9eb0.html" title="Smackover, Arkansas">Smackover, Arkansas</a>, and <a href="../../../b/u/c/Bucksnort%2C_Tennessee_c457.html" title="Bucksnort, Tennessee">Bucksnort, Tennessee</a>.</dd>

<ul>
<li><i>A world famous city like CITYNAME should be treated consistently with other world famous cities, both inside and outside of the U.S. (Chicago, New York City, Philadelphia, Paris, London, Montreal, etc.)</i> AND <i>"The other countries have a CITYNAME only convention"</i></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>Reply</b> The US naming convention most likely has the largest article scope in the English encyclopedia due to the size of the US and number of US cities with articles in contrast to other countries. The closest is probably Canada. To that extent, it is not really beneficial to try and compare this "large scope" naming convention to those of countries with significantly fewer articles that are affected. The merit and benefits of the US naming convention (and the thousands of city articles it covers) should be weighed on it's own.</dd>
<dd>As for the "world class" contention, the definition of "world class" is very subjective as the current "exception" of <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia.html" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> shows. Out of the 6 above, Philadelphia seems to be fit with the Sesame Street song <i>"One of these things is not like the other..."</i>. This is not to disparage the city of Philadelphia but it highlights a fault in the page move system when the editors of a particular city article are asked to determine if the city (of which they may have a personal connection to) is a "World City" or a "World Class City"--whatever that means. Nearly ever relatively large US city will have editors thinking it is a World Class city--something that a Middle Schooler in South Africa might not agree with.</dd>
<dd>For the "World Class" city argument to have any weight, two things must be demonstrated.
<dl>
<dd>1.) That there is an objective standard to define "World Class City" that is free of a US centric bias.</dd>
<dd>2.) That there is a distinct benefit to the article (and such, for the reader) in having these "World Class Cities" distinguished with a CITYNAME only title and be inconsistent with the rest of the US city articles. World Class City vs. Consistency.</dd>

<ul>
<li><i>CITYNAME is better known than STATENAME.'</i></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>Reply</b> This maybe true. But for the VAST majority of US city article this is not. (See the above examples like <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assawoman%2C_Virginia_0587.html" title="Assawoman, Virginia">Assawoman, Virginia</a>). Again we would have to go counter to consistency to accommodate the (relatively) few cities with more familiarity then their statename.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, if a city is familiar then it location within the United <i>States</i> is familiar. As the country name unequivocally proclaims, this country is a federation of STATES and the identity of every city is intimately connected with the state that it resides in--more so then even the country. If you are talking to our hypothetical middle schooler in South Africa and want to convey that you are from <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia.html" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, you would probably say you are from Philadelphia, USA. How would we convey the location place to that same middle schooler with our Wikipedia article title? The naming convention explicitly prohibits us from titling encyclopedia articles with USA in the title. Yet, the same lack of familiarity about Philadelphia that the middle schooler has still persists. The next best thing is to include the include the STATE in title which helps to convey the country of origin as the United <i>States</i>. While we can not accommodate every level of "unfamiliarity" or "ignorance" that any reader of the english wikipedia may have, having the best possible title will ensure that we are reaching as broad of an audience as possible. The CITYNAME only title excludes quite a bit.</dd>
