	    <p>AGNES no longer exists and I do think that it is important to see how this gallery shaped some of the artists along the way. I will flesh out what I can of the gallery and give more specifics. Since there is no longer a gallery, per se, I dont think this is an issue of blatant advertising or will it benefit the gallery except to say give credit where credit is due.</p>
<p>This gallery AGNES was certainly an anomaly and was not opened to make money but to broaden people's awareness though photo-journalism and conversation. I recall that Agnes was picketed more than any other gallery and also ended up in USA Today on one occasion. It was also the first private gallery to honor "A Day Without Art"</p>
<p>This in and of itself would be enough to list it</p>
<p>as you can see I am tryng to flesh this out</p>

<p>the reference to Agnes was supposed to be AGNES .......not Agnes Because you found a tyop in one article doesnt mean that AGNES was ever Agnes <i>... contributed by <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtintegrated_b121.html" title="User:Artintegrated">Artintegrated</a></i></p>

<p>We read that the gallery was</p>

<dd><i>dedicated to Social Awareness, dealing with cancer, death, environmental issues, racism, classism, AIDS, prisons as well as civil rights issues</i></dd>

<p>This is very odd, in view of the list of photographers. Take <a href="../../../o/2E/_/O._Winston_Link_dd9e.html" title="O. Winston Link">O. Winston Link</a> for example: nothing I read in the WP article about him and nothing I remember from an essay about him that I recently read suggests that any of his work was in any way related to this. What's at fault: the description of the gallery, the list of photographers exhibited, or my understanding of these photographers? -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 04:31, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think maybe O. Winston Link came in because of his use of the locomotive steam engine I dunno.</p>
<p>This other artist named Bart Michels did alot of wrok for the TVA Tennessee Valley Authority about areas recreated or man-made Interesting and also Volker Seding who did this whole expose on zoos across the world as a way to help animals to have a better more natural environment. Has stuff from over 50 zoos around the world. Interesting artists</p>

<dd>What have locomotives got to do with social awareness (cancer, death, etc.)? If the answer is, as I guess, "nothing at all", then it's strange (or plain wrong) to say that the gallery was "dedicated" to "social awareness". -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 06:13, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>After some thought and consideration on my part, I see AGNES showed work by some of the WPA artists and also Bart Michels. this said then it would have had to be how locomotives changed things just like Michels work is about how TVA changed things. Change sometimes is something that most people fear in the South so maybe if there was more awareness of how change is good and show work that compares photographs of things were before vs. how things were after then public would have a better understanding and see the differences for what they are. This would have had to have been the case here. Even in Sedings Zoo work the earliest photographs were very spare, austere and contained if compared to the new more lush animal settings and environments. So I summize that in the case of O. Winston Link this must had been in the same vein otherwise it would have not worked. If you are not happy then I suggest dropping O. Winston Link fromthe group because I know the gallery was about social awareness and just saw they they had shown O. Winston Link's work. Maybe Link had something to show besides his typical work.</p>

<dd>Link's rail work was not at all about how rail changed society. But OK, let's skip Link and go to Bernhard. She concentrated on studio work, notably nudes.

<p>The big problem is that the article is a terrible mess. It tends to say things twice, or leave them incoherent. I don't know anything about Agnes (or "AGNES") other than what I read here; others are more qualified than I am. Couldn't somebody whip the article into a better shape? -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 16:37, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>A couple of days will give me a chance to work on it more Out of town guests here so maybe I can whip it into better shape very soon. thank you for helping me out as much as you have. Any suggestions on what is needed most beside it tending to say things twic? Also, What type of articles are needed to make it more coherent?</p>
<p>Thank Hoary</p>

<dd>First, the claims made in the article for the significance of the gallery need the citation of sources. (They don't have to be web pages; they could be books, etc.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, avoid inline external links, other than in footnotes and lists near the foot of the article titled "External links".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thirdly, there are now two lists of "artists" (i.e. photographers, I suppose). First, <i>AGNES worked with many artists .... along the way to further their message.</i> Secondly, a list of artists. Does there have to be duplication; and if so, why? Does "working along the way with an artist to further his or her message" mean something other than "exhibiting", and if so, what? -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 01:56, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, I agree this article is a mess. Despite these well voiced concerns, it keeps getting worse. Wikipedia is not a directory or a list. Yet this article seems to be nothing but a vehicle for listing every artist who ever stepped foot into the gallery. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMindsEye_e83c.html" title="User:TheMindsEye">TheMindsEye</a> 15:16, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
