<p><b>Agnes Macphail</b> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/March_24.html" title="March 24">March 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/9/1890.html" title="1890">1890</a> — <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_12.html" title="February 12">February 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>) was the first <a href="../../../w/o/m/Woman.html" title="Woman">woman</a> to be elected to the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canadian</a> <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_House_of_Commons_f3ab.html" title="Canadian House of Commons">House of Commons</a>, and one of the first two women elected to the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legislative_Assembly_of_Ontario_b4b4.html" title="Legislative Assembly of Ontario">Legislative Assembly of Ontario</a>. Active throughout her life in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressivism.html" title="Progressivism">progressive</a> <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Canada_67dc.html" title="Politics of Canada">Canadian politics</a>, Macphail worked for two separate parties and promoted her ideas through column-writing, activist organizing, and legislation.</p>
<p><b>Agnes Campbell McPhail</b> was born to Dougald McPhail and Henrietta Campbell in <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dundalk%2C_Ontario_a34d.html" title="Dundalk, Ontario">Proton Township</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_County%2C_Ontario_f86d.html" title="Grey County, Ontario">Grey County, Ontario</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_24.html" title="March 24">March 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/9/1890.html" title="1890">1890</a>. In the early years of her life, Agnes was called "McPhail", but after visiting Scotland on a trip this changed. She rediscovered her familial roots and the traditionally spelling of "Macphail" (with no capital 'P' as in MacPhail).</p>
<p>Attending the teachers college in <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stratford%2C_Ontario_64fd.html" title="Stratford, Ontario">Stratford</a>, she taught in schools in southwest Ontario. While working in <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharon%2C_Ontario_783b.html" title="Sharon, Ontario">Sharon</a>, Macphail became active politically, joining the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Farmers_of_Ontario_0476.html" title="United Farmers of Ontario">United Farmers of Ontario</a> (UFO) and its women's organization, the United Farm Women of Ontario. She also became a columnist for the <i>Farmers' Sun</i> around this time.</p>
<p>Macphail was elected to the House of Commons as a member of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Party_of_Canada_d4f7.html" title="Progressive Party of Canada">Progressive Party of Canada</a> for the Grey Southeast <a href="../../../r/i/d/Riding.html" title="Riding">riding</a> in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1921.html" title="Canadian federal election, 1921">1921 federal election</a>. She was the first woman <a href="../../../m/e/m/Member_of_Parliament_22d1.html" title="Member of Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> (MP) in Canada. Macphail was re-elected in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1925.html" title="Canadian federal election, 1925">1925</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1926.html" title="Canadian federal election, 1926">1926</a>, and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1930.html" title="Canadian federal election, 1930">1930 federal elections</a>.</p>
<p>In 1935, Macphail was again elected, this time as a UFO-<a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28Canada%29_104c.html" title="Labour Party (Canada)">Labour</a> MP for the Grey Bruce riding. As a member of the UFO, and she was a strong voice for rural issues. Another one of Macphail's issues was penal reform; her efforts led to the formation of the investigative <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archambault_Commission_8766.html" title="Archambault Commission">Archambault Commission</a> in 1936. Macphail's concern for women in the criminal justice system led her, in 1939, to found the <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Fry_Society_of_Canada_f7fe.html" title="Elizabeth Fry Society of Canada">Elizabeth Fry Society of Canada</a>, named after <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> reformer <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Fry_f8c2.html" title="Elizabeth Fry">Elizabeth Fry</a>.</p>
<p>As a radical member of the Progressive Party, Macphail joined the socialist <a href="../../../g/i/n/Ginger_Group_9e64.html" title="Ginger Group">Ginger Group</a>, faction of the Progressive Party that later led to the formation of the <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cooperative_Commonwealth_Federation_56ff.html" title="Cooperative Commonwealth Federation">Cooperative Commonwealth Federation</a> (CCF). She became the first president of the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_New_Democratic_Party_0991.html" title="Ontario New Democratic Party">Ontario CCF</a> in 1933. However, she left the CCF in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a> when the United Farmers of Ontario pulled out due to fears of Communist influence in the Ontario CCF. While Maphail was no longer formally a CCF member, she remained close to the CCF MPs and often participated in caucus meetings. The CCF did not run candidates against Macphail in her three subsequent federal campaigns.</p>
<p>Causes she championed included <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_security.html" title="Social security">pensions for seniors</a> and workers' rights. MacPhail was also the first Canadian woman delegate to the <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Nations_d214.html" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a> in <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva%2C_Switzerland_d755.html" title="Geneva, Switzerland">Geneva</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, where she worked with the World Disarmament Committee. Although a <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacifism.html" title="Pacifism">pacifist</a>, she voted for Canada to enter <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1940.html" title="Canadian federal election, 1940">1940 election</a>, she was defeated. With the death of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Reform_71dc.html" title="United Reform">United Reform</a> MP for Saskatoon City, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_George_Brown_da4c.html" title="Walter George Brown">Walter George Brown</a>, a few days after the election, MacPhail was recruited by the United Reform Movement to run in the by-election to fill the seat, but was defeated by 700 votes.</p>
<p>Out of office, she wrote agricultural columns for the <i><a href="../../../g/l/o/Globe_and_Mail_1d03.html" title="Globe and Mail">Globe and Mail</a></i> newspaper in Toronto. Following a family tragedy in her home town, Macphail moved to the Toronto suburb of <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_York%2C_Ontario_425e.html" title="East York, Ontario">East York, Ontario</a> and rejoined the Ontario CCF in 1942 becoming its farm organizer.</p>

At that time, Macphail was barely able to support herself through journalism, public speaking and organizing for the Ontario CCF.</p>
<p>Macphail never married. She died <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_13.html" title="February 13">February 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>, aged 63, in <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>, just before she was to have been offered an appointment to the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Senate_c1b3.html" title="Canadian Senate">Canadian Senate</a>.

There is also an apartment building in <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windsor%2C_Ontario_57c6.html" title="Windsor, Ontario">Windsor</a>, Ontario named after her ("Agnes Macphail Manor" at 860 Mercer Street).</p>

On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_24.html" title="June 24">June 24</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, a <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cairn.html" title="Cairn">cairn</a> commemorating Agnes Macphail's life was unveiled in <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southgate%2C_Ontario_2852.html" title="Southgate, Ontario">Hopeville, Southgate Township</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_County_fc91.html" title="Grey County">Grey County, Ontario</a>.
