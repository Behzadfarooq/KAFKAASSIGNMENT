<p>Moorehead was born in <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinton%2C_Massachusetts_f266.html" title="Clinton, Massachusetts">Clinton, Massachusetts</a> of <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_people.html" title="English people">English</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_people.html" title="Irish people">Irish</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_people.html" title="Scottish people">Scottish</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welsh_people.html" title="Welsh people">Welsh</a> ancestry, the only child of a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterian.html" title="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> minister. She later shaved six years off her age by claiming to have been born in 1906. She grew up in <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis%2C_Missouri_7f9c.html" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a>, and was graduated from Central High School in 1918.</p>
<p>Moorehead earned a <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor%27s_degree.html" title="Bachelor's degree">bachelor's degree</a>, with a major in <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biology.html" title="Biology">biology</a>, from <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muskingum_College_571e.html" title="Muskingum College">Muskingum College</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Concord%2C_Ohio_a92e.html" title="New Concord, Ohio">New Concord, Ohio</a> in 1923. (She later received an honorary <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctorate.html" title="Doctorate">doctorate</a> in literature from Muskingum, and served for a year on its board of trustees.) When her family moved to <a href="../../../r/e/e/Reedsburg%2C_Wisconsin_dd41.html" title="Reedsburg, Wisconsin">Reedsburg, Wisconsin</a>, she taught public school for five years in <a href="../../../s/o/l/Soldiers_Grove%2C_Wisconsin_cc48.html" title="Soldiers Grove, Wisconsin">Soldiers Grove, Wisconsin</a>, while earning a <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master%27s_degree.html" title="Master's degree">master's degree</a> in <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> and public speaking at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Wisconsin-Madison_a81d.html" title="University of Wisconsin-Madison">University of Wisconsin</a> in <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madison%2C_Wisconsin_c802.html" title="Madison, Wisconsin">Madison</a>.

Although Moorehead's <i>New York Times</i> death notice (May 1, 1974) states that she attained a doctoral degree from Bradley University, in fact Bradley University did not offer doctoral degrees in literature at the time. Moorehead did receive an honorary doctoral degree from Bradley University.</p>

<p>During her career, Moorehead's varied performances established her as one of Hollywood's premier character actresses. She appeared in many of the best known films of the time including <i><a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen_Kane_0ced.html" title="Citizen Kane">Citizen Kane</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Magnificent_Ambersons_f3e4.html" title="The Magnificent Ambersons">The Magnificent Ambersons</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Belinda_053e.html" title="Johnny Belinda">Johnny Belinda</a></i>. Her film debut was as the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Foster_Kane_1584.html" title="Charles Foster Kane">title character</a>'s mother in <i>Citizen Kane</i>. She famously won the New York Film Critics award as Best Actress for <i>The Magnificent Ambersons</i>, but was reduced to a nomination as Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars. She was nominated for multiple Academy Awards (1942, 1944, 1948, 1964), all as Best Supporting Actress, including a final nomination as the suspicious maid in <i><a href="../../../h/u/s/Hush%E2%80%A6_Hush%2C_Sweet_Charlotte_8eeb.html" title="Hush… Hush, Sweet Charlotte">Hush… Hush, Sweet Charlotte</a></i>.</p>
<p>She skillfully portrayed puritanical matrons, neurotic spinsters, possessive mothers, and comical secretaries throughout her career. Moorehead was part of <a href="../../../o/r/s/Orson_Welles_8fe7.html" title="Orson Welles">Orson Welles</a>' <i><a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercury_Theater_on_the_Air_2503.html" title="Mercury Theater on the Air">Mercury Theater on the Air</a></i> <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio.html" title="Radio">radio</a> program in the 1930s and appeared in <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadway_theatre.html" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> productions of <i><a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Juan_in_Hell_89f0.html" title="Don Juan in Hell">Don Juan in Hell</a></i> in 1951-1952, and <i>Lord Pengo</i> in 1962-1963. During the 1940s and 1950s, she was one of the most in demand actresses for radio dramas, and in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a> starred in the legendary radio suspense play <i><a href="../../../s/o/r/Sorry%2C_Wrong_Number_1344.html" title="Sorry, Wrong Number">Sorry, Wrong Number</a></i>, written by <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucille_Fletcher_458c.html" title="Lucille Fletcher">Lucille Fletcher</a>. Moorehead played a selfish, neurotic woman who overhears a murder being plotted via crossed phone wires who eventually realizes she is the intended victim. She recreated the performance many times on the radio, recorded an album of the drama in 1952, and performed scenes from the story in her one-woman show in the 1950s.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnes_Moorehead_5cd1.html" title="Edit section: Private life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Private life</span></h2>
<p>Moorehead married actor John Griffith Lee in 1930, and they <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divorce.html" title="Divorce">divorced</a> in 1952; they adopted an orphan named Sean in 1949, but it remains unclear whether the adoption was legal, although Moorehead did raise the child until he ran away from home. In 1953, she married actor Robert Gist, and they divorced in 1958. In the years since her death, rumors about Moorehead's being a <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbian.html" title="Lesbian">lesbian</a> have been widespread (most notoriously in the book <i>Hollywood Lesbians</i>); however, Moorehead biographer Charles Transberg (<i>I Love the Illusion: The Life and Career of Agnes Moorehead</i>, 2005) interviewed several of the actress' closest friends, including some who were openly <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a>, who all stated the rumor is untrue.</p>
<p>Moorehead was a devout <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterian.html" title="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> and, in interviews, often spoke of her relationship with <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a>. Shortly before her death, she returned to her <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fundamentalist.html" title="Fundamentalist">fundamentalist</a> roots and requested an audience with <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Jones%2C_Jr._a9a0.html" title="Bob Jones, Jr.">Bob Jones, Jr.</a>.</p>
<p>Agnes Moorehead died of <a href="../../../u/t/e/Uterine_cancer.html" title="Uterine cancer">uterine cancer</a> in <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rochester%2C_Minnesota_26cf.html" title="Rochester, Minnesota">Rochester, Minnesota</a> <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>, not <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lung_cancer.html" title="Lung cancer">lung cancer</a> as was long believed.</p>
<p>While never confirmed, some suspect that Moorehead’s cancer was a result of having been exposed to <a href="../../../i/o/n/Ionizing_radiation.html" title="Ionizing radiation">radiation</a> at a site previously used for <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_testing.html" title="Nuclear testing">nuclear testing</a> while filming <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Conqueror_c8f0.html" title="The Conqueror">The Conqueror</a></i> (1956) in <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utah.html" title="Utah">Utah</a>. Moorehead believed her cancer was related to this exposure, and commented in an interview shortly before her death, "I wish I'd never done that damn movie!" There is no definitive proof that the movie caused her illness.</p>
<p>Moorehead <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_%28law%29.html" title="Will (law)">willed</a> her 1967 <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmy.html" title="Emmy">Emmy</a> for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wild_Wild_West_2cda.html" title="The Wild Wild West">The Wild Wild West</a></i> and her private papers to Muskingum College, including her home in Rix Mills, <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a>. She left her family's Ohio estate and farmlands, Moorehead Manor, to <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Jones_University_ab2f.html" title="Bob Jones University">Bob Jones University</a>, as well as some biblical studies books from her personal library. Her will stipulated that BJU should use the farm for retreats and special meetings "with a Christian emphasis," but the distance of the estate from the South Carolina school rendered it mostly useless. In May 1976, BJU traded the farmlands with an Ohio college for $25,000 and a collection of her library books. Moorehead also left her professional papers, scripts, Christmas cards and scrapbooks to the Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research at the <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisconsin_Historical_Society_cf75.html" title="Wisconsin Historical Society">Wisconsin Historical Society</a>.</p>
<p>In 1994, Agnes Moorehead was inducted into the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Walk_of_Fame_c855.html" title="St. Louis Walk of Fame">St. Louis Walk of Fame</a>.</p>
<p>She is interred at Dayton Memorial Park in <a href="../../../d/a/y/Dayton%2C_Ohio_88d9.html" title="Dayton, Ohio">Dayton, Ohio</a>.</p>
