<h2><span class="mw-headline">Apathetic Agnosticism</span></h2>
<p>I just wonder what the thoughts are attached to this. Trying to pinpoint my Agnostic beliefs, this seems to be the closest. I just don't think the wording does it right. Or another branch needs defined. Thoughts on: "The view that there is no proof either of God's existence or nonexistence, but since a creator(if there is one) is only observing the system, he is meaningless to our existence."</p>

<p>"There is no God" is not a claim (a statement standing in need of proof), it is the denial (the negation in logic) of one. -- 207.200.116.204 17:17, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>"There is no God" is not a claim (a statement standing in need of proof), it is the denial (the negation in logic) of one. -- 207.200.116.204 17:17, 23 July 2005 (UTC) One point of view has it that "Theists and <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strong_atheism.html" title="Strong atheism">strong atheists</a> make statements about the world: the theist, that 'God exists', the strong atheist, that 'God does not exist'. Agnostics make the statement about these statements, 'one cannot know whether or not God exists'." Two objections to the above point of view are: 1. How could anyone possibly know that it is impossible to know it if some hypothetical thing were to exist and interact with the world? Any such interaction would leave some kind of trail of evidence that could be demonstrated, wouldn't it? And 2. The argument that there might actually BE (exist) an invisible deity is what is known as an EXISTENTIAL statement, not a "statement about the world" (universal statement) as the writer of the above paragraph asserts. The null, 'There is no invisible deity in evidence in the universe' is a universal statement (statement about the universe).</p>

<p>Thanks for your input, .204. In my dictionary, to make a claim is to make an assertion or to state something one takes to be true, ...</p>
<dl>
<dd>... which stand in need of proof.</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>not</i> to make a statement that is in need of proof.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Any existential statement like, "There might be an invisible God" is an assertion that stands in need of proof. The denial is not an assertion, it is the denial of one, so it does not stand in need of proof. Look up fallacy of trying to shift the burden of proof to the non-believers.</dd>

<p>Your (1) may indeed be correct, but nevertheless, it is what agnostics claim.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am agnostic, and I do not claim any such thing, since it is nonsense. See Thomas Huxley's excoriation of the Christian Belief, "Agnosticism vs. Christianity." There you will find that agnosticism is not about knowledge at all, it is about the folly of believing things without evidence. Huxley says, and I agree, that the reasonable course is to unabashedly deny and repudiate any religious doctrine like Christianity or Islam for example, that there are existential propositions that people ought to believe without logically satisfactory evidence. Have you read it?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I have read it. Knowledge is belief that is both true and justified - see <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistemology.html" title="Epistemology">epistemology</a>. Huxley was certainly aware of Plato, and was making use of the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theaetetus.html" title="Theaetetus">Theaetetus</a> account. Huxley is advocating justified beliefs over unjustified - and so knowledge over belief. In other words, he is talking about knowledge. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">Banno</a> 09:09, July 24, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't see why "Dogs exist" is not a statement about the world - that it contains dogs. That is, not all statements about the world are universals. Also you might be aware that U(x)f(x) is equivalent to ~E(x)~f(x) - that is, all universal statements can be re-parsed as existential statements.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Only if you are trying to sell sophistry. Existential statements and universal statements are two different things. And why are you trying to change the subject to dogs? Dogs are known to exist.

<p>Allright, how about we say "Agnosticism differs from atheism in that (strong) atheists <i>say</i> there is no God". Athiests say there is no god. The purpose of this article is not discuss whether god has any way of being said to exist. see <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existance_of_God_7900.html" title="Existance of God">Existance of God</a>. correct me if I'm wrong but say doesn't imply anything about whether or not what is being said could be true. I am changing the article as above, however if someone reverses this I won't fight over it. Please considder whether these small semantic bias' can be fixed simply before engaging in a edit war. <a href="../../../o/l/l/User%7EOlleicua_887d.html" title="User:Olleicua">Olleicua</a> 21:53, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That just isn't true. All atheists do not assert that there is no god. Only strong atheists assert that there is no god. Weak atheists that are not strong atheists make no such assertion. Because theism is such a well definied category, not theism (atheism or more correctly weak atheism (the more general category)) is a very broad and general category. Babies, vegetables, and non-believers all fall into the category of atheist. And unless you make agnosticism a very quirky definition, not A or B is a subset of not A and agnostics are a subset of weak atheist. If you are going to say anything related to that at all it should be something to the tune of "Agnostics do not deny the existence of god and are not (strong) atheists". Your statement has misleading wording and the first clause is incorrect.(<a href="../../../c/_/h/User%7EC_h_fleming_140c.html" title="User:C h fleming">CHF</a> 10:31, 20 September 2005 (UTC))</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That is incorrect wording, which I find almost everywhere. The correct wording is, "Not all atheists assert that there is no god," unless you mean that no atheists assert that, which is entirely untrue. See my post below. --<a href="../../../r/o/v/User%7ERovenhot_93bd.html" title="User:Rovenhot">Rovenhot</a> 19:07, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Strong atheists deny the presence of a god and all meaning that may derive from this. Agnostics deny meaning in general. These are two different things. Atheists can believe in philosphies of fellow humans, that doesn't mean they don't believe in an afterlife. There is no reason to differ over weak and strong atheists, the ideal is the same, that a god does not exist. Atheists deny the presence of god. Agnostics deny the presence of morals, values and philosophies.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree completely. A "weak" atheist, that is, one who does not entirely deny the existence of gods, is not an atheist. Atheism is only the complete denial of any gods' existence. It is perfectly acceptable that they <i>claim</i> there is no god, because it is more specific than simply not being a theist. If one simply does not believe in the existence of gods, but does not necessarily assert that there are none, that is not atheism. Although the word "atheist" implies only that he/she is not a theist ("without theism"), atheism is the word placed on the belief that gods are entirely inexistent. Atheism is not only the denial of the claim of the existence of gods, it is the denial of the existence of gods itself, and so it is its own claim. I find considerable discrimination in saying that it is not a claim in its own right (to say nothing of my belief; I am not atheist). --<a href="../../../r/o/v/User%7ERovenhot_93bd.html" title="User:Rovenhot">Rovenhot</a> 19:04, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Before I begin, this discussion thread is a huge mess and nearly impossible to follow in its current state. Can one of the original authors please clean it up?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, I would like to (as concisely as possible) input my two cents on this issue. I believe that the statement that "Agnostics deny the presence of morals, values and philosophies." is wholly untrue. Yes, perhaps there are certain agnostics who feel that way, but that is certainly not the definition of agnosticism. Agnosticism is simply the belief that it is impossible to claim knowledge either way of god's existence or non-existence. This is in opposition to the both the theists who claim "I know god exists" and the athiests who claim "I know god does not exist". The claim that it is impossible to know whether god exists, however, does not imply the denial of morals, values and philosophies in any way whatsoever, and I have no idea where you got this from. An agnostic may hold any system of morals, values and philosophy which he pleases. Furthermore, there is nothing preventing an agnostic from having leanings toward either theism or atheism: In this case, they simply hold a belief, while also claiming that even they cannot know whether that particular belief is true. This may be considered to be irrational, however whether or not it is rational is irrelevant to the fact that it is possible, and does happen. Agnosticism is not a code of ethics, morals, values, beliefs or philosophies, nor it is a lack of any of those things. It is simply the belief that it is impossible to claim knowledge of god's existence, or lack thereof.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removed Large Section</span></h2>
<p><b>Here is the section I removed:</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p>One point of view has it that "Theists and strong atheists make statements about the world, the theist that 'God exists', the strong atheist that 'God does not exist'. Agnostics make the statement about these statements, 'one cannot know whether or not God exists'."<br />
<br />
Two objections to the above point of view are:<br />
<br />
1. How could anyone possibly know that it is impossible to know it if some hypothetical thing were to exist and interact with the world? Any such interaction would leave some kind of trail of evidence that could be demonstrated, wouldn't it?<br />
<br />
And 2. The argument that there might actually BE (exist) an invisible deity is what is known as an EXISTENTIAL statement, not a "statement about the world" (universal statement) as the writer of the above paragraph asserts. The null, 'There is no invisible deity in evidence in the universe' is a universal statement (statement about the universe).<br />
<br />
Agnosticism has suffered more than most expressions of philosophical position from terminological vagaries. Examples come from attempts to associate agnosticism with atheism. The "freethinking" tradition of atheism calls a lack of belief in the existence of any deities, "weak atheism" (or "negative atheism"). However, one can still draw a distinction between weak atheism and agnosticism by drawing a distinction between belief and knowledge, leading those who believe knowledge of God is not possible to claim agnosticism is about knowledge, while atheism/theism is about the lack of belief. Agnostic atheism is a combination of both.<br />

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Whither Robert G. Ingersoll?</span></h2>
<p>Before anything anybody want me to write <i>agnostic</i> in Greek&#160;? I don't know if its been seen as unecessary, or if nobody else wanted to do it? Well, I think this is it nonetheless: ἄγνωστος.</p>
<p>Now, forgive me for interrupting the discussions on the finer points of style and the minutiæ of logic, but I am wondering about a question of simple content. Most namely, why isn't Robert Ingersoll mentioned? I checked the talk archives and didn't see him. If I missed him, I apologize. If there's a good reason he's not here I also apologize. His <a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/robert_ingersoll/why_i_am_agnostic.html" class="external text" title="http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/robert_ingersoll/why_i_am_agnostic.html" rel="nofollow">Why I am Agnostic</a> is brilliant in the way he is able to communicate the loftiest ideas in the plainest of speech. When people want to know what I 'believe' I have them read that speech. Perhaps, a noteworthy counterpoint to the scientific oriented Agnostic thinkers already mentioned in the article for his unpretentious, "folksy" style alone. His ability to see things abstractly, offers a different perspective from the hyperfocused Huxley (whom I admire for that ability). For those not familiar with him (I'm not implying any of you do or don't) -in addition to the wiki article - there is a good, brief column on the contemporary views of him <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/columns/ingersoll.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.etymonline.com/columns/ingersoll.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>. If he has been left out for reasons of modern influence (and lack thereof), his indirect influence, is perhaps, at least worthy of a footnote. For those with some time on their hands there is his <a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/robert_ingersoll/index.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/robert_ingersoll/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">complete works</a> at infidels.org.</p>
<p>I'm not saying I don't like what is in the article at all! I just thought it was odd not to find Ingersoll here in addition to the other great Agnostic thinkers. I might also suggest, though he was more famous as a lawyer, Clarence Darrow's <a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/clarence_darrow/why_i_am_an_agnostic.html" class="external text" title="http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/clarence_darrow/why_i_am_an_agnostic.html" rel="nofollow">Why I Am An Agnostic</a>.

<dd>"Some Agnostics embrace all beliefs as possibilities". Maybe. But who? And where? And what exactly did they say? We need some actual citations from actual Agnostics. Huxley was certainly willing to reject some beliefs, as an acquaintance with what he actually wrote would soon reveal. And that's what this article needs in order to avoid all the POV squabbling. It's obvious that the word agnostic has been used in divergent ways: the entry just needs to tell the reader how these ways have been characterised, by who, and where and when. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDannyno_cd04.html" title="User:Dannyno">Dannyno</a> 20:53, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Any belief can actually be accurate, as contradictory as it may seem, because the contradictions may only be misconceptions on our part, be it from misjudgement or from lack of appropriate data (see <a href="../../../d/e/s/Descartes.html" title="Descartes">Descartes</a>'s "evil demon" hypothesis or the "brain in a jar" hypothesis). This is only a recognition of one's unability to know anything for sure. Un-knowledge; A-gnosticism; it's only an extension of that principle.</p>
<p>But since, to live, we must act as if some specific set of facts are true. We use our experience and confront it to the facts to deem many things to be less likely. It doesn't make them impossible, but we have to act as if they were because one can't remain in doubt and inactive forever (<a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Hume_69a6.html" title="David Hume">David Hume</a>, somewhere).</p>
<p>One example I really like is how a turkey, from experience, knows that whenever the farmer comes out every morning he's going to give it grain. In the same way, we know that the sun will come up, the experiment will work again, such behaviour will have such consequences... Only one day the farmer might be coming with an axe. If someone had told you otherwise, you wouldn't have believed him. And you would have been right, because you simply can't believe whatever you're told. Especially when that's against all experience (<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russell_85bc.html" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>'s inductivist turkey)</p>
<p>Oops. look at what I found:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a philosopher, if I were speaking to a purely philosophic audience I should say that I ought to describe myself as an Agnostic, because I do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which one prove that there is not a God. On the other hand, if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think that I ought to say that I am an Atheist, because, when I say that I cannot prove that there is not a God, I ought to add equally that I cannot prove that there are not the Homeric gods." — Bertrand Russell, Collected Papers, vol. 11, p. 91</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a population that "remembered" a wholly unreal past. There is no logically necessary connection between events at different times; therefore nothing that is happening now or will happen in the future can disprove the hypothesis that the world began five minutes ago." — Bertrand Russell, The Analysis of Mind, 1921, pp. 159–60; cf.

<p>As I suggested on the Atheism page, I think that here too we need to insert a typology of the different kinds of atheism that exist (before the views of precise philosophers). I think that we can distinguish 3 kinds: those who considerthat the answer to the question "Does God exist?" is unknowable, those who consider that we just don't know and the solution might, in principle, be known at some point, and those who consider that the question itself is incoherent (I think only logical positivists qualify for the last one, though).</p>
<p>Thus, we would be able to explicit what these views mean and imply, and give the result of the above discussion which will then hopefully never happen again.</p>

<p><b>October 19 Edits</b></p>
<p>I changed a little of the wording in the Variations section for a couple different reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, I added mini-definitions to epistemology and metaphysics. I changed "ontology" to "metaphysics" because the latter contrasts better with epistemology. Ontology is really a subset of metaphysics, and so for the initial definition, I think we should stick to the biggest categories that we have names for in order to highlight the fundamental difference. I added a sentence right afterwords to try to keep the ontology word in there (because it is technically more correct), but it reads kinda awkward. Not quite sure how to accomplish both (the better contrast of metaphysics with epistemology and the technical accuracy of ontology).</li>
<li>Second, I rewrote the examples to be a little more encyclopedia-like (as a math-nerd, I preferred the equals sign actually, but it's probably better to put it in prose)</li>
<li>Third, I added the bit about George Smith back in (I had last written about him way back before Variations was moved to the top -- and he remains in the Books Cited block even though he was actually removed from the text). I wanted to balance his mockery of the agnostic position with a similar mockery from a theist (something akin to "you can't disprove god, and the burden of proof is on the atheist, so even if you're agnostic you can legitimately believe). I know theists have said this, but I don't know of any famous theist writers who've written it, so I left it out. If you know a theist writer who says something along those lines, please do add it right after the Smith section.</li>

<dd>Yes. I do suck as a writer -- I guess that's why I'm an engineer. I'll edit the section (but in the agnostic theism article, where I do think it fits better anyway). In fact, you made me refine my statement - upon re-reading it, I found that Smith doesn't claim belief and knowledge are the same thing, but that early on he defines belief as justified, rationally demonstrable knowledge, and then uses it in that context throughout (so I was led to believe (hah) that he thought them the same). Full citation is at the bottom of the article (Books Cited) from the last time I tried to paraphrase Smith... Pg 103:
<blockquote>
<p><i>To rationally demonstrate a belief is to show that it warrants acceptance according to the epistemological standards of human knowledge. To accept a belief as true on the basis of reason is to accept it because it is capable of rational demonstration.</i>--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMiketwo_71f4.html" title="User:Miketwo">Michael</a> 11:49, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We'll have to agree to disagree about that. I think everyone understands that we <i>know</i> only a subset of what we <i>believe</i>. Also, your rhetorical question in parentheses isn't relevant. A "knowledge claim" and a "truth claim" are not the same thing. I agree that to believe X is to believe <i>that X is true</i>.

<dd>Agreed to disagree then. While in a general sense you may be correct, I think that in matters of religion, when someone says "I believe in God", that is equivalent (to them) of saying "I am claiming both the knowledge and the truth of God's existence." In other areas they may make the distinction, but I think in the vast majority of religious discussions, people's beliefs are not stated as opinions, they are stated as facts. --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMiketwo_71f4.html" title="User:Miketwo">Michael</a> 11:49, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Philosophical opinions: Huxley, Darwin, Russell</span></h2>
<p>I have major problems with this section. For one, Darwin called himself an agnostic but did not actually make any philosophical contributions to agnosticism. Russell is absolutely not an agnostic "in the original sense", as the article currently claims. This ought to be obvious from the quotes that are actually in the article. Basically, Russell didn't know what to call himself, was willing to say that the traditional anthropomorphic god could be disproved (how many agnostics "in the original sense" would say that?), and doesn't actually seem to have contributed much to agnostic thought. Where is Leslie Stephen? Where is WK Clifford?</p>

<dd>As for Russell, I think that all the <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weak_agnosticism.html" title="Weak agnosticism">open agnostics</a> would agree that "God's existence is not necessarily unknowable"; the traditional anthropomorphic God can be disproved in the sense that any alleged occurence in the physical word can, in principle, be disproved. For deities that are said not to intervene, that's not possible. He seems every bit of an agnostic to me, as is anyone who would say "I don't know whether God exists"... What would that agnostic "in the original sense" be, to you? (In fact, my personal stance is closest to Russell, so I'm really interested). <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJules.lt_85f8.html" title="User:Jules.lt">Jules LT</a> 23:22, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Assuming "in the original sense" means "as Huxley defined it", it could mean at least two things (Huxley used it in different ways). As he first used the word, it meant that he "didn't know" all the things that others claimed to know. As he subsequently explained it in print, it meant "methodological agnosticism" - i.e. knowledge claims must be supported by evidence: a synonym for rationalism, really. Other people then got hold of it and it came to mean "suspension of judgement" or "don't know either way". As is quite obvious, Russell was a victim of the usual confusions and called himself an agnostic or an atheist inconsistently. If he was so confused himself, it seems extremely highhanded of us to try to resolve it for him.</dd>

<ul>
<li>IMHO, "methodological agnosticism" is pretty obviously a subset of agnosticism, not all of it. The one thing that defines an agnostic is saying "I don't know". Saying "I don't know either way" doesn't look that different to me. I agree that the "suspension of judgement" might slightly differ but even then, not that much. The essential distinctions <i>inside</i> agnosticism are only among those who believe the proof to be impossible, those who state they don't know and those who think it makes no sense.</li>
<li>Russel wasn't inconsistent: he was an atheist (in the sense "not a theist") <b>and</b> an agnostic (meaning "I don't know"). Btw, he was very keen on using evidence to support claims, to the point that he often changed opinions whenever new information was available; this might be why he seemed "confused" or "inconsistent" to some.</li>
<li>Back to the original point, I don't think that Huxley would state that "God is unprovable either way": the "proof of God" and "proof that there is no God" are things which existence or inexistence are as unknown as that of God himself. Rationality would mean that one shouldn't say "The proof does not exist" without sufficient supporting evidence (what sufficient is varies from one person to the other, of course).</li>
<li>What Russell said was only that, in principle, it could be showed that the interventionnist anthropomorphic God of the scriptures didn't exist as described, even if a proof wasn't readily available at the moment. Or it might be impossible to prove: <i>we don't know</i>. He personally thought that such a God could be disproved rather than proved. People often mix up his personal opinions and philosophical statements.</li>

<dd>I think your joke is fine as it is. Agnostics are unsure whether there us a God or not, but an agnostic might well CARE very much about whether there is or not.

<dd>That's how I've always heard the joke told as well. Your parents seem to have confused the term "agnostic" with the term "<a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">atheist</a>."

<dd>There are flaws in the joke that is not so easily fixed: theists make claims that god(s) exists(-s); atheists make claims that god(s) does(do) not exist; the agnostics do not know either to be true. His parents are not in confusion: without subdividing the agnosticism into a spectrum of varying beliefs, agnosticism at the surface is simply without knowing and cannot be known. I believe that an agnostic in the simplest definition might care about existence of god(s), but not for its inherent truth, but for the impact on and secondary impact through other people -i.e., the atheists and theists- who care. It seems pointless to wonder about things that cannot be known, so it is probably more likely that the insomniac agnostic is worrying/contemplating over other psychological and physiological issues that led to his insomnia, rather than the issue of divinity. That being said, there are three issues here: 1) this joke cannot be easily fixed without turning it into a verbose paragraph (much like what I am doing&#160;:&gt; ) full of quantifiers and thus defeating the brevity that is this one-liner; 2) I do realize most jokes are not so funny when examined with a microscope for political/cultural/definitive/etc. correctness; 3) I also realize that humans often illogically worry about things beyond their control, and so it is not surprising that an agnostic might wonder all night if there is really a dgo. It just seems pointless. Any other agnostics feel as I do? (Cymbol 02:00, 14 September 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">No settled issues</span></h2>
<p><b>I removed the following section</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term <b>agnosticism</b> and the related <b>agnostic</b> were coined by <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Henry_Huxley_5060.html" title="Thomas Henry Huxley">Thomas Henry Huxley</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1869.html" title="1869">1869</a>. As Huxley explains it, agnosticism is not about <i><b>knowledge</b></i> at all, because nobody can convince the world that he knows there is a god without producing logically satisfactory evidence of a god; agnostics are simply those who deny and repudiate any doctrine that there are propositions people ought to <i><b>believe</b></i> without logically satisfactory evidence <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE5/Agn-X.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE5/Agn-X.html" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>. This is one of the main issuses that still remain concerning agnosticism. The issue is whether there is anything distinctive in being agnostic. When it comes right down to the facts of the matter theists in general do not generally say that they know that a god exists, only that they believe there might be one, and atheists in general do not say they know there is no god, only that they do not believe there might be one. And, as Huxley points out in "Agnosticism and Christianity" <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE5/Agn-X.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE5/Agn-X.html" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>, agnosticism, in essence, is not really about knowledge at all, since nobody knows, it is about the denial and repudiation of any doctrine that there are propositions people ought to believe without logically satisfactory evidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I removed it because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Radically changing the main definition of an article 2+ years in the making is too bold. The previous definition has been forged of many arguments, and is pretty good at addressing the various interest groups' issues.</li>
<li>Even that aside, the new section is badly written. This is an encyclopedia, so conjecture of the form "When it comes right down to the facts of the matter" does not belong. The use of no less than 6 commas in the last "sentence" is also pretty bad. And finally, the sentence "The issue is whether there is anything distinctive in being agnostic" is blatant point-of-view. The issue is actually providing a definition of agnosticism, not analyzing it.</li>

<dd>Actually, I want to comment on my own post here. After thinking about it over the weekend, I think the last Column and Row (concerning irrelevancy) doesn't really fit. The breakdown is between beliefs in Metaphysics (along the top) and beliefs in Epistemology (along the left side). The irrelevancy column is more like a statement of WHY, and not WHAT. For example, I could have no beliefs in god BECAUSE I think they are irrelevant -- but I belong in the third column, not the 4th. Further, the "known" part of the left column is superfluous, because it is a breakdown of epistemology (what is possible to know), not of current knowledge (what is known). I will change the table to reflect how I think it should look now...</dd>
<dd>I'm not sure about the use of "agnostic" for a lack of belief in the possibility of proof/disproof though. For any proposition, you can either have assent to it, denial of it, or "no comment". These 3 positions should be fully fleshed out with regards to god's existence and ability to be known. --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMiketwo_71f4.html" title="User:Miketwo">Michael</a> 15:01, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">(In)compatibility with strong atheism</span></h2>
<p>The article currently states agnosticism is distinct from <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strong_atheism.html" title="Strong atheism">strong atheism</a> yet compatible with <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weak_atheism.html" title="Weak atheism">weak atheism</a>. I agree with the second part. But <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strong_atheism.html#Statements_of_nonexistence_merit_positive_claims" title="Strong atheism">Strong atheism#Statements of nonexistence merit positive claims</a> says one justification for strong atheism, based on <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occam%27s_Razor_046a.html" title="Occam's Razor">Occam's Razor</a>, is that a positive claim of any deity's nonexistence is justified when there is no good evidence for that deity's existence. It seems this justification for strong atheism is, in fact, compatible with strong agnosticism. That is, a person who thinks the existence of deities is neither knowable nor supported by good evidence could call themself a strong agnostic and a strong atheist without contradiction.</p>
<p>I was made aware of this problem when I visited <i>agnosticism</i> from <i><a href="../../../s/t/r/Strong_agnosticism.html" title="Strong agnosticism">strong agnosticism</a></i>, which has since 17:48 (UTC) on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_10.html" title="April 10">10 April</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> maintained that strong agnosticism and strong atheism may be compatible. It currently says "[strong agnosticism] can even be reconciled with strong atheism if the latter is justified independently of references to a deity's attributes, which strong agnosticism does not allow." I think that's correct, and I recommend we include similar language in this article.</p>

<dd>Not exactly the wrong area, but not really the right one either. Atheism, theism adn agnosticism deal specifically with the existence or nonexistence of god(s). The existence and nature of an afterlife is a separate issue. Granted, there is a lot of overlap since people who are skeptical about gods are probably also going to be skeptical about things like souls, ghosts, heaven, hell, reincarnation, etc. - but these things are not necessarily inextricably linked and so it'd be awkward trying to write about "the atheist view on death." It'd be somewhat similar to writing about "the atheist view on cheese" or "the atheist view on country music."

<p>I am confused. What is the difference btw. atheisim and agnosticism?</p>
<ul>
<li>Very short answer: Atheism concerns beliefs (or lack of them), particularly belief about whether deities exist; agnosticism concerns what can be known, particularly whether the existence of deities can (ever) be known. It becomes about the difference between knowledge &amp; belief. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 01:29, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Some agnostics make claim of lack of knowledge only for themselves, some make claim that everyone must be agnostic re deities, though they may not all affix that as the primary description of their own stance with respect to deities. Some agnostics have not figured out whether they believe gods exist or not, have not arrived at any practical conclusion on whether or not to plan their lives as if gods existed. Some agnostics decide to live as if gods existed, others decide to live as if they do not. Some have decided that even if gods exist, it would make no difference to their own plans --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 01:39, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Definition of agnostic?</span></h2>
<p>The article states: <i>"<b>Some claim that there is nothing distinctive in being an agnostic because even theists do not claim to know God exists, only to believe it, and many even agree there is room for doubt; and atheists in the broader sense do not claim to know there is no God, only not to believe in one."</b></i></p>
<p>Well, not all theists or atheists would agree that they simply "don't know" (although one would wonder why anyone would make a claim); but there must be a high degree of belief or non-belief, which is what I believe separates them from agnostics; who are not "sure" enough to decide if they believe or do not believe. So while no one can claim to "know" (wiki the theories of knowledge), there is still a distinction. Can someone correct me if I'm wrong though? I'm not sure what defines an agnostic.64.113.106.153 03:08, 5 July 2006 (UTC) Of course anyone can claim to "know" since such knowledge is difficult to prove or disprove. I find it interesting that the undecided people are often labeled as agnostic by others or even themselves. I don't see how "I'm not sure" exactly equates with the rather positive statement of "I don't know" or a collective "none of us know." In the end agnosticism could also be considered a belief since I've heard believers of a God assert that an agnostic does actually know but does not realize it or will not admit it. So to some of them an agnostic just believes that they do not know and they take on faith that the agnostic position is correct. Agnosticism is continually hard to nail down exactly because of arguments of belief versus knowledge and whether or not these two main topics are mutually exclusive. 68.100.240.18 03:38, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Protagoras</span></h2>
<p>I find agnostics quoting Protagoras a lot, since he was a proponent of agnosticism. But isn't there a lot of criticisms against him, since he's considered a "sophist"? It's also odd that while Protagoras, a sophist, believes in agnosticism; Socrates is a theist, who tries to rely on rational thinking and logic. 165.196.149.50 20:03, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">agnostics are atheists and theists</span></h2>
<p><i>Agnosticism is distinct from, but compatible with, atheism. It is also compatible with theism. This is because agnosticism is a view about knowledge concerning God, whereas theism and atheism are beliefs (or lack thereof) concerning God. For example, it is possible to believe in God but to believe that knowledge about God is not obtainable.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>This view does not make sense to me, and heres why; if knowledge about God is not obtainable, then knowing or "believing" anything about him is void. God is non exsistant because anything about him is <i>not obtainable</i>, even the conception of a belief in <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deity.html" title="Deity">god</a>. You need <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knowledge.html" title="Knowledge">knowledge</a> of him to form a <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belief.html" title="Belief">belief</a>.
<dl>
<dd>ex: <i>There is a god but I do not know about what god is</i>. or I think: <i>I do not know about what god is</i>., makes more sense. Agnostics ignore the question of theism until there is absolute proof. If you believe, your'e a <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theist.html" title="Theist">theist</a>, if you don't, your'e an <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheist.html" title="Atheist">atheist</a>. You are stating in the above statement that agnosticism is a cross-roads to atheism or theism, instead of its own stance. <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomerset219_eb29.html" title="User:Somerset219">Somerset219</a> 01:24, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>See <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnostic_theism.html" title="Agnostic theism">Agnostic theism</a>. Basically someone who says we can't know if God exists, but chooses to believe anyway. Just because someone can't obtain knowledge about something doesn't necessarily stop them believing in it anyway (yes, I think this is a silly thing to do, but nonetheless many people believe in God through faith alone, and the concept of agnostic theism seems to exist). <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 01:38, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see what your saying, kind of, but I am a bit lost... When you say <i>many people believe in God through faith alone</i>, you are saying that these people were given prior knowlegde of whatever "god" they now believe in. In other words, they just didn't become believers in something they didn't know about. I'm saying that this is a mis-use of agnosticism, because it's a logical fallicy. If you believe in a diety, you're a theist. Agnostics take neither road. They know nothing of the question. The term <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnostic_theism.html" title="Agnostic theism">Agnostic theism</a> is wrong, a term made up because someone didn't do their homework. I would rather not promote <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnostic_theism.html" title="Agnostic theism">this</a> on <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnosticism.html" title="Agnosticism">this</a> article, especially when it's not <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnostic_theism.html#George_H._Smith.27s_rebuttal" title="Agnostic theism">cited</a> and doesn't make sense.

<dd>I think there is confusion here between knowing about a concept, and knowing that that thing exists. Surely, there are things we might think <i>could</i> be true, even if we don't <i>know</i> if they are true. Agnosticism is about not knowing in the latter sense - it doesn't we don't even have knowledge of the concept.</dd>
<dd>Some people use agnosticism to mean "taking neither road", other people use it to mean "knowing nothing of the question". But these are all different usages. The definition referred to here isn't about "not ever knowing about God", it's "not knowing that God exists".</dd>
<dd>Are you saying that <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnostic_theism.html" title="Agnostic theism">agnostic theism</a> is a neologism, or just that you think it is absurd/wrong? The former is grounds for getting rid of it, and you should probably try proposing the article for deletion. The latter just means you have a different POV to those who do think it's a valid concept. <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 02:21, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>hmm, interesting, I never knew about <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologisms</a>, guess you learn something new everyday. Actually, I'm saying both, and I stated the logical fallicy of the concept and the lack of citation.(through the links). I'm still confused on your logic, however. If you don't know if god exsists, then you don't believe in him. In other words; knowlegde, wether it's accurate or not, dictates <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belief.html" title="Belief">belief</a>.</dd>

<dd>There isn't necessarily a logical fallacy concerning agnostic theism. It makes sense to me that a theist could make the claim that we cannot know the true nature of or proof of existence for the object of their belief. See below on my argument on why this is a variation of theism and not agnosticism. If someone tried to define theistic agnosticism then your logical fallacy appears with a definition of a claim of belief in something you do not know about. Ffuege 19:02, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnostic_theism.html" title="Agnostic theism">Agnostic theism</a> has as much bearing on <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnosticism.html" title="Agnosticism">agnosticism</a> itself as an operating system agnostic computer program. In both cases agnostic is used as an adjective which means "doubtful or noncommital". Actually the computer-related common usage is more like a definition of "not having or needing an understanding of" like in the case of the application not needing to understand or be aware of the operating system it runs on. This is in contrast to the noun which is defined as "one who believes that it is impossible to know whether there is a God" or variations on that theme in various dictionaries I've checked. Therefore agnostic theism is a qualification of a type of theism (not nontheism) and is not a legitimate variation of agnosticism. I would vote for its removal from agnosticism and its reference should instead appear under category 4 on the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theism.html" title="Theism">theism</a> article since it does not obviously belong under the category 1 nontheism family where agnosticism does appear.

<dd>Dictionary.com defines the agnostic noun usage as "a person who holds that the existence of the ultimate cause, as God, and the essential nature of things are unknown and unknowable, or that human knowledge is limited to experience" and the agnostic adjective usage as "of or pertaining to agnostics or agnosticism" or "asserting the uncertainty of all claims to knowledge." I'm not a linguist by any stretch of the imagination, however I don't see where I or anyone else has used agnostic as a verb and there isn't a usage definition for an agnostic verb. I'm at a loss to think how one would agnostic something. It is my understanding from those definitions that agnostic as a noun is the viewpoint that ultimate cause is unknown and unknowable, whereas agnostic as an adjective modifies whatever noun it is associated with to qualify it as a viewpoint derived from "asserting the uncertainty of all claims to knowledge." Therefore, an agnostic atheist is still an atheist at their core even though their atheism is qualified by their lack of knowledge. Also, an agnostic theist is still a theist at their core even though their theism is qualified by a lack of true knowledge for their theism. I think clarity can come from flipping the adjectives and nouns in these attempts to define compound beliefs. A theistic agnostic would not be the same as an agnostic theist, would it? It makes about as much sense to me as a christian atheist. Ffuege 19:58, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
