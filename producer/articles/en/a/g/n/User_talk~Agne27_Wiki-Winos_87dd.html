<b>What got you first interested in wine?</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>Trying to make some when I was a <i>very</i> young kid in England. A friend and I got a bright idea one day that if we left some apples in a barrel of water in his back garden and were to come back in a month, we'd have wine. It didn't turn out quite the way we'd hoped for, but it got me started.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>What brought you to Wikipedia?</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>Getting more and more hits when using google. At some point it became time to see what it was all about.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>What type of wine articles do you enjoy editing?</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm an organizer, editor, and filer. You'll see more of this from me than the big one piece articles. It should be finite in scope however, but not trivial. The Bordeaux project for example...doable.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>What non-wine related activities do you also enjoy on Wikipedia?</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>Chasing vandals and catching sock-puppets. Passing on non-notable, patent-nonsense and hoax pages to the admins. Keeping an eye on the peacocks.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>What is your favorite wine? Least favorite wine?</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>Favourite....Haut Batailley 2000. Incredible.</dd>
<dd>Least favorite....anything corked, anything Manischewtiz (though I'd probably drink the corked wine if I had to).</dd>
<dd>Most disappointing...Oregon Pinots...they taste like grape juice to me (which technically they are I guess). Maybe I just havent had the right one yet.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>What is the most under appreciated wine, in your opinion?</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>Oooh...good question. Don't know.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>What efforts on a wine related article are you the most proud of to-date?</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>No single article...many contributions here and there that hopefully add up in the end.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Know any good wine jokes/quotes?</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>Said to Winston Churchill&#160;: "If you were my husband I'd poison your wine".</dd>
<dd>Replied Churchill&#160;: "Madam, if you were my wife I'd drink it".</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Have you ever had a "Wine snobbish" moment? If so, tell us about it.</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure who was the snob in this story...maybe no-one, maybe both. Anyway...I was in my local wine store on Madison Avenue in NY browsing the Bordeaux, looking, as usual, for something to try. A new salesman came over and asked, snootily I thought, what it was in Bordeaux that I might want help with. I asked him if the Chateau Marbuzet in my hand was Cru Bourgeois Exceptionnel or just regular Cru Bourgeois (I know it was one, and Haut-Marbuzet was the other). He said, sighing, that presumably I meant was it one of the five Grand Crus? No, I said, I mean which Cru Bourgeois is it. He confessed he didn't quite know what I meant. I smiled, said no matter...let's look it up, and pulled out my Bordeaux notes from my backpack. I thanked him for his time and he melted away, not to be seen again that visit.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>What area of the wine project would you like more editors to focus on</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>Nothing specific. I think if the organizers and watchdogs keep doing their thing, the writers do theirs, and both do some of the other, then we'll have done well.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>What are some wine related <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> (i.e. a wine book or web site) that you like using when editing wine articles?</b></p>

<p><b>Charleenmerced</b> What got you first interested in wine?</p>
<ul>
<li>I loved drinking wine at special dinners when I was a kid. I really enjoyed it and started drinking wine and reading about wine.</li>
</ul>
<p>What brought you to Wikipedia?</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever I did a search I always found Wikipedia very helpful. So, I started fixing typos and I soon found myself creating new articles. It's kind of an addiction now.</li>
</ul>
<p>What type of wine articles do you enjoy editing?</p>
<ul>
<li>I haven't started but will soon.</li>
</ul>
<p>What non-wine related activities do you also enjoy on Wikipedia?</p>
<ul>
<li>Editing TV and Literature articles.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is your favorite wine? Least favorite wine?</p>
<ul>
<li>Fave: Cabernet or Carmenère for red and Sauvignon Blanc for white; least fave Merlot and Chardonnay</li>

<dl>
<dd>The taste of it, although preceded by the look and the smell, the taste is what took it home&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
<p>2 What brought you to Wikipedia?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've been snooping around wikipedia for a while, collecting absurd amounts of knowledge on very strange topics. I look here for general information before checking Google now.</dd>
</dl>
<p>3 What type of wine articles do you enjoy editing?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've been storming through some of the French articles, editing stuff on the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appellation_d%27origine_contr%C3%B4l%C3%A9e.html" title="Appellation d'origine contrôlée">AOC</a> system and various regions and regional wines.</dd>
</dl>
<p>4 What non-wine related activities do you also enjoy on Wikipedia?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm pretty geeky so I like a lot of things and most of them are on the quirky (verging on useless side of things)</dd>
</dl>
<p>5 What is your favorite wine? Least favorite wine?</p>
<dl>
<dd>My favorite wines are the ones that I make on my vineyard (<a href="http://www.ovineyards.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ovineyards.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>).&#160;:) My least favorites is that Carlo Rossi junk that claims to be red but stained my sophomore dorm bathroom sink blue.</dd>
</dl>
<p>6 What is the most under appreciated wine, in your opinion?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Je suis vraiment chauvin, but I gotta say that the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Languedoc-Roussillon_c4f6.html" title="Languedoc-Roussillon">Languedoc-Roussillon</a> has some real pearls waiting to be discovered. They're buried in a mound of worthless wines, but they exist for those passionate enough to seek them out! And it's really hard keeping this bias all bottled up when I'm editing articles, but I must, for the good of the wiki!</dd>
</dl>
<p>7 What efforts on a wine related article are you the most proud of to-date?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've been trying to make heads or tails of an AOC article that we can be proud of, and I've been trying to sort out the different articles that deal with the Languedoc, Roussillon and Languedoc-Roussillon regions/régions/wines. It's pretty complicated, so I'm happy with every little bit I manage to wade through.</dd>
</dl>
<p>8 Know any good wine jokes/quotes?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I just heard today that Thomas Jefferson had once said "A tax on wine is not a tax on luxury but a tax on the good health of our people" haha. Oh Tommy, you always knew how to flatter a Frenchman. <a href="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/1163/0655lq.jpg" class="external text" title="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/1163/0655lq.jpg" rel="nofollow">I also like this comic although it's only peripherally related to wine</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>9 Have you ever had a "Wine snobbish" moment? If so, tell us about it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I kind of always get in these situations where people tell me all these verifiably false factoids about wine and I kind of smile it off because I don't have the heart to tell them that my personal experience invalidates much of what they're saying... and then later they inevitably find out that I make wine for a living and they realize that they've been prattling on to a "professional" and we both feel goofy.</dd>
</dl>
<p>10 What area of the wine project would you like more editors to focus on?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I could really use some help sorting out this Languedoc business. First of all, I don't know if I should merge it into the région's article since wine is so crucial to life and the economy there. Secondly, we need to fix all the entries that talk about and internal link to historic regions of France (like Roussillon) which only somewhat correspond to the contemporary designation of the Roussillon half of the Languedoc-Roussillon. Why is France so complicated?</dd>
</dl>
<p>11 What are some wine related <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> (i.e. a wine book or web site) that you like using when editing wine articles?</p>
<dl>

<p><br />
Thanks for the welcome and invite to fill out the survey. I'm looking forward to helping out as much as I can with this project.</p>
<p>1 What got you first interested in wine?</p>
<ul>
<li>I went to the Brotherhood winery in the Hudson Valley region in New York when I was in eighth grade. At the time I had decided I wanted to write a paper for a class on becoming an <a href="../../../o/e/n/Oenologist.html" title="Oenologist">oenologist</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>2 What brought you to Wikipedia?</p>
<ul>
<li>I had read a book titled Zinfandel: A Grape and It's Wine by Charles Sullivan and wanted to see if the information from <a href="../../../a/g/o/Agoston_Haraszthy_18f4.html" title="Agoston Haraszthy">Agoston Haraszthy</a> had been presented, especially on dispelling the myth of his bringing the <a href="../../../z/i/n/Zinfandel.html" title="Zinfandel">Zinfandel</a> grape to California first. It had not and it inspired me to begin editing pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>3 What type of wine articles do you enjoy editing?</p>
<ul>
<li>Ive just begun, but I have worked on the <a href="../../../z/i/n/Zinfandel.html" title="Zinfandel">Zinfandel</a> article, <a href="../../../a/g/o/Agoston_Haraszthy_18f4.html" title="Agoston Haraszthy">Agoston Haraszthy</a> as mentioned I plan on doing some research to support articles for individual <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wineries.html" title="Wineries">wineries</a> on Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<p>4 What non-wine related activities do you also enjoy on Wikipedia?</p>
<ul>
<li>I've worked on a few professional culinary organization articles as well as professional cookery books.</li>
</ul>
<p>5 What is your favorite wine? Least favorite wine?</p>
<ul>
<li>My favorite wines are some of the single vineyard selections from <a href="../../../r/a/v/Ravenswood.html" title="Ravenswood">Ravenswood</a>. My favorite was the 1994 Dickerson. It also happens to be the year I graduated from high school. The wine I buy more often than most though would be <a href="../../../v/e/u/Veuve_Cliquot_9ab6.html" title="Veuve Cliquot">Veuve Cliquot</a> NV <a href="../../../c/h/a/Champagne.html" title="Champagne">Champagne</a>, although I don't buy it allot, it's always a mainstay at the table when I have guests. My least favorite in the past used to be Mouton Cadet, but it seemed to improve somewhat in recent years. I suppose my least favorite now would have to be the Pinot Noirs they attempt to make in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>6 What is the most under appreciated wine, in your opinion?</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't have a particular answer for this one, perhaps I believe I would've said wines from <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, but they are starting to show up on shelves recently. I had a beautiful <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinot_Noir_c676.html" title="Pinot Noir">Pinot Noir</a> made in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> last year, so people should give them a try.</li>
</ul>
<p>7 What efforts on a wine related article are you the most proud of to-date?</p>
<ul>
<li>The addition made to the <a href="../../../a/g/o/Agoston_Haraszthy_18f4.html" title="Agoston Haraszthy">Agoston Haraszthy</a> article about dispelling the myth behind him.</li>
</ul>
<p>8 Know any good wine jokes/quotes?</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh all those Zinfanatic words are always funny to me.</li>
</ul>
<p>9 Have you ever had a "Wine snobbish" moment? If so, tell us about it.</p>
<ul>
<li>I try to personally be un-snobbish, otherwise it would be difficult to get people who are uninitiated to wine to enjoy it with those of us who have. I'm sure that there are people in general who find any intelligent wine drinker to be snobbish.</li>
</ul>
<p>10 What area of the wine project would you like more editors to focus on?</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual wineries, as well as being less personal with their article writing. With encyclopedic articles, they should be about facts and not opinions which I find in allot of articles.</li>
</ul>
<p>11 What are some wine related reliable sources (i.e. a wine book or web site) that you like using when editing wine articles?</p>
<ul>
<li>I read allot of academic wine books in general, but for reference texts I use Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia, The Oxford Wine Companion, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Parker_dfa5.html" title="Robert Parker">Robert Parker</a>'s - <a href="../../../b/o/r/Bordeaux.html" title="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a>, Robert Parker's - <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burgundy.html" title="Burgundy">Burgundy</a>, Hugh Johnson's - World Atlas of Wine, <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Johnson_d9da.html" title="Hugh Johnson">Hugh Johnson</a>'s - Modern Encyclopedia of Wine, Oz Clark's - New Wine Atlas. <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Parker_dfa5.html" title="Robert Parker">Robert Parker</a>'s website is also a good reference tool <a href="http://www.erobertparker.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.erobertparker.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.erobertparker.com/</a> if you have $100.00 a year to drop on the website subscription and then $70.00 a year for his magazine. I personally do not as I'm in Grad school, but I have used them both in the past for reference and they are excellent. This is another good site from Fine Wine Mag <a href="http://www.finewinemag.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.finewinemag.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.finewinemag.com/</a> as is the main stay WineSpectator.com which has some great wine classes on it for both the professional and amateur wine enthusiast.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Another question perhaps?</p>
<p>12. What is your favorite non reference wine book?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../c/h/a/Champagne.html" title="Champagne">Champagne</a> by Don &amp; Petie Kladstrup I like a book that mixes the great parts of culture and the mundane as well into my favorite wine. Wine,war, espionage, monks and French culture all make for a great story.</li>
