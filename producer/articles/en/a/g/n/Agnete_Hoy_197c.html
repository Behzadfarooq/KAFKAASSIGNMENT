<p><b>Agnete Hoy</b> (2 November, 1914 - 1 April 2000), also known as <b>Anita Hoy</b>, is an artist <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potter.html" title="Potter">potter</a> who managed successfully to create a bridge between industrial ceramics and work of the studio potters. Having studied in <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copenhagen.html" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> she went on to work for the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holbaek.html" title="Holbaek">Holbaek</a> and Saxbo potteries in the late-<a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a> before returning to <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>. Agnete’s <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Danish</a> experience helped her creativity within the English <a href="../../../c/e/r/Ceramic.html" title="Ceramic">ceramic</a> industry during the war years and following period.</p>
<p>Her technical expertise related to <a href="../../../c/e/r/Ceramic_glaze.html" title="Ceramic glaze">glazes</a> and firing was gained on the factory floor and used to produce her distinctive designs for production at both Buller’s in <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stoke-on-Trent_bd53.html" title="Stoke-on-Trent">Stoke-on-Trent</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Doulton_c544.html" title="Royal Doulton">Royal Doulton</a> Lambeth Wares.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnete_Hoy_197c.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Agnete Hoy was born in <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southall.html" title="Southall">Southall</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_3.html" title="November 3">3 November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1914.html" title="1914">1914</a> to her <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danish_people.html" title="Danish people">Danish</a> parents, Soren and Anna Blichfeldt who had been living in England since 1906. Soren, a research <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bacteriologist.html" title="Bacteriologist">bacteriologist</a> from <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copenhagen.html" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, had been invited to set-up a new scientific laboratory for the Maypole <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margarine.html" title="Margarine">Margarine</a> Works in <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southall.html" title="Southall">Southall</a>.</p>
<p>Being born into a reasonably well-off, middle-class family, Agnete had a peaceful childhood. In common with other families of the same social standing she and her two elder brothers, Svend and Eric, were looked after by a <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nanny.html" title="Nanny">nanny</a> and the household also supported a cook and maid. This happy childhood was to end abruptly with the early death of her father in 1921, when Agnete was only 7 years old. This had a profound effect on her for the whole of her life. The family’s income was now drastically reduced and her mother decided to take the young family back to <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, where she knew the boys would receive an excellent free <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_education.html" title="State education">state education</a>.</p>
<p>The family had strong artistic traditions both in the visual arts and music and she was encouraged to take up her interest in painting on pre-formed <a href="../../../c/e/r/Ceramics.html" title="Ceramics">ceramics</a>. At age 19, she applied to the Copenhagen College of Art and Crafts and was accepted, studying there for 3 years. After this she worked with Gerhard Nielsen at the Holbaek Pottery for a year and then moved on to working at Saxbo for Natalie Krebs. In 1938, Agnete married Askel Hoy, an <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architect.html" title="Architect">architect</a>, 7 years her senior and it was this surname she would use for the rest of her professional career. Within a few months the marriage failed. Agnete applied for a formal separation and left <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, accompanied by her mother in 1939 to get away from the unhappy circumstances. She planned to visit her two brothers who had returned to <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> to work, a few years earlier. It was during this visit that war broke out and they were unable to return to <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>.</p>
<p>Needing work, Agnete went to stay with her brother Svend, who lived in the centre of the <a href="../../../p/o/t/Pottery.html" title="Pottery">pottery</a> manufacturing industry at <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stoke-on-Trent_bd53.html" title="Stoke-on-Trent">Stoke on Trent</a> and secured work with Bullers Ltd. Later on she became head of their studio and continued in this position until they closed it down in 1952. After this, she moved down to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> to be with her second husband, Harry Bohrer, whom she married in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>. Once in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, Agnete applied directly to the Doulton <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lambeth.html" title="Lambeth">Lambeth</a> studio and was appointed head of the studio until its closure in 1956.</p>
<p>The next year, Agnete set-up her own studio in her home at <a href="../../../a/c/t/Acton.html" title="Acton">Acton</a>, West London and in the early 60s began lecturing and teaching at various art colleges, including <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hammersmith.html" title="Hammersmith">Hammersmith</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farnham.html" title="Farnham">Farnham</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richmond.html" title="Richmond">Richmond</a>. Her husband Harry died in 1986 and she carried on her life as best she could without his support. However from the early-<a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> onwards Agnete suffered from a disabling illness which was born with great dignity. She died at West Middlesex Hospital, <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isleworth.html" title="Isleworth">Isleworth</a> on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">1 April</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnete_Hoy_197c.html" title="Edit section: Work">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Work</span></h2>
<p>In 1939, Agnete and her mother left <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> on holiday to visit her brothers who had returned to England a few years earlier to work. With the onset of war, they were unexpectedly exiled in England and Agnete went to Liverpool to be near her younger brother, Eric, who was working in the food canning industry. Unable to find suitable employment there, she decided to join her other brother Svend, who lived and worked in the heart of the pottery manufacturing area of Stoke on Trent and look for a pottery based job there. She gained a job with Bullers Ltd. in <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milton.html" title="Milton">Milton</a> as head of the studio. This factory produced porcelain insulators for the electricity industry and had historically run a small design studio. Agnete set about consolidating and expanding this unique industrial studio and began by producing ideas for ‘oven to tableware’, something that was virtually unheard of at that time.</p>
<p>Many of her pots were experimental in nature and with no specific brief or restraint on her ideas, some one-off ceramics were produced, as well as designs for mass production. It was Bullers' intention to sell these wares to Heals in London and so when there were enough prototypes ready, Agnete herself went to see the Heals buyers. They liked the pots but immediately asked her to produce a range of <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porcelain.html" title="Porcelain">porcelain</a> animal models in similar colours, explaining that there was a market for such items in the USA.</p>
<p>As the confidence of the directors at Bullers increased she was allowed to choose assistants for the studio. The first one to arrive on the recommendation of Gordon Forsyth in 1943 was James Rushton, 15 years old, who was employed in the first place to be modeller and caster. Later they were joined by Elsie Forrester and Hilda Hind, both described as decorators. The team grew to 10 and included Harold Thomas whom Agnete considered to be the best ‘thrower’ in <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stoke-on-Trent_bd53.html" title="Stoke-on-Trent">Stoke on Trent</a>. As soon as the workers had ‘proved’ their ability, she encouraged them to develop their own styles. Over the years Agnete invited influential studio potters such as Bernard Leach and his son, Michael and Rosemary Wren to visit. The input of such illustrious visitors added to the general artistic and intellectual atmosphere within the studio.</p>
<p>In 1952, Agnete returned to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> to be with her husband Harry Bohrer where she took a job with the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Doulton_c544.html" title="Royal Doulton">Royal Doulton</a> Lambeth Studio. The <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lambeth.html" title="Lambeth">Lambeth</a> Studio had been in existence for over 80 years, producing salt-glazed stoneware ornamental pieces. The studio was run on similar lines to Bullers though none of the work was ever intended for mass production. Agnete brought her own style to Lambeth by reviving the traditional decorative methods of earlier studio artists and re-using them to make contemporary ceramics. Using a cream-coloured stoneware base she painted flower, bird and fruit motifs, the whole being applied with a transparent glaze.</p>
<p>In 1953, Agnete was asked to produce a range of decorative ware to commemorate the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronation.html" title="Coronation">Coronation</a> of <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Elizabeth_II_e338.html" title="Queen Elizabeth II">Queen Elizabeth II</a>. Among the items she produced were a 3-handled loving cup and a tankard. Perhaps one of her best known pieces from this period is the cat, Pushkin, which was modelled after her own cat – Alexander Pushkin.</p>
<p>By 1956, Doulton's had made the decision to consolidate their business in Stoke-on-Trent and closed the Lambeth Studio, which caused Agnete to set up a workshop in her home in <a href="../../../a/c/t/Acton.html" title="Acton">Acton</a>. She bought a reasonable size electric <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kiln.html" title="Kiln">kiln</a> and acquired an industrial wheel, similar to the kind she had used at Buller's and Doulton's.</p>
<p>Teaching at art colleges in and around London meant that she could use their firing facilities as well as her own. During the late 1950s Agnete, along with many fellow potters, was actively involved in the establishment of the Craftsmen's Potters Association (CPA). It was here and at many other prestigious exhibitions and venues around Britain that her work was shown.</p>
