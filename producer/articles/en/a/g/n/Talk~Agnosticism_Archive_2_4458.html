<p>The neutrality dispute is about the capitalization of God. I'll wait for that to sort itself out before making the necessary changes and removing the header.

<p>Understanding the position adopted by agnostics is easier if one understands the way in which logicians treat statements of belief or knowledge. Such statements are not about facts, but about other statements. For example, <i>god exists</i> is a statement about god, but <i>John believes that god exists</i> is about the statement <i>god exists</i>. In the jargon of the logician, statements about other statements are <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second-order_predicate.html" title="Second-order predicate">second-order predicates</a>.</p>
<p>There are two possible statements one can make regarding the existence of gods – either <i>god exists</i> or <i>god does not exist</i>. Since someone can either agree or disagree with each, there are a total of four possibilities.</p>
<p>one can:</p>
<ul>
<li>agree with the statement: <i>god exists</i></li>
<li>not agree with the statement: <i>god exists</i></li>
<li>agree with the statement: <i>god does not exist</i></li>
<li>not agree with the statement: <i>god does not exist</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Joining these with a conjunction, one can derive four possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theist.html" title="Theist">theist</a> agrees with the statement <i>god exists</i> and does not agree with the statement <i>god does not exist</i></li>
<li>The <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strong_atheist.html" title="Strong atheist">strong atheist</a> does not agree with the statement <i>god exists</i> and agrees with the statement <i>god does not exist</i></li>
<li>The agnostic does not agree with the statement <i>god exists</i> and does not agree with the statement <i>god does not exist</i></li>
<li>One cannot coherently agree with the statement <i>god exists</i> and with the statement <i>god does not exist</i>, since this is a logical contradiction.</li>
</ol>
<p>Agnostics vary in their reasons for agreeing with (3). If one holds that knowledge of god is impossible, it follows that one will not agree with either, since each assumes that one can have some knowledge of god. It is not coherent to believe in god and yet to claim to have no knowledge of god, since the belief <i>at the least</i> implies that one knows god exists. Other agnostics simply reserve their judgment, not claiming that knowledge of the existence of god is impossible, but perhaps claiming that there is insufficient evidence one way or the other. Agnosticism is thus to some degree independent of atheism/theism.</p>
<p>One can draw a distinction between <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belief.html" title="Belief">belief</a> and <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistemology.html" title="Epistemology">knowledge</a> leading some to claiming agnosticism is about knowledge, while atheism/theism is about belief. Since knowledge implies belief, one cannot intelligibly <i>know</i> some proposition to be true and not also <i>believe</i> that proposition is true. Belief does not imply knowledge, but knowledge does imply belief. However claiming to <i>believe</i> something but not <i>know</i> it puts one in a curious position—usually one accuses others of having a belief that is not knowledge.</p>
<p>(A more formal form of the argument is presented at <a href="../../../a/g/n/Talk%7EAgnosticism_Archive_1_a743.html#Logic_of_agnosticism:_Formal_argument" title="Talk:Agnosticism/Archive 1">Talk:Agnosticism/Archive_1#Logic_of_agnosticism:_Formal_argument</a>) <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">Banno</a> 20:19, 26 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Four of your comments might be considered as potential flaws in the argument; however:</p>
<ol>
<li>A false dilemma would only occur if there were other possibilities besides the ones cited. Since the statement in question is “either god exists or god does not exist”, in order to carry your point you must present at least one other possibility. I can’t see a way of doing this without denying the law of the excluded middle, but if you have a third possibility, I’d love to see it.</li>
<li>Embracing contradiction is part of Zen Buddhism, but coherence is not one of their goals. If one wishes to be coherent, one is obliged to reject contradiction, no? Is that not what was stated? Do you think that arguments presented in the Wiki should not attempt to be coherent? What sort of logic do you suggest we use, then?</li>
<li>I would have thought it obvious that the things we know form a subset of the things we believe. This is what “implies” means. Perhaps you would assist by presenting, for example, a case where something is said to be known but not believed? Perhaps a reference to one of the post-modernist articles you allude to would do this?</li>
<li>All that is meant, and necessary for the point, is that to say that someone has a belief that is <i>not</i> knowledge is to disparage that belief. Since this is a point about language use, I fail to see how a citation would be of assistance here. I suspect you have misunderstood, and so I must agree with you that the sentence needs re-writing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although I am flattered, I cannot take credit for the argument. I recall it from my natural theology studies of over twenty years ago, and had thought it a commonplace. But I cannot find reference to it - Perhaps someone else might be able to locate the source? In any event, I would have hoped that the apparent validity of the argument was sufficient for it to be included in the encyclopaedia. Is this not the case? Is it necessary that the argument not only be valid, but also authorised in some way? That might result in very long and tedious articles.</p>
<p>What is it you think I have insinuated? It does not appear that you have supported your accusation that the argument is “riddled with falsehoods”. If you are not trolling, then I suggest you provide some more support for your first three criticisms. I will not attempt to edit or re-insert the argument in the mean time, since if you are trolling, this would result in another mindless edit war. If, however, you do not back up your claims, I might, time permitting, edit the argument and restore it. In the mean time, we would both benefit by knowing what other readers think of the validity of the argument.</p>

<dd>"I would have hoped that the apparent validity of the argument was sufficient for it to be included in the encyclopaedia. Is this not the case? Is it necessary that the argument not only be valid, but also authorized in some way" This brings up some interesting points. First, the argument is bunk. Second, theoretical validity is <b>not</b> good enough. There <b>does</b> need to be some verification possible. References to how and why are presented above, in my last edit. In regards to your last paragraph, I disagree w it almost entirely, and while it would be rude and contentious to go over each and every aspect, I will do you the favor of attempting to answer your questions below. I will be watching, and if you continue not to be able to understand my objections, you might like to review them (and the links) more carefully. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 23:23, 24 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Agnosticism is one. Also, there is the problem of the definition of God. How do you define "God"? How do I? How does everybody? Is there any real consensus?</li>
<li>All I was pointing out is that there are indeed people, theoretically reasonable people, who do not, as you say. strive for "coherence". They should be acknowledged.</li>
<li>I like to call it "factual relativism", Others call it many other things, from "cultural relativism" to "postmodernism" to "subjective reality", but it is defined best as objecting to objective reality. I don't have a handy example of it because I avoid these sorts of dubious informations (I am an <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moral_absolutism.html" title="Moral absolutism">absolutist</a>), but I have no fear that some such example is not readily available. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 23:43, 24 Feb 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<p><br /></p>
<p>You will be watching? Was that a threat, Sam?</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at your replies. I noticed that you are down from the original six points to three.</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you claiming that agnostics think god both exists and does not exist? If so, you fail to understand either the nature of agnosticism, or the nature of logic. I can only assume that you are making such a lame claim as a rhetorical point. Think you should give up on this one, Sam.</li>
<li>I agree. But why do you think that it is appropriate to discuss such folk in the article on agnosticism? Would it also be appropriate to discuss them in, say, <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logic.html" title="Logic">logic</a> or <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theology.html" title="Theology">theology</a>? What is the relevance of your point to this article?</li>
<li>You have not substantiated your claim with an example of something which is known but not believed. What is the relevance of post-modernism to agnosticism? Why should the article on agnosticism discuss <a href="../../../d/e/c/Deconstruction.html" title="Deconstruction">deconstruction</a>?</li>
</ol>
<p>Your position is so silly that I can only assume that your aim is simply to incite disagreement. You have failed to demonstrate your claim “that the argument is bunk”, so now you are relying on an appeal to authority. No doubt you do not think of yourself as a troll. Possibly you see yourself as “confounding unbelievers” or some such. But if it looks like a troll and smells like a troll…</p>
<p>I really don’t want to play your game, Sam. Your stomping around is counterproductive – you’ve succeeded in bullying the authors of <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">atheism</a> into removing all mention of God, for heaven’s sake, making the article look ridiculous.

<p>I am sorry for offending you. I think I was less tactful than I might have been in my description of the "logic of atheism" section. Furthermore, I apologise for referring to you as an "academic" on your talk page. I meant that in only the most general of terms. I resolve to try harder to be polite, I understand how important that is here. Lets focus on making this a better page, and not on personal misunderstandings or POV's. I would be happy if you stayed, and between the two of us we can perhaps create a better "logic of agnosticism" section (Logic is a favorite subject of mine) or at least resolve that it is best to leave it vague, with useful links for the reader to explore. Again, I apologise for any misunderstandings. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 01:06, 26 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sam, how can we work together to ‘create a better “logic of agnosticism” section’ when you cannot tell me what, apart from the lack of authority, is wrong with it? You say you think it vague – in what way? Do you now wish to re-install it, despite the lack of a reference?

<p>In my experience here on Wikipedia, there is no problem of any size or complexity that can't be solved with an elabourate and colourful table of some kind.&#160;:) How about using something like this to try clarifying the various positions that people can take on these issues?</p>

<dd>Brilliant. This is MUCH better, and is a solid step in the right direction. I'm anxious to see/work on the text to go along with this, and have some theoretical concerns, such as the importance that we not be judgemental/negative in our description of those who may hold contridictory beliefs, as well as the care that we utilize when employing the terms "God, god, gods, and diety/dieties" so as not to provide innacurate information. Anyhow, I am heartilly in favor of what you have done, thank you. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 04:46, 28 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, calling the last row and the last column contradictory shouldn't be all that controversial since they basically boil down to "I believe A and not-A"&#160;:) The strong atheism/strong agnosticism one I'm very unsure of, hence the question mark. I can <i>almost</i> imagine holding both those views at once in a non-contradictory manner (update: I managed to imagine it a few minutes after writing this, wasn't as hard as it seemed&#160;:), but it depends on drawing some fine distinctions between belief and knowledge. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 04:59, 28 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd love to hear you explain that fine distinction, as I can't fathom it. This has always been a feature of my argument against atheism. It is a central error of Atheism (IMO), that one cannot intellegently claim certainty against Gods existance. The very nature of God implies an esoteric aspect not subject to disproval, much like astrology is said to have. While inductively someone might claim to rationally assume against the existance of God, deductively there is no disproving him. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 05:50, 28 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Heh. IMO it's a central error of Sam Spade that all atheists <i>do</i> claim certainty.&#160;:) But that's not really relevant at the moment, because the cell of the table under discussion is a "strong atheist" cell where certainty is indeed claimed. How about this analogy: "There aren't any cupcakes inside black holes. I don't <i>know</i> that for a fact, because I've never been able to look inside one and don't think I ever will, but I'll dispute anyone who claims that there might be." Such a person believes that he can never know the answer (he's a strong cupcake-agnostic), but he's nevertheless quite confident about what the answer is (there are no black hole cupcakes). One may make the case that his confidence is unwarranted, but that doesn't change the fact that he does indeed believe that there are no cupcakes in there. How's that sound? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 06:07, 28 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perfect, I agree completely with your analogy. I make the case that the confidence is unwarranted. I think this subtlety, this question of contradiction aught to be discussed within the article, fairly of course. Perhaps a sentence or so presenting each interpretation, and the significance thereof would be appropriate. Again, good editing, and I am anxious to see some of the text you would present in regards to this chart (shall I assume we are unanimously in favor of it? ) as well as what myself and others will add. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 06:30, 28 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks. I agree that these subtle distinctions are important to describe in the article, as well as the potential controversy over some of them. I'll tinker with the wording of the table a bit here first, though; some of those headers are exceptionally large and could use trimming down (if possible without losing meaning). It should be possible to incorporate a lot of Banno's previous work too, I'll ponder ways to splice it all together nicely. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 23:49, 28 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think a brief review of the preceeding section of this talk will reveal a plethora of objections to the previous logic of agnosticism section. I am profoundly dubious of what portion of it would be useful, and I heartilly encourage you to review said objections. Also, I feel that the (possibly contridictory) mention within the table is vital, although the exact wording of it is quite flexable. Maybe just a asterisk, question mark, or some such. The "with certainty" is also vital IMO. Jeep up the good work, <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 00:00, 29 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I still think there are a few things in there that will be handy to reuse, such as the paragraph on the distinction between belief and knowledge and a little discussion of how agnosticism is "belief <i>about</i> knowledge". The stuff I removed from the table a few minutes ago was removed purely to see if I could make the table a little smaller physically; there'll be a lot of text accompanying this table where those details can be described in more depth. I'm just dropping by Wikipedia for a few minutes right now, though, so I wasn't going to get into writing all that up until later today at the earliest. We'll see how it goes.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:08, 29 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

Since knowledge implies belief, they might say one cannot intelligibly <i>know</i> some proposition to be true and not also <i>believe</i> that proposition is true. They would say belief does not imply knowledge, but knowledge does imply belief. However claiming to <i>believe</i> something but not <i>know</i> it puts one in a curious position in their eyes.

<p>I have been over this a few times, and while I don't see it needing to be entirely removed, and I have NPOV'ed it repeatedly, I am still deeply disatisfied with the assumptions it makes, and the lack of opposing POV. Not only do I not agree w much of what it contains, but the information it contains is unverifiable (isn't it?) and in some ways is misleading. I very much want to see this balanced with a non-agnostic POV. It is actually very easy to know something is true, and yet not believe it. One may know that they are going to physically die, but still not believe it. Its unnaceptable to them, unimaginable.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">belief</span></h2>
<p>Sam &amp; Bryan, belief has more than one sense. One can believe something in the sense of having confidence or faith in it. One can also believe a statement in the sense of assenting to its truth. The two senses are distinguished in every dictionary I have consulted. The text cut from the article uses belief in the latter sense. Sam’s counter argument uses it in the former sense.</p>
<p>Such a simple confusion should not have taken place in the development of this article. That it has occurred says much about the quality of the editing.</p>
<p>I invite you to take another look at the table you have constructed. Does this nomenclature exist elsewhere, or is it “original research”?</p>

<dd>I have always used belief in the "assenting to truth" sense when working on this article, myself. As for the nomenclature it seems very hard to find an authoratative source on this stuff so I've focused mainly on trying to keep it consistent rather than authoratative. Feel free to suggest other terms for these positions, if others are in more widespread use in philosophical circles. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 18:06, 16 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Belief is a word traditionally utilized for this subject however, and no matter the definition used, it seems to me to imply a certain lack of certainty, but as is said in the article, the debate over <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objective_truth.html" title="Objective truth">objective truth</a> is not one we are intending to solve here&#160;;).

<p>Ah. Now I remember why I decided not to work on this page. That a word is used with one meaning in the article, and with another in a supposed counterexample, is a "useless subtlety". <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">Banno</a> 20:42, 16 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think that perhaps the biggest problem this particular article suffers from, especially in a Wikipedia environment, is that the term "Agnosticism" has been used for so many different philosophies over the years by so many different people and there's no one central authority that one can go to for clarification (as I've occasionally described it, unbelievers don't have a "Book of Nothing" they can quote from&#160;:). Perhaps it might be a good idea to try considering various uses of the term separately? For example, add a section titled "Huxley's agnosticism" that focuses specifically and explicitly on the stuff that Huxley was talking about, a section titled "Agnosticism as belief about the possibility of knowledge", a section titled "Agnosticism as 'atheism lite' in western society", etc. Then, once the various sections are fleshed out more, perhaps try to find a better synthesis of them to serve as an overview of agnosticism as a whole. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 08:41, 17 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>So, the table you disliked has now been entirely deleted. Where would you suggest that it go instead, Banno? A cursory look through some of the other related articles leads me to think it might fit well in <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theism.html" title="Theism">theism</a>, which is currently just a big list of various related types of theism and has agnosticism/atheism stuff in the see also; the table would fit in with that fairly well IMO. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 19:19, 2 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
For what it’s worth, I think the table is essentially muddle-headed. A taxonomy of belief will not catch all the possible permutations, nor will it rule out the falsehoods that have at times been propagated here (I’m thinking of the claims that Kant and Ayer held to some form of agnosticism). I was also unable to see what the purpose of the table was. It is obscure: the vertical dimension deals in third order predicates of the form “X believes that Y can know that P” – far to obscure to be useful, I count 32 possible permutations. Half of the content cells of the table contain contradictions – I don’t see a point in including them. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">Banno</a> 01:09, May 3, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Perhaps a better approach would be to place the possibilities as first order predicates on one dimension and the taxonomy on the other:</p>
<pre>
         Believes in god       Does not believe in god     has knowledge of god    Etc
Theist               yes                      no                      yes
Agnostic              no                      no                      no
Weak atheist      and so on
Callithumpian
Whatever
</pre>
<p>As for where it belongs, I think it pretty clear that it needs to be in an article that sits above both theological knowledge and belief. Why not put it in its own page, and link from the other pages? But for my money, I don’t see a great deal of worth in it. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">Banno</a> 01:09, May 3, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's a little contradictory, but not fundamentally so IMO; it's describing a variety of different positions one can take on these matters, and some of those positions happen to disagree with each other. The first one you list above is that one might <i>believe</i> that "you can't know X is true without believing X is true", and the second shows an example where that belief might be false.

<p>Either way, I'd like to see what people think of useing this chart. <a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDroege_a7b0.html" title="User:CBDroege">CBDroege</a> 3 May 2004, 0234</p>

<dd>Chris, I declined previously to add comment because, as I’ve already said, I don’t see a point to the table. But since no one else has commented, I’ll throw in my two bits – This was a valiant effort. It is an improvement. In essence, I think the possible range of beliefs is too great to be covered by such a table, and that in part is why you wind up with (?) in so many of the boxes. But a nice try, anyhow. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">Banno</a> 06:34, May 12, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since it's a step in the right direction, at least, how about we try letting the Wikipedia Process work its magic and perhaps reduce some of the question marks? I'm going to copy this over into the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theism.html" title="Theism">theism</a> article and see what the people over there think, as per my suggestion in <a href="#Overview_of_Available_Positions_Regarding_Belief" title="">#Overview of Available Positions Regarding Belief</a>, above. Better than letting it slip quietly away into talk archive oblivion, IMO. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 05:10, 15 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>
