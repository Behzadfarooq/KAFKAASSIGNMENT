	    <p>The entire two paragraphs on the UN and acts of aggression should be compacted to a few lines with a link to the 'definitions of aggression' article. - 20/04/06</p>
<p>"Aggression is a basic drive of life" Aggression is not a <b>drive</b> -<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 15:32, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>"The easiest aggression to explain is that of a group defending itself against a predator to prevent to be eaten.</p>
<p>Either the strong will form a circle around the weak and defend them, thus using aggression and also endangering themselves, or the group will flee and the weak gets eaten, which may eventually lead to extinction."</p>
<p><a href="../../../g/r/o/Group_selection.html" title="Group selection">Group selection</a> explanation? - Not Good.</p>
<p>In fact, the more I read this page, the more I think it's really not up to snuff. The psychology section should include some discussion of instrumental aggression, reactive aggression etc, in addition to the indirect aggression. The biology section, well there should be a biology section, and it should discuss aggression as a method of securing access to resources, rather than casting it as a behavioural aberration.</p>
<p>To add: Brain's (1979) classification, and other criticisms of Moyer's classification.</p>
<p>Other forms of aggression to add:</p>
<ul>
<li>indirect/social aggression</li>
<li>displaced aggression</li>
<li>schedule-induced aggression</li>
<li>ritualized (ethological sense) aggression</li>
</ul>

<p>This piece is confusing and contradictory. The writing and thinking are poor. The section, for example, appears to confuse defense and aggression:</p>
<p>"Aggression against outsiders</p>
<p>The easiest aggression to explain is that of a group defending itself against a predator to prevent being eaten.</p>
<p>Either the strong will form a circle around the weak and defend them, thus using aggression and also endangering themselves, or the group will flee and the weak get eaten.'</p>

<p>"Aggression is a basic aspect of living beings and part of the process of survival and evolution.</p>
<p>Aggression in humans is partly genetic, with origins going back to our reptilian ancestors, and partly a result of upbringing. "</p>
<p>"living beings" might better be restricted to "animals", and "reptilian ancestors" is a bit strange, fish are perfectly capable of aggression...

<p>In my opinion, this piece still needs work, including some citations to back up the various assertions. It's still conceptually self-contradictory, and in places the writing could be improved.</p>

<p>I have added a See Also PsychoanalyticTheoryA Fundamental Revision. Aside from the UN definition, and the Aggro stuff, this article is an unorganized series of examples of mostly individual and some group aggression. This is characteristic of the literature on aggression. However running through are frequent mentions or references to two important easily observed constructs from ethology and animal behavior, namely, Territory and Dominance. These two constructs refer to complex patterns of behavior which have not been taken seriously in the literature on human behavior. The above WP link starts the process. Don't be put off by the title or introduction and explanation.This was just an almost empty article with a semi-appropriate title.Most of the text could just as easily been placed here.<a href="../../../i/s/l/User%7EIslandsage_f502.html" title="User:Islandsage">Islandsage</a> 01:42, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Example follows: "For example, a researcher’s ideas becomes territory through his personal interaction over time with the formulation, elaboration, and maintenance of those specific ideas. The researcher will not only vigorously defend her ideas, but will return again and again to those ideas even after long periods of separation. In fact, an individual may perservere in holding abstract ideas long after they have been factually contradicted or period of usefulness is exceeded, as in an obsolete scientific theory , religious beliefs, or political dogma."<a href="../../../i/s/l/User%7EIslandsage_f502.html" title="User:Islandsage">Islandsage</a> 18:22, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I added a well accepted definition of aggression from social psychology, so this should help us to focus our thoughts while cleaning up this article. While talking about aggression, it's important to make sure we understand what aggression is <i>not</i>. <a href="../../../j/c/b/User%7EJcbutler_a250.html" title="User:Jcbutler">Jcbutler</a> 23:42, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A worthwhile article to add, considering that this quality is coveted in many areas of music, particularly heavy metal. It forms the spine of the genre's ethos, among others.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree. Music is generally not used to harm others. This topic might be more appropriately addressed elsewhere. <a href="../../../j/c/b/User%7EJcbutler_a250.html" title="User:Jcbutler">Jcbutler</a> 23:43, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/g/Talk%7EAggression_6e8f.html" title="Edit section: Anthropocentric">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Anthropocentric</span></h2>
<p>This article seems to me to be sorely lacking in content, at least based on my expectations for such an important topic. Further, I have noted it as anthropocentric, as it completely ignores questions of animal aggression, which could then be tied into how animal aggression is manifest in more complex human aggression.</p>
<p>I cannot rewrite the article myself at this time, though I may contribute to it later. Excellent reading on the subject could be had in <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desmond_Morris_9be1.html" title="Desmond Morris">Desmond Morris</a>'s books, as he covers the topic in many of his published works. --<a href="../../../l/v/t/User%7ELvthn13_0eaf.html" title="User:Lvthn13">Lvthn13</a> 04:24, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is an interesting point. I normally think of aggression as something that occurs between human beings, but I can see how a short section on animal aggression would be very valuable here, especially in the context of evolutionary theory and research. <a href="../../../j/c/b/User%7EJcbutler_a250.html" title="User:Jcbutler">Jcbutler</a> 23:45, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It looks like 140.247.44.100 has made some solid improvements. I think the definition and Moyer's classification have value though, so I have restored them, along with some softening of the language suggesting that aggression is no longer perplexing. I like the emphasis on biology and evolution, though I think the article needs some additional social psychological research and theory. Some anthropological work on the influence of culture would also help to round out the section on human aggression. <a href="../../../j/c/b/User%7EJcbutler_a250.html" title="User:Jcbutler">Jcbutler</a> 20:29, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd say that in the biological literature, "aggression" is taken to mean within a social context, that is to say between members of the same species. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 19:32, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Alcohol, pain and discomfort, frustration, and <b>violence on television</b> are just a few of the factors that influence aggression in humans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Er...I'm pretty sure the television thing isn't a scientifically proven fact.<br />
138.243.129.4 15:14, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>From a review article by Anderson &amp; Bushman 2001 (<i>Psychological Science</i> <b>12</b>:353-359) "Five decades of research into the effects of exposure to violent television and movies have produced a thoroughly documented and highly sophisticated set of research findings. It is now known that even brief exposure to violent TV or movie scenes causes significant increases in aggression, that repeated exposure of children to media violence increases their aggressiveness as young adults, and that media violence is a significant risk factor in youth violence (Bushman &amp; Huesmann, 2001; Huesmann et al., 2001)." <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 15:45, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also keep in mind that these are considered to be risk factors, or "factors that influence" aggression. No one is claiming a simplistic view of causality in which a person sees violence and then immediately goes out and commits violence 100% of the time. The link between aggression and violence isn't actually <i>proven</i> but then the theories of evolution and gravity aren't proven either. They are merely explanations that have a tremendous amount of empirical support. I'd recommend going over to <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logic.html" title="Logic">logic</a> or <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geometry.html" title="Geometry">geometry</a> if you want to talk about proof. Scientists try to avoid that word. --<a href="../../../j/c/b/User%7EJcbutler_a250.html" title="User:Jcbutler">Jcbutler</a> 16:24, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
