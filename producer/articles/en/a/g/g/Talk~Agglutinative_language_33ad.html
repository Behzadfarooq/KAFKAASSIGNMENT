<dd>Take the time to minor in Linguistics and learn about the various types of polysynthetic languages, like me. The error you are seeing on the web is the near-ubiquitous one of mistaking "agglutinative" for a synonym of "(poly)synthetic". It is not. (you might find the article on fusional language, skeletal as it is, rather instructive.) --<a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELenBudney_873b.html" title="User:LenBudney">User:LenBudney</a></dd>

<p>I've moved German and Esperanto to the back, saying 'and to a lesser extent'. More seriously, I've changed 'polysynthetic' to 'synthetic'. The term 'polysynthetic' refers to languages like those in North America that incorporate both the noun and verb into a single phonological word. The term 'agglutinative' covers two things: (a) multiple morphemes in the same word, and that's in core inflection of nouns and verbs (so a few English examples like <i>kind+ness+es</i> don't count); and (b) each morpheme phonetically separate, as opposed to other synthetic types. In fact, the core morphology of German is fusional: -es is gen.+sg.+m/n., so it really shouldn't be in the list. <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGritchka_9a6d.html" title="User:Gritchka">Gritchka</a> 17:43 25 Jul 2003 (UTC)~</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>I would like to agree with you (Gritchka) about the idea that 'polysynthetic' =&gt; noun incorporation. However, several months ago I had a conversation about this on a mailing list, and at least etymologically (going back to Sapir, I think) 'polysynthetic' simply means "extremely agglutinative" or "containing in a single word what would be complete sentences in other languages." Of course the latter is vague (you can arguably do this in a pro-drop fusional language), but the general idea is that there are a whole lot of morphemes in a single word. And this seems to be a (not necessarily the only) widespread idea of what 'polysynthetic' means. (I've actually never heard the term 'synthetic' used this way, but maybe I have just overlooked it.)</dd>

I'd like to give an example from Turkish, a word primary-school kids like to play on:</p>
<p>Çekoslovakyalılaştırabildiklerimizden misiniz?</p>
<p>This is one word, and one sentence, actually, meaning: are you among the ones whom we were able to turn into a Czechlovakian? (politically outdated, though)</p>
<p>Çekoslovakyalı[Czechoslovakian] + -laştır[turn into] + abil[ability = to be able to] + -dik[past tense = were] + -ler[plural suffix for the object -&gt; so that it becomes first person plural; "we" namely] + -imiz[this doesn't mean "we" actually, but indicates that the object performing the action is "we", first person plural] + -den[among] + -mi[question suffix] + -siniz [are you? -&gt; makes the subject the second person plural]</p>
<p><br />
The longest known word in Finnish (and possibly in the whole world) is 103 letters long:</p>
<p>Kumarreksituteskenteleentuvaisehkollaismaisekkuudellisenneskenteluttelemattomammuuksissaansakaankopahan</p>
<p>As its creator, professor Artturi Kannisto, has died, nobody has been able to actually interpret its meaning -- or even tell how many morphemes there are in it. However, it is definitely a real word.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Um, if no one knows what it means, or even what the morphemes are, how can we be sure it's a real word? I'm not slagging, I'm seriously curious. I could just as easily say that <b>freemjaboodinalitatiousnessism</b> is a new long word, and as no one could say what it means, then by the logic apparent above, it would be a "real" word...? Or am I missing something in your argument?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, not to rain on any parades, but my (probably limited) understanding was that the longest words on record were chemical names. Due to the complicated atomic structure of some rather large molecules, it becomes possible to come up with some truly ridiculously long formal names for these compounds (such as that listed here at <a href="http://www.fun-with-words.com/word_longest.html#Chemical" class="external text" title="http://www.fun-with-words.com/word_longest.html#Chemical" rel="nofollow">Fun-With-Words.com</a>, sporting 1,185 letters).</dd>

<p>It would be very helpful to include an example from each language which shows the full structure of its agglutination. By this I mean which agglutinative morphemes can appear in which positions.</p>
<p>It would be nice to have one example for a verb, and one example for a noun.</p>
<p>Some languages are regularly stated to be agglutinative but their agglutinative properties are seldom discussed. Japanese and Korean fall into this category. Illustrative examples for them will be valuable.</p>
<p>Some languages can be analysed in multiple ways with one way being more accepted, or different ways accepted by different groups. For instance, Hungarian is considered to have cases by some, and considered to have nouns built from individual particles by others. Japanese verbs are usually described as conjugating but the conjugations can be broken down into functional pieces. Japanese nouns are pronounced with their following particles attached but described in terms of the particles being separate words. It would be good to show the more agglutinating analysis here, perhaps with a note. — <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHippietrail_ecc5.html" title="User:Hippietrail">Hippietrail</a> 13:38, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The postposed particles in Japanese are indeed part of the same phonological word, but they're not agglutinative morphemes; they're <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clitic.html" title="Clitic">clitics</a>. Note also that the copula is also a clitic (I mean anything like <i>da</i>, <i>desu</i>, <i>deshou</i>, etc.). I don't know enough Japanese to propose good examples, but I guess I can chip in with <i>tabetakunakatta</i>: <i>tabe-</i> "eat", <i>-ta-</i> "want", <i>-ku</i> adverbial operator, <i>-na(i)</i> negative, <i>-katta</i> past tense mark for adjectives = "did not want to eat". --<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the example. I have the Finnish structure for nouns, verbs, and participles downstairs. I think I have the Basque structure too. I'll try to post them soon.</dd>
<dd>A couple of questions, am I right in thinking the difference between the enclitics and agglutinative morphemes is that the latter would only be able to join specific word classes (nouns or verbs but not both) whereas the former can join onto any kind of word whatsoever?</dd>
<dd>Also, can clitics be added in arbitrary order or does the degree of freedom vary by word class and by language? Do you know the answer at least in the case of Japanese? — <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHippietrail_ecc5.html" title="User:Hippietrail">Hippietrail</a> 12:18, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>A clitic is more or less defined as a morpheme that behaves syntactically like a separate word, and phonologically like a bound morpheme. That is, a clitic appears in places where you would expect a separate word, but sounds as if it were an affix (which it isn't). An affix is applied to specific word classes, as you say, while a clitic may be attached anywhere (well not anywhere, but the distribution rules are not as rigid). For example, the articles in Romance languages are proclitic: Spanish <i>un beso</i> "a kiss" is phonologically one word. But you can add an adjective in between: <i>un apasionado beso</i> "a passionate kiss". The article just cliticizes on the first word it encounters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the rules: I'm sure no language allows clitics complete freedom of order (it's the same with words). In Japanese the clitics are the postpositions, the copula and some other particles, and they all come after the rest. They're not distributed arbitrarily. Suppose this (clumsy) example:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Kore wa anata no desu ka?</i></dd>
<dd>this (TOPIC) you (GENITIVE) (COPULA) (QUESTION)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Phonologically those are two words: <i>kore-wa</i> and <i>anata-no-desu-ka</i>. Neither can be ordered differently: the genitive always follows the noun/pronoun, the copula or the verb comes at the end in declarative sentences, and if the sentence is an interrogative one, you add <i>ka</i> after the verb. --<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

<p>At the bottom of the page, there is the statement:</p>
<p>"Agglutinative languages tend to have a high rate of affixes/morphemes per word, and to be very regular. For example, Japanese has only two irregular verbs, and Turkish has only one."</p>
<p>I believe that there are three irregular Japanese verbs:</p>
<p>"suru" (to do) has the stem form "shi" -- if it was regular, it would be "su" or "suri"</p>
<p>"kuru" (to come) has the stem form "ki" -- if it was regular, it would be "ku" or "kuri"</p>
<p>"iku" (to go) has the gerund form "itte" -- if it was regular, it would be "iite"</p>
<p>I suspect that the two noted verbs in the article are "kuru" and "suru". Is there any reason that "iku" was left out?</p>
<p>-Seth</p>
<dl>
<dd>Some analyses of Japanese grammar don't consider "suru" to be a true verb but rather an "auxiliary". So maybe that writer was only considering "kuru" and "iku" — <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHippietrail_ecc5.html" title="User:Hippietrail">Hippietrail</a> 22:59, 29 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Can it really be said that Japanese has only 3 irregular verbs? That is based on the idea that the verb です - basically, "to be" - is not a verb, rather a thing that is added to end of a sentence that lacks a verb, even though it acts like a verb. An IRREGULAR verb. And there are also several other verbs formed from a noun + one of those three irregular verbs, and so they too are irregular. <a href="../../../e/l/v/User%7EElvenscout742_266b.html" title="User:Elvenscout742">elvenscout742</a> 22:55, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I concur that some consideration should be given for what to do with the Japanese ending copula <i>da</i> / <i>desu</i>. However, I would not go so far as to include compound verbs formed by nouns + irregulars. On the one hand, the list gets ridiculously long pretty quickly, and on the other, they are after all compounds. Though 勉強する <i>benkyō suru</i> translates roughly as "study" or "to study" in English, the basic morphemes in Japanese are quite separate and distinct -- <i>benkyō</i>, and <i>suru</i>. One may as well advocate lumping together similar constructs in English as single verbs -- but then "dothelaundry" doesn't seem to work very well. &#160;:) --- <a href="../../../e/i/r/User%7EEirikr_d43d.html" title="User:Eirikr">Eirikr</a> 05:42, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have been to the website, but I do not see why they are irregular (the site which lists the supposedly 14 irregular verbs). I have consulted with over 5 teachers of Turkish in the United States and Europe, and they claim that Turkish does not have any irregular verbs. That is why I corrected the article, saying that Turkish has no irregular verbs.</p>
<p>If 'to be' isn't conjugated the same as every other verb in Turkish - in other words, if you can't take the infinitive and deduce all forms of the verb using a consistent rule - then it's irregular. By that definition it seems irregular to me, based on the link above. 65.96.15.43 01:07, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know about "to be" in Turkish, but it's quite possible that some people analyse it as a verb and others as a copula which they see as not a verb though usually with many similarities. — <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHippietrail_ecc5.html" title="User:Hippietrail">Hippietrail</a> 02:08, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the verb in question is "one of a kind", it's a copula, and is morphosyntactically different from the others in some way, then maybe it should not be called an irregular verb.

<p>What is the reference for there being only a few irregular verbs in Nahuatl? I can't find anything on the 'Nahuatl' wiki page. Also at issue is which Nahuatl. Presumably this refers to classical Nahuatl, i.e. the form attested in various written manuscripts from the early post-conquest era. I'm working with another researcher on building a morphological transducer for several varieties of modern-day Nahuatl, and I can attest to the fact that these varieties are *full* of irregularity. (Of course some of the irregularity is predictable on a phonological basis, if you allow your phonological rules access to lexical features; but to me, needing to refer to lexical features in the phonology is synonomous with "irregular".) <a href="../../../m/c/s/User%7EMcswell_7a2e.html" title="User:Mcswell">Mcswell</a> 14:31, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Comment added later: I just ran across the Wikipedia entry for 'Irregular verb', which also does not mention Nahuatl. <a href="../../../m/c/s/User%7EMcswell_7a2e.html" title="User:Mcswell">Mcswell</a> 20:11, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
