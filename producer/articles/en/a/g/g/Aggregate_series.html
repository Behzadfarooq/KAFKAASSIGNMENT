<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/g/Aggregate_series.html" title="Edit section: A1">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A1</span></h3>
<p>The A1 was the first rocket design in the Aggregate series. It was designed in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a> by <a href="../../../w/e/r/Wernher_von_Braun_52ea.html" title="Wernher von Braun">Wernher von Braun</a> in a <a href="../../../w/e/h/Wehrmacht.html" title="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> (German army) research program at <a href="../../../k/u/m/Kummersdorf.html" title="Kummersdorf">Kummersdorf</a> headed by <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Dornberger_77b7.html" title="Walter Dornberger">Walter Dornberger</a>. The rocket was 1.4 m long, and had a takeoff weight of 150 <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilogram.html" title="Kilogram">kg</a>. The engine, designed by <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Rudolph_3e08.html" title="Arthur Rudolph">Arthur Rudolph</a>, used <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcohol.html" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/q/Liquid_oxygen.html" title="Liquid oxygen">liquid oxygen</a>, and produced 3 <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilonewton.html" title="Kilonewton">kilonewtons</a> of thrust. The rocket was designed to be stabilized using a heavy rotating wheel in the nose, but there was concern that this might cause problems with the liquid fuels. Although the engine had been successfully test fired, the first flight attempt blew up on the launching pad. Since the design was thought to be unstable, no further attempts were made, and efforts moved to the A2 design.</p>
<p><a name="A2" id="A2"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/g/Aggregate_series.html" title="Edit section: A2">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A2</span></h3>
<p>The A2 was designed in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a> by von Braun under the program at <a href="../../../k/u/m/Kummersdorf.html" title="Kummersdorf">Kummersdorf</a> headed by <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Dornberger_77b7.html" title="Walter Dornberger">Walter Dornberger</a></p>
<p>At a length of 1.6 meters and thrust of 3 kilonewtons from alcohol and liquid oxygen, it was in outline similar to the A1. However, in contrast to the A1, the A2 had the stabilization <a href="../../../g/y/r/Gyroscopes.html" title="Gyroscopes">gyroscopes</a> in the center of the rocket between the alcohol and oxygen tanks, which made it more stable. The rocket weighed 72 kg empty, with takeoff weight of 107 kg. Initial flight testing was done in September 1934 at Kummersdorf.</p>
<p>Two A2s were built for a full out test, and were given the names Max and Moritz. On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_19.html" title="December 19">December 19</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_20.html" title="December 20">December 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a> they were flown in front of the Army brass at an island in the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Sea_f231.html" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> named <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borkum.html" title="Borkum">Borkum</a>. They reached altitudes of 2.2 km and 3.5 km. (Gatland 1989, p. 10).</p>
<p><a name="A3" id="A3"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/g/Aggregate_series.html" title="Edit section: A3">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A3</span></h3>
<p>The A3 was first <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocket_launch.html" title="Rocket launch">launched</a> on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_4.html" title="December 4">December 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>, and was intended to test components for the planned A4.</p>
<p>Only three more test launches were carried out, all of them failures. The final launch, on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_11.html" title="December 11">December 11</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>, was typical of all the attempts: the engine cut out early, and the rocket was destroyed as it fell to the ground, the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parachute.html" title="Parachute">parachute</a> failing to deploy. All the failures were due to the unstable design of the rocket's experimental <a href="../../../i/n/e/Inertial_guidance_system.html" title="Inertial guidance system">inertial guidance system</a>.</p>
<p>After this last unsuccessful launch, the A3 was abandoned, and a complete redesign was carried out to bring the A5 into being, and to continue subscale testing for the A4.</p>
<p>The A3 was the first Peenemünde design (Huzel 1962, p. 235). In 1936, Army General von Fritsch witnessed a static firing of an A3 at Kummersdorf, and was sufficiently impressed to lend his support to the rocket program (Huzel 1962, p. 233). Since ground was not broken until August, 1936, von Fritsch's viewing must have been in September through December. The A3 also used a pressure-fed propellant system, using the same liquid oxygen and 75% alcohol mixture as the A1 and A2. It generated 3,300 pounds of thrust for 45 seconds. It used a three gyroscope system to deflect tungsten alloy jet vanes (Huzel 1962, p. 236). Several A3s were launched, reaching a maximum downrange of 7.5 miles and maximum altitude of 11 miles. Three A3s were launched from Greifswalder Oie in Autumn 1937. They carried a three-axis gyro control system which actuated exhaust vanes. On the first launch, the parachute opened after five seconds, causing the rocket to crash into the sea. Parachutes were omitted on the second and third launches, but both rockets still went out of control (Gatland 1989, p. 11).</p>

<p>The A4 was a full-sized design with a range of about 175&#160;km (110 miles), a top altitude of 80&#160;km and a payload of about a <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tonne.html" title="Tonne">tonne</a>. Versions of the A4 included the first ballistic missile, the first projectile to reach <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space.html" title="Space">space</a>, and were actively used in warfare.</p>
<p>This increase in capability had come through a complete redesign of the A3 engine by <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Thiel_bfd9.html" title="Walter Thiel">Walter Thiel</a>, known as the A5. It became clearer that von Braun's designs were turning into real weapons, and Dornberger moved the team from the artillery testing grounds at <a href="../../../k/u/m/Kummersdorf.html" title="Kummersdorf">Kummersdorf</a> (near <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>) to a small town, <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peenem%C3%BCnde.html" title="Peenemünde">Peenemünde</a>, on the island of <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usedom.html" title="Usedom">Usedom</a> on Germany's <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltic_Sea_a4f2.html" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic</a> coast, in order to provide more room for testing and greater secrecy. This version was completely reliable, and by 1941 the team had fired about 70 A5 rockets. The first A4 flew in March 1942, flying about 1.6&#160;km and crashing into the water. The second launch reached an altitude of 11&#160;km before exploding. The third rocket, launched on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_3.html" title="October 3">October 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>, followed its trajectory perfectly. It landed 193&#160;km away, and reached a height of 80&#160;km (50&#160;mi) becoming the first rocket to reach outer space.</p>
<p>Production started in 1943 on the rocket, now known as the <i>Vergeltungswaffe 2</i> (Vengeance Weapon 2) or V-2, at the insistence of <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Goebbels_d1dd.html" title="Joseph Goebbels">Goebbels</a>' <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> ministry. The <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allies.html" title="Allies">Allies</a> were already aware of the weapon - at a test site at <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blizna.html" title="Blizna">Blizna</a> in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a> a fired missile had been recovered by Polish resistance agents from the banks of the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Bug_7404.html" title="Western Bug">Western Bug</a>, and vital technical details had been given to British intelligence.</p>

<p>The A4b was a winged version of the A4. It was developed during 1944 and 1945 in order to double the range of the A4. Test starts were made on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_27.html" title="December 27">December 27</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a> <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_13.html" title="January 13">January 13</a>, and <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_24.html" title="January 24">January 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a> in <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peenemuende.html" title="Peenemuende">Peenemuende</a>. The first two attempts were aborted, while the third launch was successful, but the rocket did not achieve the planned range because of a wing failure. The program was cancelled at that point.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/g/Aggregate_series.html" title="Edit section: A5">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A5</span></h3>
<p>The A5 had a length of 5.825 meters, a diameter of 0.78 meters, a takeoff weight of 900 kilograms and a takeoff thrust of 1.5 MN. The engines were alcohol fueled with liquid oxygen as an <a href="../../../o/x/i/Oxidant.html" title="Oxidant">oxidant</a>. The first launch of the A5 took place in the summer of <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a> at <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greifswalder_Oie_5fa9.html" title="Greifswalder Oie">Greifswalder Oie</a>. The first successful guided flights were in October <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a> in order to test the control systems planned for use in the A4. The A5 reached a ceiling of up to 12 kilometers and could be used several times.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/g/Aggregate_series.html" title="Edit section: A6">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A6</span></h3>
<p>The A6 was a war rocket suggested by von Braun at the beginning of the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940s</a>. The A6 was to be an improved A4b, propelled by nitric acid and kerosene and with a longer range than the A4. It was not realized because of the progress of the war. The takeoff thrust would have been about 12,500 kgf (123 kN), a wing span of 6.3 m, and the overall length 15.75 m. <a href="http://www.friends-partners.org/partners/mwade/lvs/a6.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.friends-partners.org/partners/mwade/lvs/a6.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/g/Aggregate_series.html" title="Edit section: A7">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A7</span></h3>
<p>The A7 was a winged design that was never fully constructed. It was worked on between <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a> at Peenemuende for the <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kriegsmarine.html" title="Kriegsmarine">Kriegsmarine</a>. The A7 was similar in structure to the A5, but had larger tail unit fins (1.621 m²) in order to obtain greater range in gliding flight. Two unpowered models of the A7 were dropped from airplanes in order to test flight stability; no powered test was ever performed. The finished rocket should have produced a takeoff thrust of 15 kN and a takeoff weight of 1000 kg. The design had a diameter of 0.38 m and a length of 5.91 m.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/g/Aggregate_series.html" title="Edit section: A8">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A8</span></h3>
<p>The A8 was prepared in Peenemünde and never finished because of the progressive war situation. The A8 would have had a takeoff thrust of 340 kN with a takeoff weight of 22,370 kg. The diameter was 0.78 m. The weapon designs were finished in 1944.</p>
<p><a name="A9" id="A9"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/g/g/Aggregate_series.html" title="Edit section: A9">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A9</span></h3>
<p>The <b>A9</b> was a further development of the A4 rocket. No prototype was ever developed due to the ending of the war, although a variant, the A4b, was produced before the end of the war. The A9 would have been used as the upper stage for an intercontinental missile or a manned craft. The A10 was to have been used for the lower stage.</p>

<p>The A10, which was never actually constructed, was intended to serve as first stage for the A9, to help it to reach an intercontinental range. <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> and other targets in the northeastern U.S. were its intended targets. <a href="../../../t/e/s/Test_Stand_VII_47c9.html" title="Test Stand VII">Test Stand VII</a> was built at <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peenem%C3%BCnde.html" title="Peenemünde">Peenemünde</a> for use in the A10's development.</p>
<p>The A10 was designed to have a diameter of 4.12 meters and to exceed the A4 in its size. It was to be fueled with alcohol and liquid oxygen. The thrust of the engines would have been 235,000 kgf (2300 kN) with a 55 second burn time. Two different concepts for the A10's engine were studied. In one, a single very large combustion chamber and exit nozzle were used; in the other, six standard A4 (V-2) engines were to exhaust into a single combustion chamber and their mixed exhaust was to exit through a single nozzle. The A10 was intended to be recoverable for re-use and would have descended into the Atlantic under a large parachute after the upper stage A9 had separated from it. To keep range to its target (New York City or Washington DC) to a minimum, it was intended to be launched from western Spain in its original form.</p>

<p>The A11, along with the A10 and A9, had the potential of launching a <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satellite.html" title="Satellite">satellite</a> payload. However, the conclusion of the war halted further efforts to develop or deploy this weapon.</p>
<p>It had a takeoff weight of 500 <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tonne.html" title="Tonne">metric tons</a>, a thrust of 1,200,000 kgf (11.8 meganewtons (MN)) or thrust <i>(vacuum)</i> 1,400,000 kgf (14 MN), a diameter of 8.10 m, a span of 16.50 m and a length of 25.00 m.</p>
