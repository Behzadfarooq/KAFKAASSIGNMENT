	    <p>This article did <i>not</i> present the classical rabbinic view of the aggadah. Rather, it presented a view which said that all aggadah are secret, hidden teachings. It basically said that every single statement in all of rabbinic literature that isn't a law, actually was a parable containing hidden, deep, secret knowledge. That may be taught by someone, but it isn't the sole classical rabbinic view, and it isn't even the Orthodox view. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 02:05, Mar 20, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Fair comment in general. Two points though:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1) Agreed that it is not true that "every single statement in all of rabbinic literature that isn't a law, actually was a parable containing hidden, deep, secret knowledge". Nevertheless, both Rambam and Ramchal (and not just "someone, somewhere") hold that, in general, the aggada do communicate deeper teachings. Still, I concede that the view as represented previously in this article was somewhat overstated...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2) I think that today, the passage that you quote from Rambam in his introduction to <i>Perek Chelek</i>, describes the (small if not tiny) minority of Orthodox Jews and is thus unrepresentative; please see all references quoted.
<ol>
<li>Feldman (based on the Ramchal and Rambam in the sources) is largely representative of the "Yeshivish" view today;</li>
<li>Feldman's view is definitely the view held by Modern Orthodoxy;</li>
<li>SOME Haredi and Chassidic communities may take references to fantastic creatures somewhat literally, but even there, they are definitely aware of Rambam's view as quoted - and his view as expressed in the commentary on the Mishna (and similar views as expressed by Ramchal and others) - and thus temper their literal interpretation with the Rambam's rationalism...</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thus, I intend to rewrite with partial reversion to the earlier version, but still incorporating all comments made in your revisions.</dd>

<p>That's all fine by me. I have no problems with any of your plans! I wanted to add Maimonides' view - but not exclusively so. By all means I would truly appreciate your adding of the views of Yeshvish rabbis and scholars. I also have been trying to add information aggadah compilations, which can be seen as a complement to the aggadah commentary section. I remember briefly reading part of an English work, "The Mishna Says", which as I remember was an Orthodox version of "The Legends of the Jews". At the time I read it it was presented to me as "The midrash", but only later did I learn that it was an original synthesis of earlier rabbinic aggadot. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 13:28, Mar 20, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>As for the issue of literally interpreting tales of fantastic creatures, a literal belief in this led directly to the story of the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golem.html" title="Golem">Golem</a>. I don't have references on this off-hand, but it might be worth discussing. (Everything about the Golem is worth discussing.) <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></p>
<p><br />
David Stern is a professor in the Dept. of Oriental Studies at the Univ. of Pennsylvania, and is the author of <i>Parables in Midrash</i>, and is co-editor of <i>Rabbinic Fantasies: Narratives from Classical Hebrew Literature</i>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Aggadah is 2000 years old. To quote Stern in the introduction, he must have been Buber or Scholem, not an author of the sickeningly titled "Rabbinic Fantasies". <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 17:43, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I understand (and to some degree agree with) your discomfort at Stern's title. From what I gather Stern loves Jewish literature and aggadah, but he isn't religious, and so speaks in ways that offends religious Jews. (The title is bad, from my point of view, because it sounds more like a <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woody_Allen_6fd3.html" title="Woody Allen">Woody Allen</a> film on rabbis, sex and bacon.) I only briefly thumbed through his book, but it isn't too bad. In any case, maybe we should offer a quote from Rabbi <a href="../../../a/d/i/Adin_Steinsaltz_2674.html" title="Adin Steinsaltz">Adin Steinsaltz</a>'s book on the Talmud? He's a fairly traditional Hasidic Orthodox Jew, loosely affiliated with non-messianic Chabad, yet he also allows for the use of historical comparisons and study in his explication of the Talmud. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 18:26, Mar 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Most of that was tongue-in-cheek. I'm too open-minded to be religiously offended by a book title.</dd>
<dd>However, I think we don't need the Stern quote to give a definition of Aggadata, nor Steinsaltz for that matter. It's also worthwhile quoting M.C. Luzzatto's <i>Maamar al ha-Aggadoth</i> (discourse on the Aggadah). While I cannot claim having studied this text, it's supposed to be a good introduction. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 22:00, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Several of the (admittedly) unattributed quotes - which RK removed - were in fact from the <i>Maamar</i> (see link in article). This is also the source of the (removed) categorisation of TSHB"P as comprising <i>Chelek Hamitzvot</i> and <i>Chelek HaSoddot</i>. The <i>Maamar</i> does not, however, as such, define the aggadah. In fact, I searched long and hard for a non-negative definition...</dd>

<dd>(A)I don't mind using any of those quotes within the article. However, it would be better to use entire sentences rather than the phrases so that the average reader can better understand the context. (B) I have never seen a comprehensive and simple definition of the aggadah, other than "Everything that is not about halakha." Come to think of it, perhaps there is a good reason for this. Why should everything outside of halakha neatly fit into one category? Be that as it may, I have seen positive descriptions of aggadah that list the themes, such as what R. Adin Steinsaltz wrote, or what Prof. Stern wrote. (C) I am adding some new material to this article based on Fintor's comments above. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></dd>

<p>It should be noted very clearly in the article there is no psak for Jewish thought or historical data. See also, Perush HaMishnayos on Shavuos, at the end of Makkot. 203.214.133.79 17:48, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>technically you are right, but I don't see why it '<i>must</i> be made clear. There are many ideas that are almost universally accepted (that there are 613 mitvot, for example) and we needn't mention that someone who says otherwise is still orthodox. In a certain sense you can say that mussur is not binding like halakha, but still it is important and universally accepted. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon513_f8f5.html" title="User:Jon513">Jon513</a> 16:06, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
