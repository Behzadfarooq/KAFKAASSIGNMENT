<p>This article starts out as though it will be general (as in any type of skating that might use a skate park) but then seems to be about inline skating. Perhaps we need an Aggressive inline skating. As well or instead of this? I can see some overlap between aggressive skateboarding and aggressive inlining, but don't think it makes since to make a special article about it. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_Brown_78bc.html" title="User:Tom Brown">Tom Brown</a> 04:59, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

I tend to agree with the comments here. Perhaps this article should remain general, and then branch off to two further articles. One being about inline skating, and the other about skateboarding. Otherwise, remove reference to skateboarding in this article, and rename it to be <b>Aggressive inline skating</b>. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERic_man_5875.html" title="User:Ric man">ric_man</a> 03:52, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Or <b>Aggressive roller skating</b> as there was a strong subculture of quad aggressive skaters in the late 70s-early 80s. They shared skate parks in many places with the skateboarders. There were never as many of them as the later inline aggressive skaters, but they weren't insignificant at the time, either. It would be nice to have a bit of that history included. (Whether I can find enough reference material to write about it is another story -- I have some around here somewhere, so if I can find it, I will). <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManekiNeko_cc64.html" title="User:ManekiNeko">ManekiNeko</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EManekiNeko_2e50.html" title="User talk:ManekiNeko">Talk</a> 23:16, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Follow-up comment: I just dug out an old copy of <i>The Complete Book of Roller Skating</i> from 1979 or so. The section about aggressive skating called it <b>Radical Skating</b>. I had forgotten that was the term used then. It mentions famous radical skaters such as Fred Blood. Lots of great pictures of radical skaters skating pools, etc., but unfortunately they are all copyrighted so we can't use them on Wikipedia. Anyway, when I have time I will try to work up a history paragraph or two that covers this material. Not today, though -- have to work.&#160;:/ -- <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManekiNeko_cc64.html" title="User:ManekiNeko">ManekiNeko</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EManekiNeko_2e50.html" title="User talk:ManekiNeko">Talk</a> 00:32, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I edited much of the "grinds" and "variations" content to make things a little bit simpler. instead of trying to compile a comprehensive list of all possible grinds, i feel it would be simpler and clearer to specify the basic grinds and their possible variations. I still think there should be a seperate section for some of the variations, and there are probably a few "basic" grinds that i didnt think of. Also, there were a few grinds that i didnt include in the list because of their lack of use within the sport... there are virtually limitless combinations of grinds, like sidewalks and cab drivers that i dont think really need to be covered; the line had to be drawn somewhere, or we would end up with three pages of tricks that were simply variations of other, more basic tricks. Instead of a complete list of possible tricks, i thought it would be best to stick to the basics. additionally, much of the info was pretty dated, and i tried to bring things up to date a bit.&lt;/end&gt;</p>
<p><br />
There really seems to be two major definitions of this sport and its culture. The definition held by outsiders who may have seen it for a second on the television 10 years ago, and the definition of those who actually do it. Because its fluctuating popularity most claims, descriptions, or definitions by its participants are discredited as attempts look cool basically. So then the sport's definition is left at the mercy of commercials and pop culture opinion which would rather deny the sports entire existence or poke fun at it with figure skating and/or homosexual references. Thus the creation of the derogatory title, "Fruitbooter."</p>
<p>It becomes increasingly difficult to define because there are so many different forms and uses of inline skates such as roller hockey, recreational skating, fitness skating, speed skating, ski cross training, and then this division that has loosely been referred to as "Aggressive Inline Skating." And because of its vague similarities to other sports such as skateboarding, roller skating, and ice skating people tend to want to mix all of that in as well. In the end the result is one big undefined lump of an activity/culture, when in reality it is far from that. It has been such a small, underground thing that no accurate documentation or publication even exists to back that statement, all I can offer is my word as an individual who has been doing this and following the sport for the past 15 years. The sport and its following does not lack definition in anyway, however, the publics understanding and knowledge of it lacks as much as something can possibly lack. And since there are as I said no accurate documentations on this specific type of skating it becomes basically impossible to create believable documentations on the subject because there is nothing to reference. The closest thing I can reference is a recent documentary titled, "Barely Dead," which for further information you can find at <a href="http://www.misledmedia.com" class="external text" title="http://www.misledmedia.com" rel="nofollow">www.misledmedia.com</a></p>
<p>Skateboarding on the other hand has always been simple to describe because there is only one form or one use of the skateboard and that is to do stunts, tricks, dangerous maneuvers or what ever you want to call it. There is no need to invent a specialized name for it like, "Aggressive Skateboarding" to differentiate it from say fitness, or hockey skateboarding.</p>
<p>Many people try to lump skateboarding and aggressive inline skating into the same group, and though they are similar they are two entirely different sports. The same way there may be or have been individuals who preform tricks on roller skates, it is in no way the same thing as skateboarding or aggressive inline skating. I could go on and on here but I'm not sure if anybody will even read this, so I am just going to end it now.<br />
