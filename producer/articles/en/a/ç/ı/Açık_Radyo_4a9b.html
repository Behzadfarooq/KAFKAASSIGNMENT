<p>Açık Radyo (Open Radio), which went on air on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_13.html" title="November 13">13 November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, is a “regional” radio station, which broadcasts to the metropolitan Istanbul area and its environs. It is founded as a private company as required by the Turkish Law on Radio and TV, but nevertheless functions quite like a non-profit organization. In 2003, the General Assembly of shareholders formally adopted a resolution to that effect.</p>
<p>Açık Radyo is rather a collective, which has 92 partners holding almost equal shares where the shareholders own “share certificates”, which are composed of marked and numbered lithographs of the late distinguished painter and sculptor Abidin Dino. (The inscription on the back says: “This is to certify that the support you have provided for the founding of a free, independent, democratic, dignified, compassionate, and out-of-the-ordinary radio station would hopefully lead to the creation of other similar projects.”) Açık Radyo is not dependent on any interest group or any capital group. It is also completely independent from any kind of “ideology” except the principles of pluralist democracy, the rule of law, and the protection and promotion of universal human rights and fundamental freedoms. Thus, it is an independent body. It can be considered as one of the rare independent institutions in the Turkish media, which is under increasing pressure from the concentration of ownership of financial and power centers.</p>

<p>During its existence of 10 years Açık Radyo has summoned the talents and efforts of 728 individuals from all walks of life and from a rich variety of professions – as well as those of a few unemployed – who contributed with more than 698 talk shows, music shows, etc.) to the general program of the radio station.</p>
<p>Currently, 154 programmers – ranging from age 10 to 75 – are contributing with more than 122 different programs to Açık Radyo each week. Together with the “guest speakers”, it can be said that every week more than 250 persons occupy the tiny studios and the narrow corridors of Açık Radyo, thus contributing to the general “uproar”.</p>
<p>People with various nationalities – American, British, Bulgarian, Canadian, Costa Rican, Dominican, French, German, Greek, Iranian, Lebanese, Spanish, Sudanese, etc., – have been coming from many parts of the world to take part in the Açık Radyo family of programs.</p>
<p>The outstanding common characteristic of the whole bunch of Açık Radyo programmers, producers, DJs, etc., is that they all “work” on a totally voluntary basis. That is to say, they are all volunteers, working without any salary or remuneration whatsoever. This is, as far as we can tell, a unique phenomenon. At Açık Radyo, there is one individual who regularly co-produced a weekly music show for 6.5 years posthumously! (His family’s permission obtained.) And, another individual prenatally contributed for a show called “Baby Scent” (Her permission taken for granted.)</p>

<p>Some Of The Main Issues Covered</p>
<p>Global Climate Change and Global Justice: Açık Radyo, since its inception, has been actively engaged in the struggle against global climate change and global warming. It has continuously tried to amass scientific information and evidence of devastating changes in the atmosphere, oceans, ice cover, land, and biodiversity, and then to disseminate and share this information with the public in general. In short, it has always tried to focus on what it deems to really matter. Besides giving widest possible coverage to this greatest threat ever faced by the biosphere – caused mainly by human behavior, and affecting foremost the poor and the weak – its editors have undertaken the rather painful task of organizing of and taking part in panels, conferences, seminars, TV/radio shows on the issue. Açık Radyo produced two separate live shows powered by solar energy on the subject. Most recently, it has been one of the main organizers of the Istanbul march and meeting, held on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_3.html" title="December 3">3 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, in coordination with the global movement, to protest against global climate change and to support the Kyoto Protocol measures, and the measures to be taken after the Kyoto Protocol expires. The meeting, the first of its kind ever, was held with the active participation of more than a thousand individuals.</p>
<p>War and Peace: When Açık Radyo first went on air the war in Bosnia had entered into its culminating phase, nevertheless, it was still to go on for many months to come.. Açık Radyo, both with its word and music, unhesitatingly took sides – with the underdogs: Throughout the war it produced a daily program called “The Bosnian Diary”, connecting by phone to the ordinary people of Sarajevo. From then on, Açık Radyo continued to focus on cases of international violence. It was certainly one of the first media outlets in the world to perceive the coming threat of the illegal, unethical occupation of Iraq. 17 months before the invasion, Açık Radyo began to warn its listeners on such a possibility and even made a “scoop” on the so-called “Rumsfeld Plan” of 2001, through reading in between the lines of mainstream newspapers. Açık Radyo commentators were among the earliest – globally – to thoroughly expose the lies concerning Saddam’s “weapons of mass destruction”. Long before the invasion, a daily half-hour news program called “The Peace Band” was aired and this went on well after the invasion. Açık Radyo broadcasted “live” – through telephone from London and New York – the huge global mass protests of <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_15.html" title="February 15">15 February</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>. It was also the only radio station in Turkey reporting live the mass protestations in Ankara on the same day when the Turkish Parliament rejected the deployment of US troops on Turkish soil for the invasion of Iraq. On 24-<a href="../../../j/u/n/June_27.html" title="June 27">27 June</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> the historical Final Session of the WTI (World Tribunal on Iraq) and the consequent Verdict of the Jury of Conscience was also broadcast live on Açık Radyo for four consecutive days…</p>
<p>Disaster Preparedness: From day 1 of the great Marmara (epicenter Gölcük) earthquake disaster of 1999 Açık Radyo started to perform as a “clearing house” for the civil society, formed an Earthquake Communication Center (ARDIM), broadcasted 24 hours for 60 consecutive days, and continues to produce to this day a program called “Golden Hours” on earthquake and other disaster preparedness. (Transcripts of the specific individual programs are being posted on the website of the radio station.) In 2000, on the first anniversary of the great 1999 Earthquake disaster, Açık Radyo produced and presented a 2-hour documentary on the event.</p>

<p>The Açık Radyo website was started in the beginning of 1997, at which period there were only around ten million internet users in the world. In the first two years of its existence the web site of Açık Radyo (www.acikradyo.com and www.acikradyo.com.tr) encompassed basic information about the programs and programmers, broadcast schedule and the general structure of the radio station. Also, Açık Radyo has been broadcasting online since May 2000. Açık Site (Open Site): Together with the Açık Radyo web site a second web site became operative towards the end of 2001, when there were an estimated 700 million internet users in the world. Açık Site as would be seen from its own “manifesto” was aiming to be “a tiny flash-light upon the dark side of the world”. Here, transcripts of various interviews and talk shows of Açık Radyo have been regularly posted, plus links from various original and translated articles concerning the state of the world written by eminent thinkers and artists of the world.</p>
<p>Açık Radyo + Açık Site: Starting as of December 2004, the pay subscription system of Açık Site was eliminated, and, the two web sites were combined in one: <a href="http://www.Acikradyo.com" class="external free" title="http://www.Acikradyo.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.Acikradyo.com</a>, <a href="http://www.Acikradyo.com.tr" class="external free" title="http://www.Acikradyo.com.tr" rel="nofollow">http://www.Acikradyo.com.tr</a>. In addition to gaining access to detailed information about Açık Radyo, its programs, its programs and its listeners it is now possible to find a “civil library” comprising more than 12,000 articles, commentaries, special dossiers, research, reports, cartoons, and the like…</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/%C3%A7/%C4%B1/A%C3%A7%C4%B1k_Radyo_4a9b.html" title="Edit section: The &quot;Open Space&quot; Project">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The "Open Space" Project</span></h2>
<p>In the fall of 2005 a group of students from İstanbul Bilgi University carried out a collective graduation project on Açık Radyo. They were asked to design a project that would 1- Expand recognition of AR by youth groups. 2- To attract young people to join the AR family and to pass the flag in the long run. 3- To push more young blood, vision and energy into AR. The students came up with the idea of a creating a youth community within AR through a program contest that will enable young people to express themselves through alternative media. Thus AR had its first program contest for university students; “Change the world, even if it’s for an hour a week”. The winning project was produced into a weekly live show by its creators throughout a full broadcast season. (6 months)</p>
<p>Meanwhile both winners and other participants began to get together on a regular basis and exchange ideas through a mail group. Acquiring the name “Open Space” They decided to let the synergy of the group define the objectives in its own course. The main focus of the group turned out to be the unrelenting issue of “boredom”. Open Space is currently working on a web supported project titled “Something To Do”. Open Space is concurrently organising the program contest 2006, with the title “Invitation to the game”, because it is looking for new play-pals.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/%C3%A7/%C4%B1/A%C3%A7%C4%B1k_Radyo_4a9b.html" title="Edit section: Listeners And Listener-Support Projects">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Listeners And Listener-Support Projects</span></h2>
<p>The opinion poll conducted by AC Nielsen in 2000 regarding Açık Radyo shows that its “core listeners” (those who listen every day) number around 45,000; those who listen every other day: 80,000; once a week: 120,000; the number of listeners who have listened at least once during the last 3 months is around 200,000. According to the polls conducted by the Istanbul Foundation of Culture and Arts (IKSV) in 2001 and 2003 among the music lovers and filmgoers of the International Festivals of Classical Music, Jazz, and the Istanbul International Film Festival, Açık Radyo was chosen the most popular radio station.</p>
<p>At the beginning of March 2004, a project called “Açık Radyo is seeking its listeners” was started. The purpose was to further the effort of the 92 founders and 650 volunteer programs with the contribution of the listeners. The main aim was to attain a level of “sustainable independence”. With the addition of these funds raised from a few thousand individual “listener-sponsors” to the regular income obtained by advertisements and sponsorships, it is hoped to reach a level of permanent financial sustainability.</p>
<p>During a year-long campaign the listeners were asked to sponsor one or more programs. At the end of 2004 the number of listeners who had sponsored their own radio station turned out to be 2,250 – meaning that 2250 individuals had consciously chosen to pay from their pockets for a public service completely free of charge!</p>
<p>It can be argued that this constitutes a very rare case for individual participation in the Turkish media, if not unique. The Second “campaign” of 2005 seems to have produced more or less the same number of individual sponsors. With the yearly perpetuation and augmentation of the support, this may herald the birth of a model of sustainable independence for a media organ in Turkey.</p>

<p>Açık Radyo has produced an 8-part, 4-hour “collage of sound” on its 10th anniversary, gathered from its ten years’ broadcasting. The Station, an alternative medium with its independent standing outside mainstream media, keeps on its determined effort at its 11th year, to share – through its talk shows and music programs – information with a view to transform its listeners into informed citizens, to transform itself into a forum of discussion, and to pave the way to get organized for a better future. It strives, in brief, to show that another world is not only possible but essential as well.</p>
