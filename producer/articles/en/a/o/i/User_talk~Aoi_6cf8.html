<p>hi there, yes i moved it, because apparently the rules say that she is an exception. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_%28names_and_titles%29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_%28names_and_titles%29" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Past Royal Consorts are referred to by their pre-marital name or pre-marital title, not by their consort name, as without an ordinal (which they lack) it is difficult to distinguish various consorts; eg, as there have been many queen consorts called Catherine, use Catherine of Aragon not Queen Catherine. However, there has been one notable exeption. From Wikipedia: "Shortly after King George VI died of lung cancer, on February 6, 1952, Elizabeth began to be styled "Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother." This style was adopted because the normal style for the widow of a King, "Queen Elizabeth," would have been too similar to the style of her elder daughter, now Queen Elizabeth II. The alternative style "The Queen Dowager" could not be used because a senior widowed Queen, Queen Mary, the widow of King George V, was still alive."</li>
</ol>
<p>if you follow the discussions as well, you can gather that naming the article "elisabeth bowes-lyon" whatever is probably not such a wise idea, since nobody knows her under that name... <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntares911_8cd1.html" title="User:Antares911">Antares911</a> 9 July 2005 00:55 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is no justifiable reason why the late Queen Mother is in as <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Elizabeth_the_Queen_Mother_7403.html" title="Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother">Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>It marks a deviation from the normal naming of deceased consorts;</li>
<li>It breaks Wikipedia naming conventions, which require that a royal, if not referred to by maiden name (ie, if they were the reigning monarch or are still alive) be listed by their highest title. <i>Queen Mother</i> was not Elizabeth's highest title. <i>Queen Mother</i> is a lower status than <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_consort.html" title="Queen consort">queen consort</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>So calling Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon QEtheQM breaks just about all the conventions followed not just here but in royal naming generally. The <i>only</i> justification, and it is a slim one, is that she is only recently dead, but even that is dodgy. We have redirects to allow people to link to her by her old title of QEtheQM. If she was only a few months dead then there might be <i>some</i> justification for keeping her <i>initially</i> at her own title. But there is none for keeping her at her old title <i>years</i> after her death. It is amateurish and unencyclopædic, and suggests that she should get special treatment. From every conceivable angle, like other deceased consorts she should be at maiden name or maiden title by now. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i></font></font></a><a href="../../../t/r/i/Image%7ETricolour.gif_7e85.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/e/e6/Tricolour.gif/40px-Tricolour.gif" alt="" width="40" height="23" longdesc="../../../t/r/i/Image%7ETricolour.gif_7e85.html" /></a><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Animated-union-jack-01.gif">Image:Animated-union-jack-01.gif</a> SOLIDARITY WITH THE PEOPLE OF LONDON\<sup><font color="blue"><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(caint)</a> 9 July 2005 02:03 (UTC)</font></sup></p>

I think it should. A handful of users try to sneak in 'new' policies by putting them on the naming conventions page. They hope no-one will notice and sometimes no-one does. Next thing you know, Wikipedia appears to have a policy on something and no-one has a clue where it came from. I think this is a classic example of a sneaked in 'policy'. AFAIK there was no debate on making Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon an exception to the normal rules. It sort of happened, or was done by a minority of users. Whenever I spot a new <i>made up</i> so-called policy appearing from nowhere I revert it until it has been agreed on with a consensus behind it. I think this was one that slipped through the net. It is a classic 'where the hell did that come from?' addition to the page. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i></font></font></a><a href="../../../t/r/i/Image%7ETricolour.gif_7e85.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/e/e6/Tricolour.gif/40px-Tricolour.gif" alt="" width="40" height="23" longdesc="../../../t/r/i/Image%7ETricolour.gif_7e85.html" /></a><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Animated-union-jack-01.gif">Image:Animated-union-jack-01.gif</a> SOLIDARITY WITH THE PEOPLE OF LONDON\<sup><font color="blue"><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(caint)</a> 9 July 2005 04:51 (UTC)</font></sup></p>

It is a <i>very</i> suspicious edit. It looks as though some established user went <i>incognito</i> to doctor the page and slip in their desired changes. In this case they weren't caught doing it.

<p>osu aoi, no problem. in any case, i don´t think opening up this can of worms again would be wise. if you look at other consorts, such as "<a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Alice_d12c.html" title="Princess Alice">Princess Alice</a>" her name has also not been reverted back to the maiden form. i agree though that it is confusing, because there seem to be exceptions everywhere. look at <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marie_Antoinette_cf2c.html" title="Marie Antoinette">Marie Antoinette</a>, who has also not reverted to her maiden name, justifiably i think, because who would know her under that? maybe we need more clearer guidelines when consorts go back to the maiden name, and when they should remain with the name they carried. if you are interested in such a discussion, let me know...</p>
<p>i also see you contributed some articles about Hawaiian royalty. i was thinking about some guidelines about naming that as well. i don´t understand for example, why we have european royalty under their titular names, but someone like <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Victoria_Kaiulani_5657.html" title="Princess Victoria Kaiulani">Princess Victoria Kaiulani</a> is listed as <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Kaiulani_70a4.html" title="Victoria Kaiulani">Victoria Kaiulani</a>? because the kingdom of Hawaii does not exist anymore? i don´t know about this... <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntares911_8cd1.html" title="User:Antares911">Antares911</a> 9 July 2005 11:35 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are a tiny number of exceptions, principally Marie Antoinette, simply because she is remembered not as a consort but as an executed queen. If the revolution had not occurred and she had not died the way she did, she would just be another consort and would be treated like all other consorts (ie, reverted to maiden name). As to Princess Alice, she is less than a year dead. It is reasonable to leave her at her death name for a short time after her death (often that is done as a mark of respect for a deceased person - most cultures treat the first year as an informal mourning period usually symbolically ended with a religious ceremony and which people 'move on') but certainly after a year she will be reverted to maiden name as is normal. It probably would make sense to go though consort articles to make sure they all follow the standard academic and royal style of maiden name/maiden title. The odd article has slipped through with the wrong name. Also a small minority of people keep changing opening paragraphs to use consort title first, where it should be maiden name first, and <i>who was the . . .</i> link in the paragraph to consort name. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i></font></font></a><a href="../../../t/r/i/Image%7ETricolour.gif_7e85.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/e/e6/Tricolour.gif/40px-Tricolour.gif" alt="" width="40" height="23" longdesc="../../../t/r/i/Image%7ETricolour.gif_7e85.html" /></a><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Animated-union-jack-01.gif">Image:Animated-union-jack-01.gif</a> SOLIDARITY WITH THE PEOPLE OF LONDON\<sup><font color="blue"><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(caint)</a> 9 July 2005 18:05 (UTC)</font></sup></dd>

<p>Re Alice, her objective treatment (also now when she is dead) is a wife of a peer. It is different than wife of monarch. She could be under <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice%2C_Duchess_of_Gloucester_ea47.html" title="Alice, Duchess of Gloucester">Alice, Duchess of Gloucester</a> into eternity, and does not need revert to maiden name. <a href="../../../2/1/7/User%7E217.140.193.123.html" title="User:217.140.193.123">217.140.193.123</a> 09:43, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Conventions generally treat royal wives like royal consorts, not least because many royal wives were part of other royal houses and so reverting allowed such details to be seen clearly.</p>
<p>Re the added bit to naming conventions, and the location of the Queen Mother page: both have now been changed back to the way they should have been. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i></font></font></a><a href="../../../t/r/i/Image%7ETricolour.gif_7e85.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/e/e6/Tricolour.gif/40px-Tricolour.gif" alt="" width="40" height="23" longdesc="../../../t/r/i/Image%7ETricolour.gif_7e85.html" /></a><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Animated-union-jack-01.gif">Image:Animated-union-jack-01.gif</a> SOLIDARITY WITH THE PEOPLE OF LONDON\<sup><font color="blue"><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(caint)</a> 16:52, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</font></sup></p>

<p>hi aoi, ahm I will see what else was moved via copy+paste, but I think that was the only case as far as I can remember. apart from that I´m rather busy at the moment and please remember that I have another life outside Wikipedia and the cyber-community as well. If something comes up, I will let you know. I don´t understand the latter part of your comment, "Plus, your copy and paste moves MUST be fixed and merged." (ps: please don´t leave me messages in CAPITAL letters or <b>bold</b> in future, I shall refrain from doing so as well) What does that mean, I mean from a technical point? What exactly needs to be fixed and merged and how is it done correctly? I don´t understand the procedure, maybe you would be so kind to elaborate...? thanks. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntares911_8cd1.html" title="User:Antares911">Antares911</a> 16:16, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Aoi. Thanks for your help with the emperors. It might be better if you let me fix the double redirects though. I'm doing them in a consistent style and putting the proper diacritics in the articles, etc. Thanks! -<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefu_84bf.html" title="User:Jefu">Jefu</a> 05:38, August 23, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for your message. I hate double redirects as much as you do and I've been working fast and furious to get these articles right. We have now moved the first 49 emperors and fixed all double redirects. Not bad for a days work.

<p>Quoting what you wrote earliar. "Also, I'm tagging this page for clean-up, as it reads horribly, is full of distracting fragments, and some rather useless information. I notice ManoaChild and others have done some work trying to improve the page. I'll try to contribute, too, unfortunately I'm too sick at the moment to do anything useful."</p>
<p>Believe me I'd like to fix this page, however so far the Admin on Wikipedia have been real pains, and well the page got butchered and then some by everybody's edits. I invite you to do something on this page, because I am not going to risk banning from some overzealous admin who imposed some weirdo changing standards with no basis in Wikipedia policy about no religion as vandalism.</p>
<p>As for the useless information.. I'd like to hear from you what you think is more useful? What kind of facts do you think should be in there?

   * Suppose page title A redirects to B which in turn redirects to C.
   * Follow a link to A. You will see a page containing: (a) the page title B; (b) a large link to C; (c) a very small notice in the corner saying "redirected from A".
   * Click the "A" in "redirected from A".
   * You will see a page containing: (a) the page title A; (b) a large link to B.
   * Click "Edit this page" and change B to C.

<dd>A is the double redirect itself (since it mentions a large link, etc.), so it says to do it like I said. But Werdnabot uses the Wikipedia servers just like you do — he's just a lot faster than you are. <b><a href="../../../f/e/t/User%7EFetofs_45e3.html" title="User:Fetofs"><font color="blue">fetofs</font></a></b> <sup><a href="../../../f/e/t/User_talk%7EFetofs_75a9.html" title="User talk:Fetofs"><font color="maroon">Hello!</font></a></sup> 19:32, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
