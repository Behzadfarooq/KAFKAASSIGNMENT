<p>It's not entirely made-up, or at least not made up by us. Various pundits in the US media are getting worked up about the idea that not everyone says "Merry Christmas." Other pundits are getting worked up about the first set of pundits. So, it's probably not speediable, but I hope it gets folded into a larger (more interesting) article.

<p>I'm not really making that many...4? And anyway it's not supur of the moment stuff. I was thinking for the last week of a few templates I'd like to create for my babel, and I don't see why others shouldn't have the right to use them easily. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChooserr_aa51.html" title="User:Chooserr">Chooserr</a></p>

</ul>
<p>I haven't been thrice blocked...twice. And since the second I've stopped reverting over 2 times. As a far as disrupting the article...I believe it's not. I believe when they were originally changed they disrupted the article. And to anyone viewing it for the first time it wouldn't matter which version was "current". I'm not erasing information...quite the opposite in fact.

<p>Can you please lay off of Chooserr a bit? There are probably several admins keeping an eye on him now—I am, at least. Our goal is to help him become a productive editor instead of a POV warrior, <i>not</i> to drum him off the site. Incidentally, an article about a notable subject, even if it was created for the wrong reasons and is full of POV, isn't suitable for either speedy or regular deletion—instead, you should fix it, or put a tag like {{<a href="../../../n/p/o/Template%7ENPOV_75c8.html" title="Template:NPOV">NPOV</a>}} on it to request it be fixed. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 03:02, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Assume good faith?? Why?? He's been blocked three times already, each time he <i>forgets</i> to log in, and keeps editing from 3 or 4 ip addresses, then <i>accidently</i> creates two or three new user names, after these are all blocked, he confesses, proclaims that he had no way of knowing it was against policy, then does it again the next time he's blocked--Aolanonawanabe 03:52, 9 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>He's been blocked twice—the first time the block was suspended for most of a day and then reinstated for something that, were it not part of his parole, wouldn't have been a violation at all. He has done some screwy things, I admit—but if he really is the troll you say, your frivelous accustions are only hurting your case. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 03:59, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No problem. You were correct, also, that many of his pages lack content to allow one to derive notability from them. He's said he'll fix that, and I hope he will. I don't want to get in a war here, and I guess he does have some prior history, let's just go slow and let him develop them more.... anyways, good luck on finals!

<p>Hi. I've been helping clean up the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_on_Christmas_1f94.html" title="War on Christmas">War on Christmas</a> article (which still needs a lot of work), and I'd just like to ask if you could please refrain from using the revert function when there have been multiple edits, by multiple users. I know that you were just trying to remove Chooserr's commercial link, but it's considered polite not to just steamroll other, unrelated edits, in the process. It's pretty easy to remove a link manually.
