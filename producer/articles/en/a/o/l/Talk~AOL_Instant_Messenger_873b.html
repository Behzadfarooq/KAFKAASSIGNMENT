<p>I think it would be wise for someone to mention some of the negative aspects of AIM, for example its adware/spyware that is bundled with all modern versions. I stopped using AIM a few years ago. Ditched it for GAIM (and sometimes Kopete). Can someone who knows what is in it please post some stuff about it? I am aware of the one line "aim is an ad supported im program"; but I don't think that is enough. Many people will read that and never think about it. I believe it is especially important since it is listed on <a href="../../../s/p/y/Spyware.html" title="Spyware">Spyware</a> as a known program that is bundled with spyware. --<a href="../../../e/l/y/User%7EElysianfields_8b58.html" title="User:Elysianfields">Elysianfields</a> 21:49, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think it might be of note that most of the chat rooms AIM uses are only fraction of what they used to be. Most official channels are filled with bots the simply spam the channel with advertisements and user-created channels (such as the formerly popular anime channel) are either filled with bots that either fill up the room (to the 36 user limit, leaving it off limits to _most_ people) and/or ban people on sight or simply flooded to be unintelligable. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheSock_e6bb.html" title="User:TheSock">TheSock</a> 22:18, 2005 Jun 21 (UTC)</p>

<p>AIM is hardly <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gratis.html" title="Gratis">gratis</a>, as it is supported by advertising. For example, here's the ad-space at the top of the AIM 5.5 client:</p>

<p>The article has "AIM has 195 million users (January 2003)", but this number seems unrealistically high.</p>
<p>On 3 May 2004, I got a response from AOL giving the following stats:</p>
<pre>
   AIM: 35 million monthly
   ICQ: 22 million monthly (8 million daily)
   AOL-IM: 13 million monthly
</pre>
<p>Did the number of users really fall by 160 million users within only one year, or was the original number simply way off the mark to begin with?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>I believe it's likely that "195 million" was the number of 'registered' users(a.k.a. screennames), while the stats AIM gave you are the number of screennames regularly signing on to the service. --<a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElfWord_a3da.html" title="User:ElfWord">ElfWord</a> 16:47, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>That's probably right. In which case, that "195 million" may as well include people who don't even sign in anymore. If you use anything else which required an AOL screenname, you'd end up in that count. Maybe the article should be changed to list the number of monthly users instead, as that's supposedly the standard statistic for IM usage.</p>
<hr />
<p>195 million could also be the amount of downloads, since they've had nearly a 100 versions in the past decade. The most recent statistic (and most realistic) is "more than 40 million"; but that includes ICQ which is now merged (or at least compatible) with the OSCAR protocol. This was ran by Reuters and was a little fact thrown on the bottom of the google IM program article. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/internet/08/23/google.messaging.reut/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/internet/08/23/google.messaging.reut/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> -<a href="../../../e/l/y/User%7EElysianfields_8b58.html" title="User:Elysianfields">Elysianfields</a> 17:11, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Like the two links two days ago to a single brand new site, or the four today all by "Binary Inertia"? I agree. I'll see about a proposed list of removals to bring links down to established AIM community resources. Cronus 21:42, 24 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The "See Also" section should probably stay, external links are the spam problem. Description tags for this section might also help.</li>
<li>The official site is obviously fine, and the Online Versions all look quite active and substantial.</li>
<li>Most "add-ons" are already listed in "See Also". Messenger:Mate should probably be moved up there, leaving AIMFix which is valuable and "IMOff" which is brand new and not so substantial yet (though hopefully will be in the future). I propose getting rid of the add-ons section, leaving AIMFix as a standalone link with a note about virus removal.</li>
<li>Third-Party clients all work, with only Jabber being out of place. Some are more active than others, but trying to cull that list would probably start a war</li>
<li>Utility AIM Bots was originally created with three services, only one has survived. DoorManBot should probably have an entry created and be moved to See Also, getting rid of this category</li>
<li>AIM Bot Creation all seem active except Ultra Hal, which seems to have been made part of a larger bundle with little to do with AIM. I'll probably remove this one unless somebody has more information</li>
<li>Profile Tools and Extensions is mostly spam. Buddy4u, Buddy Profile, and Subprofile seem to be the only three with substantial use. I couldn't look to much at Subprofile, but it was once THE profile service</li>
<li>Other is also mostly spam (though not quite "OtherOther" quality). AimFight is already in "See Also". What is left is mostly Icons, Away Messages, and other resources. Iconator seems to be far and away the most popular of the icon sites. None of the away message sites seem particularly substantial (to be fair, I'm not sure who would really want pre-made messages). AIMForum seems questionable, but there are no other forums, so it should probably stay. AIMFilez has not been updated for quite some time (years?) but was once THE AIM file resource, so it should also probably stay. The AIM URLs link is fairly informative and useful, written by the AIM client architect, so I'd also leave that.</li>
<li>Away Message sites are very popular, and merit being part of the Wiki on AIM. Just because you don't use them doesn't mean 8000 people a day don't. <a href="http://www.AIMAwayMessages.com" class="external text" title="http://www.AIMAwayMessages.com" rel="nofollow">AIM Away Messages</a> is the premier Away Message site.</li>
<li>Iconator might have the highest Alexa ranking, but <a href="http://www.originalicons.com" class="external text" title="http://www.originalicons.com" rel="nofollow">Original Icons</a> is the highest quality icon site with the most icons that are made by the webmaster and not copied.</li>
</ul>

<dd>By taking out the spam and moving a couple items into See Also (with brief descriptions) I think this will clean up nicely. Please leave comments. If there are no changes, I'll implement after 4-5 days. --Cronus 23:14, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I waited 10 days due to slight hosage, but it is done, with two changes from my proposal. I created "Useful Tools" for AIMFix (which needed a home) and DoorManBot (which I was going to create a separate entry for). Really, these two should probably have their own articles, but for now this heading will have to do. I also removed the Third-Party clients which were being duplicated from See Also. AIMutation needed a POV edit and the actual source/installer link added to its article. Things look a bit cleaner now, I can see all External Links on one page in my broswer. I guess this isn't the time to point out that neither the client I use nor another that many people I know use are linked to :-P</dd>

<p>I would suggest listing the last version of "real AIM" (the last 5.9 version, forget the number becuase I cant stand using it) in addition to the newest "Triton" version. The Triton versions are completely different, and many people I have spoken with refuse to use it and intead use either 5.9 (despite its overly0large im boxes) or 5.5 (for sn linking) or the amazing 5.2.3292 (compromise between intrsive program and using the AIM chat service) version.</p>
<p>5.9 made everything huge and added too much clutter, but it allows imming while away 5.5 allows SN linking, but it also has some clutter 5.2 is pretty much as streamlined as AIM official clients get, but it lacks SN linking and talking while away...</p>
<p>again, while my semi-non-NPOV comments here should most definately not be put into the article, i feel something should also be listed as an offical current alternative to Triton, because Triton is just too intrusive and horrible for most people to tolerate</p>

<p>I recently installed the new version of AIM onto my laptop. I don't even know how to switch between fonts with Triton. There are 8 fricking fonts to choose from... and I haven't found a way to switch to the countless other fonts supported by earlier versions. I'm with the people you said you talked to earlier... I am too going to switch to my old trusty version soon. <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirdValiant_9e3d.html" title="User:BirdValiant">BirdValiant</a> 02:15, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just tried Triton just today. It really really sucked. I mean, honestly, if AOL expects to release a new line of AIM clients, they should at least keep the old features of the original AIM, like being able to upload a buddy icon from your PC or being able to display the Away message without auto-responding with it.Viltris 02:56, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

I only tried Triton briefly, but it was awful. It lacked <b>many</b> features that I used quite regularly, and it had the worst performance of any program I've ever used, bar none. With only a browser and AIM Triton open, and 512 MB of RAM, I was seeing 15-30 second delays when attempting to switch between programs. Completely and utterly unacceptable. The 5.5whatever version is currently my favorite - 5.9 doesn't work with DeadAIM, my preferred add-on, and I like SN linking.</dd>

<p>What is the difference between Triton and Triton Beta? Which one is more advanced? I know Triton is in 1.04 (which is what I have), but Triton Beta is in 1.2-soemthing.

<p>Well, knowing AOL, Triton Beta 1.2 is the newer one. Actually, I think Triton and Triton Beta are the same product line, just that Triton 1.2 is still in beta and Triton 1.0.4 is the stable version.Viltris 22:32, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The BETA version has features like: you can actually download another expression from another site or from your computer, other than the selection Triton gives you. And if you rest your mouse on a screename in your buddylist it will show their online time, their icon, their away message (if up)....and other stuff, but I forget what.

<p>More information about how AIM stacks up against other clients would be nice. After all, AIM is one of the most popular clients, but it lacks a -lot- of features other clients have had. Heck, ICQ had off-line messaging years ago. (I'm not sure if this didn't post the first time or if someone deleted it... I don't know why someone would just delete it from the talk page, though...)
