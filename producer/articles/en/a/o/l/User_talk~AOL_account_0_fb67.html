<li>That's borderline irrational, it's impossible for any AOL user to actually receive any message sent to their talk page. When they get a <b>new message</b> they're sent around from one talk to the next, the best way to look at an AOL talk page is as 'community property'. Having several years worth of vandalism warnings sitting in front of them, is little more than a deterrent to productive editors, and a <b>how to</b> guide for vandals--<a href="../../../a/o/l/User%7EAOL_account_5190.html" title="User:AOL account">AOL account (205.188.116.200)</a> 19:57, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Oh.

<li>Well, I'm still standing by the first two I listed, as they added identical information to the Mystic Force articles and sections on episodes.

<dd>Ehm. The first edit was, again, vandalism <i>removal</i>. The second diff does indeed seem to be WatchtowerJihad vandalism, but you'll notice Xanax is my FRIEND was not involved. (I'm not even sure if the "reverting vandalism to vandalism" trick was deliberate; the other vandal may just have slipped an edit in while "Ward Cleaver" was reverting you. It's a common race condition with reverts, both good <i>and</i> bad faith ones.) I haven't seen any actual vandalism from Xanax is my FRIEND; let's just assume good faith until and unless there's actual evidence, please. —<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> <small>(<a href="../../../i/l/m/User_talk%7EIlmari_Karonen_f3b7.html" title="User talk:Ilmari Karonen">talk</a>)</small> 19:22, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In that case, since Xanax is my FRIEND <i>isn't</i> a vandal, you wouldn't mind sprotecting my user and talk pages to stop the near constant <i>not</i> vandalism to them--<a href="../../../a/o/l/User%7EAOL_account_5190.html" title="User:AOL account">AOL account</a> 14:18, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Done. I see Syrthiss already sprotected your user page. You should probably add some kind of notice, such as {{<a href="../../../s/p/r/Template%7ESprotected_2018.html" title="Template:Sprotected">sprotected</a>}}, to this page; I haven't. You may also want to copy the trick I've used on my own talk page for allowing new/anon users to edit a part of my talk page despite the semiprotection, especially if you're serious about acting as a "good will ambassador between AOL and Wikipedia".

<dd>Ps. I wonder why you seem to think Xanax is my FRIEND is involved; surely it's more reasonable to assume that the reason you've been targeted is because you reverted vandalism by <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWard_Cleaver_e79c.html" title="User:Ward Cleaver">Ward Cleaver</a>, who <i>is</i> an obvious sock of our dear friend WatchtowerJihad. From what I've seen of Xanax's edits — not that there have been many — he still hasn't shown any vandalous tendencies. His latest edit, though unsourced, was otherwise perfectly reasonable. Of course, it's true there <i>are</i> vandals that sneaky, but this just doesn't smell like WatchtowerJihad to me; he's sneaky in his own ways, but doesn't seem to have this kind of patience. —<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> <small>(<a href="../../../i/l/m/User_talk%7EIlmari_Karonen_f3b7.html" title="User talk:Ilmari Karonen">talk</a>)</small> 17:00, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>That was weird. I don't think I've ever had a warning for vandalism before, warranted or not... and what you call "only a few recent edits" is what I call "Wikipedia is taking over my life again and I'm not getting any work done", but whatever! You've made me go and restore my user page, anyway. --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">woggly</a> 17:10, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, first of all, allow me to, once again, explain how the system works here on Wikipedia. You are entitled to remove warnings from AOL talk pages (technically, policy states you are to <b>archive</b> warnings, but since it is AOL we are talking about here, we all have been very lenient about it and have not really questioned your actions to a large extent), just as much as I am entitled to restore them. As you have said, it would make no difference how many warnings are on the talk page of AOL users, or how old or new they may be. AOL users will always be warned, due to automated vandal fighting tools, among other things, so you ought to understand that is not going to change. Therefore, I am going to ask you to refrain from you preforming such activites as policing AOL talk pages, and refrain from edit warring with administrators on the AOL template, as this will warrant a block. You may wish to review <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>. Now, with that being said, your work, though admittedly odd, is viewed helpful to some people, with me, of course, being the exception. In my personal opinion, if AOL was a good internet service provider, they would have addressed this issue a long time ago. I would suggest you change your activites from the aforementioned to contacting AOL's customer service department if you wish to see changes around here. Otherwise, your actions are wasted. By thw way, Wikipedia has been around only since 2003 or so I believe, so no warnings are years old&#160;:) --<a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilotguy_59e8.html" title="User:Pilotguy"><font color="#000000"><b>Pilotguy</b></font></a> <sup><b>(</b><a href="../../../p/i/l/User_talk%7EPilotguy_51fb.html" title="User talk:Pilotguy"><font color="#0000FF"><b><i>roger that</i></b></font></a><b>)</b></sup> 23:59, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>most of the warnings you are restoring <b>are</b> that old&#160;:) and inserting false information into a template, while helpful for some people, who they are I'm not sure, the vandals I guess, is rather pointless, although it probably helps justify a lot of range blocks&#160;:)--<a href="../../../a/o/l/User%7EAOL_account_5190.html" title="User:AOL account">AOL account</a> 00:03, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'd just like to note that you accidentally removed warnings that were placed within the last 48 hours from some talk pages. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 00:24, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>It wasn't an accident, AOL hasn't used XTP headers at any time since 2004, they're no more or less random to AOL users than older warnings, if you want to restore the more recent warnings, as you have been doing, I have no objections--<a href="../../../a/o/l/User%7EAOL_account_5190.html" title="User:AOL account">AOL account</a> 00:26, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>I have just delinked and deleted the {{AOL-static}} template, since no such thing exists: the user pages labelled with this were either AOL dynamically assigned IP addresses ("DAHA" in AOL terminology) from the ipt.aol.com pool, or corresponded to nonexistent IP addresses, such as in the case of User talk:172.324.195.106. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 23:16, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
