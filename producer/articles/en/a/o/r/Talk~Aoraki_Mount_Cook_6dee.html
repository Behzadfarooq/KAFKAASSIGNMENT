<p>I haven't done so yet, but I think that it should be considered that this page is move/renamed to reflect the moutain's actual name: Aoraki/Mount Cook. I'm interested to see what other people's perceptions are of this. It's certainly been a change by stealth, but I note now that all the highway signage, even near Christchurch now reads Aoraki/Mount Cook, and that the village is also now calling itself Aoraki/Mount Cook Village.</p>
<p>Also, the page on Mount Taranaki is under that name rather than Egmont...</p>

<dl>
<dd>Please no - we prefer to reflect reality, not some bureaucratic gobbledygook. It works perfectly well to have Aoraki be a redir to the name most commonly seen in English over the entire world (not just NZ). Redirs aren't feasible on street signs, thus the dual nomenclature, but we're not limited in that way. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 06:06, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do see your point, however "reality" is not a static thing. It's not the first mountain in NZ to have undergone a name change, and some of theser were initially resented, and may have been labelled by some as "bureaucratic gobbledygook". I note that the page has been re-directed and then reverted before a year or so back. However, I'd guess it'll definitely be ready for a change in 10 years, even if it is policy to be trend-following. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimegreen_7840.html" title="User:Limegreen">Limegreen</a> 11:48, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the mountain was only known to locals, there would be a stronger case, but Mt Cook is very well-known outside New Zealand. Also, why would an official name change be by stealth? If it's official, you want to publicize widely so travel agencies can change their brochures, newspapers can issue new instructions to proofreaders, etc. Perhaps you could elucidate further? Are they saying the name is "Aoraki" or "Aoraki/Mount Cook"? Governments often use a "/" on road signs as a transitional form so people don't get lost, that doesn't tell you which is the "official" name. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 16:39, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you re-read my original post, I didn't say it was an official name change by stealth... I referred to the changing of the name happening by stealth. The mountain's name has been officially changed for around 7 years now. The first couple of years nothing much happened, and indeed, I don't think some people were too happy about it. However, at this point I've started to notice more changes, and not just to road signs. Commercial websites, running tourist operations in the area, are starting to adopt the change. And the name is "Aoraki/Mt Cook". Had it not be named after Cook, I'd imagine the english monkiker, to paraphrase the Inspector General of Intelligence, would have been outski. Perhaps as a comprimise, the point at which half of the top ten results for "mount cook" in google come back with Aoraki/Mt Cook, it'll be time. It's currently sitting at around 2-3/10. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimegreen_7840.html" title="User:Limegreen">Limegreen</a> 23:28, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The official name is Aoraki/Mount Cook, and I think that's a better arbiter than google. We can always redirect from Mt Cook for international readers with guide books older than 1997. All the newer ones have the correct name, however. I'm going to request a move. --<a href="../../../t/i/r/User%7ETirana_4bab.html" title="User:Tirana">Tirana</a> 22:54, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How do you define what's common?

<dd>I support the move because I think that if a name appears in national newspapers and on television, that makes it a fairly common name. And whether or not you think it is in common use probably depends on the people you happen to know.

<dd>Using Brian's reasoning, we would not be discussing this because the original name Aoraki would still be the common usage, in that no name anywhere in the world could have been changed in the past or could be changed now or forever. Those recent explosions would have happened in Bombay, not <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>. Should Wikipedia change its article names for <a href="../../../c/%C3%B4/t/C%C3%B4te_d%27Ivoire_ed5b.html" title="Côte d'Ivoire">Côte d'Ivoire</a>, or <a href="../../../m/y/a/Myanmar.html" title="Myanmar">Myanmar</a> or <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yangon.html" title="Yangon">Yangon</a>? Names can only become common usage after they have been in use for a while. If the government of any country decides there is good reason to change a geographic name, who the hell are we to tell them they are wrong?

<dd>It went right over your head Brian, didn't it. It can't become <i>"commonly known 'worldwide' and ‘nationwide’ "</i> if the article name isn't changed.

<dd>I support the move to <a href="../../../a/o/r/Aoraki_Mount_Cook_8090.html" title="Aoraki/Mount Cook">Aoraki/Mount Cook</a>. The redirect's history is completely trivial. Moriori created that page by moving the contents of <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Cook_02c6.html" title="Mount Cook">Mount Cook</a> to it. One editor added an interwiki link, but also changed quotes to smart quotes, and another editor then fixed the quotes. The <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Cook_02c6.html" title="Mount Cook">Mount Cook</a> article was then reverted to a version before the move and the A/MC article redirected to it. I think we can delete the current A/MC redirect without worrying about compliance with requirements of the GFDL to preserve article history.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User_talk%7EGadfium_49fb.html" title="User talk:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 02:05, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>So, is that a consensus? I tried moving the article myself but it wouldn't let me seeing as there's already an article at A/MC. Would blanking A/MC fix that, or does someone with special admin powers need to delete the old A/MC before pasting the new one on top?

<p>An anon changed the very long-standing claim in this article that <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmund_Hillary_e493.html" title="Edmund Hillary">Edmund Hillary</a> made the first traverse of all three peaks. They appear to be right; see <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/134" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/134" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> under "Routes overview".-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadfium_9104.html" title="User:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 22:53, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>There are numerous written references, beginning with Freda Du Faur's biography, Hugh Logan's Classic Peaks, John Pascoe's Great Days in New Zealand Mountaineering ....</p>

<p>Why?? This article's been obviously getting plenty of attention, that it has gotten so large without any references or citations makes the mind boggle.. verifiability is important, no good wikipedia article is without references or citations <a href="../../../k/o/t/User%7EKotare_47ed.html" title="User:Kotare">Kotare</a> 07:51, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
