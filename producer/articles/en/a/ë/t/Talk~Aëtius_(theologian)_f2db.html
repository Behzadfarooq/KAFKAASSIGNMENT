<p>The POV tag recently added says "see the discussion on the talk page". But there is no such discussion. What exactly seems to be the POV problem? His surname "the Atheist" was tagged as POV; obviously that name was attached to him by his enemies -- the article is not claiming that he <i>was</i> an atheist. Similarly, the POV tag after "the first to introduce the doctrine that the Father and the Only Begotten Son do not share the same divine substance." is unclear. Is it questioning that he is the first? (not really a POV issue) That he held this doctrine? (that's what our sources say) That that doctrine is true? (not for us to decide). Please clarify. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 14:48, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry. Message must have gotten lost. Quick run down: Wikipedia articles should describe his life and views, not assess their orthodoxy.</p>
<ol>
<li><i>surnamed "The Athiest"</i> it is a misleading nickname given undue weight.</li>
<li><i>by his Orthodox enemies</i> states that their views were orthodox (i.e. true). <i>Nicaean enemies</i>, <i>Nicene enemies</i>, or <i>Trinitarian enemies</i> would avoid this problem.</li>
<li><i>extreme sect</i></li>
<li><i>of Arians</i> conflates Aetius' heteroousionist position with Arius' heteroousionist position. IMHO this is as misleading as describing the Mennonites or Calvinists as Lutherans. (because they happen to share certain positions).</li>
<li>I think the paragraph about Epiphanus is somewhat POV but not as problematic</li>
<li><i>dangerous heretical party</i></li>
<li><i>first to introduce the doctrine</i> this is one of the points where Aetius parallels Arius. The Athanasian party regarded both as innovators, but Arius was clearly the earlier one. The Aetian party, e.g. Eunomius and Philostorgius, regard Aetius as the defender of the original faith, Athanasius et al. as innovators, and seemingly Arius as an innovator on certain other matters (it's not always possible to tell when Philostorgius is criticizing Arius or when Photius is).</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope this helps.Jacob Haller 15:26, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for the clarification. I basically agree with all your points; but since there was no discussion in Talk, I didn't know it....</p>
<ol>
<li>The nickname "the Atheist" is certainly misleading, but it is also rather well-known. It is in the opening section of the article to make it easy for the reader to know who is being talked about. Does the phrase I added "by his enemies" help?</li>
<li>Saying "orthodox" (not, by the way, "Orthodox") to describe the Trinitarians is of course history as written by the victors, and I agree that "Nicene" or "Trinitarian" or whatever would be better; please go ahead and change it.</li>
<li>"extreme sect" -- I am not competent to judge this claim. The few things I've read seem to agree that his positions were the most divergent from what became the orthodox view; perhaps you can find some wording that says that explicitly?</li>
<li>as for differences betweeen Aetius and Arius, I'm not sure that's POV or simply in need of correction and amplification</li>
<li>"dangerous heretical party" is certainly over the top.</li>
</ol>
<p>I was afraid you were hit-and-run tagging things as POV, but obviously that's not the case. Perhaps you could quickly run through the article and clean up the most flagrant problems? --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 16:01, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>In the EB11 text, it sounds as though it is <i>Basil'</i>s position that the <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anomoean.html" title="Anomoean">Anomoeans</a> are "the most dangerous heretical party". Can we check that and if it is correct restore it, clarifying that it is not our editorial position, but Basil's? --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 17:15, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I can't find any such reference in <i>Against Eunomius</i>. Also, IIRC, Basil and Philostorgius present different versions of Aetius' origins.Jacob Haller 18:00, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
