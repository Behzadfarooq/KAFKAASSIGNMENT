	    <p>Anupam Satyasheel is an accomplished finance professional and a social entrepreneur. He has served in various roles for world class organizations in the field of corporate finance, and corporate and investment banking. He holds an undergraduate degree in Commerce from Delhi University’s Shriram College of Commerce (SRCC) and an MBA from New York University’s Leonard N. Stern School of Business.</p>
<p>Anupam was born in a family of meager financial resources in Jamshedpur in India. He did not get any primary education due to adverse situations. However, at the age of 13 he got an opportunity to attend school and made the most of this opportunity by performing brilliantly in high school. His all round accomplishments helped him become the President of his school and his academic accomplishments got a mention in newspapers.</p>
<p>At the age of 18, he moved to India’s capital Delhi to pursue an undergraduate degree in Economics and Accounting at Delhi University’s reputed college, SRCC. While he pursued his education, he also engaged himself in a sales job and coaching children from under-privileged back ground. Seeking inspiration from his own background he took initiatives to provide educational opportunities to young children. Simultaneously, he excelled at extra-curricular activities, in the process being elected the General Secretary of the Student Union at his college.</p>
<p>In 1995 Anupam started a career in Corporate Finance and Accounting at Siemens Limited in Delhi. During his stay of two and a half year at Siemens he was recognized as a special talent and got rapidly promoted through the hierarchy. However, in 1998 he left Siemens and joined an IT start up NetAcross Limited. In less than two years of his stay at NetAcross, Anupam played a key role in bringing structure and process orientation to the Accounting function. In 2000, faced by the choice of starting a Masters Degree in Business Management from Delhi University’s Faculty of Management Studies, and pursuing a managerial responsibility at a mid size IT corporation in New Jersey, USA, Anupam preferred the overseas opportunity. At Iris Software, Anupam made significant contributions by his strategic cost cutting initiatives and bottom line driven recommendations.</p>
<p>After a four year long successful tenure at Iris, Anupam quit work life to pursue an academic life. At New York University’s Stern School of Business, he specialized in Finance, and Economics and spent the summer of 2005 at Scotia Capital (the corporate and investment banking arm of Scotia Bank). Anupam spent a semester at London Business School (LBS) in 2006. During his stay at NYU Stern and LBS, Anupam was actively involved in various clubs and extra-curricular activities.</p>
<p>Before Anupam went to graduate school he founded a National Society called Anusheelan Vaichariki Jan Madhyam (AVJM) in India to help provide educational opportunities to street children and teenagers from under-privileged backgrounds. In 2005 he co-founded Child Literacy as a not-for-profit in New Jersey to promote and propagate the cause of universal education. After completing his MBA, Anupam traveled extensively across Europe, India and USA. He used this opportunity to promote the mission of Child Literacy and AVJM.</p>
<p>Currently Anupam pursues the twin careers of Corporate and Investment Banking at Scotia Capital, and social enterprise and charity through AVJM and Child Literacy. He lives and works in New York and is actively involved with charity and social entrepreneurial ventures.</p>
