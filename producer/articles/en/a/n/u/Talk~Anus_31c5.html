<p>Removing obvious porn image of female booty with shaved labia and simulated sweat. This is not suitable in a medically-oriented article. Also, I want to re-iterate that there is no difference between a male anus and a female anus, all we really need here is an image of a moderately hairy anus labeled "human anus." <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hokkaido_Crow_7bd1.html" title="User:The Hokkaido Crow">The Crow</a> 22:14, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>WRT that female image - how would the contributors here feel if I was to crop it down to the anus alone and use it to replace the current pic? Porn-sourced or not, it is a good, clear picture of the human anus, moreso than the existing image IMO. --<a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurt_Shaped_Box_3207.html" title="User:Kurt Shaped Box">Kurt Shaped Box</a> 22:28, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That would bring it around full circle to where it's been a couple of years. We had a cropped, shaved, bleached porn-anus in this article for a while, it was determined unsuitable (and a copyvio) and replaced with the current hairy man-hole. All we need is a neutral-looking and not-overly-hairy, suitable for an anatomy text. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hokkaido_Crow_7bd1.html" title="User:The Hokkaido Crow">The Crow</a> 22:43, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have actually considered taking a photo of my own anus for the article (as far as I am aware, mine is pretty typical) just to put an end to this. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be able to hold the camera at the right angle to get a decent shot.&#160;:( If you take a close look at the 'porn' anus in hi-res, it doesn't actually appear to have been shaved or bleached. --<a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurt_Shaped_Box_3207.html" title="User:Kurt Shaped Box">Kurt Shaped Box</a> 22:52, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think the old female anus was unsuitable; it was removed because it was unsourced. I'm not a fan of females, but cropped, that anus looks more useful than the male one we have now. I'd support adding it if you're willing to crop it. The only real problem is that it looks like a copyright violation too. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinst_dd2f.html" title="User:Kinst">Kinst</a> 21:59, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think my anus is any less hairy than Ano.jpg and I wouldn't say that my anus is an atypical human anus. In any case, who would you be to state that my anus, or the anus on the picture is atypical. In fact most male anuses that I have come across have a similar amount of hair, although the color of the hair on the picture makes it quite prominent. If we were discussing the anus of any other species than human, hair would surely not be a concern. Furthermore if was the Italian gentleman, who was so generous and kind to contribute the picture, I would be downright offended, if the picture was replaced only because the amount of hair was considered, by other wikipedians, to be unnatural and/or objectionable. BrunOperator 13:36, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As for my part, I don't find the present anus photo objectional or abnormal. My issues are (1) it's so hairy that the actual anus isn't very visible, (2) It's a decidedly male-looking anus, so people are going to be tempted to put a shaved anus on there and call it "female" because this is what porn has conditioned them to think. The anus is neither male nor female... the anatomy is exactly the same, and some females have even hairier anuses than men. So I think if we had a slightly hairy anus, it would be both medically illustrative and gender-neutral. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hokkaido_Crow_7bd1.html" title="User:The Hokkaido Crow">The Crow</a> 14:17, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While we're at it, why not put up an explicit picture of the anus expelling feces since this is its main function. That would surely be beyond valuable to the reader. And don't forget the "anal sex" page - there should be multiple pictures under anal sex: one of the anus before penetration, one with a penis penetrating the anus, and one of a gaping anus filled with semen. Of course, we should do this for both male and female anuses as to present a neutral POV. In all seriousness, get rid of this picture. No one is coming onto wikipedia to see a close-up picture of an anus. If they want to see what it looks like, they can bend over and look in a mirror. If you insist on associating that picture with this page then make it an external link with a warning. MC24

<dl>
<dd>What is it about the human anus that you find so strange? As I said, the article on the hand contains images of that part of human anatomy, as do the articles on breasts, the penis, vulva, etcetera. Wikipedia is not censored for minors, and consensus is to use photographs in conbination with medical diagrams in articles on anatomy.</dd>
<dd>You made two points. Firstly, you suggest that any image of an anus (in the anus article no less) is as vulgar as showing defacation (the article on which, you'll note, contains an image of a defecating cow and feces). Secondly, you suggest that there is no need to include images on parts of human anatomy when everyone can simply look at their own anatomy. Again, consensus disagrees, as evidenced by the articles on the eye, mouth, skin, nose, etcetera. -- <a href="../../../e/c/5/User_talk%7EEc5618_ab71.html" title="User talk:Ec5618">Ec5618</a> 11:58, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I never said I found it strange. Firstly, I agree that a defecating anus is more vulgar than just an anus. I'm glad you can at least see that distinction. Do you mind if I post a picture of a gaping anus? That certainly conforms to your criteria. Secondly, it's funny you mention consensus; the consensus of every nation in the world is that there is a difference between an anus and a nose. Based upon the fact that the vast majority of every civilized society in that world makes a distinction between an anus and a nose, you would have to admit that there are a significant number of users who might use this article for research who don't necessarily want to look at a photograph of an anus. What I don't understand is why you feel that my proposal to provide a link to the photograph instead of directly posting it detracts from the article. User:MC24
<dl>
<dd>Simply put, I object because the anus is not more vulgar than the vulva, or the penis. All of those have images. They are not included to shock people, but to illustrate the topic.</dd>
<dd>I also object because the only arguments in favour of removing the image are based on prudishness or decency, which are fluid and depend on one's point of view. Some might find images of cows offensive (which would make the image of the defecating cow most heinous indeed).&#160;::::::::::::I'm sure you can see Wikipedia would be in a poor state indeed if people were allowed to remove (or hide) content they found disagreeable. -- <a href="../../../e/c/5/User_talk%7EEc5618_ab71.html" title="User talk:Ec5618">Ec5618</a> 13:55, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This arguement is ridiculous....if you don't want to see an anus, be it male or female or hairy or not so hairy...um don't come to this page? Yeah...now if you want to see a female anus to masturbate to for whatever reason, how bout you go find a porn site? The gender of the person with the anus does not matter. An anus is an anus is anus.

Are aliens coming to this page? Anyone from the animal kingdom who isn't human? We don't need photos of anuses, ok? We just simply do not. It's gratuitous, inappropriate, nearing pornographic and quite ridiculous. Everyone has an anus and they know what it looks like. If an image is *absolutely* necessary, i think i diagram or drawing would suffice. 71.232.108.228 07:01, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I really didn't think I'd weigh in on this, but why not? When I first saw this page, I figured, 'hey, there's a picture of someones anus. I guess I can see the encyclopedic value in that.' But when I saw two pictures, I really think this articles contributers lost some serious street cred. I mean, two pictures? Male and Female? It's not like we're talking about a penis and a vagina. Anuses look the same either way. There is no gender difference. Two pictures is quite simply gratuitous. Not pronographic. Not inappropriate. Just gratuitous. You really only need one picture, if any. IF ANY! When an article has useless information, it is deleted. Useless pictures ahould and DO get the same treatment. Also, look at the <a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankle.html" title="Ankle">ankle</a> page. Hmm... no picture. Why not? We need both a male and female picture. How will readers know what they look like? Heck, save for the gallery, the <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hand.html" title="Hand">hand</a> article lacks pictures. Ditch the picture. At least one of them, if not both. It makes the article and its contributors look foolish.</dd>

<p>Lastly, in case it hasn't been pointed out, or for what it's worth, the pic of the female anus looks as if she had a bad <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episiotomy.html" title="Episiotomy">Episiotomy</a>.

<p>The article gives the impression that as long as good hygeine is used, there is no risk associated with anal sex. Is this true? Perhaps the part on sexuality should mention the health issues --I don't think any doctors reccomend anal sex-lubrication or not! <a href="../../../p/u/d/User%7EPuddytang_b2aa.html" title="User:Puddytang">Puddytang</a> 02:41, 19 January 2007 (UTC) Actually, four out of five doctors recommend anal sex with lubrication.</p>
<p>this always spawns an argument, because people who enjoy anal sex want to think it is basically safe and that the anus is meant to be penetrated, when really it is not. the tissues inside the rectum are very thin and delicate and are very susceptible to irritation and infection. 71.232.108.228 07:11, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Image is not as good as the original. And, consensus image was changed without discussion first. No offense intended. Be bold, revert, discuss. 02:42, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd be in favour of the new image if it were cropped slightly better. At the moment, the image looks badly framed - the skin surrounding the ringpiece is visible at the top of the image but not at the bottom (no pun intended). --<a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurt_Shaped_Box_3207.html" title="User:Kurt Shaped Box">Kurt Shaped Box</a> 11:13, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The skin outside isn't the anus, by any means. The anus is perfectly framed IMHO. <a href="../../../2/1/1/User%7E211.30.71.59.html" title="User:211.30.71.59">211.30.71.59</a> 21:02, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it's rather peculiar that when showing anuses we show both female and male anuses, where they are waxed and unwaxed respectively. This isn't really showing the subject from a medical standpoint whereas women and men can be just as dasypygal, as well as this could make someone (who might not know better) think that women don't have hair on their bums (which they of course do). It also gives the impression that a man's anus is not as clean/pretty/smooth (what have you) as the female counterpart. --<a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBiT_5ae3.html" title="User:BiT">BiT</a> 00:49, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Feel free to photograph a waxed male anus and unwaxed female anus and contribute the images. I'm not convinced that more pictures of anuses are needed. We already have a waxed anus and an unwaxed anus, and I think that provides a complete idea of what anuses look like. --<a href="../../../a/f/e/User%7EAfed_b194.html" title="User:Afed">Afed</a> 02:24, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's not the point, someone complained that there was a female anus picture in this article and assumed this was because it was deemed more pleasant to look at; it was then replaced by the most hairy male anus on this hemisphere. Apparently there are now (redundantly) two anus images, presumably for the sake of 'neutrality'. The existence of two anus pictures in this article is not encyclopedic, rather, it is diplomatic. The downsides of this encyclopedia concept, I guess we'll have to live with it. --<a href="../../../j/o/f/User%7EJoffeloff_ba63.html" title="User:Joffeloff">Joffeloff</a> 02:13, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A request for this article to be semi-protected was recently denied. This article was previously semi-protected; do Wikipedians honestly think that unregistered users are going to contribute valuable information on the topic of the anus? It's experienced heavy vandalism recently and is wasting the time of users who have to revert it.--<b><a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHisSpaceResearch_9ccf.html" title="User:HisSpaceResearch">h i s</a></b> <i><a href="../../../h/i/s/User_talk%7EHisSpaceResearch_e5e1.html" title="User talk:HisSpaceResearch">s p a c e</a></i> <b>r e s e a r c h</b> 21:57, 5 March 2007 (UTC) 29/3/2007 - hey, I am a medical student and a description of the blood supply and lymphatic drainage of the region would be really useful... this area is on each side of the ischorectal fossa (important in abscess formation) and the skin around the anus is supplied by the inferior recal nerve. The superior and inferior rectal arteries supply the area (i THINK). The lymph vessels of the skin drain into the medial group of the superficial inguinal nodes. hope this helps, ignore it if not.

<p>I would like to address the fact that humans also have anal glands. When mentioning "anal glands", almost everybody (who has heard of them) thinks of dogs. Most people don't seem to realize that humans have them as well (possibly most mammals). Anal glands are apocrine sweat glands (as found in the arm pits) that open into the anal crypts, about an inch into the anal canal. In humans, they are more numerous than in dogs and their secretions are mostly odorless. It is speculated that their secretions help lubricate bowel movements.</p>
<p>Given the sensitivity of this page, I thought I was post my intentions a bit prior to making any changes to the section on structure.</p>
