<p>I have to say, an anus image would be totally appropriate. As things stand now, there isn't even a real picture of an anus. Not that I would enjoy seeing one of course (gross), but it would be appropriate. In fact, the anus should be shown in all its variety: male anus (very hairy), female anus (not too hairy), and the goatse image (yuck... in the section on "sexual" stuff of course) 65.34.186.143 08:57, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Judicious use of a few more photos would indeed be appropriate, since this is supposed to be an encyclopedic entry. The Goatse anus, however, is sufficiently outside the mainstream that including a photo here would be more inflammatory than informative. 70.177.90.39 20:23, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As far as anus pictures so, that one isn't too bad. Anything bigger, dirtier, hairier, or more dilated would really be pushing things too far, but that one is just about tolerable, and illustrates the anus well. My one concern is that it is probably a copyvio. â€” <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChameleon_a79b.html" title="User:Chameleon"><i>Chameleon</i></a> 23:44, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello, Is anyone in favour of replacing this photo with one taken from an anatomy/medical website? I suspect people aren't offended by the anus itself but by the sourcing of the photo from a pornographic image. I support the inclusion of a photo but would prefer that the photo was one taken for eduational purposes with the consent of the individual providing the anus. Appearance (eg. hair etc.) shouldn't matter as long as the relevant anatomy is visible and the image is a fair representation of what anatomists/medical professionals consider 'normal'.--195.92.67.68 20:25, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, let's first see the proposed alternative and then decide. â€” <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChameleon_a79b.html" title="User:Chameleon"><i>Chameleon</i></a> 21:18, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The current photo shows a completely normal anus and it is without copyright issues. Substituting a different image is unlikely to placate those who have been deleting it. 70.177.90.39 18:17, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The purpose of substituting a different photo wouldn't be to placate anyone. Any anatomy textbook or other reference work/encyclopedia wouldn't feature the current photo. Anatomists generally follow an international standardised system of representing parts of the body for ease of comparison etc. All other educational media also follow this method. The perineum is usually shown from below with the thighs abducted; deviations from this are reserved for highlighting 'abnormalities'. Although the article covers more than just anatomy I see no reason why Wikipedia should use different criteria. Secondly, an educational photo of any part of the body should probably not be sourced from pornography and certainly not without the consent of the individual.--195.92.67.67 00:06, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suggest you look at an anatomy textbook (Gray's Anatomy is the authority but Snell's/Grant's Atlas or indeed any other such book would be fine). Before we get to any specifics they all describe 'the anatomical position' which is the international standard whose existence you deny. Other articles on body parts feature illustrations or photos which use these criteria (eg.hand, penis, vagina, perineum). Regarding your second point, I fully agree that Wikipedia shouldn't strive to be an anatomy textbook, just as it shouldn't be a biology or chemistry textbook. However, an article cannot ignore the fundamentals of the subject it addresses. An article on, for example, carbon could ignore the periodic table and discuss only coal and diamond, but this would be far from ideal. The anatomical position is equally fundamental to anatomy and can't be ignored by any encyclopedia. Finally, the burden should be on us to prove that photos of intimate body parts are properly sourced. The absence of evidence to the contrary simply isn't enough, particularly where a photo appears to be derived from pornography.--195.92.67.209 21:39, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

In reference to the sourcing of images, are you proposing that Wikipedia adopt a different standard for the documentation of an image if the subject is an intimate body part? 70.177.90.39 23:15, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gray's uses illustrations. Other textbooks use photos for surface anatomy. However, both photos and drawings conform to the same basic principles by which the body is represented in anatomy or any other reference work. These fundamental principles can't be ignored. To do so seriously damages the educational authority of the article. As for your second point the burden of proof rests on us for every image. Images which are obviously derived from a copyrighted source are removed. In this case the angle and position make it highly likely that it is cropped from a pornographic image, in which case we obviously don't have copyright. Copyright aside, for the benefit of the article it is best to have a photo which doesn't appear to be taken from pornography.--195.92.67.75 23:47, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While I like the image, perhaps for the wrong reasons, might I suggest that the photo be converted to a grayscale image. The excessive "pinkness" really does scream pornography. Making it black and white would certainly make it look more medical, at least. N^O^el 07:33, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Shall there be no reference to sexuality?</span></h2>
<p>Newcomer to this dispute... I believe the photo issue is secondary to the fact that 90% to 100% of this article should be deleted. This article is superfluous and also ridiculously skewed toward the human species. Most animals have some form of anus. Few other species possess anuses resembling the human anus, and in the absence of humans, virtually none of their anuses serve in an erotic capacity. The anus in all its glory is sufficiently described elsewhere on Wikipedia (how many anal erotica articles do we have, again?) Quite frankly, this article should be stripped down to pointers to Freud, anal erotica, and the digestive system, or even deleted altogether. Otherwise, article should be renamed to "Butthole" to accurately reflect the assembled prurient interests driving it. 219.102.32.92 10:51, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The biodiversity argument was earlier exposed as a dishonest one, because those who bring it up here only complain about biodiversity when it comes to this specific orifice. Even if honestly offered, the biodiversity argument fails. The anus is remarkably similar across species. <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teeth.html" title="Teeth">Teeth</a> are different, <a href="../../../n/o/s/Nose.html" title="Nose">noses</a> are different...but the wrinkly little anus is almost ubiquitous. And your complaint that anuses don't play a role in animal sexuality, is demonstrably false.<a href="http://www.zoofur.com/gayanimals.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.zoofur.com/gayanimals.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> In any case, the way to resolve a biodiversity problem is to add information, not to delete it. 70.177.90.39 17:34, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, kindly do not assert dishonesty; unless you can prove intent, it is merely error. And you have not successfully proven error nor dishonesty. First, anuses are not remarkably similar across species, unless you suffer from a strong bias toward the mammal phylum. The anuses of the reptile, fish, insect, crustacean, amphibian, mollusk do not resemble the human anus in appearance (I could go on and on). Humans and mammals are greatly in the minority in the animal kingdom, if you weren't aware. Also, you offered a photo of same-sex animal mounting as proof of anal eroticism in animals, but this link mentioned nothing about anal penetration. That borders on dishonesty. Mounting is about mounting. You are making assumptions on animal sexuality based on your knowledge of human sexuality, and generally there is no penetration involved. Third, I affirm that most organ articles here violate the concept of "Wikipedia is not a dictionary". If I were to turn the selectivity argument around on you, I'd have to ask why you (or someone like you) aren't going around adding a sexual function clause to every such article. 219.102.32.92 22:47, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>An argument can suffer from dishonesty without <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intent.html" title="Intent">intent</a>, and to dismiss such an argument as 'mere error' would be a mistake. To say the argument is dishonest is not to say that one's position on the argument is wrong, it is to say that the argument itself is wrong. The biodiversity argument has indeed been exposed as dishonest.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anus#Shall_we_delete_current_photo.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anus#Shall_we_delete_current_photo.3F" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> 1) The way to resolve a biodiversity problem is to add information, not to delete it. 2) I should have cited a better article, but the pictures of dogs humping were just too funny. Animals do indeed penetrate when mounted; it has been observed in animals as diverse as rams and albatrosses. <a href="http://www.salon.com/it/feature/1999/03/cov_15featurea.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.salon.com/it/feature/1999/03/cov_15featurea.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> 3) There is nothing inconsistent about my pro-photo views.

<dd>Sexuality is important to this article and should stay. It should also be noted that the anus does play a role in the sexual behaviour of many animals. See "Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity" by Bruce Bagemihl--195.92.67.75 00:07, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems to me that there is a disproportionate amount of detail in the "role in sexuality" section. It is one of the longest sections and the only one containing its own image, which implies that this section is the most important aspect of the anus (I think most would agree with me here). There should be no more detail than a 2-3 sentence paragraph. If the reader wishes more detail he can click on the "Anal sex" link that is already there. Another thing that could help the balance of this article is that the other sections be expanded and new sections added.</p>
<p>I'm not a person who is easily offended. In fact, I was rather amused and entertained while reading the section, and send the link to the picture to several of my friends who were also quite amused. However, amusement or offense should not be the impression of the 'majority' of people who read Wikipedia; urbandictionary.com (or other wiki-based site) is a better place for content like that. Whatâ€™s at stake is reducing the level of credibility of Wikipedia such that it becomes just a big joke. In my opinion, this article does not meet the objective and balanced standard expected for Wikipedia articles and needs to be revised.207.171.180.101 04:01, 24 February 2006 (UTC) by Derrill D.</p>

<dd>I disagree: First of all, the "Another Nitwit User Surfaces" shows that Wetman cannot be considered an unbiased source, so what he say has to be disgarded in the name of objectivity. Second of all, a user searching for the Nihilist group may type "anus" but not know how to find the group's page: so I believe a disambiguation page should be created. It happens with bands all the time: see <a href="../../../b/e/h/Behemoth.html" title="Behemoth">Behemoth</a> and look at the top where it has alternate pages linking to it. I've never claimed that it has links to Nihilism, but it has links to an organization that shares it's name. Now, if the Nihilist organization cannot be linked from ANUS, then all pages such as the ones on <a href="../../../b/e/h/Behemoth.html" title="Behemoth">Behemoth</a> must be deleted as well. --Iconoclast 19:40, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is nothing inherently obscene about anything. But cultures impose standards. Wikipedia is not going to benefit people by posting "gross-out" or potentially offensive images (although if they require a separate click from the article to access it, that's fine, because then the person is making a deliberate choice about it). Instead we will just turn them away. Nor is Wikipedia itself going to benefit. If people avoid us, or at least articles like this one, then we suffer. In some cases it isn't so clear cut. But here we can say with considerable certainty that a large majority of people will be offended/disgusted.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Need non-copyrighted, preferably medical image</span></h2>
<p>I don't entirely object to the display of a picture on this page. However, it is obvious that the one in this article was taken from a pornographic image, that was probably copyrighted. A good medical image would be much more suitable. A pornographic image is just plain prurient. Wikipedia should be held to the same high standards as any other encyclopedia, even if it can be edited by anyone with a computer. If you wouldn't see it in world book, why should it be here?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Because wp aspires to be more complete than World Book; and because sometimes it is better to have a less-good placeholder rather than nothing at all.</dd>
<dd>Seconded. I don't think a photograph is strictly necessary, but if one is to be included it ought to be a medical image, or at least one which can be guaranteed to be free. --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathan_Drain_9ea0.html" title="User:Jonathan Drain">Jonathan Drain</a> <a href="http://www.jonnydigital.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jonnydigital.com" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> 12:46, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Got to this page via the requests for protection page. Why is the nutrality template up? Is it up because of the debate over the photo or something else? I don't find body parts offensive. But I do understand that some people do. Can't we just create a link to it, or do what some message boards do for spoilers and hide the image unless someone clicks something causing the image to reveal itself?

<p>I'm happy that you did this, because it annoyed me to just see a female anus. I do think it's a serious problem however that the female anus is shaved and the male isn't.

<p>There is absolutely no problem with putting a picture of any normal human body part in anatomy articles, but this pair of images promotes sexist pornographic standards regarding grooming of men and women's anatomy. The woman's anus is clearly waxed, which is not the natural state of the adult female anatomy. The "breast" article should not show a set of obviously altered breasts as the sole image for similar reasons. I would guess that the female image came directly from a porn and I think it should either be removed or replaced by a more correct image.</p>

<p>The male anus has been removed by various users, myself included. I stand by this change as I believe the item is redundant, per the given reason for the addition of the male anus being inappropriate, the reason given is that it "is different (for instance, because of hairs)", this is lacking in principal or forethought. The human anus is identical, a sphincter is a sphincter, whilst every anus is different in aesthetics however we cannot list every anus, thus one example is neccesary to define the anus.</p>
<p>That being said, it appears that immediately on removal without discussion two users who guard this article revert without query, which whilst mildly irritating caused me to ponder whether it is appropriate to have images at all given the public backlash (ie: the fact that 90% of the articles talk page is whether or not images should be included). So I figure perhaps we should adopt a purposive approach and examine this a little more clearly.</p>
<p>Cited in the pro-anus basket most of all is that 'Wikipedia is not censored (for minors)'. <b>However</b>, Wikipedia's policy should then be examined as to what is stipulated on the matter: -</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia is not censored</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia may contain content that some readers consider objectionable or offensive. Anyone reading Wikipedia can edit an article and the changes are displayed instantaneously without any checking to ensure appropriateness, so Wikipedia cannot guarantee that articles or images are tasteful to all users or adhere to specific social or religious norms or requirements. While obviously inappropriate content (such as an irrelevant link to a shock site) is usually removed immediately, some articles may include objectionable text, images, or links if they are relevant to the content (such as the article about pornography) and <b>provided they do not violate</b> any of our <b>existing policies</b> (especially Neutral point of view), <b>nor the law of the U.S. state of Florida</b>, where Wikipedia's servers are hosted.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>So let us examine the obscenity and decency laws of Florida,<a href="http://www.moralityinmedia.org/nolc/stateObscLaws/florida.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.moralityinmedia.org/nolc/stateObscLaws/florida.pdf" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> which are very verbose on the matter yet also very, very stringent in their scope: -</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(6) "Harmful to minors" means any reproduction, imitation, characterization, description, exhibition, presentation, or representation, of whatever kind or form, depicting nudity, sexual conduct, or sexual excitement when it:</dd>
<dd>(a) Predominantly appeals to the prurient, shameful, or morbid interest of minors;</dd>
<dd>(b) Is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors; and</dd>
<dd>(c) Taken as a whole, is without serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(10) "Obscene" means the status of material which:</dd>
<dd>(a) The average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest;</dd>
<dd>(b) Depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct as specifically defined herein; and</dd>
<dd>(c) Taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The argument then becomes whether or not a certain article or piece of media "lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value." Many comentators have been swift to point out that 'academic or educational' is not listed in this category of exemption from the law. Thus, expressio unius est exclusio alterius: â€˜the express mention of one thing is the exclusion of anotherâ€™.</p>
<p>We can thus derive from this that as Wikipedia is not a scientific resource, but an academic and educational resource, it does not, by law, have permit to publish images that may be of questionable nature. Whilst I may not agree with the laws of Florida on this matter, especially due to the fact they still list 'anal sex' as 'deviate sexual intercourse', as well as pre-marital sex likewise, I, as a Wikipedian am bound by the legislation in place that governs the location of the hosting server.</p>
<p>So we've worked out that the photos themselves may be illegal and we must definitely err on the side of caution, all it takes is one bored filing of a civil decency complaint and a take down notice of the site to ruin our favorite hobby, especially as there are digital images alternatives, diagrams and other such graphics of equal quality available (even without license) the world over; what solutions are we left with and where shall we go from here?</p>
<p>I personally would recommend sticking with the Grey's diagrams we have, although as said above, there are many photorealistic diagrams out there in the medical world which may be of more avail to the purpose of the article.

<dd>I'm going to adress this in sections:
<dl>
<dd>1) To your original complaint: The male anus isn't just different because of hair, it's better because of hair. The female buttocks is artificially modified, and a global oddity. The female anus has POV implications about women and about shaving. The male anus is also at least 5 times larger, and 93 times higher quality in terms of KB. The male anus is centred, the female is at an odd angle and not. If you're so desperate to delete one, delete the female.</dd>
<dd>My inclination is to keep both. The female anus, though poorer quality, provides a different perspective. In fact, even with it, <i><b>I</b></i> don't know what the female area is supposed to look like. The only buttocks I know has a lump at the bottom where the penis and scrotum start, very close to the anus.</dd>

<dd>2) To your legal issue, that's hardly specific to <a href="../../../a/n/u/Anus.html" title="Anus">anus</a>. What about <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">penis</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast.html" title="Breast">breast</a>, both with no less than seven photographs each? Eight on <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">penis</a> if you count the giant elephant genitalia? Since your issue is with 'legality and policy' now, why not ask <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>?</dd>

<dd>I shall respond to your comments in kind, as per the first point you raised I can see the potential implications as you raised them. I would personally claim it is sexist if it weren't for the fact that 12/14 body part articles are male focused only; however the hair removal has been noted with the female photo. Thus perhaps we should organise a consensus, as the prior consensus was outdated immediately on the placement of an additional unagreed upon photograph. That is why I addressed that photograph as it was not agreed upon. That is on the grounds that it is -not- illegal under the laws of Florida to maintain these images when Wikipedia is not a 'scientific purpose'.</dd>

<dd>Secondly, I understand what you are saying, however I did not point this out in those articles, feel free to do so if you likewise wish to draw their attention to the fact that the images may be in breach of the laws of Florida. I have not been to these articles, nor have any intention on going there.</dd>

<dd>And, with those two points out of the way, my purposive point raised (on the legality issue) still stands and, I feel at present, has not been addressed at all. Your above comments are purely obiter and do not touch on the issue raised. "X is doing it, so why can't we." is not a very valid response. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJachin_f2fc.html" title="User:Jachin">Jachin</a> 05:30, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Jachin, if you want to discuss the legality of the images then this is really the wrong place to do it. Go and contact the wikimedia board (board@wikimedia.org). If the image should not be on this page then it should be removed from the image servers also.--<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClawed_5038.html" title="User:Clawed">Clawed</a> 07:43, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm inclined to agree, thank you Clawed. I shot an email off with a more in depth analysis of the matter to them. All it would take is a censor-weenie (tm) running to a local court house to get a take-down order filed, it's not worth risking our wiki project just for the censor-weenie polar opposites out there. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJachin_f2fc.html" title="User:Jachin">Jachin</a> 09:07, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
