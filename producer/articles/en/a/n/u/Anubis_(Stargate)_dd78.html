<p>In the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> series <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Stargate_SG-1_3423.html" title="Stargate SG-1">Stargate SG-1</a></i>, <b>Anubis</b> was an extremely powerful <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goa%27uld.html" title="Goa'uld">Goa'uld</a>, the dominant evil alien race in the galaxy. Anubis replaced <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apophis_%28Stargate%29_2512.html" title="Apophis (Stargate)">Apophis</a> as the show's main villain after the latter's ultimate demise in the episode "<a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemies_%28Stargate_SG-1%29_cb3f.html" title="Enemies (Stargate SG-1)">Enemies</a>", and was quite unlike any Goa'uld previously encountered. He was first mentioned (Although he wasn't named at the time) in the episode "<a href="../../../b/e/t/Between_Two_Fires_%28Stargate_SG-1%29_dc47.html" title="Between Two Fires (Stargate SG-1)">Between Two Fires</a>", although he was not seen in person until "<a href="../../../r/e/v/Revelations_%28Stargate_SG-1%29_7eb1.html" title="Revelations (Stargate SG-1)">Revelations</a>".</p>
<p>Like most powerful Goa'uld, he had assumed (and, possibly, was the origin of) a deific persona from early <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> mythologies, in his case the <a href="../../../a/n/u/Anubis.html" title="Anubis">Anubis</a> of <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptian_mythology.html" title="Egyptian mythology">Egyptian mythology</a>. However, Anubis was far more dangerous then the rest of his race, as he was partly <a href="../../../a/s/c/Ascension_%28Stargate%29_3a10.html" title="Ascension (Stargate)">ascended</a> and thus invulnerable to being killed by conventional means.</p>
<p>Due to his semi-ethereal existence, depriving him of an actual corporeal body, Anubis was seen only through character, and never truly through appearance. As such, he has been played by several different actors including <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Palffy_d903.html" title="David Palffy">David Palffy</a>, Dean Aylesworth, <a href="../../../r/i/k/Rik_Kiviaho_e60f.html" title="Rik Kiviaho">Rik Kiviaho</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Dzundza_eff5.html" title="George Dzundza">George Dzundza</a> (Palffy previously played <a href="../../../s/o/k/Sokar_%28Stargate%29_3eec.html" title="Sokar (Stargate)">Sokar</a> in the series, a similar extremely powerful <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goa%27uld.html" title="Goa'uld">Goa'uld</a>, who was also considered far worse than the majority of his race).</p>
<p>While all <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goa%27uld.html" title="Goa'uld">Goa'uld</a> were megalomanic, egotistical and arrogant, Anubis was more clever than most, and had a sound mind for complexity and convoluted schemes. Notably, he was also infamous for being even more <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melodrama.html" title="Melodrama">melodramatic</a> than the rest of the <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goa%27uld.html" title="Goa'uld">Goa'uld</a>. Therefore, he has often been compared by fans to <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palpatine.html" title="Palpatine">Emperor Palpatine</a> of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a>, causing <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel.html" title="Colonel">Colonel</a> <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_O%27Neill_%28Stargate%29_a913.html" title="Jack O'Neill (Stargate)">O'Neill</a> to remark at one point, "Oh, come on.

Anubis' usual appearance.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Commanding vast legions of <a href="../../../j/a/f/Jaffa_%28Stargate%29_c4d5.html" title="Jaffa (Stargate)">Jaffa</a> warriors and space-faring attack vessels (<a href="../../../h/a/27/Ha%27tak.html" title="Ha'tak">Ha'taks</a>), Anubis was regarded as a <a href="../../../s/y/s/System_Lord_3b38.html" title="System Lord">System Lord</a>, one of the few most powerful <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goa%27uld.html" title="Goa'uld">Goa'uld</a>. After spending centuries away, his main contender upon returning was the System Lord <a href="../../../y/u/_/Yu_%28Stargate%29_36e8.html" title="Yu (Stargate)">Yu</a>, the other System Lords having agreed to his reacceptance into their ranks. As most of the System Lords, Anubis posed as a <i>god</i> to his underlings, ensuring supreme loyalty.</p>
<p>Unlike other Goa'uld, who are merely a parasite living inside a human host, Anubis was a half-<a href="../../../a/s/c/Ascension_%28Stargate%29_3a10.html" title="Ascension (Stargate)">ascended</a> being, meaning that he is partially ethereal, having almost converted his body to energy and risen to a higher plane of existence. This transformation was first discovered by the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_%28Stargate%29_eeed.html" title="Ancient (Stargate)">Ancients</a>, perhaps the most advanced race ever to exist in the galaxy, that have long since all Ascended. Apparently, Anubis discovered the fate of the Ancients, and ascended through a combination of their knowledge and the unwilling help of <a href="../../../o/m/a/Oma_Desala_16b2.html" title="Oma Desala">Oma Desala</a>, whom he tricked into believing that he was spiritually worthy of ascension.</p>
<p>Refusing to allow Anubis amongst their ranks, the Ancients somehow managed to "descend" Anubis and partially force him back to this plane of existence, stopping short of completely returning him to physical existence to 'punish' Oma Desala for her interference in the lower planes. Being partially Ascended allowed Anubis to gain much of the knowledge of the Ancients, which enabled him to use much of their technology, giving him a significant advantage over the other <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goa%27uld.html" title="Goa'uld">Goa'uld</a>. Effectively, he became the most dangerous of all <a href="../../../s/y/s/System_Lord_3b38.html" title="System Lord">System Lords</a>, possessing vast armies, advanced technology, and being practically impossible to destroy.</p>
<p>Although he could theoretically use his godlike powers against lower, mortal beings, the Ancients prevented him from doing so, as according to their rules, ascended beings are forbidden to interfere with the lower planes of existence. However, as the Ancients themselves would not interfere with mortal affairs, Anubis was allowed to do anything he could have done as regular Goa'uld. <sup id="_ref-Threads_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Threads" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Without a physical form, Anubis was forced to rely on an energy shield to keep his essence together. He appeared as a shadowy hooded figure wearing a large black cloak. Instead of a human face, all that could be seen under the hood was a shifting energy field. <sup id="_ref-Full_Circle_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Full_Circle" title="">[3]</a></sup> After his defeat by <a href="../../../s/g/-/SG-1_f555.html" title="SG-1">SG-1</a> during his attempted invasion of Earth <sup id="_ref-Lost_City_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lost_City" title="">[4]</a></sup>, Anubis was forced to abandon the use of the hooded force field, and began to possess other bodies for his shape, somewhat returning to the parasitical nature of his fellow Goa'uld. However, unlike other Goa'uld, he was unable to remain in the same host body for an extended period of time, as his essence was somehow 'toxic' to humans, causing his hosts to die after a prolonged period of holding him. <sup id="_ref-Threads_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Threads" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

Anubis' face.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Originally a regular member of the System Lords, Anubis was exiled over a millennium ago from the System Lords collective, apparently for "crimes unspeakable, even to the <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goa%27uld.html" title="Goa'uld">Goa'uld</a>". <a href="../../../y/u/_/Yu_%28Stargate%29_36e8.html" title="Yu (Stargate)">Yu</a> and the other System Lords of the time sent assassins after him, and assumed him to be dead. <sup id="_ref-Last_Stand_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Last_Stand" title="">[5]</a></sup> However, Anubis used Ancient information on ascension he had discovered earlier to trick <a href="../../../o/m/a/Oma_Desala_16b2.html" title="Oma Desala">Oma Desala</a> into helping him to ascend.</p>
<p>Normally, the Ancients will allow newly ascended beings to join their ranks if one is "pure of heart". However, because of his evil nature, the other Ascended beings partially cast him down to a lower plane, stopping short of completely returning him to physical existence to 'punish' Oma for her interference. Being partially ascended allowed Anubis to gain much of the knowledge of the Ancients, and made him effectively invincible.</p>
<p>Although he could theoretically use his godlike powers against lower, mortal beings, the Ancients prevented him from doing so, as according to their rules, ascended beings are forbidden to interfere with the lower planes of existence. However, as the Ancients themselves would not interfere with mortal affairs, Anubis was allowed to do anything he could have done as a regular Goa'uld. <sup id="_ref-Threads_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Threads" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Eventually, Anubis returned in the wake of the deaths of <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apophis_%28Stargate%29_2512.html" title="Apophis (Stargate)">Apophis</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cronus_%28Stargate%29_5d3e.html" title="Cronus (Stargate)">Cronus</a> by <a href="../../../s/g/-/SG-1_f555.html" title="SG-1">SG-1</a>, and began to dominate the galaxy using advanced technology, based on the Ancient knowledge gained through his ascension. This technology was superior to that of all the other Goa'uld, giving him an enormous advantage over his peers. He recruited other exiled Goa'uld such as <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanith_%28Stargate%29_e0a6.html" title="Tanith (Stargate)">Tanith</a> <sup id="_ref-Between_Two_Fires_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Between_Two_Fires" title="">[6]</a></sup>, <a href="../../../o/s/i/Osiris_%28Stargate%29_bc41.html" title="Osiris (Stargate)">Osiris</a>, and <a href="../../../z/i/p/Zipacna_%28Stargate%29_ac37.html" title="Zipacna (Stargate)">Zipacna</a> to aid him in conquering the galaxy. <sup id="_ref-Summit_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Summit" title="">[7]</a></sup> Also, he conducted many raids against the other System Lords, without ever revealing his identity to them. <sup id="_ref-Last_Stand_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Last_Stand" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Also, one of the civilizations he destroyed during his rise to power were the <a href="../../../t/o/l/Tollan_%28Stargate%29_fa07.html" title="Tollan (Stargate)">Tollan</a>. It originally was Anubis' intention to force the Tollan into attacking the <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tau%27ri.html" title="Tau'ri">Tau'ri</a>, who were protected by the <a href="../../../a/s/g/Asgard_%28Stargate%29_7edc.html" title="Asgard (Stargate)">Asgard</a> through the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protected_Planets_Treaty_8a2f.html" title="Protected Planets Treaty">Protected Planets Treaty</a>, and could therefore not be attacked without igniting a war between the System Lords and the extremely powerful race.</p>
<p>After having developed shields capable of withstanding the Tollan <a href="../../../t/o/l/Tollan_technology_in_Stargate_67f4.html#Ion_cannon" title="Tollan technology in Stargate">Ion cannons</a>, their only measure of defense, Anubis, through his minion Tanith, forced the Tollan to build phase-shifting warheads, capable of penetrating the <a href="../../../s/g/c/SGC_8568.html" title="SGC">SGC</a>'s <a href="../../../i/r/i/Iris_%28Stargate%29_b12e.html" title="Iris (Stargate)">Iris</a> protecting their <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stargate_%28device%29.html" title="Stargate (device)">Stargate</a>. However, when SG-1 discovered what the Tollan were about to do, they were able to convince the Tollan <a href="../../../t/o/l/Tollan_characters_in_Stargate_7937.html#Narim" title="Tollan characters in Stargate">Narim</a> to destroy the already completed weapons. In retribution, Anubis ordered Tanith to destroy the defenseless Tollan. <sup id="_ref-Between_Two_Fires_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Between_Two_Fires" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>During a System Lord summit to discuss the possibility of creating a new order, as much of their peers had recently fallen, Anubis sent <a href="../../../o/s/i/Osiris_%28Stargate%29_bc41.html" title="Osiris (Stargate)">Osiris</a> as his proxy, hoping to be accepted back into their ranks. <sup id="_ref-Summit_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Summit" title="">[7]</a></sup> In exchange, he proposed to destroy the Tau'ri, something the System Lords could not do without suffering Asgard retribution. Six of the seven System Lords present voted to accept Anubis as a System Lord, the only dissenter being <a href="../../../y/u/_/Yu_%28Stargate%29_36e8.html" title="Yu (Stargate)">Yu</a>, the only System Lord still alive from the time of Anubis' original banishment. While the summit was taking place, Anubis ordered Zipacna to attack the <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tok%27ra.html" title="Tok'ra">Tok'ra</a> base on <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planets_in_Stargate_6ed0.html" title="Planets in Stargate">Revanna</a>, causing their near-destruction. <sup id="_ref-Last_Stand_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Last_Stand" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>In an attempt to destroy Earth, he sent an <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asteroid.html" title="Asteroid">asteroid</a> containing explosive <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_materials_in_the_Stargate_universe_eb3e.html#Naqahdah" title="Fictional materials in the Stargate universe">naqahdah</a> on a collision course with Earth, hoping that either the impact would destroy the planet, or that if the SGC was successful in destroying the asteroid, the naqahdah inside would create a big enough explosion to take Earth with it. This plan eventually also proved to be unsuccessful, as <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samantha_Carter_750d.html" title="Samantha Carter">Samantha Carter</a> discovered the naqahdah and decided to fly the asteroid <i>through</i> Earth via a hyperspace window. <sup id="_ref-Fail_Safe_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fail_Safe" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Several months later, Anubis, through his minion Osiris, attacked a planet protected by the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protected_Planets_Treaty_8a2f.html" title="Protected Planets Treaty">Protected Planets Treaty</a>. The sole Asgard ship sent, a <a href="../../../b/e/l/Beliskner_class_cruiser.html" title="Beliskner class cruiser">Beliskner class cruiser</a> commanded by <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thor_%28Stargate%29_d78d.html" title="Thor (Stargate)">Thor</a>, was no match for Anubis' improved <a href="../../../h/a/27/Ha%27tak.html" title="Ha'tak">Ha'taks</a>, and was easily destroyed. He subsequently took Thor captive, and probed his mind to learn more about <a href="../../../a/s/g/Asgard_technology_in_Stargate_aa8e.html" title="Asgard technology in Stargate">Asgard technology</a>.

<p>Possibly in retribution, Anubis tried to destroy the Tau'ri several months later by using an Ancient <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_technology_in_Stargate_76e6.html#Gate_Overloader" title="Ancient technology in Stargate">weapon</a> capable of sending immense energy through a Stargate.

Daniel Jackson attempts to defeat Anubis.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>After Anubis had been successful in collecting five of the six "<a href="../../../g/o/a/Goa%27uld_technology_in_Stargate_092c.html#Eye_of_Ra" title="Goa'uld technology in Stargate">Eyes</a>", devices capable of being assembled into a devastating, <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planet_killer.html" title="Planet killer">planet-killing</a> weapon, and had recently located the last remaining eye on the planet <a href="../../../a/b/y/Abydos_%28Stargate%29_5ea1.html" title="Abydos (Stargate)">Abydos</a>, the ascended <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Jackson_1278.html" title="Daniel Jackson">Daniel Jackson</a> informed the System Lords about Anubis' plans. In response, they eventually joined forces to oppose him, first under <a href="../../../y/u/_/Yu_%28Stargate%29_36e8.html" title="Yu (Stargate)">Yu</a>, and then <a href="../../../b/a/27/Ba%27al_%28Stargate%29_de89.html" title="Ba'al (Stargate)">Ba'al</a>. Jackson also notified the <a href="../../../s/g/c/SGC_8568.html" title="SGC">SGC</a> about Anubis' plans, hoping that they would both protect the Abydonian people and keep Anubis from obtaining the Eye.</p>
<p>When Anubis' <a href="../../../j/a/f/Jaffa_%28Stargate%29_c4d5.html" title="Jaffa (Stargate)">Jaffa</a> arrived on the planet, they were fought by both SG-1 and the Abydonian people. However, knowing that they would be unable to hold off the Goa'uld forced for long, Daniel Jackson made a deal with the System Lord. In exchange for the Eye, Anubis promised to leave Abydos alone. Jackson was able to convince Jack O'Neill to hand over the Eye to Anubis' Jaffa by both claiming that the Abydonian people would remain unharmed and that the mistrust created between the System Lords by the completion of the weapon would probably do them more harm then good.</p>
<p>However, Anubis did not keep his end of the bargain. When the Eye was delivered to him, he used it to destroy the System Lord Alliance fleet, and was about to turn it on Abydos. When Daniel tried to use his ascended powers to stop him, he was pulled away by <a href="../../../o/m/a/Oma_Desala_16b2.html" title="Oma Desala">Oma Desala</a>, and was subsequently descended for breaking the Ancients' rules regarding non-interference. With nothing in his way, Anubis used his superweapon to destroy Abydos and its Stargate. However, the Abydonian people were collectively ascended by Oma Desala. <sup id="_ref-Full_Circle_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Full_Circle" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the next few months, the System Lords continued to battle Anubis, although they had little success against his newly developed superweapon. Eventually, the United System Lord Alliance was forced to cooperate with Earth and <a href="../../../s/g/-/SG-1_f555.html" title="SG-1">SG-1</a> (now reunited with the descended Daniel Jackson). This uneasy alliance was successful in destroying Anubis' superweapon by sabotaging the cooling vents with an <a href="../../../f/-/3/F-302.html" title="F-302">F-302</a> missile. <sup id="_ref-Fallen_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fallen" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>One of the members of SG-1, <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonas_Quinn_47f6.html" title="Jonas Quinn">Jonas Quinn</a>, was captured during this mission. After Anubis had probed his mind and discovered the information about <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_materials_in_the_Stargate_universe_eb3e.html#Naqahdriah" title="Fictional materials in the Stargate universe">naqahdriah</a>, a powerful naqahdah variant naturally occurring on Quinn's home planet <a href="../../../l/a/n/Langara_%28Stargate%29_c0f6.html" title="Langara (Stargate)">Langara</a>, his mothership arrived on the planet and enslaved the populace. However, his attempts to learn more about the naqahdriah failed, and when the System Lord Alliance, lead by Ba'al, discovered his location, they sent a fleet to destroy his mothership. Still, Anubis was able to escape the demise of his ship in an escape pod. <sup id="_ref-Homecoming_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Homecoming" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Realizing how unreliable the Jaffa had become because of the successful <a href="../../../j/a/f/Jaffa_Rebellion_c01e.html" title="Jaffa Rebellion">Jaffa Rebellion</a>, Anubis created a new, almost indestructible ground trooper, which would later become known as <a href="../../../k/u/l/Kull_Warriors_8803.html" title="Kull Warriors">Kull Warriors</a> to the <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goa%27uld.html" title="Goa'uld">Goa'uld</a> and 'Supersoldiers' to the <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tau%27ri.html" title="Tau'ri">Tau'ri</a>. Produced on the planet <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planets_in_Stargate_6ed0.html" title="Planets in Stargate">Tartarus</a>, these warriors were genetically engineered hosts, infested by modified Goa'uld symbiotes. They were protected from enemy fire by an almost indestructible armor suit and possessed a powerful energy weapon. Using these warriors, Anubis killed several minor Goa'uld, usurping their armies into his own in preparation for an all-out assault on the remaining System Lords.</p>
<p>However, when SG-1 discovered the location of the warrior's production facilities, they destroyed the Goa'uld queen producing the modified symbiotes and killed Anubis' chief scientist <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goa%27uld_characters_in_Stargate_f76b.html#Thoth" title="Goa'uld characters in Stargate">Thoth</a>, at least temporarily preventing Anubis from creating more warriors. <sup id="_ref-Evolution_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Evolution" title="">[12]</a></sup> Also, the Tau'ri and Tok'ra were able to devise a weapon that could effectively be used against them. <sup id="_ref-Death_Knell_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Death_Knell" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

<p>Anubis finally launched an all-out attack against Earth, using more than thirty <a href="../../../h/a/27/Ha%27tak.html" title="Ha'tak">Ha'tak</a> motherships. His initial assault resulted in the destruction of an American aircraft carrier and battle cruiser, but he and his fleet were ultimately destroyed when Colonel O'Neill (who possesses the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Technology_Activation_gene_ba4b.html" title="Ancient Technology Activation gene">ATA Gene</a>) used the recently discovered planetary <a href="../../../d/r/o/Drone_Weapon_8666.html" title="Drone Weapon">defense weapon</a> of the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_%28Stargate%29_eeed.html" title="Ancient (Stargate)">Ancient</a> Outpost in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antarctica.html" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> to defend the planet. <sup id="_ref-Lost_City_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lost_City" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Because of his immaterial, half-ascended nature, Anubis survived the destruction of his fleet. Unable to simply use his ascended powers to return without bringing the wrath of the Ancients upon him, he was forced to float around in space, existing as pure energy as the shield holding his form intact had been destroyed along with his fleet. When several pieces of debris left over from the attacking fleet were about to collide with the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Space_Station_3aa9.html" title="International Space Station">International Space Station</a>, Anubis came on board, where he possessed one of the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russian</a> cosmonauts on board.</p>
<p>After switching hosts several times, who all died shortly after Anubis had left their bodies, he infested a Russian military officer named <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tau%27ri_characters_in_Stargate_8ea1.html#Alexi_Vaselov" title="Tau'ri characters in Stargate">Alexi Vaselov</a>. As the Russians had an agreement with the American government to allow their military access to the Stargate, Anubis, still in the body of Vaselov travelled to the SGC under the pretense of joining an <a href="../../../s/g/_/SG_team_fab2.html" title="SG team">SG team</a>.</p>
<p>However, Anubis' presence was eventually discovered. Unable to kill him, he continued to float around the base, manifesting himself as an almost invisible energy field. He possessed various members of the <a href="../../../s/g/c/SGC_8568.html" title="SGC">SGC</a> including Carter, Jackson and O'Neill, until he managed to escape through the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stargate_%28device%29.html" title="Stargate (device)">Stargate</a> in the body of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russian</a> military officer Alexi Vaselov who voluteered to sacrifice his life, only to find himself stranded and frozen on a remote ice planet after <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samantha_Carter_750d.html" title="Samantha Carter">Samantha Carter</a> changed his destination at the last moment. <sup id="_ref-Lockdown_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lockdown" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

<p>Almost a year after being stranded on the ice planet, Anubis somehow escaped, and he reclaimed his fleet and <a href="../../../k/u/l/Kull_Warrior_7da7.html" title="Kull Warrior">Kull Warrior</a> army that the <a href="../../../s/y/s/System_Lord_3b38.html" title="System Lord">System Lord</a> <a href="../../../b/a/27/Ba%27al_%28Stargate%29_de89.html" title="Ba'al (Stargate)">Ba'al</a> had subsumed. It is not clear for how long Ba'al enjoyed a galaxy without Anubis, but when Anubis did return, he secretly made himself master over Ba'al, and became in effect the most powerful System Lord once again.</p>
<p>During the climactic <a href="../../../r/e/p/Replicator_%28Stargate%29_9d8b.html" title="Replicator (Stargate)">Replicator</a> invasion of the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milky_Way_7069.html" title="Milky Way">Milky Way</a> galaxy, Anubis learned of an <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_%28Stargate%29_eeed.html" title="Ancient (Stargate)">Ancient</a> <a href="../../../d/a/k/Dakara_Superweapon_475b.html" title="Dakara Superweapon">Superweapon</a> that could be used to not only defeat the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Replicator_%28Stargate%29_9d8b.html" title="Replicator (Stargate)">Replicators</a> but also wipe out all life in the galaxy; due to him lacking a body, only he would survive the use of the weapon, and he could thus recreate life in the galaxy based on his own design. Unwilling to sacrifice his own life, Ba'al contacted the SGC and admitted that he had been controlled by Anubis for some time. He asked them to destroy the device before his fleet could arrive over <a href="../../../d/a/k/Dakara.html" title="Dakara">Dakara</a>, the location of the weapon, so that the weapon would never be used.</p>
<p>However, the combined efforts of SG-1, <a href="../../../b/a/27/Ba%27al_%28Stargate%29_de89.html" title="Ba'al (Stargate)">Ba'al</a>, the Rebel Jaffa, and <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Jackson_1278.html" title="Daniel Jackson">Daniel Jackson</a> were successful in adapting the weapon to destroy the Replicator threat once and for all. Still, even after the Replicators were ultimately defeated, Anubis continued to plan to activate the weapon and destroy all galactic life. <sup id="_ref-Reckoning_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Reckoning" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>He was only stopped when <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Jackson_1278.html" title="Daniel Jackson">Daniel Jackson</a>, who was deciding whether to ascend for a second time after his death at the hands of <a href="../../../r/e/p/RepliCarter_902f.html" title="RepliCarter">RepliCarter</a>, realised that both Anubis and Oma Desala were in his presence, all existing on the low ascended plane he was occupying at the time. Jackson convinced Oma, who was responsible for the System Lords' ascension in the first place, to fight Anubis, which prevented him from continuing his plan in the non-ascended world. Although neither Oma nor Anubis could triumph over the other, as long as Oma continues to battle Anubis on the ascended plane of existence, all his concentration must be spent on battling her, effectively preventing his return to the mortal world for the rest of eternity. As a result, his Kull warriors became disorganized and confused, after which they were easily overpowered. <sup id="_ref-Threads_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Threads" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>Even after his disappearance, Anubis' legacy kept menacing the SGC. Knowing he would never reach his true potential as an ascended being because of the Ancients, Anubis had attempted to create a new kind of soldier, essentially ascended warriors, to fight them. In an attempt to recreate his pre-ascended DNA, he created a genetically-engineered hybrid human, later named Khalek, with all his memories and various Ascended powers such as <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telekinesis.html" title="Telekinesis">telekinesis</a>, and later subjected him to DNA treatments with an Ancient <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_resequencer_%28Stargate%29_b489.html" title="DNA resequencer (Stargate)">DNA Resenquencer</a>, afterwards placing him in a stasis chamber.</p>
<p>When SG-1 found the chamber on planet <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planets_in_Stargate_6ed0.html" title="Planets in Stargate">P3X-584</a>, he was awoken by the arriving team and convinced them he was an unwilling subject, abducted from his home by Anubis and left in stasis after the System Lords' disappearance. However, eventually <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Jackson_1278.html" title="Daniel Jackson">Daniel Jackson</a> saw through the ruse after reading the notes in the lab written in the Ancient language. Discovered, Khalek worked to an end of returning to the planet and complete the treatments that would allow his full ascension. Although captured, he used his advanced state to attempt escape, killing several SGC troops in the process. However, he was finally shot by Daniel as he attempted to escape back to his planet and complete his last steps to ascension. <sup id="_ref-Prototype_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Prototype" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

<li>An early script of the plot for the episode "Prototype" appeared on Gateworld which stated that Khalek was part of Anubis's attempts at creating an army known as the "Mashur". The name Mashur is derived from the Goa'uld world "Mashur-nat" which meant "mutation". His plans for this army was to train them to ascend in order for them to do battle with the Ascended Ancients and destroy them. However, this was cut from the episode.</li>
