If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the Newcomers help page, where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have! Or, you can just type on your user page, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Here are a few good links for newcomers: • The Five Pillars of Wikipedia • How to edit a page • Editing tutorial • Picture tutorial • How to write a great article • Naming conventions • Manual of Style I hope you enjoy editing here and being a Wikipedian! By the way, you can sign your name on Talk and vote pages using three tildes, like this: <a href="../../../a/n/u/User%7EAnubis3_4b68.html" title="User:Anubis3">Anubis3</a>.

Orphaned fair use image (Image:Tom Welling 05.jpg) Thanks for uploading Image:Tom Welling 05.jpg. I notice the 'image' page currently specifies that the image is unlicensed for use on Wikipedia and may only be used on Wikipedia under a claim of fair use. However, the image is currently orphaned, meaning that it is not used in any articles on Wikipedia. If the image was previously in an article, please go to the article and see why it was removed. You may add it back if you think that that will be useful. However, please note that images for which a replacement could be created are not acceptable under fair use (see our fair use policy).</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other unlicensed media, please check whether they're used in any articles or not. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the "my contributions" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box. Note that any fair use images not used in any articles will be deleted after seven days, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. Thank you. Chowbok ☠ 22:39, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

You may add it back if you think that that will be useful. However, please note that images for which a replacement could be created are not acceptable under fair use (see our fair use policy).

Image:Dulé Hill.jpg I have reverted your edit to the Dulé Hill page. Promotional images of actors are only fair use if they are under the characters page and should not be used to illustrate the actual person. Fair use images such as the ones on Brad Pitt or Sean Bean illustrate what is allowed. (Quentin X 13:07, 12 February 2007 (UTC))</p>

Image:Dulé Hill.jpg I have reverted your edit to the Dulé Hill page. Promotional images of actors are only fair use if they are under the characters page and should not be used to illustrate the actual person. Fair use images such as the ones on Brad Pitt or Sean Bean illustrate what is allowed. (Quentin X 13:07, 12 February 2007 (UTC)) • Thanks for the message. I have moved the Sean Connery photo for the same reasons as Dulé Hill. The image on the Sean Bean page is a screenshot, which gives a good example of what can be used in place of a copyrighted photo, whuch is a replaceable free use. The idea of Wikipedia is to keep it as free as possible and to have multiple uses of a single copyrighted image goes against that idea. It would be easy to get a screenshot of Charlie or a photo of Dulé Hill in character on set. The image of David Caruso is a good example of this. I have reverted the page again and would remind you of the three revert rule. Also...</p>
<p><br />
[edit] Image:Dule Hill.jpg I have had a look at the expanded rationale and all it seems to do is extend to the photo as being used on the character's page and not the actors. As such I believe that it is not applicable to the page Dule Hill.</p>
<p>Also, to take up other points that you have made and the relevant questions. As far as screenshots are concerned and the ability to use them in articles when it concerns the roles that actors play rather than promotional pictures, you can liken them to the photocopying of books for educational uses. I am not sure of the law in the U.S. but in the U.K., if it is for educational purposes, you are allowed to photocopy a chapter or 10%, whichever is the greater. That analogy can be used for a screenshot which is a miniscule amount of a copyrighted film.</p>
<p>Secondly, the fact that photos have been used for a long time does not make it right to use them. Jimbo Wales has gone on record as saying that Wikipedia should be as free as possible and that this has not necessarily been the case in the past. Also, this is not a 'single person's' view. Just because you have not come across it in the six months that you have been a registered user under this name does not mean that this process has not been ongoing. I tried, albeit forlornly, to keep an image that I had used for a good three months until I accepted the argument that had been used which is basically, "Can this image be replaced by a different one, while still having the same effect?" If the answer is yes, then the image probably doesn't meet the criteria above and should not be used.". As far as this image is concerned, it can.</p>
<p>Furthermore, and without wanting to bore either of us, the first sign of bad faith was used by yourself when you reverted my edit initially without giving a reason and then did it again when not signed in to your account. (Unless two people at your University have an interest in West Wing actors). Finally, I understand your point about improving articles but if we used that process Wikipedia would be 99% nonsense and no one would use it.</p>
<p>As such I am again reverting the Dule Hill photo, primarily because the first act of bad faith was by yourself. I am also doing this due to the problems with fair use rationale but, as the image is still used in Charlie Young, there is no danger of it being orphaned. If you wish to take this to arbitration then you are more than welcome. (Quentin X 13:43, 14 February 2007 (UTC))</p>
<p>Our Dispute</p>
<p>It appears that, on your part, this issue concerning Dule_Hill.jpg has become a personal one but I would thoroughly and sincerely ask you to refrain from personal attacks. I am merely trying to secure the content of an article which I believe constitutes a fair use.</p>
<p>That having been said, I am not exactly sure how U.K. photocopying laws fits into the picture. Neither cyberspace nor wikipedia is governed by U.K. law but I’m sure that you already know that. Based on the reasoning you provided, every copyrighted photo in the Wikipedia commons should be deleted. Additionally, it is also unfortunate that you see a single revert on my behalf (before discussing with you) as a sign of bad faith. Reverts constitute neither vandalism nor personal attack. However, when a fellow member specifically asks another member not to revert but rather submit the matter to arbitration and the latter ignores this, that can be seen as a sign of bad faith.</p>
<p>To continually extend my good faith, I will, for the time being, hold off on reverting or editing the article Dule Hill. But, at the same time, I would ask you to please try, at least, to replace the image (with what you think constitutes fair use) rather than simply remove it. Thank you.
