	    <p>"anyone lived in a pretty how town" is a famous, and beautiful, poem by e.e. cummings. Except for the 6 people who took this class on the works of George Lucas, I just can't see how categorizing the title of the poem as a "short film" is helpful to anyone. It may be interesting as trivia, but is not worthy of sole mention to the many people who have studied the works of cummings, and those who think this is one of his most moving poems. I'd rather see a page that a) has the poem b) describes the almost obsessive attention this poem receives from scholars and c) includes other examples of how e.e. cummings' work has inspired artists in many mediums, with the Lucas short as one interesting - if not exactly "must see" - piece.</p>
<p>The argument could be made that since cummings never titled his own work, but Lucas did, the actual titling of the page could go to the more official title, and you'd have a point there, but not a great one since in anthologies and text books the first line of cummings works is always used as the title. Obviously, since he is listed as a writer of the short (hilarious thought, right there) it could be inferred that the short was based on the poem. It'd be a hell of a coincidence if it were not. So to have a better description of the poem would actually serve to explain something of the short, until the day someone gets video of it to put online. (hmm, maybe not)</p>
<p>Although I'm not an expert, I would be honored to put something small and basic together until someone more qualified comes along...and include the Lucas info, and any other interesting works people might know of. Not to insult the USC guy (see IMDB profile if you haven't already) I just think it's incorrect to use the title to describe the unseen, unheard-of, and apparently derivative short film instead of the incredible, beloved, and constantly reinterpreted poem. I'd like to see the short mentioned in addition to it, simply because it's relevant to show how cummings' work has inspired others who may be better known (or not, there's always room for more obscure info) and I think that's a great thing about Wikipedia. If that makes me a hair-splitting nitpicker, call me a loser, I guess.</p>
<p>I've never commented on anything in Wikipedia before, in fact I created an account simply to say this, so please forgive me if I did it wrong. I mean no disrespect.</p>
<p>Also: please don't mock the name. I've been "wiki" since my college days, when a classmate with a speech impediment changed "Vicky" into a nickname that just wouldn't unstick. Another classmate changed the spelling ("phonetically" he said) and voila! I've had that name for many, many (hey not that many!) years. I'm okay with sharing it with this encyclopedia, you know, but please don't assume I'm trying to sound authoritative or connected or even some perverse, borrowed "cool" by choosing the name, I'm just too lazy to "unchoose" it and come up with a new one. (Also, I kinda had it first, so I shouldn't have to. Not to be a hypocrite: if there were a page describing the word "wiki" I would not expect to see my picture. That would be insane. I'm the obscure, unseen, unknown one in this example. That's fine by me if it's okay by you. Dig?) Thank you. wikisamWikilicious 02:03, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As someone who is familiar with this poem, I was quite surprised (and a little dismayed) to see it indexed solely as a George Lucas film. I've made changes to reflect the fact that it was a poem by a relevant poet long before Lucas adapted it into an obscure short film. --<a href="../../../j/t/a/User%7EJtalledo_ca0a.html" title="User:Jtalledo">Jtalledo</a> <a href="../../../j/t/a/User_talk%7EJtalledo_8071.html" title="User talk:Jtalledo">(talk)</a> 21:28, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've seperated the page into two sections for the poem and the film. This will allow commentary on either to remain seperate. If the article ever grows in size, a short mention of the film can be given in the introductory paragraph. The infobox for the film should remain seperate from the section on the poem. I've also cleaned up the information on the poem, but we have a long way to go. The article should direct readers to major critical works on the poem. <a href="../../../b/j/a/User%7EBjart_97cb.html" title="User:Bjart">Bjart</a> 20:09, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I feel that the emphasis of the article shouldn't be on the film at all. Lucas' work should be given it's own page, really, so that we don't have to have his giant filmography box at the bottom of a page that should be about a Cummings poem. I propose that the two different mediums currently in this article be seperated into <a href="../../../a/n/y/Anyone_lived_in_a_pretty_how_town.html" title="Anyone lived in a pretty how town">anyone lived in a pretty how town</a> and anyone lived in a pretty how town (film) (or short film). -- <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColumba_livia_8c44.html" title="User:Columba livia">Columba livia</a> 06:18, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Surely quoting the poem in full is a copyright violation?</p>

<p>I've removed it and substituted a link to a site which has the poem and permission to use it Hypnopomp 11:16, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
