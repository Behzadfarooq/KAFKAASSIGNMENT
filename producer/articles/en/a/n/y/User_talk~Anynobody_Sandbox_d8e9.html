<dd><a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO,</a> I'm afraid I still do not agree with your assessment as to the reason for its inclusion. Had her flamewar activity on the Usenet been the core issue, I would agree it should come out, but the core issue of the citation remains one of internet <i>abuse</i>, not flamewars. Her flamewars on the Usenet are not cited as such in the draft article. Schwarz's banning from the SLC libraries was due to the abuse of that facility for spamming, and <i>that</i> is inherently notable, by reason that her actions alone resulted in the blocklisting of large amounts of UEN IP ranges. As previously discussed on the article Talk page, it is not unusual for people to be banned from the use of library privileges; it <i>is</i> notable and unusual however that the action of one user could cause widespread effects upon a State government facility. It is also notable the UEN were at a loss as to how to deal with her internet abuse until the blocklisting was applied. While this issue has no bearing on her FOIA campaigns, it may offer some insight on how she treated these public facilities, which were done in a similar manner to how she treated the court system and the FOIA process. <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a> also stated that he did not agree with the truncation and removal of this section, and <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> has stated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Barbara_Schwarz/Archive_8#Remove_page.3F" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Barbara_Schwarz/Archive_8#Remove_page.3F" rel="nofollow"><i>She is a notable Usenet personality.</i></a> There would appear to be a consensus from contributing editors to support its re-inclusion. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 22:26, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry, but I don't. Why would I want to expend my effort in a fight over here when this is not the article. We know that we have differences. They are not likely to resolve easily as I think they are fundamental differences of understanding of wikipedia basic policies. They will only be resolved on a point-by-point basis by coming to some agreement on what will stand as community consensus and that will likely take a number of visits to the BLP noticeboard but please with a concise question each time and not a bunch of allegations, doubts, suppositions, what-have-you. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 22:23, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You may be right <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a>, the only resolution may be on the <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLPN_8a63.html" title="WP:BLPN">WP:BLPN</a>. However i personally have not given up on this being a big misunderstanding, if so perhaps illustrating the edits we've been talking about may help to make things clearer. Of course you don't have to participate if you don't want to, but I noticed the noticeboard is very backlogged. It could take a while before action is taken. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> if my belief that you are unconsciously trying to keep information you deem to show Scientology in a negative way out of the article is wrong, I am willing to look at proof to the contrary. Understand that it was your general allegations about editors and their agendas as well as how your attitude appears to change when discussing information that doesn't reflect positively on the church that caused my concern. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 22:44, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My attitude changes when I am faced with obvious bigotry, attacks, attempts to marginalize me, and editors that are willing to break any rule here to get as many non-RS slams in against Scientology as they can. Other than that, I am a total pussycat. Witness my dealings with any number of editors and admins here that I have excellent reason to believe are devoted to harming something that I and my loved ones believe in and consider important. But so long as they can control themselves here then I can play nice with them. Obey the rules here and be polite and we will get along fine. Don't and reap what you sow. I do not think that you will find a case where I "started it". But please note that my feelings on this are changing and I am hoping that, as more NPOV editors take an interest in the Scientology articles, that those editors and admins will provide the "social control" needed to restrain the more outrageous actions of the few and I can be more sanguine about it all. Sorry, but I am not interested in proving anything to you. If you cannot figure out what I am about by my words and actions here then I guess you cannot. Or if you think that you already have, then I guess that you do. Think so, that is. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 23:06, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
