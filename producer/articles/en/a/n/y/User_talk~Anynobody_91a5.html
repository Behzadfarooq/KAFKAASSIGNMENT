<dd>Right, and this edit clearly points a COI at him. However the issue of notability is a prime argument in his RfD. The contradiction again: one day she <b>does</b> meet the notability requirement for inclusion - albeit "barely" - but in the RfD statement a short time later, she does not any more? Huh?

<dd>Yeah, I was pretty happy with that as a great comeback but I decided that I did not want to lower myself to the level of "psychoanalysing" my "opponents".

<p><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a>, what you call "psychoanalysing" is something we are all supposed to do if we notice other editors trying to make edits that can't be explained by logic or supported by facts. If a new editor was insisting that L Ron Hubbard was gay, I'd be having similar conversations with him/her concerning a possible anti-CoS POV as the ones I've had with you concerning your pro-CoS POV. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 22:32, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ps, Anynobody, if you want this to stop all you have to do is stop. You are the one driving this. I can tell you that it will not end in any great victory for you so you are really wasting your time. Myself, I am not looking for a "victory". This wastes my time too; I just don't invest as much time in it as you do. I really really suggest that you stop letting your new-found friends egg you on into wasting a lot of effort on attacking me. I don't do anything wrong here. I just respond to the weird attacks on me from others and have some fun while I do so. No big deal to me. Best wishes. Take a break and think about how you want to spend you time in life and your time here. Fixating on me is a total waste, man. This is really friendly advice. Think about it OK? --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 05:17, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let me assure you first and foremost that every action I take here is my own, and it is because I believe you are wrong in this case that I have said what I have said. That is not meant as a bait or an insult, it is simply what I have come to believe regarding you and your motives regarding <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Schwarz_fc5e.html" title="Barbara Schwarz">Barbara Schwarz</a>. What really brought in into focus was your reaction to the volcano on the CoS project userbox, and I will explain why I think that is the key to your COI.</p>
<ul>
<li>I doubt the volcano on the cover of Dianetics offends you when another Scientologist mentions it. It's when anybody who is not a member of or friendly to the CoS does you assume they mean "Xenu and the erupting volcanoes". There is no way your perception could be the same as every Scientologist, otherwise they'd find something else for the cover. I don't blame you for being sensitive, some critics might very well mean "Xenu" when they talk about volcanoes and Scientology. The problem with your view is that there are even more people, some of whom may be future Scientologists, who mean volcano and not space opera. You're essentially assuming everyone who doesn't "like" Scientology is the enemy, and by treating them as such you're actually ensuring that they stay that way.</li>
<li>Regarding Barbara Schwarz, I don't know all the specifics about Scientology but I do know that her existence is somewhat of a paradox. A person as insane as her couldn't have been a Scientologist because she would have been cured, or shouldn't exist. Yet there she is, filing FOIA requests and making herself very visible by saying Hubbard is the son of Ike Eisenhower. I could see where somebody who is sensitive about her creating a negative perception of the CoS would have a problem with it, but the perception of the CoS is irrelevant to Wikipedia because not everybody who reads it cares about Scientology.</li>
</ul>
<p>In regard to stopping, I don't remember asking you to stop discussion in general. I do remember asking you to explain the logic and reasoning you've used to come to your conclusions. I'm still very interested to know. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 08:36, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Couldn't have said it better or more politely myself. Anynobody, very well put points... <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmee_be9e.html" title="User:Smee">Smee</a> 12:09, 15 March 2007 (UTC).
<ul>
<li>(EC - speak of the Smee) I just mention that, for your own reasons, it might be healthier for you to not fixate on me. Watching my edits, collecting "evidence", plotting and planning your next RfC. You are wasting your time. I do nothing wrong here. If you show evidence of stopping your fixation with me then I do not mind discussing anything with you. But so long as you are communicating with other about me then I will know that you are still fixated. So lose the fixation first and we can go from there. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 12:11, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Also Anynobody, I will soon be going on wiki-break or reduced involvement here while I attend to real life issues. You would do well to take my user pages off your watchlist and try to avoid jumping into the middle of any issues that I do address that you would normally not be interested in. In other words, don't go picking a fight with me. If you do that, then, in a bit, when I fully return, you will be in a better frame of mind to address any issues of substance that you might have with me and we can get a 3rd party involved as needed. Later. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 15:19, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have personal matters to attend to I strongly encourage you to deal with them as you see fit. I think you should know that matters do proceed whether you are here or not, so if you make a comment I wish to address I'll go ahead and do it (I just won't expect a response as rapidly as they have been coming). Moreover if this break is similar to your last break where you continued to make edits yet expected me to not address you, I will be treating it the same. (It's my understanding that a Wikibreak means you stop editing or responding to comments because you are away, this explains any delay in responding another editor may experience when sending a message to a person on break.) The impression I got from the last time was you needed a break from dealing with me and a few others while you went on editing and pursuing the AfD. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 03:48, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, I just got your message. So I'm confused, you want to keep the B.S. page or have it deleted? Looking at it, honestly, the only reason it's there is because people who dislike Scientology want to load up wikipedia with as much weird and negative information as they can. That's the only reason. This lady is obviously nuts, and that she has chosen to target Scientology doesn't have anything to do with Scientology, it's just a mentally ill woman's delusions. It just doesn't seem noteable or worth keeping on wikipedia. On a website collecting weird stories about Scientology, yeah, but I don't think it is important enough to put here. We don't make wikipedia pages every time a mentally ill person makes rants,unless its big news or stands out. If you were wanting to keep it, how come?</p>
<p>Where's the image of the volcano that justanother didn't like? I don't care about volcanos and things but I don't find them related to Scientology apart from the cover of Dianetics. I would say using the cover of Dianetics with the volcano makes sense but not a random photo of a volcano, when volcanos have nothing to do with Scientology, apart from that story about Xenu but that really isn't what Scientology is a bout and makes no sense to represent it with a volcano.</p>

<dd>My feelings about spirituality are complicated, but I think I should talk about them to make sure you understand I have no interest in an anti-CoS crusade. Personally I'm <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnostic.html" title="Agnostic">agnostic</a>, and believe people ought to be able to worship as they please so long as they don't hurt anybody while they're doing it. If someone does get hurt, I don't think that a religion should be banned unless said religion advocates hurting people. For example, I don't think any Scientologists meant for <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_McPherson_0813.html" title="Lisa McPherson">Lisa McPherson</a> to die. They were just trying to help her the best way they knew how, and she died. The same thing has happened with other religions since the concept of religion began.</dd>
<dd>I do want to keep <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Schwarz_fc5e.html" title="Barbara Schwarz">Barbara Schwarz</a>, but not because of her relationship with Scientology. I'd honestly be trying to save the article no matter what religion she was affiliated with, because most Americans don't realize that they can use the <a href="../../../f/o/i/FOIA_3838.html" title="FOIA">FOIA</a> too.</dd>
<dd>My beef is with people who believe crap like: A <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controlled_demolition_hypothesis_for_the_collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center_8913.html" title="Controlled demolition hypothesis for the collapse of the World Trade Center">Controlled demolition hypothesis for the collapse of the World Trade Center</a>, the <a href="../../../r/o/s/Roswell_UFO_incident_a78c.html" title="Roswell UFO incident">Roswell UFO incident</a>, or that <a href="../../../a/r/e/Area51.html#UFO_and_other_conspiracy_theories_concerning_Area_51" title="Area51">UFO and other conspiracy theories concerning Area 51</a> are true. They usually try to point out how secretive the government is to make their case. I like to point to Ms. Schwarz as an example that the government really does make good faith efforts to be honest with people (not just U.S. citizens) where national security isn't involved. When security is involved at a time like 1947 when the Roswell incident happened, they'll come clean when the risk has passed. They did lie and say it was a weather balloon, because they didn't want the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> to know that the CIA/NSA/USAAF were developing spy balloons to monitor atmospheric conditions created by a nuclear detonation. In 1947 we knew it was just a matter of time before the USSR tested a nuclear device, and we couldn't count on them to be open about it. The balloons of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Mogul_a4c1.html" title="Project Mogul">Project Mogul</a> were supposed to tell us instead. If the Soviets knew that, they'd just shoot down the balloons, so there was no way the government was going to tell the truth at the time. Now that the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> is over, thanks to the <a href="../../../f/o/i/FOIA_3838.html" title="FOIA">FOIA</a> the real story is now available. Which goes back to Ms. Schwarz, would a secretive government waste so much time addressing the claims of a person with unusual beliefs? (I honestly wish her ideas had nothing to do with the CoS, it would make things so much easier for me.)</dd>
<dd>The volcano question was prompted because <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> seems to think people not affiliated with the CoS are being offensive by talking about the volcano and symbology that might be related to it. By not affiliated I mean anyone who isn't a member no matter what their feelings are, I'm neutral on whether the CoS is a good or bad thing. (I thought it was supposed to represent a person's unlocked potential exploding after reading Dianetics, in a good way. I remember seeing a commercial about the book in the 80's and thought that was what it was, a self help guide to tap hidden potential.) <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 02:42, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Yeah, that's what it is to me as well, just a good symbol to represent what it's like doing Scientology stuff, I don't think it's for any of that weird Xenu stuff.</p>
<p>I don't know, but it seems to me like the Barbara Schwarz page was created for the reason I said before, and the government, FBI, whatever, was really suspicious and interested in Scientology, I think they stole documents and did all kinds of things (which is why they did the same thing back I believe), i don't think any of that means anything, the government were wrong and just needed to chill out and if some lady like Barbara Schwarz was saying nutso stuff, and they're already paranoid about Scientology, they won't be ignoring it. I don't think it needs a page, especially when it just makes me religion look even weirder for nothing that has to do with my religion. It reminds me of having my parents embarrass me and not being able to have any control in that. I don't think Scientology should have to have this crazy lady's named tied to them, it's not right, imo. ttyl <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnpedia_28d7.html" title="User:Johnpedia">Johnpedia</a> 16:17, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm sorry it took so long to respond here, thinking of the best way to convey my displeasure of having to advocate an article about a person who is embarrassing to the CoS but doing so anyway is hard. And then it occured to me, I have a Barbara Schwarz of my own, <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madalyn_Murray_O%27Hair_b35f.html" title="Madalyn Murray O'Hair">Madalyn Murray O'Hair</a>. I'm <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnostic.html" title="Agnostic">agnostic</a> but that often gets me lumped in with <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">atheism</a> and forced to explain this...person. She was everything most atheists are NOT, and I'd rather her and her family be forgotten. I can't logically back that up because beneath my contempt for her I know she is notable. (If for no other reason than the fact that she was murdered by a former office manager she hired). Seriously, Ms Schwarz has taken craziness to new levels by bogging down courts with her...issues. There's a quote from a movie that fits here if you substitute crazy for dumb,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look, mister, there's... two kinds of dumb, uh... guy that gets naked and runs out in the snow and barks at the moon, and, uh, guy who does the same thing in my living room. First one don't matter, the second one you're kinda forced to deal with.</p>

<p>I'm still interested in the RfC. I honestly think several outside views are needed, but don't want to give the impression I'm unwilling to explore other avenues to get those views.</p>
<p>I honestly don't think you've been baiting or fighting with <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a>, even though he chooses to call it that. It seemed to me that you were just trying to hold him accountable for his actions, albeit in a slightly aggressive way. I think when the entire history comes out, most people will feel similar. If you're afraid of baiting <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> here, I don't think that applies since he isn't actually an invited participant of this discussion. He can certainly continue to comment, but he can't accuse you of baiting him by discussing how to best bring his behavior to the communities attention on my talk page. If, however, we were discussing this on <i>his</i> talk page...I could see where <i>that</i> might be called baiting because expecting him to not respond would be stupid. So please, don't hesitate to comment or point out actions on his part that I may not notice (like the recent odd commentary you noticed, even though I didn't do anything I found the notice helpful&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 01:33, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually I remember you asked me not to post about your religion, which is the heart of the COI matter I was trying to address with you. Of course I could be wrong, but you didn't provide a diff. In the future, would you mind including diffs or proof that I am misrepresenting you? There are two reasons for this: 1) I make it a point to include proof when I point out instances of your specific misrepresentations so you know I'm not making baseless allegations, this goes both ways. 2) Making accusations without some kind of proof is at best an failure of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and at worst a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, which gives me even more proof for a RfC of your inappropriate behavior. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 02:38, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are different kinds of stress with different sources and different reactions. But certainly you see that "germs" did not "cause" the illness. The germs are always with us. But, Anynobody, I do not want to discuss much of anything with you until we settle any outstanding issues. So this was a "freebie" since I had mentioned it to Jossi because I felt bad that you were ill and I had not taken definite action to resolve our dispute. If Jossi does not want to try then I will ask someone else. Or you can. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 05:16, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you anyway for the freebie, I appreciate the explanation. To assuage any bad feelings you may have had, I can honestly say you are not a source of stress for me. I was concerned in the beginning that perhaps my opinions were insulting to Scientologists in general, since discussing it with some others a few weeks ago the worry is gone.</p>
<p>Please understand that what I am about to say is not meant as a bait or an insult. I think if you ask one of your friends about what I am about to say they will probably agree I have a point. Your behavior has taken away a lot of potential stress, I don't mean to sound like a jerk but you really illustrate the issues I've brought up much better than I could. It's why I'm not trying to interfere with your attempts with <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">Jossi</a>, you are literally making my case for me. I say this because my conscience won't let me watch you self destruct without mentioning it as a warning. I think similar behavior on your part also affected you on the AfD page, when you seemed to go out of your way to comment on every keep vote. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 05:41, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand your position <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a>, as I've said before though I'd like to hear from more than one third party who doesn't know either of us. I can accept any errors I might have made, so I want the most neutral review possible. If I ask one specific third party, I'm going to feel like I'm asking a friend to back me up which I find inherently compromises the neutrality of the process. Seeing the comments of the many editors who added their input to the AfD convinced me that community involvement is the way to go here, I just don't understand why you have such a huge problem with that.

<p>I have one small piece of constructive criticism, and it should only be taken as a suggestion. (I hate making criticism) When you are addressing improper behavior on his part it may be helpful to imagine him as an angry child. If you are "short" with him, it could portray you in a negative way to anyone who is unfamiliar with his past behavior, and earn him unwitting allies. If you explain to him what he is doing like an understanding parent it makes you look "better" because you aren't: 1) Engaging him on his "level" and you are 2) Setting an example, which makes his attacks look even worse. It gets repetitive, but it can prevent a similar misunderstanding such as <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShenme_67cd.html" title="User:Shenme">Shenme</a> and <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a> recently had.(<a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a> said <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> should be banned on the Schwarz AfD. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShenme_67cd.html" title="User:Shenme">Shenme</a> thought <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a> was being hostile).</p>

<li><i>I sympathize with your plight.

<dd>Hello <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnpedia_28d7.html" title="User:Johnpedia">Johnpedia</a>, I'm not saying the CoS or Landmark are only about money, but they both do require payment to advance so it is something they share in common (they also both have vocal critics). It's interesting to me because Scientology is anti-psychology and groups like Landmark (especially when it was est) attempt to apply psychology in their methods. I'm surprised I couldn't find much about how Scientology views groups like that, can you point me to some? (I'm not saying either is right or wrong, but I'm interested in how they appear to be polar opposites). <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 03:02, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm told that the money goes to keep the church running, so I don't know. They say nobody profts off of it, etc. and the FBI cleared them on all of that. And Scientology is anti-psychiatry , not anti-pyschology. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnpedia_28d7.html" title="User:Johnpedia">Johnpedia</a> 04:17, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I might be confused, so please correct me if I'm wrong. I know that Scientology has problems with the drugs and electro-shock therapy that psychiatrists authorized to proscribe. It was my understanding that psychiatrists and psychologists are both trained in the same type of talk therapy, but psychiatrists also receive training about drugs. I hadn't ever heard Scientology endorse going to a psychologist, so I figured they disagreed with their approach too.</p>
<p>Do you know if Scientology has an opinion of people like <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Newman_ad8f.html" title="Fred Newman">Fred Newman</a>? <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 04:37, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. Can I, in all good faith, suggest you withdraw from RfA. I do not believe you will be successful and a graceful withdrawal will show you in good light when you run again in a while. I think you have the makings of a great admin; just not yet. --<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 11:44, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hello, <a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> I was just about to respond on the talk page to general concerns about inexperience. Thank you for your comment, honestly it gave me pause because I had grave concerns about it myself. I can not deny a part of me agrees with you, but a greater part wants me to let the RfA run it's course and I'll explain why. We really are backlogged in several categories, I know it sounds like high drama to say "I just want to clear the backlog!" but I've had a couple of proposals and questions become backlogged. (I'm not trying to resolve those specific issues myself, but while making my case I couldn't help noticing some other issues that I could solve). I recently read <a href="../../../a/d/m/WP%7EADMIN_f0df.html#No_big_deal" title="WP:ADMIN">Jimbo on Admins...No Big Deal</a>, and thought well "That's great Jimbo, but how are you going to make sure we don't end up with a bunch of bad administrators?". Then it occurred to me he probably meant the community won't tolerate them, since everyone more or less as a say. I truly think allowing the community to hold me accountable mitigates much of the risk involved, vs how much work I could do.</dd>
<dd>I also want to explain that I'm not saying I'm the only exception either, there are probably other editors around my tenure that could be doing more to help if given the chance. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 12:18, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I understand what you're saying, but having participated in a fair amounts of RfAs, I'd be utterly utterly gobsmacked if even the ultimate editor in the world, with no skeletons in their cupboard was approved so soon after starting. Oh, and while I'm here, a word of advice. A look at your edit history shows that you rarely leave an edit summary. Change your personal settings so that Wikipedia prompts you if you omit a summary. Two reasons: a) edit summaries are useful (and courteous) b) I've seen people get oppose&#160;!votes at RfA just for having poor edit summary stats. Cheers, --<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 15:40, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I agree with Dweller; I've watched enough RfAs to know that yours isn't going pass this time. It might demonstrate maturity to not drag it out. I do think you should try again later (three months seems to be what many people expect as a minimum of time between RfAs). <span style="white-space: nowrap">â€” <a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant: small-caps">l</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan">acan</a></span> â€” 23:06, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think you both are probably right in that I won't be approved, and I further agree with you that it would be far better for my prospects to withdraw and file again later. I'm interested in resolving a contradiction about how the community really perceives administrators. I realize this may be close to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> but I can't reconcile <a href="../../../a/d/m/WP%7EADMIN_f0df.html#No_big_deal" title="WP:ADMIN">No Big Deal</a> with the actual attitude of many editors while backlogs accumulate.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is free of cost in financial terms, but in order for it to work like it should there are tasks that must be done that are boring, thankless, and unpleasant. In certain areas, these tasks are not getting done. Since I enjoy editing here I feel it would be selfish to not at least offer my help.</p>
<p>Also, even if I get no more support I'll still have the opportunity to get constructive feedback. Such as <a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller's</a> observation about my use of edit summaries which I agree with for the most part. There are plenty of minor edits where I could've used the edit summary, and I will work on making more use of it. However there are a few instances when I intentionally don't use it. I find an edit summary on talk pages can cause problems if the edit summary is either too direct or too ambiguous, and can cause people to ignore the edit itself. I also don't attempt one if I've made significant changes to an article that are better explained on the talk page. In cases like that I'll remember to leave a see talk comment.</p>
<p>I really appreciate the advice, and your time. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 23:39, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you, that is very useful actually. I was seriously afraid the support would be much lower. Are there other tools for similar proposal type articles?

<p>I'm not speaking for the church, I don't know exactly what the stance is, but my feelings and from what I've heard and seen and learnt, psychology isn't necessarily damaging, it CAN lead people in the wrong direction at times, it can make a lot of mistakes, it might not understand how people really work as it should, it could be a big waste of money for what you're getting, but it doesn't really damage the person. We don'[t like psychiatry because it damages people, it ruins them, it makes things so much worse, to mess a person up so much that they don't know what is what so they're not on the same playing field as they were and as they should be , where they had a problem to begin with. Psychiatrists do all kinds of things to a person's body to affect the mental aspect. For some reason, I don't know why, some of the sickest people go into psychiatry. For fun, go to ratemds.com and read the reviews of psychiatrsts in any state or province, so many of them say the same basic thing, and most of them are awful reviews, and some sound like they were written by the person they're supposed to be reviewing. I've seen and met some psychaitrsts and they are the scariest people, there's no humanity in them, it's awful being around them. So Scientology is really opposed to it, but psychology, no no, if somebody is going to a thearpist to talk about things and they're feeling better, awesome! good for them! like talking to a friend, getting relief from it, etc. Psychiatrists don't even do much of that, they're pill prescribers and all those awful surgeries. They're not going to last, either, most people are so weary of them, but they've tried to create this idea that they know what they're doing and they have answers, when they don't, they have such smug arrogant attitudes and that's all they have, so I can't wait for the day when it's completely gone and everyone realizes what it really is. Sorry for the rant, it's just a topic I'm, passionate about. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnpedia_28d7.html" title="User:Johnpedia">Johnpedia</a> 04:41, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To address the last part first, you didn't sound like you were ranting. I generally agree with your assessment that many doctors (but not just psychiatrists) are essentially licensed drug dealers. I've seen it in general MDs, a cardiologist, and a couple of dentists so it wouldn't surprise me in the least to find out that some of them just prescribe meds and nothing more.</dd>
<dd>I also agree that psychology won't work for everyone and could make things worse, but it's important to remember that can happen with any medical treatment (mental health or physical). For example a person allergic to Penicillin would have a whole new set of problems if he/she got a shot of it to cure an infection. I guess my point is that there is no one cure all, and that's why I think people ought to have their choice of treatment. (You sound like you feel that way too, which is why I don't see your post as a rant.) I'll take a look at ratemds.com and finish my thoughts a little later. Thanks for responding, I was starting to worry I had offended you. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 05:32, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The <a href="http://www.ratemds.com" class="external text" title="http://www.ratemds.com" rel="nofollow">ratemds.com site</a> gave me 26 listings for psychiatrists in Arizona (which is where I live). I have to say they really don't look that bad, 15 good ratings, 2 average ratings, 3 bad ratings, and 6 unrated. The three who have bad ratings appear to be conflicts of personality. For example one of them has 1 good and 2 bad ratings, the other two felt they were being ignored by the doctor.</dd>

<p>Hey, read the ones in British Columbia (switch to Canada to view provinces) they're pretty scary to read. I don't think California had good reviews either. I think when it's a self-help, mental/spiritual health profession and area, you have to be very very very careful. If you break your arm, you get it set in a cast, it's not a very tricky thing, but if someone is hearing voices or having delusions, that's a really complicated area and it's just.....so different from anything else, the whole mental health thing, you can make people crazy if you don't know what you're doing, you can really screw people up, so I'm a little more iffy about psychologists then medical doctors (except I dont think Id be too happy to have surgery or anything major). p.s. have u read Dianetics? (i just started re-reading it) read it if you havent! i want to know what you think of it. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnpedia_28d7.html" title="User:Johnpedia">Johnpedia</a> 03:45, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I totally agree with you, extreme care must be taken when treating someone for mental health issues. Considering how much damage a doctor who wants to hurt people can do, like <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Shipman_a6d7.html" title="Harold Shipman">Dr. Harold Shipman</a>, a mental health practitioner out to hurt people could cause their patient to go on a killing spree or something. I just don't think any one way is right for everyone, for example I think a lot of drugs like <a href="../../../a/d/d/Adderall.html" title="Adderall">Adderall</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prozac.html" title="Prozac">Prozac</a> get perscribed way too often for any problem that looks like <a href="../../../a/d/h/ADHD_4f6a.html" title="ADHD">ADHD</a> or <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depression_%28mood%29.html" title="Depression (mood)">depression</a>, especially in kids. For some there might very well be a better way and for their health's sake they should have other options. It's important to remember that there are people who are really helped by medication, so going the other way and eliminating all drugs would hurt them. Unfortunately I don't know where the middle ground is in these cases.</dd>
<dd>I haven't read Dianetics, self help books really aren't my cup of tea in general. When you're done though would you mind letting me know if my idea about the volcano on the cover representing the reader's untapped potential exploding (in a good way) is true? I never got an answer from <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> if I was correct or not.

<dd>I personally don't think anything you said was unforgivable, and I could see where stress was probably the factor responsible given how you usually conduct yourself (as proven by the positive comments). To sum up my feelings; bad news = you made a couple of minor mistakes good news = you already know this and are doing something about not repeating them. I notice a lot of comments about incivility, the best way to handle those IMHO is to make it clear that you learned from the times when stress got the better of you. By that I mean don't let it happen again and the in next RfA take time to devote a section to saying something like: "I have allowed myself to edit in the past when perhaps I shouldn't have. I was experiencing a lot of stress in real life and was trying to relieve it by editing. Instead all I did was cause myself and the community more stress by losing my temper and being uncivil. Long story short, I found something else to relieve stress and won't make that mistake again." As long as you've kept up your usual behavior, neutral people will understand it was not who you usually are.</dd>
<dd>As to how you resolve disputes, I think you have the right ideas toward conflict resolution. Do you have any examples not on the RfA? The reason I ask is that one isn't so much resolving a dispute as defending one's position in an RfA for oneself. Preferably one where you got two other editors to agree? <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 01:50, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, recently I was a major part of resolving a dispute at <a href="../../../t/n/a/Talk%7ETNA_Impact%21_2dc6.html" title="Talk:TNA Impact!">Talk:TNA Impact!</a>, with TJ Spyke again ironically. There are no hard feelings, which is how it should be. I mentioned in the RfA that "Wikibreaks are invaluable." That was my way of trying to say that I know that I shouldn't have been editing then, and I won't edit at times like that in the future. I'm not very good at defending myself, and I have always known that. I don't choose correct wordings, spend enough time on things that warrant a large response, and I fall for the either/or trick far too often, as I did with Prodego at first. I'm not saying that he tricked me intentionally, as he wouldn't have anything to gain by tricking me out of my adminship, but I tried to give him an excuse because he asked for one rather than admit that there is no excuse for that type of behavior, and try to explain that I have changed until it was too late. To this day I don't believe that I could have proved it, as I don't know of any way to prove a negative. I am simply useless in that type of situation. Obviously I get that I have done things that were wrong in the past, and I am making an effort to fix what I haven't already, but I don't know how to say that correctly when the pressure is on. -- <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Hybrid_70ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Hybrid"><font color="blue">The</font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hybrid_f2fa.html" title="User:The Hybrid"><font color="red">Hyb</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Hybrid_f91f.html" title="User talk:The Hybrid"><font color="green">rid</font></a></b> 02:13, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"I theorize that some people aren't smart enough to understand an apology unless it's very specific." Ha, I was just talking with a friend of mine, he has a habit of filling in the blanks when I, or anyone else, isn't absurdly specific, how unfortunate it is that being so specific has become necessary. Some people just can't seem to fill small blanks in on their own. Anyway, I agree with you about some of them wanting to see the person squirm.

<dd>I haven't really decided yet. I know that Wikipedia needs admins, but I would really like to put some extreme distance between my next RfA and the last one. By looking at past RfAs, 6 months appears to be the magic number in terms of having one's past RfAs and actions disregarded by the majority of voters. Someone who was desysopped by the Arb Com for wheel warring was able to get his admin powers back simply by waiting and working for 6 months! That is really encouraging to me.

<p>Thanks for your message. I'm afraid I see things rather differently. Your original intention doesn't sway me one way or the other. What does sway me is the fact that someone is clearly uncomfortable and embarrassed by your actions and you make it clear that you simply do not care.</p>
<p>As I said in my RfA comment, I could never support a candidate who seems to enjoy baiting other editors. And the fact that you refuse to remove the text and claim that you see nothing wrong with your actions confirms, for me, that you are not currently suitable for adminship. I also note that Justanother isn't the only person you are doing this to. If you were to change your attitude and remove the trolling on your user page, I would be willing to reconsider in a few months time, but otherwise I'll be a permanent "no thanks"&#160;!vote. People who have such little regard for their fellow editors just aren't worth risking the tools on. You can tell <i>much</i> more about a person by how they treat their adversaries than you can by how they treat their friends. Your treatment of Justanother makes me concerned about how you will behave towards other editors if you are given the tools. I note that you state you would be open to recall. Recall is non-binding and depends entirely on the integrity of the admin being recalled and so unfortunately that does not reassure me at all.</p>
<p>As far as the text on your userpage goes, you seem to think that it is okay because you don't identify the editor by name. However, one edit back in the page history identifies them. And I note that in that edit you confess that you put it on your userpage for entertainment value. As you tell Justanother above, everyone makes mistakes. You made a mistake when you decided to put trollish material on your userpage for your own entertainment.I can see no valid reason for you to maintain these comments. They are wholly disruptive and of no benefit to the encyclopedia. Please remove it. <b><a href="../../../s/a/r/User_talk%7ESarah_9956.html" title="User talk:Sarah">Sarah</a></b> 11:28, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You honestly seem like a fair editor and I truly understand why it might appear that way to you, but there are a few facts you may have overlooked which I'd like to present. Please understand that I don't mean to sound like I'm interrogating you, but I have several questions to ask you. I'm asking because you could very well be correct, and if you are I want to learn from any mistakes I've made.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I really thought identifying him would be holding him up to ridicule, but I also thought that the comment itself was an example of a personal attack. Many editors would have their feelings hurt if they were on the receiving end of those remarks, would you agree? I personally feel that editors should learn to look at PAs as merely a sign that their arguments must be working, because the other person obviously can't disprove them. Would you agree with that? It's easy to give advice, but I think it means more if the adviser can show they practice what they preach. At the same time it's important that the example not cause undue grief to the person who said it. If you take a look at the page as it was before he edited: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Anynobody&amp;oldid=118648609" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Anynobody&amp;oldid=118648609" rel="nofollow">at this point there was no reference in the history</a> for further proof <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Anynobody&amp;oldid=116982250" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Anynobody&amp;oldid=116982250" rel="nofollow">please see the page as it appeared when I added it</a>, his name was left out from the beginning. Would you agree that I was trying to balance a lesson to others with the privacy of the editor in question?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Everybody says things they regret, and usually want to forget them but sometimes there are lessons that can be learned. As a rule people don't deserve to have their mistakes brought up to them again and again. In such cases it seems that the perfect balance is to teach the lesson without hurting anyone involved. When he added his username he may have been intentionally sabotaging the privacy I tried to afford him because he seems smart enough to realize by editing, he's announcing his identity.</dd>

<dd>In the US last year something very similar happened to a <a href="../../../d/e/a/DEA_995b.html" title="DEA">DEA</a> agent who was videotaped shooting himself while demonstrating gun safety at a school. The video got out, and people both laughed and learned that handling a gun can be dangerous. That is probably not what he wanted to be known for of course, but it seems like a valid point to make about gun safety. It also happened to be hilarious because 1) He wasn't severely injured (if I remember it's the first thing he said after the gun discharged) and just moments before he spent a good 15 - 20 seconds talking about how dangerous the weapon is. He actually said "I'm the only one certified to handle this weapon..." <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0411061foot1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0411061foot1.html" rel="nofollow">then proceeded to shoot himself in the foot holstering it.</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The problem as you can see by the link, was made somewhat worse when he put his name out in public by suing the government for not suppressing the video. Granted a few people knew him personally, so he probably would never have heard the end of it from them. In trying to right a perceived wrong, he's now ensured that someone might recognize his name when they see/hear it. Would you agree that the video is more important than his embarrassment? Would you also agree that the video shouldn't include his name, and maybe pixelize his face to protect his privacy? Finally, would you agree that because he made people aware of his name the video should still be available?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The point is that he has nobody to blame for shooting himself in the foot but himself. As it just so happened he illustrated his lesson more than he intended, and as long as an active attempt to identify him isn't made it's still a valid lesson. I'm not sure if any of these arguments have swayed your opinion of whether or not I was trolling, so if they haven't I don't want to take up much more of your time. My last point is simply a functional one, if I really wanted to bait him into something why leave it on my user page rather than making a post on his talk page or bringing it up in our frequent debates? I thought baiting was going out and looking for ways to embarrass him. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 00:06, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have a question about that, I'm not saying that it should be reopened or anything but there were still a few days left (I think until 3 April 2007). I agree the prospects at the time you removed it didn't look good, but I thought the idea was to see how many votes there are in the end? If not, why is there a time limit and what is the point where it's determined a failure? <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a> says
<blockquote>
<p>Bureaucrats may also use their discretion to close nominations early, if a promotion is unlikely and they see no further benefit in leaving the application open.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>But 72 hours to go seems premature.</p>

<dd>Ummm... RFA is not a vote. If the outcome is clear (in this case clearly failing), we can remove it. There's no point in keeping a failing RFA for the sake of accumulating votes. It's a waste of everybody's time and bandwidth.

<dd>I guess I must not have been clear, I understand it was failing and don't dispute that at all. My questions were why is there a time limit and what is the point where it's (a RFA like mine was) determined a failure?</dd>

<ul>
<li>If a an amount of time is designated for the community to weigh in on something, until the time expires anything can happen. (Please understand I'm not saying that was definitely going to happen in my case, but nobody knows that 20 editors won't offer support tomorrow either.</li>

<dd>Also, and I must say I've wondered this about <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> also, why are the comments tallied and grouped by support/oppose/neutral yet not called a vote?
