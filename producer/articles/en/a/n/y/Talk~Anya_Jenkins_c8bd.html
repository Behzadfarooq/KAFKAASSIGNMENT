<p>This article currently states that Aud is from Norway, but I don't recall seeing anything in <i>Buffy</i> that makes that clear. The caption for "Selfless" says "Sjornjost, 880 A.D.", but I've not been able to find anything that pinpoints where "Sjornjost" might be. <a href="http://www.expedia.com/pub/agent.dll?qscr=mmfn" class="external text" title="http://www.expedia.com/pub/agent.dll?qscr=mmfn" rel="nofollow">Expedia's world topographic maps</a>, which are the best source I've found yet for finding obscure towns outside the U.S., knows of no Sjornjost. I suspect such a name, during the <a href="../../../v/i/k/Viking_Age_00e7.html" title="Viking Age">Viking Age</a>, could be found not only in modern-day Norway, but Sweden, Finland, Denmark, various parts of Germany, Britain, and Iceland, if not further. Does anyone have a canonical Buffy reference or reasonable real-world argument for Norway? —&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a> <a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 19:34, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The person who added 'Norway' did so because the actors are speaking Norwegian (see the page history). But I guess if you want to get super-technical, did Norway exist as an entity in the 8th century...? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Singing_Badger_db89.html" title="User:The Singing Badger">The Singing Badger</a> 21:56, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, I forgot that they were speaking a real Scandanavian tongue. I also don't recall (having just listened the DVD commentary last week) if they'd mentioned which language, but Norwegian would make sense — except, of course, that it didn't exist then. I think <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Norse_cc89.html" title="Old Norse">Old Norse</a> would have been more appropriate, but that's getting <i>really</i> picayune! (I love it when a TV show goes to the trouble of accurately rendering foreign languages, and <i>Buffy</i> did that quite a bit, usually with decent results. Far be it from me to discourage that practice!)</dd>

<p>Just to add in my two cents here, I beleive Sjornjost is a Swedish town. About fifteen minutes into the episode, Olaf is turned into a troll and the town chase him away. A blonde woman in perfect Swedish yells out it is the biggest troll shes ever seen. It was definately not Norwegian (being Norwegian myself). So unless she was just a Swedish tourist roaming around Norwegian villages, chances are the rest of them are also trying to speak swedish. (hard to understand them.) whether or not Sjornjost actually ever existed in real life remains to be proven.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 87.115.228.175 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_87.115.228.175_df4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/87.115.228.175">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>In the commentary for the episode, it was mentioned that the lines were originally going to be dubbed over, but the actors decided to go for it and read them in the Ancient Norse.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 151.197.64.207 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_151.197.64.207_9eef.html" title="Special:Contributions/151.197.64.207">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>For what it's worth, I met Joss at a benefit event last year and asked him some Olaf-related questions, since that character was a favorite of mine; he said that the language in this episode was Swedish. <a href="../../../d/s/a/User%7EDSatz_5148.html" title="User:DSatz">DSatz</a> 15:41, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>For some reason, I have been under the impression that Anya's fear of bunnies goes back to when she and Olaf had a rabbit farm, and the rabbits reproduced out of control. Another possible theory is that because of the high reproductive rate, she decided to give away rabbits to the townspeople, for goodwill, but that this backfired. Is this at all correct? Is it explained clearly in the series? <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaver1ck_a90f.html" title="User:Maver1ck">Maver1ck</a> 10:53, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selfless_%28Buffy_episode%29_8dca.html" title="Selfless (Buffy episode)">Selfless</a>, they do show Anya with bunnies, unafraid. It's likely that her fear sprouts from something to do with these particular bunnies, but no, it's not specifically explained. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoopydance_737e.html" title="User:Snoopydance">Snoopydance</a> 01:37, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We could probably do with finding some way to mention the confusion over the surname; she was given the surname Emerson by the writers of the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunnydale_High_Yearbook_623a.html" title="Sunnydale High Yearbook">Sunnydale High Yearbook</a>, gave <i>herself</i> the name Jenkins in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Checkpoint_%28Buffy_episode%29_c72f.html" title="Checkpoint (Buffy episode)">Checkpoint</a> and described herself as "Anya lame-ass-made-up-maiden-name Harris" in a flashback in <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selfless_%28Buffy_episode%29_8dca.html" title="Selfless (Buffy episode)">Selfless</a> (almost certainly a flashback to <a href="../../../o/n/c/Once_More%2C_With_Feeling_%28Buffy_episode%29_f23b.html" title="Once More, With Feeling (Buffy episode)">OMWF</a>)... <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinitawowi_fe97.html" title="User:Kinitawowi">Kinitawowi</a> 00:38, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ever notice how she always says/does the wrong things for a situation, talks obsessively about the same topics time after time (Xander, vengeance, bunnies, sexual intercourse), speaks pedantically, and is clearly socially impaired? Could it be that Anya has Asperger's/an autistic disorder? And considering how in <i>Buffy</i> witchcraft is a metaphor for being ignored et al, it does not take a huge amount of imagination to link being a demoness-come-human flung into the mortal realm without anything resembling a clue on how to act, to the autistic spectrum. And I should know - I have Asperger's myself. <a href="../../../n/p/_/User%7ENP_Chilla_8285.html" title="User:NP Chilla">NP Chilla</a> 15:53, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>So do I. Hmmm. I see definite similarities, but there would have to be some official statement that it was a metaphor. Noneofyourbusiness 00:03, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Speaking as a woman with <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asperger%27s_Syndrome_18a6.html" title="Asperger's Syndrome">Asperger's Syndrome</a> myself, I have to say that personally Anya totally seems to have it, and when I'm trying to explain Asperger's to people I often use her as an example because to me she's the best TV representation of the condition I've ever seen, including shows where characters were <i>officially</i> diagnosed with the condition. But yes, this information unfortunately would count as speculation unless there was an official source to back it up. Perhaps it would be appropriate to add to the Trivia section that her personality quirks closely match those of a person with (relatively) higher functioning Asperger's Syndrome? By the way, I wouldn't say socially <i>impaired</i> myself, she seems more to have the same traits with that that I do - certain social conventions I just don't get/understand, and certain ones I <i>do</i> get but choose to ignore because they seem pointless and an utter waste of time to me. Mostly I (like her) get along with my life absolutely fine, I'm just....perhaps noticably quirky to some people. <a href="../../../x/m/o/User%7EXmoogle_0a50.html" title="User:Xmoogle">Xmoogle</a> 18:44, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Comic book "Spike: Old Times" includes that Halfrek was "on the job" at the time, so should this retcon note be removed?
