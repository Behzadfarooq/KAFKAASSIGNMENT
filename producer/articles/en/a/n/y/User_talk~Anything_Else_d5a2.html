<p><s>I think everything you put down there is an awesome idea! You just listed all the things that I wish were in the game when I play it. I own the PS2 Black edition, and I gotta say, I wish rockport were bigger. I wish there was a day to night cycle. I wish the weather cycles would be more realistic. And most of all: i wish there was online play. you know what would be sweet: to set up a huge online free roam police chase where players controlled a few racers AND the players controlled the cops! So were you thinking of doing this all by yourself or were you saying you wanted EA to do it. Cause it seems like a big project for you to do by yourself. But just wanted to let you know I think that you have a great Idea. I hope you get this message!&#160;:)</s> <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipeedio_5ef0.html" title="User:Wikipeedio">Wikipeedio</a> 03:52, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><s>== Here is a long message for you. (I know you're gonna love it)&#160;:) ==</s></p>
<p><s>From: <a href="../../../a/n/y/Anything_Else_0bca.html" title="Anything Else">Anything Else</a> (a.k.a the professional driver and the protagonist)</s></p>
<p><s>My favorite goal is to become king of video games, and I don't do this by myself, but I can be their assistant so I can make the graphics vivider and get more cars from Need For Speed: Underground series. I hope I can tell them to make the 600MB Memory Card for the PlayStation 2 like they did on the PSP like the 512mb of the Memory Stick Duo, as a special offer. I don't know if I go to Missouri to create the Need For Speed: Most Wanted Gold Edition. I just hope I can get enough money to get there and give hope for PlayStation 2 fans. That means, only 2 consoles like PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360. And thats not all, I got to tell them to make the game that it can change music by pressing R3 (on the PlayStation 2) and pressing the... uhhh... oh, man... I forgot how does the music change on the Xbox 360. And like the title on press "START" button, like the one with the heavy modified vehicle thats on the title screen, it'll be also come out on your own vehicle, but it randomizes to pick. Like the courses from Burnout Revenge, I got to make the city bigger enough so it'll be like point-to-point (also A to B or B to A in reverse). The Road Rage from Burnout Revenge might still remain here, and when the police spots you, the music is not going to change as in interrupt your gameplay. The damage from the Xbox 360 version of Burnout Revenge might still be here, but when you go to the garage, it auto-repairs, so you got no problem at all. It might feature more muscle cars, exotics, roadsters, SUVs, Trucks (not minivans because I think they are non-customizable vehicles, especially exotic vehicles, which can only change paints, rims, dimensions and so on), Coupés, Motorcycles, Choppers and Compact cars. The biker can get ragdolled after getting taken down, but you can still use a bike to perform aftertouch. You can transfer weight to your both Motorcycle and the Chopper (not a helicopter), but pull up too much wheelies and you'll get taken down. It'll feature like Eliminator and the still here Lap Knockout. Some Endurance Races may require 12,000 or more bounties to display and Endurance Race. And making a full use on both consoles, the players will create their own blacklist as a clan so the limit here is up to 50 blacklists. Also, when you hit the spike strips, you don't get busted, you get taken down, but you can activate the "Crashbreaker" from Burnout Revenge to not only to take down your rivals, but to take down the cops as well. When the damaged traffic hits one of your teammates, it's not going to happen. Instead, it gets their paints scraped off. During online gaming, it can offer voice chat so once you're taken down, and when there is a team on your side coming straight at you, tell them to either look out or ("get out of the way, I'm going to activate the Crashbreaker). If one of your teammates is aftertouched by you, you might lose your nitrous, especially when they got blown up by one of your crashbreakers. The teamwork is simple. You can name the team name and also to set the color on the position numbers. it'll be up to six players online, because this time, it will not be up to 4 opponents, it'll be up to 6 opponents. The heat level might remain in the game, but Seargant Cross from Need For Speed: Most Wanted is'nt going to stand a chance against the toughest rivals, even if he is a skilled driver. The pursuit breakers might remain in the free roam, but the signature takedowns will be here. It'll be more cities, but you start out In Rockport, which will have bigger maps and will offer transportaion to go like this one: (Central Route, Lone Peak, White Mountain, Angel Valley, Eternal City, Sunshine Keys, Motor City and Eastern Bay! That means, the bigger the cities, the more and better events have.) The credits only display it on the "Options" menu so you could see who made it. And on "My Cars" selection will be here and you can still customize it. Burnout Revenge cars are the only ones who cannot be modified. The money remains in the game, but it can offer more performance, more visuals and more parts from your car. And the car lot will not be less than 32, it'll be like a total of more than 20 vehicles from the Need For Speed series. And the back of the box will be different. Since the guy who drives the BMW M3 has aleady left Rockwood, but until the new guys come here. It can offer like pedestrians get run over because it's not rated "M", it's still rated "T" because of more violence and more aggresion. Oh, and by the way, the ranks of the one like from Burnout Revenge, it'll be here. Once you get to the "Elite" rank, you get a Burnout Revenge edition of the Mercedes SLR MclAren (which the eyelids almost look angrier). You can still use traffics as to take down both rivals and/or cops. The crash events will now be available and your cars from Burnout Revenge crash series will still be here and you can name the crash events name. Some car lots are not for sale because you need more bounties got unlock cars and some cars are now prize cars. Not only you transfer cars from Need For Speed: Most Wanted, but it will also transfer cars on both Burnout Revenge and Need For Speed: Underground 2. It's not an easy task, but with a lot of teamwork, the task will be a lot easier. And a huge thanks to you! I hope you read my long message!</s></p>
<p><s>Your Friend, Anything Else (a.k.a.) David (which it's my real name, but my first name begins with the letter "J")</s></p>
<p><s>P.S.: How can a Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren, Lamborghini Gallardo, Aston Martin DB9, Prosche Carrera S, Porsche 911 GT2 Chevrolet Corvette C5, Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe, Lamborghini Murciélago, Ford GT, Porsche Cayman S, Porsche 911 Turbo S and Porsche Carrera GT can't go over 200 mph and how come the special spoiler does not come up and go up while stopping? It's impossible. I should tell EA. Both Lamborghini Gallardo and Murciélago are concept cars. The special spoilers from the Murciélago is supposed to go up after picking up more speed, and the Gallardo's "spoiler" can't be changed. It's supposed to go up. Also, I'm a fan of Need For Speed fan, plus I'm also a Burnout fan, so I can combine these 2 so I am able to give PS2 fans a lot of hope for EA. Thanks, Wikipeedio!</s></p>
<p><s>Hope to see you there!</s></p>
<p>All of your ideas sucked big time. How is everyone going to know that there is Need For Speed: Revenge? Your idea is just as worthless as you. Electronic Arts already made <a href="../../../c/a/r/Need_For_Speed%7E_Carbon_a7c2.html" title="Need For Speed: Carbon">Need For Speed: Carbon</a>. Might as well give up, loser. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessional_Gamer_adf7.html" title="User:Professional Gamer">Professional Gamer</a> 22:46, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><s>== about the gold edition ==</s></p>
<p><s>Leave me a message on my talk page when you hear back from EA. Good luck! You have a great creative mind. I seriously think that you should think about becoming a game developer and getting a job at EA because I think they could use someone like you. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipeedio_5ef0.html" title="User:Wikipeedio">Wikipeedio</a> 19:28, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</s></p>
<p>There is no Gold Edition, my friend. He is making a joke here and they are making a release called <a href="../../../c/a/r/Need_For_Speed%7E_Carbon_a7c2.html" title="Need For Speed: Carbon">Need For Speed: Carbon</a>. <a href="../../../b/e/s/User%7EBest_Gamer_4436.html" title="User:Best Gamer">Best Gamer</a> 9 October 2006</p>
<p><s>== How goes the thing with EA? ==</s></p>
<p><s>Just curious about how your NFSMW Gold Edition request thing was coming. Cheers! <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipeedio_5ef0.html" title="User:Wikipeedio">Wikipeedio</a> 00:28, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</s></p>
<p>There is no NFSMW Gold Edition. Anything Else was making a very rude joke. This is a false rumor, my friend, and I'm afraid you fell for it. Electronic Arts is now making a release called <i>Need For Speed: Carbon</i>. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessional_Gamer_adf7.html" title="User:Professional Gamer">Professional Gamer</a> 22:49, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
