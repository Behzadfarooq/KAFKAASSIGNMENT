<h2><span class="mw-headline">Photosynthesis</span></h2>
<p>Some time ago you helped improve the article <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photosynthetic_reaction_centre.html" title="Photosynthetic reaction centre">Photosynthetic reaction centre</a> to bring it to featured article standard. The article never became featured, probably because it's too obscure, so now I want to merge it with photosynthesis and then eventually rewrite that whole article. Few people have heard of reaction centres, but the majority of people have heard of photosynthesis, so this is probably a better candidate for a featured article. I just wondered if you would like to help merge the two articles appropriately. Thanks. --<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimpsons_contributor_6d6c.html" title="User:Simpsons contributor">Miller</a> 17:10, 3 April 2006 (UTC)<a href="../../../s/i/g/Image%7ESignature_george.PNG_1404.html" class="image" title="Image:Signature george.PNG"><img src="../../../upload/d/df/Signature_george.PNG" alt="Image:Signature george.PNG" width="102" height="21" longdesc="../../../s/i/g/Image%7ESignature_george.PNG_1404.html" /></a></p>

<dd>I don't have time to do big stuff right now (the next month or so looks busy as heck). However, I will try to keep an eye on <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photosynthesis.html" title="Photosynthesis">Photosynthesis</a> and help with the details—checking grammar and style, citing sources, etc. I agree that the main photosynthesis article is a better candidate for FA, but given the limits on article size (people on FAC tend to get more hissy than necessary when articles exceed 32Kb), it might be a good idea to keep <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photosynthetic_reaction_centre.html" title="Photosynthetic reaction centre">photosynthetic reaction centre</a> separate. The main article could have a summary of the biochemical structures involved, with a notice saying "<i>For details, see the article photosynthetic reaction centre.</i>" This is how lots of articles handle that sort of thing. <a href="../../../a/n/v/User%7EAnville_a648.html" title="User:Anville">Anville</a> 09:59, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, I wasn't aware there was actually a style rule about chemical infoboxes. Somewhere, back on the horrendously long talk page for that article, I'd read something about having the initial focus on the history and social importance, and thus keeping the chemistry infobox down in the chemistry section. I suppose that makes a sort of sense, but if there's a better way to do it, there's a better way to do it.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Banning</span></h2>
<p>Hi Anville. Is it possible to ban anyone from editing Wikipedia who deletes or otherwise vandalizes an article? I'm thinking of a "one strike and you're out" policy.--<a href="../../../s/t/n/User%7EStN_acd1.html" title="User:StN">StN</a> 16:42, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I assume you've read <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">the Vandalism Policy</a>. Usually, people are given at least one warning, although if the edits they make are clearly intended to be disruptive, the normal escalation from "use the sandbox if you'd like to make further tests" to "you're out of the game" can be shortened. As far as I know, the only place where a "one strike and you're out" policy has been implemented is with the article <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bogdanov_Affair_7b8e.html" title="Bogdanov Affair">Bogdanov Affair</a>. That was a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Regarding_The_Bogdanov_Affair_d765.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Regarding The Bogdanov Affair">deliberate choice by the Arbitration Committee</a>, and I don't think it will happen again very easily. That situation involved the people who started the Affair itself promoting their viewpoint on the Wikipedia and disguising their aims with sockpuppets and jargon. (They or their supporters are still at it, too.) It was an extreme case which has led to <i>indefinite</i> <a href="../../../s/e/m/Wikipedia%7ESemi-protection_policy_9387.html" title="Wikipedia:Semi-protection policy">semi-protection</a> and <i>immediate</i> blocking of violators — just a nasty situation. <a href="../../../a/n/v/User%7EAnville_a648.html" title="User:Anville">Anville</a> 16:58, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All the recent changes to the Hicks page you made.. fine, but why did you remove the line that mentions the Hicks page at MySpace which offers four of his track to hear. I often get told that some of these tracks are available at billhicks.com but not the same tracks that are offered at Hicks' myspace. Also hicks.com frequently has connections problems of one kind or another in my experience, maybe they'll get resolved one day.. but personally I wouldnt hold my breath. So can you please re-add the myspace mention and the internal link to wiki's myspace page and also the external link to hicks at myspace.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Earth in fiction (regarding Star Wars)</span></h2>
<p>I'm not following your reasoning for removing my post. If the reason you removed it was because it's an "unproved theory", then I say that it's no more of a theory than the Star Wars post that you left on there: "However, the opening line to each film of "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away" reveals that the story is being told from the perspective of someone who had witnessed these events. The line implies that the Star Wars galaxy exists far away from our own, therefore making Earth an actual planet within the fictional Star Wars universe."</p>

<p>And then there is the well-known quote from <a href="../../../h/a/n/Han_Solo_1c62.html" title="Han Solo">Han Solo</a>: "<i>You've never heard of the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millennium_Falcon_baaa.html" title="Millennium Falcon">Millennium Falcon</a>? It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parsecs.html" title="Parsecs">parsecs</a></i>." A parsec is defined to be the distance from which the Earth and Sun appear to be separated from one another by 1 second of an arc. Therefore, since a parsec is a unit of measurement derived from Earth, the <i>Star Wars</i> universe must currently have or once had a knowledge of Earth. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.190.115.189 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.190.115.189.html" title="User talk:68.190.115.189">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.190.115.189_6af2.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.190.115.189">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I'm not trying to be harsh here, but I have to ask: "So what?" Like the majority of the things the Wikipedia says about <i>Star Wars,</i> it is Original Research. In a better world, we could expunge still more and actually have articles which are useful and readable. Read the policy: <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>. Now, I'm going to go trim that section further, since it looks like I didn't trim enough. <a href="../../../a/n/v/User%7EAnville_a648.html" title="User:Anville">Anville</a> 15:39, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Comma Johanneum for GA</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I am in the middle of reviewing <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comma_Johanneum_4d82.html" title="Comma Johanneum">Comma Johanneum</a> for GA status. It is an excellent article, but I wanted to ask you to address one thing: The phrase near the opening of the article reading "In readings containing the clause, 1 John 5:7–8 reads as follows (from the King James Version; the Comma is rendered with emphasis):" is confusing. I actually had to read the opening paragraph several times before I understood what the article is about.</p>
<p>Do you mean to say that 1 John 5:7–8 is a definitive <i>example</i> of the Comma Johanneum? Or that the Comma Johanneum appearing in that passage appears verbatim in all examples of Comma Johanneum? Can you re-write to make it more clear? Maybe:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An example of a passage that contains the clause, 1 John 5:7–8, reads as follows (from the King James Version; the Comma is rendered with emphasis):</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me know what you think. <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 15:22, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That sentence has actually bothered me before, though I had read it as more awkward than unclear. This is why it helps to bring in new editing eyes! I have edited that passage, hopefully making the meaning more transparent. <a href="../../../a/n/v/User%7EAnville_a648.html" title="User:Anville">Anville</a> 17:01, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I agree with your sentiments, broadly speaking. Recently, I have come to feel that I've been watching a tempest in a teapot — one which to the people <i>in</i> the teapot looks like a tsunami. I believe the article has improved since it made FA (though of course edits made since the last time I looked at "Criticisms" may have deranged everything). One reason I had thought of suggesting for splitting off a Criticisms of Transhumanism article was to get the arguments into a different place: if everybody could agree that the current revision of the main article was at least factually accurate and based upon verifiable sources, then we could go split hairs, chop logic and engrave tombstones on some other page. Meanwhile, the main article itself could stay nice and stable, serving its purpose for the people who <i>aren't</i> already flashing with heat lightning.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have grown more sensitive over this past year to what constitutes Original Research; I believe I think about the subtleties more than lots of other Wikipedians I've run into. Maybe that's because I like to play in areas where the sort of OR I might do here would use exactly the same type and quality of reasoning as it would in any other venue — <i>Science Fiction Studies</i> or a paperback from MIT Press, say. I think I stayed on the legitimate side of the line with <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_Laws_of_Robotics_f74e.html" title="Three Laws of Robotics">Three Laws of Robotics</a>, for example, but I know many places where I could've crossed that line. (One reason I'm writing less new material now than I was last fall is that, hey, a big part of me <i>wants</i> to do Original things.) I get the distinct feeling that the heavy hitters on <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transhumanism.html" title="Transhumanism">Transhumanism</a> may all be capable of slipping in the same way.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe everyone should just back off, read something new and work on different articles for a while. The sound and the fury need to go somewhere else, and I'm trying to think of a good place to take them. <a href="../../../a/n/v/User%7EAnville_a648.html" title="User:Anville">Anville</a> 04:35, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
