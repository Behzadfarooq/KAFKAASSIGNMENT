<p>An interesting idea. Wellesley would do as well as any.</p>
<p>I don't think it would really do that much to combat academic boosterism, and I'm not willing to work <i>terribly</i> hard on it, but I'd be glad to nibble away at it from time to time. I, too live near the school and it's easier to drive over there than to schlepp into Boston or Cambridge.</p>
<p>The first time my wife saw the Wellesley College campus she said "Do you know what this reminds me of?" I said, "I bet I do. Walt Disney World, right?" "Right."</p>
<p>One unsolved little mystery. I don't think they dress quite the same way now... but the question is... in the 1960s, were Wellesley students <i>consciously</i> imitating the general appearance of the women in <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pre-Raphaelite_ef91.html" title="Pre-Raphaelite">Pre-Raphaelite</a> paintings? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:59, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Enrollment management and other obscenities</span></h2>
<p>I just read, in rapid succession, two of the most depressing articles I've ever read on college admissions. One was in this month's Atlantic Monthly. It's called "The Best Class Money Can Buy" and it's about an obscene thing I'd never heard of before called "Enrollment management." I don't know whether <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200511/financial-aid-leveraging" class="external text" title="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200511/financial-aid-leveraging" rel="nofollow">this link</a> works if you don't have a print subscription.</p>
<p>It is the art of manipulating financial aid offers so as to shape the incoming class to meet the college's desires. In many cases, it is used to drive away poorer students and attract wealthier ones. You need to read the article...</p>
<p>The second was in last week's The New Yorker (Oct. 10th), called "Getting in: The social logic of Ivy League admissions" and it is a sort of history of admissions at Harvard. Ah, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/critics/content/articles/051010crat_atlarge" class="external text" title="http://www.newyorker.com/critics/content/articles/051010crat_atlarge" rel="nofollow">here it is</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>In 1905, Harvard College adopted the College Entrance Examination Board tests as the principal basis for admission, which meant that virtually any academically gifted high-school senior who could afford a private college had a straightforward shot at attending. By 1908, the freshman class was seven per cent Jewish, nine per cent Catholic, and forty-five per cent from public schools...</dd>
<dd>...that meritocratic spirit soon led to a crisis. The enrollment of Jews began to rise dramatically. By 1922, they made up more than a fifth of Harvard’s freshman class. The administration and alumni were up in arms. Jews were thought to be sickly and grasping, grade-grubbing and insular....</dd>
<dd>The difficult part, however, was coming up with a way of keeping Jews out, because as a group they were academically superior to everyone else. Lowell’s first idea—a quota limiting Jews to fifteen per cent of the student body—was roundly criticized. Lowell tried restricting the number of scholarships given to Jewish students, and made an effort to bring in students from public schools in the West, where there were fewer Jews. Neither strategy worked. Finally, Lowell—and his counterparts at Yale and Princeton—realized that if a definition of merit based on academic prowess was leading to the wrong kind of student, the solution was to change the definition of merit. Karabel argues that it was at this moment that the history and nature of the Ivy League took a significant turn.</dd>
<dd>The admissions office at Harvard became much more interested in the details of an applicant’s personal life. Lowell told his admissions officers to elicit information about the “character” of candidates from “persons who know the applicants well,” and so the letter of reference became mandatory. Harvard started asking applicants to provide a photograph. Candidates had to write personal essays, demonstrating their aptitude for leadership, and list their extracurricular activities. “Starting in the fall of 1922,” Karabel writes, “applicants were required to answer questions on ‘Race and Color,’ ‘Religious Preference,’ ‘Maiden Name of Mother,’ ‘Birthplace of Father,’ and ‘What change, if any, has been made since birth in your own name or that of your father? (Explain fully).’ ”</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Macdonalds wages</span></h2>
<p>About your change in History of Democracy of "MacDonalds wages" to "limited". Did you find the original glaring and intrusive? My problem with 'limited' is that it means less. What about a principle that decorum and stylistic level should yield to informativeness? The mention of MacDonalds invites the reader to set Athenian ways of doing things against the modern practice of paying professional wages to politicians: at Athens political pay was aligned with the earning power of the very poorest citizens. Maybe a refernce to a day labourer's wages could be used instead, though even this is less graphic to most modern readers who may not have encountered that as a role. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlounderer_420c.html" title="User:Flounderer">Flounderer</a> 22:43, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In a word, yes, it was glaring — or at least too much so to sit easily with me. It reads like a disparagement of a particular company; perhaps it's a justified one, but such a discussion is certainly not within the scope of the article in question. I think the best option is telling the reader explicitly what the "buying power" of Athenian political pay was, metaphors aside, since in this case, a graphic metaphor invites comment on modern society instead. <a href="../../../a/n/v/User%7EAnville_a648.html" title="User:Anville">Anville</a> 18:48, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It would appear as though there are certain "editors" who wish to remove the lesser known literary punk genres, not only is this a blatant witch hunt which emerged from my argument on the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_City_07cd.html" title="Dark City">Dark City</a> talk page that the movie is a relveant component in reference to the dieselpunk genre, but also extremely vindictive against myself and those who have helped in categorising and adding content to the literay punk genres.

<dd>I hope you understand, I don't think our coverage of SF &amp; the like should be less, but that our coverage of other things should be more. Good work is good work, regardless of the topic, and I'm always grateful for it. (The snide remark about ents was actually Xed's, I suppose I should have dropped it when I moved the essay to my own page, especially since he seems to think I'm either the anti-Christ or one of his minions.) Anyway, it would be hard to like Pynchon and hate science fiction.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Question: if you like Pynchon &amp; Nabokov: ever read any of William Vollmann? - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 20:59, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree entirely on the coverage issue, as it happens. Whether I with my manifold limitations (South America spirals outward from Borges and grade-school Spanish for me) can make any difference is, well, probably not worth debating.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>

<dd>

<dd>I haven't read Vollmann; there exists in fact a long queue of books and authors I wish I had read, including those my friends nominate and those which Borges recommends.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wharton school</span></h2>
<p>First feeble attempt?</p>
<p>What <b>did</b> you think JDoorjam and I have been doing?</p>
<p>Please, take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wharton_School_of_the_University_of_Pennsylvania&amp;oldid=38036301" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wharton_School_of_the_University_of_Pennsylvania&amp;oldid=38036301" rel="nofollow">its state a couple of days ago</a>. Just scroll through it... I dare you!</p>
<p>I do think I'd be inclined to allow something along the lines "The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania is one of the world's leading business schools." in the lead section, just as Harvard "is among the most famous universities in the United States and the world" If I can find a suitable source--and as always, if something is "widely regarded" or "generally known" it shouldn't be hard to find someone who says so--I might put it back in.</p>
<p>The interesting question is how to convey the nuance that Wharton really <b>is</b> the tippy-top bestest undergraduate business program in <s>the nation</s> <s>the world</s> <s>the solar system</s> the Mind of God, but is only <i>among</i> the prestige, elite, top, leading MBA programs.</p>
<p>More to the point, it is [one of] the first/oldest/whatever business schools [by some criterion and with some qualifications].</p>
<p>The Wharton website itself is pretty disgusting, by the way. I don't no much about business schools but I take it they are institutionally inclined to boosterism even without the help of alums? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 12:02, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK. OK. Looking at the history later, I realized that you two had done considerable work in that direction. Unfortunately, edit summaries are not as editable as the rest of contributions (and we call ourselves the <i>Wiki</i>-pedia?). Consider this my acknowledgement for your work well done.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I suppose it's too much to ask for any business school to offer a second-year course in "Becoming Modesty", even if it <i>is</i> only an elective. I would prefer to see an article having more history and less present-day curriculum, since history establishes significance and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hidden_Curriculum_24a8.html" title="The Hidden Curriculum">the formal curriculum is often irrelevant anyway</a>. But this requires actual research, instead of merely highlighting and deleting. Sigh.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Mostly meaningless story: during what <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Lehrer_f6ba.html" title="Tom Lehrer">Tom Lehrer</a> would call my "Bright College Days", several of my friends were rowers and <s>vixens</s> <s>coxens</s> coxswains on MIT's crew team, so I got occasional doses of second-hand gossip and general culture. I should poll them for stories about the Harvard teams. . . There seems something unpleasantly Randian (or maybe Sperry-RANDian) about painting dollar signs on paddle blades, but it does jibe with the (second-hand) impression I received. "Harvard Crew", by the way, was one of our favourite euphemisms for "Beautiful People". I recall a song someone put together, to the tune of "Look Down" from <i>Les Misérables</i>:
<dl>
<dd>I know, she'll wait,</dd>
<dd>I know that she'll be true.</dd>
<dd><i>— Look down, look down,</i></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Asimov</span></h2>
<p>Sorry about my bad edit, I missed the <i>not</i> in that particular quotation. You were right to rv. Still, this quotation does not really concur with the second one in the list. O well, opinions can change. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChina_Crisis_8a30.html" title="User:China Crisis">China Crisis</a> 11:40, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No big deal. The second quotation comes from the last major autobiographical work that Asimov wrote, his memoir <i>I. Asimov.</i> It might also occur in <i><a href="../../../i/t/27/It%27s_Been_a_Good_Life_7174.html" title="It's Been a Good Life">It's Been a Good Life</a></i>; I don't know for sure. In his memoir, Asimov talks about how he called himself an atheist for many years but felt dissatisfied because the term seemed to say more about what he didn't believe than what he did. Eventually, a copy of the "Humanist Manifesto" found its way to him, and he signed gladly. He rose to being president of the American Humanist Association, an honorary position whose real "job" was to be himself and be visible.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I figure we should take the latest statement as reflecting the development of Asimov's thoughts over the course of his life. "Atheist" hardly sums up his beliefs, and "humanist" doesn't either. One could believe in an afterlife or an original Divine Mover responsible for the Universe and still think that human beings are responsible for humanity's problems (and therefore, responsible for fixing them). A person like this would be a "spiritual humanist", I guess. Asimov was an atheistic humanist. If I find a particularly clear and eloquent way of summarizing the beliefs I've read in his autobiographical works, I'll put it into the article.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pynchon</span></h2>
<p>Thanks for your question. To be honest, I find deconstruction very puzzling. I'd prefer what you wrote (which seems absolutely correct about Pynchon!!) without the words "(or deconstruction)". Perhaps it's correct to use "deconstruction" in this way, since it could be argues that Pybchon is challenging the assumption of a high art/low art divide, but it just seems a bit like getting in the term for the sake of getting it in. No big deal, but if it were me I'd leave it out. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 08:38, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK. I'll remove the parenthetical bit (which wasn't something that I had put in), since the rest seems fine overall.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">My objection:</span></h2>
<p>My objection is to the use of the old ref-note style as opposed to meta:cite. It is not a requirement to use foot and end notes (in fact, I only objected to articles that used foot and end notes, but in the ref-note format). It is a requirement to use the best TYPE of foot and end notes available. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 15:41, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Comma Johanneum</span></h2>
<p>Thanks very much for your message. Sorry it's taken a couple of days to reply- real life has a habit of getting in the way! I think that the article looks really good now. Like you say, it needs a bit more on the KJV only movement (I'll have a go at that myself if I get a chance). I've made some changes to clarify a few bits and I've also commented out 3 passages that I thought were digressions. I haven't simply deleted them as I thought that (if they weren't already) they should be in the articles to which they refer. I haven't had a chance to do that either, so if you could that would be great, otherwise I'll try and do it later in the week.

<dd>OK. I appreciate the clarifications, and I think they work well. Being a great lover of digressions (too much <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Burke_%28science_historian%29_007c.html" title="James Burke (science historian)">James Burke</a> as a small child!) I probably go overboard in that department upon occasion. In a few days, when I'm a bit more objective about my own writing, I'll see if there are any good arguments to keep any of that material (or duplicate it in different articles—not always a bad thing, I think). The phenomenon laughably called "real life" is getting in my way too, these days, so it'll take me a little while to carve out the time necessary for big-time revisions anyway.</dd>
