This article is not a lot more interest to me than <a href="../../../r/i/m/Rimming.html" title="Rimming">rimming</a> (it is a little!), but both should stay.

<li>Doesn't it occur to you that no one ever said fans weren't people? Doesn't it occur to you that even when people are <i>people</i> (what a shocking idea!) it doesn't meant that everything they <i>want</i> to find in an encyclopedia is everything that belongs in an encyclopedia? Again, this is an example of the "if you talk about fancruft you are an anti-fan bigot" fallacy, which I consider just short of a personal attack. For cripes' sake, if Wikipedia <b>was</b> a place for every sort of thing that fans were interested in, I'd want a full episode guide for <i>Mr. Rose</i> and <i>Take Three Girls</i> and <i>Quick Before They Catch Us</i> and <i>The Sentimental Agent</i> and <i>Lucan</i> and <i>The Corner Bar</i> and craploads of other obscure TV series. Don't you go telling <i>me</i> that I'm crushing the dreams of those poor innocent fans who want their particular TV show/movie series/video game covered in infinite detail. I <i>am</i> a fan and I <i>love</i> that kind of detail but I don't delude myself that Wikipedia is the place for it. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:45, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<li>Comment: Thank you for illustrating the very point I was wanting to make. IMO terms such as <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">fancruft</a> indicate dangerous thinking, and remind me of the story of the preacher who noted on the side of his preaching notes <i>logic weak on this point, speak loudly</i>. It's obvious some people are irritated by the details some fans want included in Wikipedia, and I fear we are reducing the usefulness of Wikipedia to such people as a result, and rejecting their interest with their interests. Perhaps this one is over the top as an article, it's an extreme case, but it's also a useful, catchy term on which someone who had just seen the cartoon and remembered little else might well search, looking for encyclopedic information. Food for thought? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 20:49, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not really. These are just more personal attacks from you. You haven't explained why you think my logic is weak; you haven't explained what the very point you wanted to make was, let alone how you think your point was made for you; you haven't explained why typing "fancruft" instead of "a level of granularity inappropriate for a general-purpose encyclopedia" every time represents "dangerous thinking". All you've done is throw insults; pat yourself on the back that you can cite smarmy insults about how foolish the people disagreeing with you are instead of, y'know, raising an adequate defense of why a joke that appeared in exactly one episode of one TV series should have its own article or why we should encourage people to think so. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 22:33, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm sorry you find nothing but insults in my comments, and that you don't see why it's dangerous. Let me try again. <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">Fancruft</a> is an emotive term that expresses the user's disgust at the material. It's not respectful of other views, in particular the contributors', and it avoids the issue of what level of detail is appropriate. Again, I'm truly sorry that you feel I don't respect your views. I do. I just don't agree with them. I'm sorry I have evidently expressed it badly. And I am certainly giving myself no pats on the back. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 10:19, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. A fictional dicadef. Really, all this information in this article is in the title. I have nothing against fancruft, but this has no potential for even usefulness to a fan. (Although, if you move away from the fancruft angle, the anvil is a classic icon in the physical comedy of cartoons. One could write an article on the use of the anvil in art. Makes me wonder what started that gag, and why it became so popular, and what makes the anvil more popular than the less commonly used heavy weight or safe... And <a href="../../../a/n/v/Anvil.html" title="Anvil">anvil</a> mentions nothing about this use of the anvil, which is surprising. Hmmm... I'll have to do some research...) --<a href="../../../l/3/3/User%7EL33tminion_371f.html" title="User:L33tminion">L33tminion</a> | <a href="../../../l/3/3/User_talk%7EL33tminion_b015.html" title="User talk:L33tminion">(talk)</a> 19:11, Nov 19, 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>By all means, include the iconic use of anvils in cartoons (particularly Warner Brothers cartoons) in the <a href="../../../a/n/v/Anvil.html" title="Anvil">anvil</a> article; I'm surprised it's not there already. A short paragraph at the bottom of that page is a great place for such information. But we don't need breakout articles on such things, nor do we need mention of their cartoon use to overwhelm their legitimate use. I am still be against keeping this as a redirect, as I have no idea where to redirect it to. It seems way too minor to have it redirect to <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animaniacs.html" title="Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a>; I think it would only confuse people, as the two are not synonymous. Redirect to anvil would be worse, as it would imply this word has legitimacy. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 19:36, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: Redirect could be to either, but makes more sense to <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animaniacs.html" title="Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a> IMO, or better still to Anvilania (perhaps only until that is also deleted). Redirects do not need to be <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synonym.html" title="Synonym">synonyms</a>, but should obey the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Wikipedia%7EPrinciple_of_least_astonishment_ec45.html" title="Wikipedia:Principle of least astonishment">principle of least astonishment</a>. No change of vote. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 20:54, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My point basically was that a redirect from anvilology to Animaniacs <i>would</i> violate the principle of least astonishment. If anvilology is going to be mentioned at all on that page I don't think its important enough to be mentioned in any capacity until very far down in the article. So the reader will be linked to a page that seems to have little to do with anvils, and wonder why he is there. While redirects do not need to be synonyms, they should have a strong and readily apparent connection, in my view. The anvilology/Animaniacs connection doesn't do it for me; anvilology is too small an aspect of Animaniacs. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 23:23, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think the principle could be quite well respected by such a redirect. We need to ask, <i>why would a person search for or link to <b>anvilology</b>?</i>, and notice it's a principle of <i>least</i> astonishment, not <i>none under any circumstance</i>. In any case it's up to those who create a redirect to make it work, and if it doesn't work then the redirect can and should be nominated for deletion. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 10:19, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Redirects are cheap, and I have no problem, for the record, of a redirect to <a href="../../../a/n/v/Anvil.html" title="Anvil">anvil</a> and the iconic use of anvils as the omnipresent falling object in cartoons is an excellent idea. The anvil is a great object for falling in a cartoon. People who grew up with smithies and farriers still in existence (e.g. the people who watched the early cartoons in the 1930's and 1940's) would think of the anvil as something immovable and the non plus ultra of hard. It's a great object. It's just that an entry on a one-off joke in any pop culture ephemera turns us into a "Hey, 'member when they did this? that was awesome" (the Chris Farley skits on SNL): discussion, placement in context, historical impact, significance are things I expect of articles. Just "It happened here" is a registry. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:43, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
