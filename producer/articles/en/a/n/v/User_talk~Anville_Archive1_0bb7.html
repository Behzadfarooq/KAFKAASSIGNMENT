<h2><span class="mw-headline">Liouville's equation</span></h2>
<p>I don't think I follow the argument on non-crossing of phase-space trajectories as sufficient.</p>
<p>I suggest that _that_ is part of a subsidiary argument for showing that the volume in phase space always contains the same number of representative points, N.</p>
<p>The other key element is to show that the phase space volume V over which the particles are distributed, does not change. This occurs IIRC because the stretching in delta q is balanced by the shrinkage in delta p, (or vv), so deltap.deltaq is constant when following a particle and its environs. This comes about because the rate of change of <span class="texhtml">Î”<i>p</i>.Î”<i>q</i></span> is</p>

</dl>
<p><br />
AND by Hamilton's relations, this is zero.</p>
<p>NB NB Hamilton's relations between p and q are ESSENTIAL to this argument - determinism is NOT enough.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This is the way I was taught it long ago in stat mechanics and is essentially as the fuller argument given at</p>

Later - if you can bear to treat the motion through phase-space as fluid mechanics then Hamilton's relations ensure the 'velocity' field has zero divergence.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A little experiment</span></h2>
<p>I'm very tired of wiki editing, wiki politics and the pettiness which festers in the wiki mindsetâ€”of the bush wars which erupt over inconsequential articles while entire regions of human inquiry fust undocumented. I think it's about time I hung up my hat and went off to write something which will make me <i>happy,</i> or at least bring me fame and fortune. Because my heart is a shriveled cinder, however, I thought it best to provide a parting gift. I wanted to make it something which would really infuriate as many people as I couldâ€”when I act small, I do it on the grand scaleâ€”while being as careful and scholarly as I could possibly manage.</p>
<p>There are more footnotes on heaven and earth than are dreamt of in Wikipedia philosophy.</p>
<p>So, I took a couple days when I probably wouldn't do anything else anyway, and I put together a little essay entitled "Influence and Criticims of <i><a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlas_Shrugged_7452.html" title="Atlas Shrugged">Atlas Shrugged</a></i>". Yes, the canonical Big Thick Book for the first subculture to be seen as over-representing itself on this encyclopedia. Given that <i>nothing</i> I could ever write would please the hard-core <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivist_philosophy.html" title="Objectivist philosophy">Objectivists</a>, since a <i>free encyclopedia</i> is really only a way to let the Looters of this world get away without doing research on their own (isn't it?), I figured that my most rigorous scholarship would still start a pissing contest.</p>
<p>I'm vaguely curious to see how it looks, in a few months. Until then, let me note that the paragraph on "Influence" as it stood before was not just pathetically short but also unforgivably sloppy. It managed to mis-represent the two sources it did cite, while making an unjustified claim about the entire <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarian_science_fiction.html" title="Libertarian science fiction">libertarian science fiction</a> sub-genre. It included a phrase in quotation marks which did not appear in any of the sources it cited, which tends to support my intuition that nobody checks sources anyway. I included a reference to <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_S._Raymond_ac9d.html" title="Eric S. Raymond">Eric S. Raymond</a>'s essay "A Political History of SF" to address the first problem; not that I agree entirely with ESR's conclusions, but he addresses the topic, and does so in what I consider an admirably rational manner.</p>
<p>For the curious, or those worried about copyvios, my rough draft is available at User:Anville/Atlas Shrugged Criticism. If its style seems a little jarring, I can only reply that I wrote it the same way I did my material for the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_Laws_of_Robotics_f74e.html" title="Three Laws of Robotics">Three Laws of Robotics</a>, <i>i.e.,</i> the material which pushed that article to FA status. I used the same standards and the same nerve circuits as I did for <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Asimov_1d17.html" title="Isaac Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a> or <i><a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvin_and_Hobbes_386b.html" title="Calvin and Hobbes">Calvin and Hobbes</a>,</i> and nobody has taken those <i>off</i> the FA list, either. Yes, if what I say stands the way I said it, somebody will probably go away thinking that <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> is too childish for consideration. That means I've done my job. It's now up to somebody else to present whatever counterarguments, literary or historical, which competent critics have made. I would really prefer those arguments to come from outside sources, paraphrased and summarized with proper attribution, but I won't be surprised if they aren't.</p>
<p>One of the perks you discover while being a writer is that, thanks to revision, you can make something which is actually better than any given thought which goes through your brain on a day-to-day basis. Just like Einstein's mother didn't have to be a great physicist, and just like natural selection can make thumbs opposable without a Grand Designer's whim, the product can turn out better than its creator. Kind of funny, actually.</p>
<p>One or two people can probably make a book which will not only outlive their bodies but also live more grandly and with greater subtlety than their quotidian lives can manage. I remain to be convinced that an encyclopedia, produced by the conflicting jibber-jabber of ten thousand web-surfing <i>yahoodim,</i> can really attain more sophistication than the original Humanity which it mirrors.</p>
