<p>Hi Anlace,<br />
I noticed in your edits to <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annadel_State_Park_47bc.html" title="Annadel State Park">Annadel State Park</a> that you had removed the cited unit of measurement (35 miles) and replaced it with a converted value (56 kilometres). You may not know this but, this type of edit goes against the <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOSNUM_3545.html" title="WP:MOSNUM">MOS</a> for a couple of reasons. One, that you always use the sourced units and include a converted value —i.e. if the source is metric, state the metric value in the text with the appropriate U.S. or Imperial unit converted in parenthesis and vise-versa. Second, the conversions should always be included and not removed. In this example, your source stated that there was 35 miles of trails. Therefore, I changed the article to read "<i>There are 35 miles (56&#160;km) of trails...</i>" with proper formatting and references. There were some other areas that I tweaked in that article. Check out my changes to get a full idea of what I am talking about.

<p>Howdy - Please forgive this dumb question, but do we define surface runoff the same way? (I may misunderstand what some edits mean.) It's not always so clear, and perhaps the terms get mixed up. This is how I see it: Runoff is water flowing over the Earth, anywhere. Surface runoff, is runoff on a hillslope before is reaches a channel. Once surface runoff reaches a channel, it become subsumed into streamflow (which is also runoff). This view conflicts with a chunk of the content in <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surface_runoff.html" title="Surface runoff">surface runoff</a>. What say you?

<dd>Thanks. I just wanted to make sure. Compared to <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surface_runoff.html" title="Surface runoff">surface runoff</a>, the other runoff entries are sorely lacking.

<p>I'm not clear about the caption to the image of Devil's Slide. Is <i>Potentilla hickmanii</i> habitat in this picture or not? The picture should not be used if it does not include the habitat, instead just link to article about Devil's Slide.

<dd>i have modified the caption to make things clearer. the earlier vagueness was due to desire not to publicise the precise location of an endangered species. <a href="../../../a/n/l/User%7EAnlace_5bdb.html" title="User:Anlace">Anlace</a> 21:32, 25 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, I think the caption change is fine, but if there is any concern about publicizing the precise location the photograph should simply be removed--the risks outweigh any possible benefit of including a photograph. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 21:45, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>i think the scale and rugged terrain are adequate protections given the residual broad scale caption depiction....so we are fine the way it stands. <a href="../../../a/n/l/User%7EAnlace_5bdb.html" title="User:Anlace">Anlace</a> 22:37, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Cedros Island is not in the CFP according to its article and the article on Cedros Island. "With an area of 293,804 km² , [the CFP] includes 70% of California and extends into southwestern Oregon, a small part of western Nevada and <b>northern Baja California</b>." Cedros Island is " 426 km (265 miles) south of San Diego." If you feel these are incorrect, please change everything as necessary. Otherwise I have removed comments about Cedros Island endemics from the CFP article. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 18:26, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed your picture from the <i><a href="../../../q/u/e/Quercus_lobata.html" title="Quercus lobata">Quercus lobata</a></i> page because they don't look like Valley Oak acorns which are known for tapering to a pointed tip, and generally being long and slender, etc. See <a href="http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?query_src=ucjeps&amp;enlarge=0000+0000+1002+0533" class="external free" title="http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?query_src=ucjeps&amp;enlarge=0000+0000+1002+0533" rel="nofollow">http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?query_src=ucjeps&amp;enlarge=0000+0000+1002+0533</a> <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 19:24, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>when i collected these valley oak acorns there wasnt another typ of oak within several hundred meters, so i know these are valley oak acorns. note the date of my photo upload was winter, when the acorns have shriveled quite a bit. also note that some of my acorns are somewhat at an end view, making them appear less elongated than they are. Finally i could not see a source location for your photo. these acorns from my experience vary in elongation over the range of this tree. My acorns were collected in sonoma county, calif. feel free to insert a photo of your choosing, but i do think the source location of collection should be given. if i dont hear from you in a timely way i will re-install my (genuine) photo of valley oak acorns. <a href="../../../a/n/l/User%7EAnlace_5bdb.html" title="User:Anlace">Anlace</a> 20:20, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is simply no point in attaching atypical acorns to the page, particularly if you have to admit they look less elongated than they are in the photo, they're shriveled quite a bit and so on. Just wait and gather some fresh ones that look like <i>Quercus lobata</i> acorns or include the fact that though you say they are <i>Q</i>. <i>lobata</i> acorns, they don't look like them because they're shriveled, not fresh, and the photo is shot from the end making them appear less elongated than they are. It's not useful in an encyclopedia to include a picture of something that doesn't look like what it is--this is just confusing. Source location? For the CalFlora photos click on the "more information" to get a source location: location Near Coleman Fish Hatchery (Shasta County, California, US). <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 18:23, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for you comments. Much appreciated. Re fish kills from thermal pollution - I have had experience of a few especially during the drought year of 1976 in the UK and also following an incident in which 20 tonnes of liquid oxygen discharged into a small stream - not the normal sort of thermal pollution. No photographs howerver - sorry. Most of the evidence that I have relating to power station thermal pollutiion shows little evidence of fish-kills since the discharges tend to be permanent and fish exhibit avoiding behaviour so that the local area is reduced in its bio-diversity including fish life. We have had a number of examples of fish killed on the intake screens of power stations, especially smolting Salmon.

<p>Hi Dr. Anlace, Thanks for your contribution to <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvest_mouse.html" title="Harvest mouse">harvest mouse</a>. I felt bad removing it since it was clearly a situation where common names cause confusion. Once a <i>Reithrodontomys</i> page gets created we should see that a disambiguation statement is posted at the top that directs people there.</p>
<p>Instead of just deleting it outright I decided to create a new page (stub) at <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Harvest_Mouse_a7cd.html" title="Western Harvest Mouse">Western Harvest Mouse</a> to at least incorporate your image. As I was creating redirects to it, I found the page you started at <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_harvest_mouse.html" title="Western harvest mouse">Western harvest mouse</a>. Obviously we're talking about the same animal and the articles should be merged. I have done so, placing the two combined at <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_harvest_mouse.html" title="Western harvest mouse">Western harvest mouse</a>. I actually slightly prefer the lowercase use, but tend to find many Tree-of-Lifers ravenously pushing the all caps option. I don't care enough to debate them on every case so tend to do the all caps first. Please look over the article and make sure I didn't butcher it too much. Thanks again for delving into muroid rodents. There are too many red links over there. --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranae_c7be.html" title="User:Aranae">Aranae</a> 00:54, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, I have a reference for the lighting energy entry, but it's my own website and I didn't want to be accused of self-promotion.&#160;:) See <a href="http://michaelbluejay.com/electricity/lighting.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://michaelbluejay.com/electricity/lighting.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Incidentally, this is easy to prove by simply using a watt-hour meter, or looking at one's electric meter as the light is flipped on. It's not really that mysterious. -<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelbluejay_da97.html" title="User:Michaelbluejay">MichaelBluejay</a> 22:21, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Are any of your publications related to this topic available online? If so then I can reference it, and then it wouldn't be self-promotion -<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelbluejay_da97.html" title="User:Michaelbluejay">MichaelBluejay</a> 00:13, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Given your California experience, I can see why you're skeptical of the D.O.E.'s lighting percentage numbers. I live in the Chicago area, and to me those same percentages seemed too high! I did an energy audit for my house in 2005, and the total natural gas usage was (converting btu's to kwh) 37000 kwh. Total electric was 3360 kwh. Doing the math, electricity was only 8% of my total energy consumption. And of course lighting is only a fraction of that. I don't know if I'm typical for this area (about half my lights are compact fluorescents, and I don't have central A/C), but it's safe to say most folks around here spend a lot more money staying warm than we do staying illuminated.</p>
<p>I hope the DOE used some kind of nationwide sampling to include all these climate differences. Unfortunately that also means the data aren't that meaningful for energy consumers in a specific region. <a href="../../../i/n/n/User%7EInNuce_91db.html" title="User:InNuce">InNuce</a> 00:02, 6 March 2006 (UTC)==DYK <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congdon_silktassel.html" title="Congdon silktassel">Congdon silktassel</a>==</p>

<dd>the research data speaks for itself. other editors have made small changes but the article stands in much the tenor as written. we will all be hearing much more about ADMA in ten yrs. that seems to be about the length of time the medical establishment takes to absorb new facts&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/n/l/User%7EAnlace_5bdb.html" title="User:Anlace">Anlace</a> 21:46, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If so, please do no use this sock to review your articles, and do not vote twice on the same issue, whether for merging or anything, such as the merger discussion for California Least Tern.

"<b>In addition to double-voting, sock puppets should not be used for the purpose of deception, or to create the illusion of broader support for a position than actually exists.</b>" It is intensely unfair to other editors to do something of this nature that requires them to go through the formal process of establishing that you are a sock puppet, but it looks pretty straight-forward in the case of these two accounts, as Annasweden created an account, blue-linked her user and talk page, then went forward to start editing articles of your interest, and shares your interests in rivers of Scotland (although professing to be a Swede), architecture, Sonoma/Marin/Napa county rivers, environmental issues, and wildlife, and architectural vaults.

<p>I'm largely in agreement with you here. Barrel vaults are extremely significant to the development of western architecture, particularly the gothic, and ultimately should have it's own article. My problem is with the <i>destined to be expanded</i> - that's all well and good, but the article is a stub at the moment and could readily be incorporated into the vault article, now as it stands - the vault article needs expanding itself, because we can demonstrate the progression of development of the vault through its stages, starting with the barrel vault. Of course if the barrel vault article actually <b>is</b> expanded in the next week or so then, hell, why not keep it. So perhaps we can compromise on that - shall we say doubled in size in by the end of the month - or merge? --<a href="../../../m/c/g/User%7EMcginnly_76e7.html" title="User:Mcginnly">Mcginnly</a> | <a href="../../../m/c/g/User_talk%7EMcginnly_e9ad.html" title="User talk:Mcginnly">Natter</a> 20:41, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>your compromise proposal is acceptable regarding <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrel_vault.html" title="Barrel vault">barrel vault</a>. i assume to be in good faith your doubling measurement is based upon the stub version of the article when you installed the merger tag? <a href="../../../a/n/l/User%7EAnlace_5bdb.html" title="User:Anlace">Anlace</a> 21:45, 16 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>yeah of course - look I'm not trying to piss anyone off here - I think as things stand the articles could be merged - if they're improved to a point they can stand on their own then fine, let's keep them if not - if it's only 20% larger but 100% better then so much the better - brevity is the soul of wit - we'll all take a view at the end of the month. how does that sound? --<a href="../../../m/c/g/User%7EMcginnly_76e7.html" title="User:Mcginnly">Mcginnly</a> | <a href="../../../m/c/g/User_talk%7EMcginnly_e9ad.html" title="User talk:Mcginnly">Natter</a> 00:14, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. Just to respond to your comments on my talk page, I agree that there are lot of other biology pages out there in need of work, the reason I felt this was a high priority cleanup candidate was that it was at the time linked from the Main page, that the cleanup work wasn't trivial (e.g. spelling error, stub needing expansion), and that the problems with it were evident in the first few sentences of the lead. I agree that the 99% of the article is very good - as you say, thorough and well-referenced; it was because the not-so-good 1% was so visible that I felt we needed to highlight this with a cleanup tag. Looking at the page now, <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">User:jimfbleak</a> seems to have done a good job sorting things out - it's worth taking a look at his edits to see what he's done. <a href="../../../s/p/-/User%7ESP-KP_2816.html" title="User:SP-KP">SP-KP</a> 19:49, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

While does play a role in what is included in articles, it does not address in any way the questions I asked, that need to be addressed in the article to make it useful for readers, especially if this is a high importance California native plant.
