<p>Hi there again. I still don't see any great evidence to think that Monboddo was terribly influential on Darwin or his theories at all. I could imagine putting a small note about him in the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_evolutionary_thought.html" title="History of evolutionary thought">History of evolutionary thought</a> page but beyond that, it doesn't seem warranted. Here's all that Peter Bowler gives him in <i>Evolution: The History of an Idea</i> (3rd edn), after discussing Linnaues and Buffon's ideas about human nature:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>James Burnet, Lord Mondboddo, argued in the first volume of his</i> Of the Origin and Progress of Language<i>, published in 1774, that the apes might represent the earliest form of humanity. But he regarded humans (savages and apes) as quite distinct from the rest of the animal kingdom.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>He then goes from that to start discussing Lamarck at some length. I've yet to find any reference to Monboddo in any source on the history of evolution that made him sound really very consonant with what Darwin was doing. To say that Darwin's theory was only about apes and humans being related, which seems to be Monboddo's sole relevant contribution, is a gross misunderstanding of what Darwin was doing and what makes Darwin different than other evolutionary theories. Now, I again am first to admit that I don't know if that's all Monboddo was saying, but even the newer version of his page here doesn't give any real details about his scientific theories. All it currently contains is:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Finally one must remark that Burnett seemed strangely obsessed with man's relation to other primates. He clearly believed that the orangutan was a form of man; furthermore, he accepted an account of a Swedish explorer that reported one primitive tribe had tails. Most astonishingly, he at one time said that humans must have all been born with tails, that were simply removed by midwives at birth. His contemporaries ridiculed his views, but later commentators have seen him preceding the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin. In any case in his serious analysis he clearly argued that animal species adapted and changed to survive, and his observations on the morphological similarities of man to primates underscored his clear concepts of evolution.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Which still does not sound very much like Darwin to me at all. Arguing for blunt transmutationism is not the same thing as putting forward a real scientific theory of evolution, and Monboddo's statements look nothing at all like the sorts of things Darwin was saying. As for your other question -- I'm not a physicist, I'm a historian of science. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 01:54, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You're correct - that article could be fleshed out quite a bit. Regarding oil and rashes, I saw a report on the BBC about oil production, abandoned wells and pipeline leaks which resulted in the local kids suffering skin problems. There was no doctors around to treat the people and no-one was being compensated.

This has become a real "joke" or game to a few persons with whom I have disagreed in the past.

(it's getting fun))". We had a civil disagreement over his effort to remove all fair use images a while back. This was all started by <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> went on and on, I believe misinterpreting the guideline under <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_of_people_2346.html#Ordering_names_in_a_category" title="Wikipedia:Categorization of people">Wikipedia:Categorization of people#Ordering names in a category</a>. He then filed RfC, which doesn't even meet the requirements for the RfC and its gone on and on. Edgar de Evia was one of the most successful editorial photographers, yes with major credits and I have many of the tear sheets, but in many cases without the issues and dates. I have added some of this and am looking for more. Unless someone is current national news it's somewhat catch as catch can with who gets into editorial obits at the New York Times and one person that was out of the country would most likely have written it had she been here. Edgar even had credit on a number of photo spreads in the New York Times. All of this will come full circle in time, but it is annoying.

<dd>hi, i answered it on that talk page on sept 6 at 12:23 UTC. i didnt want to add to the turmoil, so i just said deletion of those stubs seems like a good idea. we seem to have too many stubs floating around here and who knows when or whether some of them will ever turn into articles. what do you think? sincerely <a href="../../../a/n/l/User%7EAnlace_5bdb.html" title="User:Anlace">Anlace</a> 16:30, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>i am really missing the question being asked by you. i didnt want to stir up an argument about anyone's past edits, so i didnt comment on Michael Hardy's "re-organization". now that you seem to belabour the matter i have tried to study his edits and dont find them to have a great impact. i m more interested in where we are going here than trying to criticise anyone's past edits. i think <a href="../../../p/o/i/Point_source.html" title="Point source">point source</a> should be as unified as possible. if the concensus is to have a separate point source (pollution) article, then so be it. i really would like to get rid of the multiplicity of stubs, but i would also like others to weigh in before i just start axing away. most of our readers are interested in the concept of <a href="../../../p/o/i/Point_source.html" title="Point source">point source</a> and all this fragmentation doesnt help them. if im still missing your question, kindly rephrase it. im not trying to dodge any question. frankly i cant make much sense of much of the talk page on <a href="../../../p/o/i/Point_source.html" title="Point source">point source</a> regards <a href="../../../a/n/l/User%7EAnlace_5bdb.html" title="User:Anlace">Anlace</a> 17:20, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello; I'm glad to see you're watching the page.. i didn't mean harm by my edits, and after looking at the national geographic and yahoo news article again, i still don't see what is in them that isn't in the press release? i noticed you didn't end up putting the references back anyway, so perhaps you had a change of heart? cheers, 131.111.220.6 10:56, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, sorry to bother you but the National Geographic makes no mention whatsoever of "assault weapons" they refer to automatic weapons, something completely different. While the true definition of "assault weapon" is a man-portable shoulder-fired rocket launcher (such as an AT-4, or LAW rocket) used to crack open bunkers and other hardened positions at the start of an assault, general usage defines an "assault weapon" as a semi-automatic firearm that is similar in name, appearance, or design to a fully automatic firearm or military weapon. Note that this term is not synonymous with assault rifle, which has an established technical definition. Please note semi-automatic, not automatic. The National Geographic source clearly states automatic weapon therefore it is not an assault wepon by very definition. I have been in the firearms trade for many, many years if I you ever need help naming weapons please do not hesitate to ask on my talk page. L0b0t 19:03, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The National Geographic article calls the weapons observed "automatic weapons" and the wildlife conservation article calls them "assault rifles". In any case, this thread is about a user deleting a significant reference and your discussion of nuances in weaponry underscores the importance of using multiple references to give the reader the broadest insights. thank you for helping me prove my point to anonymous user 131.111.220.6 <a href="../../../a/n/l/User%7EAnlace_5bdb.html" title="User:Anlace">Anlace</a> 19:14, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, I just need to interject here. An <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assault_weapon.html" title="Assault weapon">assault weapon</a> is a purely political construct relating to the prohibition of <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semiautomatic.html" title="Semiautomatic">semiautomatic</a> firearms, particularly the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_assault_weapons_ban.html" title="Federal assault weapons ban">Federal assault weapons ban</a>. The exception to this is the <a href="../../../s/m/a/SMAW_4dbc.html" title="SMAW">SMAW</a> and <a href="../../../s/r/a/SRAW_91c4.html" title="SRAW">SRAW</a>, which are multi-purpose man portable <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocket_launcher.html" title="Rocket launcher">rocket launchers</a>, and are the only such weapons used by the military with the label "assault weapon". An <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assault_rifle.html" title="Assault rifle">assault rifle</a> is a selective fire rifle or carbine firing an intermediate power cartridge, such as the <a href="../../../a/k/-/AK-47_b9b4.html" title="AK-47">AK-47</a> or the <a href="../../../m/-/1/M-16.html" title="M-16">M-16</a>. An <i>automatic weapon</i> may cover everything from a machine pistol to an <a href="../../../m/2/_/M2_machine_gun.html" title="M2 machine gun">M2 machine gun</a>; anything significantly larger is considered an <i>automatic cannon</i>. Note however that the media is woefully incorrect in its terminology, and will call anything that looks even vaugely military an <i>assault rifle</i> or <i>asault weapon</i>--usually while showing footage of people firing machine guns, to further mislead the audience. <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluzwup_2550.html" title="User:Fluzwup">scot</a> 20:49, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I saw that you have been changing the rankings on the talk pages. I don't have a problem that. In fact I was just using those articles as placeholders as I was creating the different assessment categories. I do have one other comment ... <a href="../../../r/u/e/Rueben_Martinez_4fae.html" title="Rueben Martinez">Rueben Martinez</a> is notable. --<a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a> 18:44, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>his article wouldnt exist unless he were notable. on the other hand, in terms of importance ranking within southern california, that's a much higher bar. most articles within the california domain are ranked low or mid; only a handful of articles have a higher ranking, eg the governor <a href="../../../a/n/l/User%7EAnlace_5bdb.html" title="User:Anlace">Anlace</a> 19:38, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This page was just moved by a user to the pagename <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halltorp.html" title="Halltorp">Halltorp</a> citing grammar. the fact is that Halltorps usually occurs in the literature and in spoken terms as the "s" ending. i am proposing to move this page to <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halltorps_Manor_20ce.html" title="Halltorps Manor">Halltorps Manor</a>, which satisfies the grammar interest of Tupsharru.

<p>Hi Anlace. I'm not sure how to respond to your message on my user talk page so that you can see it, so I'm posting it here as well. Otherwise, wouldn't you have to check my talk page to see if I've responded? In any case, thanks for the encouragement.</p>
<p>i would like to help with the article, but at this stage i need to learn much more. i still haven't read the whole farrell review, for instance&#160;:). one thing i find very frustrating with energy-related information is that it seems to be especially biased; people take strong positions on this issue. in one way this is good, because it means that people take energy issues very seriously as they should, and the debate is lively. in another way, it's very difficult to assess the viability of some solutions. for instance, when someone says that the energy density of a wind farm can be calculated from the fact that the <i>footprint</i> of a wind turbine is only 10 square meters, there is obviously a spin verging on dishonesty at work! the same applies to nuclear advocates who say that <i>all</i> issues surrounding environmental contamination and waste storage have been solved - if only people would listen. i would like to see the full-cost accounting for all energy systems. it's a big demand, but how else can one make informed decisions? how do you feel about this, Anlace? --Robert Turner 17:11, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was going to put the article in the lead with the image you suggested, but there's a conflict between the licence you uploaded the picture under and the watermark in the bottom-left corner of the image.

<p>The <i><a href="../../../c/e/a/Ceanothus.html" title="Ceanothus">Ceanothus</a></i> article should be ranked at least mid, in importance for California articles, it is a major world horticultural plant, it's not found only in California, but California is its center for diversity.

<p>As to <i><a href="../../../c/a/l/Calochortus_tiburonensis.html" title="Calochortus tiburonensis">Calochortus tiburonensis</a></i>, there are hundreds of other plants that are endangered, rare and endemic to California, I think over 100 California serpentine endemics alone.

<p>PS Thanks for taking the time to do this, though. I find tasks like categorizing, to be tedious, but they are one of the most useful things for making Wikipedia accessible to new contributors and experts. Also they create usable guidelines for established editors by rating needs to expand articles--in a more significant way than someone running through every short article and putting a "stub" or "expansion" tab on it. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 16:44, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>thanks for your input on the ceanothus article and for your feedback on my (otherwise) almost thankless task of categorizing. i agree with you that the evaluation and assessment of articles really helps novice and expert and is also a guide to those seeking to improve articles. i dont deem my assessments perfect, but i have broad enough knowledge to know they are a good start at the assessment process. as to tiburonensis. First of all i stand by my ranking of high importance, not only per endangered but also this plant is in the path of land development and has been cited in a number of marin county lawsuits over zoning issues. In general it is really a ratio matter. presently we only have about 10000 articles in proj california and i think there are articles on only about two dozen endangered California plants. thus i think all of those plants probably will fall unders "high" importance. at such time as we have articles on all the endangered plants we may also have 200,000 total calif articles and thus most of the endangered plant articles will probably merit a "high" rating still. your point is a good one and hopefully will stimulate more discussion on this matter. <a href="../../../a/n/l/User%7EAnlace_5bdb.html" title="User:Anlace">Anlace</a> 17:11, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, development alone won't do it, even in addition to the others, as there is pretty much not a single species in California that is not in the way of development. It's a cute plant, though, interesting to have been found so late in the game. I think there are certainly more than 2 dozen plant articles! I hope so! <i><a href="../../../a/r/c/Arctostaphylos.html" title="Arctostaphylos">Arctostaphylos</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../a/d/e/Adenostoma_fasciculatum.html" title="Adenostoma fasciculatum">Adenostoma fasciculatum</a></i> should be high because of their dominance of certain types of ecosystems, and for the former's extensive biodiversity in the state, the latter's role in Southern California wildfires--and 'cause the first one's purty and the second ones has a lovely scent, well probably not for those reasons. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 17:23, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, two dozen endangered is better. Still, Wikipedia is a bit slack in the botany department. No need to give me credit, if you agree and know the plants.
