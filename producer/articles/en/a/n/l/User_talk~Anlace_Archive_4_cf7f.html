<p>...is that the authorities in the field use it consistently, and for WP's purposes, it is spelled the same in all articles. I went to the trouble of removing all the hyphens from the term "honey bee" on the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colony_Collapse_Disorder_d922.html" title="Colony Collapse Disorder">Colony Collapse Disorder</a> page, and you put them back; the use of a hyphen is NOT the way bee scientists spell the name, nor is it used in any of the other articles on honey bees in WP. If you can find other articles which hyphenate it, you can help out by removing the hyphens in the future.

<p>Thank you for the comment! Right now I'm on a bit of a Bay Area history kick. Actually, if you're also interested in Bay Area history, or just the Bay Area in general, you might you consider joining <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_San_Francisco_Bay_Area_5ff9.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject San Francisco Bay Area">WikiProject San Francisco Bay Area</a>. It looks like you've made a number of contributions to Bay Area-related topics. I just created a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_San_Francisco_Bay_Area_History_of_the_Bay_Area_3c32.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject San Francisco Bay Area/History of the Bay Area">History of the Bay Area</a> page, and it'd be great if more people could contribute. If you'd like to join, just add your name to the <a href="../../../b/a/y/WP%7EBAY_7fdb.html#Members" title="WP:BAY">members</a> list. If not, no worries. Take care! — <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmiellaiendiay_0236.html" title="User:Emiellaiendiay">Emiellaiendiay</a> 18:35, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>i agree with you completely on this major rewrite. i almost added this tag yesterday. what do you think would make a good outline? i think we still need the history section...its the closest thing to actual content we have here. i also think we need some section related to <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy_conservation.html" title="Energy conservation">energy conservation</a>. regards. by the way great work on the Flue gas stack article. i think one of your works should be in the references though for completeness. if you dont add it ill have to take a best guess where to cite it <a href="../../../a/n/l/User%7EAnlace_5bdb.html" title="User:Anlace">Anlace</a> 20:32, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm happy to learn that we are in agreement that <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_heating.html" title="Central heating">Central heating</a> needs a re-write ... and, yes, the history section should stay in.

<p>Hello, thanks for your invite. I will consider it but have two pressing projects ahead.</p>
<p>Normally, I rate articles for the projects I am part of and do complimentary ratings for other projects that I feel will not mind me being <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a> like with the SFBA because I belong to the <a href="../../../c/a/l/WP%7ECAL_acbd.html" title="WP:CAL">WP:CAL</a>. Because I am a Recent Changes Patrol editor and due to the 1000 plus articles I have on Watch, I see a lot of pages that I try to help with small edits. I enjoy rating articles because usually that generates action from other projects or because another editor wants to bring up the article a class based upon some of the recommendations I have made.

<p>Some time ago, WikiProject California members had placed their project tags on all articles about California cities. Those tags have been in place for some time. Recently certain members of WikiProject Southern California, after discussion on that project's talk page (only), decided to remove the WikiProject <i>California</i> tags for (almost all) Southern California cities, and replace the tags with WikiProject <i>Southern</i> California tags - only.</p>
<p>That is, the WikiProject <i>Southern</i> California members didn't simply add the WikiProject Southern California tag to Southern California cities, the WikiProject <i>California</i> tags were completely removed. This was done apparently without consultation with the WikiProject California members.</p>
<p>We are gathering responses to the following questions on those projects' talk pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have a view whether the WikiProject California tag should be removed from a large number of cities in Southern California?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Do you have a view whether city article for Southern California cities should have more than one WikiProject tag?</li>

<dd>I dont know of a guideline, but it seems obvious to me that every non-USA reader need not be familiar with all the states, just as americans should not be expected to known all the provinces of a european country. even though the state in question, california, is well known, i think this common sense principle applies. regards. <a href="../../../a/n/l/User%7EAnlace_5bdb.html" title="User:Anlace">Anlace</a> 04:17, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If "permissions" is not meaningful to you, you probably should not be uploading images that are not yours. Any photograph copyrighted by another party must have that party's permission e-mailed to Wikipedia's permissions in order to be used on Wikipedia. The question is do you have permission to use John Games' images on Wikipedia? And it can be put on your talk page because it appears it may concern more than one image, if you indeed don't know what "permission" is. I will paste this all to the Image:Thornwort.jpg|left|200px|thumb page, also, as you're correct, these conservations should be had on those pages. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 03:11, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Real problem, wrong image (Image:Thornwort.jpg is a cropped version of Image:Jgameaduttoniihr.jpeg). I've added imagevio tags to both pages. I'm OK with discussion happening on the talk pages of the images, but <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">established procedures</a> also call for putting something on the talk page of the uploader. Here's the boilerplate for what to do next: == Copyright problems with Image:Jgameaduttoniihr.jpeg ==</dd>

<p>Hi Anlace. Thanks for the recent additions to the Light pollution article. I was wondering if you have any citations of sources available for the statements you've added, though. (Particularly the note about elevated blood pressure and stress under fluorescent lights, and the dimished sexual performance.) It wouldn't exactly surprise me too much for these claims to be completely true, but the article in general looks better if it can back things up with citations. Thanks. <a href="../../../i/z/o/User%7EIzogi_2699.html" title="User:Izogi">Izogi</a> 07:56, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi again. The updates are great -- thanks for taking the time. My own field of study is computer science, and my interest in light pollution has been a spinoff of my interest in amateur astronomy, so I'm not really an expert on something like <a href="../../../a/t/m/Atmospheric_diffraction.html" title="Atmospheric diffraction">atmospheric diffraction</a>. I'm happy to look at it all the same (will have to wait a couple of days). But yeah, I have a great appreciation for having references on things.</dd>
<dd>With light pollution in particular, I've noticed that there are a lot of people out there making quite big claims, but not properly backing them up. Even organisations like the IDA are hugely guilty of this with things like the information sheets they provide, I think, which I haven't found to be at all detailed about where the information's come from, where it applies, how up-to-date it is, and so on. Coming from an organisation that clearly has an agenda, it makes it that much harder to use un-sourced material, and for my own efforts, it's made it really difficult to be confident about anything I've tried to argue in front of people. I was just thinking it'd be great if the Wikipedia article could really out-do a lot of those other sources when it comes to actually providing references about the claims it makes. <a href="../../../i/z/o/User%7EIzogi_2699.html" title="User:Izogi">Izogi</a> 19:01, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do you have John Game's "express written permission" to upload his images to Wikipedia from CalPhotos? You told me to post on the image talk pages, and Kingdon did, but you failed to respond.

<dd>see the image talk page. should not be an issue. <a href="../../../a/n/l/User%7EAnlace_5bdb.html" title="User:Anlace">Anlace</a> 23:25, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please add explicit information to all images you upload from other photographers. Game is a federal worker, so I see no reason why he wouldn't do it, but for a professional photographer, they're giving away a lot of their rights to their artistic work via a Creative Commons license, like the right for others to make money off of their work without the permission of the photographer--I can make a calendar of Game's Wikipedia pictures and sell it, as long as I acknowledge him as the photographer, use it in pornographic clips, add it as a logo to my company brochures, as long as I end-license in the same manner and give credit. It's a lot of release of artistic license for a professional photographer, so it's useful to be very clear to Wikipedia users that this is precisely what has been done, in particular when the photographer has requested a much stricter license elsewhere on the Internet.

<dd>Thanks, they're great images. Oftentimes federal work cannot actually be copyrighted, so getting very high quality, well-identified images from a federal worker is a very sharp way of going about it--and for many of these obscure species, there simply are no great photographs. Just think of some form sentence to put when you upload them, you'll eventually get in the habit, and that will take care of it. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 00:28, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
