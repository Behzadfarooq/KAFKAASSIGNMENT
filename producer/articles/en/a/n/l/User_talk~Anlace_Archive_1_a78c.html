<p>I don't want to get off on the wrong foot here — you'll understand if I am a little skeptical, given the lack of information on this fellow and the fact that a high percentage of the websites which give him such credit are anti-Darwin sites. Priority disputes on Wikipedia science pages are quite common (there's on on the Albert Einstein page as well at the moment), and what is required in all cases is to make sure that it can be demonstrated that Wikipedia is reflective of significantly notable points of view, and not fringe points of view. This is not to say that there aren't ways for non-mainstream points of view to be incorporated into articles, and is certainly not meant to imply the correctness of one view over another. So if I am suspicious, just take it into context that in most cases I am used to people trying to push little agendas when they insert priority dispute information like this into articles, and it is nothing personal against you.

<dd>The problem is with the way you documented it. On the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Image_description_page.html" title="Image description page">Image description page</a>, you need to source any information you have on the underlying image, especially if you know when the image you photographed was created or published. If the images are over 100 years, they are probably public domain in the United States (which is where English Wikipedia's servers are located). Change the copyright tags to {{PD-art-US}} or {{PD-US}} and that should fix the issue -Thanks <a href="../../../n/v/8/User%7ENv8200p_b2e9.html" title="User:Nv8200p">Nv8200p</a> <a href="../../../n/v/8/User_talk%7ENv8200p_4d2d.html" title="User talk:Nv8200p">talk</a> 22:34, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><a href="../../../n/o/i/Noise_pollution.html" title="Noise pollution">noise pollution</a>, which now encompasses occupational exposure as well as urban and industrial settings</li>
</ul>
<p>The inclusion of marine environments was an implicit reference to military use of sonar impacting the "sound" habitat of marine mammals such as whales. I guess this is somewhat controversial but there are substantial scientific findings concerning this and sonar is sound, albeit underwater. Occupational exposure while you state it more explicitly, was already less prominently included under industrial settings. I would like to take this opportunity to caution against practicing deletion too liberally. Sometimes one can add to or modify without deleting what is already there to edit an article. -thanks, <a href="../../../o/n/c/User%7EOnceler_94a0.html" title="User:Onceler">Onceler</a> 16:46, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Paul Cyr ought to learn to give people time - only <b>four</b> minutes elapsed between your edit and Paul tagging your article for the first time. To avoid the problem, create your articles in user:Anlace/sandbox until it has established notability, then copy it to the permanent title. -- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 08:46, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Or not, since it's a <i>speedy deletion due to lack of notability</i>. If articles like the one in question are deserving of speedy deletion and no one marks them when they're listed as a new page, there's a good chance they'll never be noticed and just waste space. Now, given how many new pages get speedy deleted within the first 10 minutes, that's a lot of wasted space. In the future the contributor should place a {{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Template%7EHangon_38a0.html" title="Template:Hangon">hangon</a>}} tag on the page.<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Cyr_2f7a.html" title="User:Paul Cyr">Paul Cyr</a> 16:33, 26 January</li>

<p>What you've done so far is great, and very impressive. It is wikified, seems to be well written and informative, it's linked to by other articles (very important), I think interested people will see this article and work on it over time.</p>
<p>If you're really wanting to go the distance though, you can see <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_is_a_featured_article_4840.html" title="Wikipedia:What is a featured article">Wikipedia:What is a featured article</a>, which is about where you are on "the path to a featured article". The steps are laid out on that page (in the upper righthand corner), and if you follow them, you'll get a lot of help in further improving the page.

<p>You seem to be quite new to the FAC process. I have seen some of your votes on various Featured article Candidate pages, and I should tell you this: You need to read the rules, conventions and guidelines <b>before</b> voting. You have repeatedly used words like "Poorly written" or "awkward sentences' as reasons for votes. While this is acceptable, you need to cite <b>specific</b> instances in the article where the POV or poor grammar are. This enables the editors to correct them. Please read <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_c58c.html#Supporting_and_objecting" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates">Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates#Supporting_and_objecting</a> before voting again. Moreover, you cannot oppose an article because you think the topic is trivial. An important topic is not a <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_is_a_featured_article_4840.html" title="Wikipedia:What is a featured article">FA criterion</a>. In fact, even <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoe_Polish_305d.html" title="Shoe Polish">Shoe Polish</a> is a featured article.</p>
<p>I'm sure that most (if not all) of your oppose votes will be overlooked by the Fa director as they have failed to follow the voting guideline. <a href="../../../j/o/u/User%7EJournalist_823c.html" title="User:Journalist"><font color="navy">Oran</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../j/o/u/User_talk%7EJournalist_14df.html" title="User talk:Journalist"><font color="blue">(t)</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Journalist_65e6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Journalist"><font color="deepskyblue">(c)</font></a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Journalist_c8a5.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Journalist"><font color="mediumblue">(e)</font></a> 05:17, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>First, the sentence I removed was uncited. Second, I explained my rationale in the edit summary which is: "<a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_monoxide.html" title="Carbon monoxide">Carbon monoxide</a> present in tobacco smoke increases blood pressure and cardiovascular risk." is not a "Directly correlated benefits of smoke-free restaurants". There is no correlation there. If someone put up a source that said banning smoking in restaurants decreased carbon monoxide poisoning then it would make sense. Everything else in the section has a cited source and actually talks about how the ban correlates to the listed benefits. While carbon monoxide may be a health risk, the way it was written in the article did not relate back to a ban on smoking in restaurants. It just seems like someone threw in a random fact that just conflicts with the flow of the rest of the article. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheKoG_0143.html" title="User:TheKoG">TheKoG</a> 20:04, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I see you've edited the article to include more information. It makes a lot more sense now in relation to the topic as it doesn't just stand out as a random statement. <s>I'd say the only thing it needs now is a source and it's good to go.</s> Looks like it's good to go now.  :p --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheKoG_0143.html" title="User:TheKoG">TheKoG</a> 20:10, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You posted the above comment on the Talk page at <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dispersion_Modeling_of_Air_Pollutants_2f17.html" title="Dispersion Modeling of Air Pollutants">Dispersion Modeling of Air Pollutants</a>. As the primary author of the article, I disagree with you slightly. Having worked in the air dispersion modeling field for over 30 years, I am aware that it is often referred to as "air dispersion modeling" and as "atmospheric dispersion modeling". However, I have never seen the field referred to as "air dispersal modeling".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The reason for choosing the the current title when I contributed the article is simply that I felt it was more precise. The article is not about dispersion of the air nor about dispersion of the atmosphere. Rather it is about dispersion of air pollutants in the atmospheric air ... and therefore the current title is more precise.</dd>

<dd>I think an article on line source modeling would be very useful. As you may know, the EPA has a BLP line source model and a CALINE4 line source model as well as a HYROAD model. You might want to mention them in your proposed article. As for a title, how about "Air Dispersion Modeling of Line Sources" or "Air Dispersion Modeling of Roadway Sources"? I will watch for your further response here on your Talk page.<br /></dd>

<dd>AERMOD is definitely NOT a line source model. It is the latest general purpose model accredited by the EPA (just about 1-2 months ago) after a some years of developing the model. When you said you were unfamiliar with AERMOD (see above), you suggested doing an article on Line Source models and I agreed that was a good, alternative idea.</dd>

<p>Yeah, I don't really like the clarifiers in brackets. "Runoff (water)" probably irks me the most, though I have a clear bias. If this instance of runoff is not by far the most relevent "runoff", I'd feel more comfortable with "runoff (hydrology)", which is in line with every other "foo (bar-ology/-ist)" formulation. However, a superficial Google query returns sig more hydrology runoffs than voting runoffs.

<dd>It looks like there are nuances across disciplines. Looking at Web of Science, there are 16,409 records with "runoff", 3,167 with "river" and "runoff", and 446 with "river runoff". 446 is no small number in hydrology publications. I think of runoff as all encompassing, though I grant you in shorthand (when context is obvious) runoff may often be used to mean overland flow. When I need to be specific, I talk about overland flow or channel flow. (Searching "overland flow" yielded 1,375 results.) <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Collins_c8db.html" title="User:Daniel Collins">Daniel Collins</a> 05:55, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Click! "Surface runoff" is a good label (WebOfSci: 1,913 &gt; "overland flow"). I meant to stress that it was "runoff" that I considered universal, including both "surface runoff" and "river runoff" (or channel flow). I reckon there should not be one page on both types of runoff, because their physics are sufficiently different. So...
<ul>
<li>"runoff (hydrology)": general discussion of water movement over land; points to "surface runoff" and to "river runoff" (aka channel flow);</li>
<li>"surface runoff": non-channelized flow;</li>
<li>"river flow": river flow.</li>
</ul>

<p>I just now noticed that you had left me a message about the Carmel/Carmel-by-the-Sea issue. Please understand that I was not ignoring you, but since you left the message on my User page instead of my Talk page, I didn't see it until just now. :) I hope that the current situation (with the notation that Carmel-by-the-Sea is commonly referred to as "Carmel" being a bit further down in the article) is acceptable to you. I had no particular interest in it going in the opening line (it just seemed to be common practice, such as at <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhode_Island_988e.html" title="Rhode Island">Rhode Island</a>), I just felt that it needed to be stated at some point, seeing as how the article body used "Carmel" almost exclusively, and otherwise a non-local reader might be confused. As far as people actually referring to it by the full name... well, I'm from the SF Bay Area, and we all seem to call it Carmel up here. When I visit down in the Monterey area, I usually hear people there refer to it as Carmel as well, but I grant that your experience with the matter is likely more wide-reaching than mine. :) Nevertheless, please reflect that even "official" sources often abbreviate the name, as an example, see <a href="http://www.carmelcalifornia.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.carmelcalifornia.org/" rel="nofollow">this</a> and look at the address of the <a href="http://www.carmelcalifornia.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.carmelcalifornia.com/" rel="nofollow">official website for the city</a>. In any event, I think the current state of the article is fine, and I hope that we're past any arguments over it. P.S. I never edit under an alias. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 19:09, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>why do you link to an article in spin wave? Robert M. White I've at least heard of, and he arguably deserves an article based on his long career of contributions to magnetism, his leadership of the Center at CMU and his tenure as Undersecretary of Commerce in the Clinton Administration.

<dd>Could it be that you considered [[California clapper rail to be a high priority to put another link in it? I appreciate that you have done some high quality work on a variety of articles but that doesn't excuse links. Either defend the works you've referenced or take them back out again! <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaiken_deb8.html" title="User:Chaiken">Alison Chaiken</a> 04:53, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Let me make myself clear: I don't think you should remove just the links; I think you should remove all the references to et al. papers too. That doesn't mean you just remove the list of authors; that means remove the entire reference to all papers I'm not trying to be mean but simply don't believe that all this belongs in Wikipedia. Since I post under my real name, you can easily verify that I have written a bunch of scientific papers and that I have never referenced one of them. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaiken_deb8.html" title="User:Chaiken">Alison Chaiken</a> 06:11, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>I got your message regarding noise pollution et al. I haven't had a chance to respond there (I just got off work), but I thought I'd leave you note about talk pages, specifically the use of indentation to help organize the conversation. <a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_page_guidelines_82c6.html#Layout" title="Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines">Wikipedia:Talk_page_guidelines#Layout</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<b>Use indenting to keep the threads of the conversation straight:</b> The first contributor is all the way to the left, the next person starts with one colon (:), the next person starts with two colons. Then, when the first contributor responds, they start at the left margin again, and the second and third persons continue to mark themselves with one and two colons respectively. In that way, who is saying what is clear. Other indentation systems are equally acceptable and widely used (such as a threaded tree format, like that often seen in email clients)."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Obviously no one is perfect and I sometimes forget to indent my own comments. I've indented some of your comments and I thought I'd let you know how to do it yourself. <a href="../../../h/y/a/User%7EHyacinth_44fa.html" title="User:Hyacinth">Hyacinth</a> 15:16, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>thanks for the invitation. ive browsed and weighed in a little bit. is it possible to suggest "environmental science as one of the "sciences" regards <a href="../../../a/n/l/User%7EAnlace_5bdb.html" title="User:Anlace">Anlace</a> 17:51, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One of the "sciences" regarding what? The environmental sciences are certainly part of history of science (even if we haven't turned much attention to them yet on the wikiproject). Did you have a place in mind where it should be mentioned but isn't? Thanks,--<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagesoss_e992.html" title="User:Ragesoss">ragesoss</a> 18:53, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
