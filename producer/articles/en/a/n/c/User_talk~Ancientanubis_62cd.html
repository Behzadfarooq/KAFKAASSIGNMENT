<p>I tried using this: Userboxtop|Location &lt; for the top of the section and then &gt; Userboxbottom at the end of each section. (with of course the {{ }} on either side)</p>
<p>Like so:</p>
<dl>

<dd>Inserted box here</dd>
<dd>br</dd>
<dd>Userboxbottom</dd>

<dd>Inserted other box here</dd>
<dd>Userboxbottom</dd>
<dd>Userboxbottom</dd>
</dl>
<p>Then when you add the brackets it looks like this:</p>
<table class="userboxes" style="margin-left: 1em;; margin-bottom: 0.5em; width: 248px; border: #99B3FF solid 1px; background-color: #FFFFFF; color: #000000; float: right;">

<p>Thanks for uploading Image:NERV.jpg. Wikipedia gets hundreds of images uploaded every day, and in order to verify that the images can be legally used on Wikipedia, the source and copyright status must be indicated. Images need to have an <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">image tag</a> applied to the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_description_page_4215.html" title="Wikipedia:Image description page">image description page</a> indicating the copyright status of the image. This uniform and easy-to-understand method of indicating the license status allows potential re-users of the images to know what they are allowed to do with the images.</p>

<p>Thank you for putting up your userboxes in the <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUserboxes_Anime_aec4.html" title="Wikipedia:Userboxes/Anime">Anime section</a>. However, I have observed that you used images with copyright problems or fair use images. Unfortunately, that's not allowed; <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUserboxes_3753.html#Preliminary_notes" title="Wikipedia:Userboxes">only free images are allowed in userboxes</a>. So like it or not, your userboxes will be modified. Sorry. - <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanami_Kamimura_a5ae.html" title="User:Nanami Kamimura">上村七美</a> | <a href="../../../n/a/n/User_talk%7ENanami_Kamimura_a618.html" title="User talk:Nanami Kamimura">talk</a> 09:39, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a href="../../../n/a/n/User_talk%7ENanami_Kamimura_a618.html" title="User talk:Nanami Kamimura">Continuing on the topic</a>... I've already told you; your userboxes have to be modified because putting up images that either are of fair use or copyrighted, <i>even if it is yours</i> or <i>it is a screenshot</i>, is not allowed in userboxes. It is Wikipedia's policy. So I had to replace the images with text or (as in the case of {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser_Straw_Hat_8dd1.html" title="Template:User Straw Hat">User Straw Hat</a>}}) a free image. Even if you made it, if the image has a copyright problem, it is still not allowed. You have to read that policy to fully understand yourself. (I once did two months ago!) As a side note, IMHO you are making the gallery redundant because the kinds of userboxes you put up are already present when you posted your own. Take a good look. - <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanami_Kamimura_a5ae.html" title="User:Nanami Kamimura">上村七美</a> | <a href="../../../n/a/n/User_talk%7ENanami_Kamimura_a618.html" title="User talk:Nanami Kamimura">talk</a> 08:33, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You still don't get it. In simpler terms, the policy says that <i>screenshots, logos, and most images taken from the internet are not allowed in userboxes</i>. If you made the images yourself (as in the case of your FMA logo), say so in the image's description page. The lowdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>The GITS logo you used was once used in the GITS template already there when you posted yours. It was removed and "GITS" was added later. It was labelled "Fair use in...," which means that it can only be used in the GITS article and never elsewhere.</li>
<li>The NERV logo you used has a copyright problem. I bet it is a logo, which is not allowed in userboxes (as already mentioned).</li>
<li>The Straw Hat Pirates logo was classified as a screenshot. As already mentioned, screenshots are not allowed.</li>
<li>You said that you made the outlined FMA logo yourself, but its description page said that you found it in the net. If that really <i>is</i> from the internet, that is not allowed either in userboxes. But if it is yours, change its description to say that you made it and I'll be happy to reinstate that image in your FMA template (as well as the other two FMA ones).</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, if you wanted your images back, suit yourself. You can revert it. But be prepared to see your userboxes deleted or be reminded by another user (not me) later on. I've already forwarded your complaints to a third party to settle this. - <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanami_Kamimura_a5ae.html" title="User:Nanami Kamimura">上村七美</a> | <a href="../../../n/a/n/User_talk%7ENanami_Kamimura_a618.html" title="User talk:Nanami Kamimura">talk</a> 23:23, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I fully agree with what 上村七美 has said above. Regardless of how you came across the images (screenshots, logos, etc.) in question, if their copyright holder hasn't released them under a free license, they can only be used on Wikipedia as <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair-use images</a>. While fair-use images are allowed for limited use in the encyclopedia (which is why <a href="../../../g/i/t/Image%7EGits-laughing-man.jpeg_37ca.html" title="Image:Gits-laughing-man.jpeg">Image:Gits-laughing-man.jpeg</a> is available and used in the <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laughing_Man_%28Ghost_in_the_Shell%29_e14e.html" title="Laughing Man (Ghost in the Shell)">Laughing Man article</a>), the use of fair-use images is strictly prohibited in user pages and userboxes. Item nine of our official policy on <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">Fair use criteria</a> is quite clear:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Fair use images should be used <b>only</b> in the article namespace. Used outside article space, they are often enough not covered under the fair use doctrine. They should never be used on templates (including stub templates and navigation boxes) or on user pages.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>While I appreciate that you want to do your favorite anime justice by making the related userboxes look nice, you do need to steer clear of using and uploading fair-use images. To understand why, I think it's useful to keep in mind that our primary purpose here is the creation of an encyclopedia. Fair-use images are allowed for limited use in encyclopedia articles for those situations where free alternative images aren't available, as that furthers our goal of improving the encyclopedia. However, since we are "the <b>free</b> encyclopedia", it's important that we keep the use of non-free fair-use images to a minimum. Now, there is no similar <i>need</i> to use non-free images on user pages (i.e., outside the encyclopedia)—using such images to decorate user pages is unnecessary, and so we can better comply with our goal of using only free content by prohibiting their use in user pages and userboxes.</p>
<p>I hope this helps you understand the current situation with fair-use images and userboxes. I can try and answer any questions you might have. — <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffrey_Smith_c619.html" title="User:Jeffrey Smith">Jeff</a> | <a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffrey_Smith_e194.html" title="User talk:Jeffrey Smith">(talk)</a> | 09:40, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>(edit conflict with 上村七美) The "lowdown" specified above is a good explanation of <i>why</i> these images are fair use. The only comment I'd make is that the situation with the FMA logo might be a bit dicey, even if it is an "original" work and not something from the web. The description of Image:Full metal crucified serpent.jpg says that it came from a manga scan. Now, if you modified that manga scan in order to create that image, then I believe your version represents a "derivative work". IANAL, but I think that you can't freely license something that's heavily derived from someone else's original, copyrighted work. If my thinking is correct, since the scans of the original manga could only be used as fair-use images, then derivative works from those scans might also be fair-use images. I'm not sufficiently versed on fair use law to speak definitively on this, but I'd probably advise erring on the side of caution. — <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffrey_Smith_c619.html" title="User:Jeffrey Smith">Jeff</a> | <a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffrey_Smith_e194.html" title="User talk:Jeffrey Smith">(talk)</a> | 09:55, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For the licensing, manga is considered "comic book" equivalent.

<p>Um let's here what anime/manga is this for? And what are you doing with this stuff again (I may have missed that part)?

<dd>You could do something like that but before you do try it out on something like <a href="../../../a/c/i/User%7EAcientanubis_O_Parts_3766.html" title="User:Acientanubis/O Parts">User:Acientanubis/O Parts</a> and make the article like normal but don't add things like categories or templates because it might confuse people (and add a explanation about what the article is). So this way you can see how it looks but not screw anything up. Good luck. ^_^ <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_ov_the_blue_sand_359d.html" title="User:Sam ov the blue sand"><span style="color: #ff0000">Sam</span> <span style="color: #000000">ov</span> <span style="color: #000000">the</span> <span style="color: #0000ff">blue</span> <span style="color: #808000">sand</span></a> 23:32, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Um, I was actually just fiddling around with the grid with the angels, but I am a fan of this manga, and I think making that separate page on the O-Parts is a neat idea. And I was really happy when I saw your changes to the page, cuz it was really dull before.

<dd>Uh, I dont know about the setting up a collaboration thing. It's nothing personal, but it's not like I edit on wiki every day or anything, but recently I've been reading 666 Satan and got caught up in it. And I did add a few things on the O-Parts page a while ago, you know, like the "Chapter First Appeared" stuff. Oh, and I got an account (stupid, stupid of me to not think of doing that earlier). Anyways, I just dont want to be expected to work on it everyday, or anything like that, and my experience in editing on wikipedia isnt as great as you think it is.&#160;;-P.

<p>Oh, the character page was a good idea. But do you think you can find that much info on all the o-parts? I mean, some of them dont really have that much of a history or anything. Well, i guess we should do what we can so far and find out. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 21:20, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok, sure, and some of the info on the main page is actually useful, so we can copy some of it onto the new pages. I guess 666 Satan wasnt as well-known before, so no one really did anything with the site. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 21:30, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think they used to have a list of OPTs of the O-parts on the old grid too, so that's a good idea. And I don't think you really need to add anything more for the description of Ashura, cuz that's pretty much all that's there to tell. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 22:10, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok, I added just a teeny bit to the Ashura part. I dont know if that made it better, but I think its still ok... <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 22:18, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ha, sorry about rewriting the o-part effect all over again, it was just sort of a pet peeve i have. Sure, if you can find info on the history on the o-parts, then by all means, put it in. I was just saying before that some of the o-parts dont really have a history, thats all. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 22:27, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hey, the "Flying Fish" o-part is the Ophan, right? Just wanted to check. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 22:40, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>didnt they already separate it into a big one and a little one? or do u mean that ruby changed the big one a little, u know, when she flipped it over? <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 23:04, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>well, there is a big one and a little one. i think the big one's the one everyone uses after the time-skip. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 23:24, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>uh, i dunno. all i know is that the little one was used before the timeskip, just before they went to rock bird city <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 23:35, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>um, actually, it says "ophan", not "orphan", and the manga scans i read say "ophan", too. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 03:03, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>ok, well, adding most of the character first appearances arent that hard, since ruby &amp; jio are in ch.1, and u can just read chapter titles to guess most of the rest. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 03:42, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>awesome pic for the crew of the ophan! and as for the cool ball, do u think u can find a pic with the whole thing? cuz the ones u have are either too blurry or like part of it is missing. if u cant, its cool, just use the one where hes holding it in his hand. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 05:20, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>um, it was outdoors, at a park, cuz the other team didnt have their own swimming pool. and the water felt really thick for some reason. but freestyle's my best stroke (I cant do butterfly to save my life), so it was ok. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 06:14, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>thx, im sort of just rereading the manga and adding pics and info i find along the way. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 09:06, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>ok, i voted for the thing on the talk page. i do think that 666 satans a much better title. lets hope everyone agrees. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 04:50, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>hey, i found that ch. 35 has a lot of pics of tennyo, u know, anna's o-part, but its really late now, so maybe u could look through that when u get the chance. cya tomorrow if i have time. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 09:02, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>yeah...im still working on it...but all of a sudden my teachers seem to think its ok for them to cram in as much work as they can before finals, so i might get slower for awhile. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 05:39, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>k, thx <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 05:53, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>well, they didnt specifically say that michael was destroyed, but im pretty sure he was, since cross blasted him and that giant ball he turned into shattered. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 21:26, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>um, so what exactly did the article say? i looked at it and i cant read italian, so...&#160;:-P<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 22:40, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>i didnt really get it. i guess they say theres a poster coming out and something about Anime Land and Seishi Kishimoto or something... <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 22:57, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>u know what, i honestly dont know. but if u do, then maybe its ok to put the chapter list in its own page too, since its pretty long. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 03:01, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>i dont think the main page has to be too long. but we could definitely write a better plot summary, cuz the synopsis we currently have is really vague. but we'll probably have more info to put if an anime comes out.^^ <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 04:03, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would be happy to be part of any debate about the series, I want to know what subjects still need attention, outside of adding first appearances and pics. Dead by Pickle 07:54, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Indirectly, yes. It was done by Viz Media to avoid "certain reprocussions" from religious and parental groups. On a side note, I would indeed support it, Anubis. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilgohan2_f7d8.html" title="User:Evilgohan2">Evilgohan2</a> 00:14, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well then yes because O parts hunter is Viz's version (An American version) so since 666 Satan is the English translation then it should be 666 Satan.<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_ov_the_blue_sand_359d.html" title="User:Sam ov the blue sand"><span style="color: #ff0000">Sam</span> <span style="color: #000000">ov</span> <span style="color: #000000">the</span> <span style="color: #0000ff">blue</span> <span style="color: #808000">sand</span></a> 00:16, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In response to your message on my talk page, page move discussions are to be held on the article's talk page.

<p>yeah, my dads a tech freak too. but i already tried the wii out at my friend's house, and it was a lot of fun. u should have seen the look on my bro's face when he played boxing, it was priceless. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 05:00, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>aw, thats too bad. even on my orchestra trip some guys brought theirs and played it in the hotel. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 05:17, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>WOW, that is a lot. my house also has 4 computers (and one system box that my dad just keeps lying around) and 1 laptop, but all we have, really, are 2 old nintendo consoles and our own individual gameboy colors &amp; advance SPs (my brother asked for a gamecube, but our dad told him he couldnt get one until he learned to speak spanish -_-). <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 06:37, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>ok, i was working on that chapter list site, and i found that some of the chapter titles looked like they were stuck through a translator or something. i mean i almost laughed my head off when i saw that chapter 18 was called "Of Plain-Pied in the Way Sinueuse of Life!" (it's actually "the road full of hardships"). oh, and chapter 41 was left blank cuz it wasnt translated, but i can read some chinese, and i think it says "hope", so im gonna put that in. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 08:06, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>k, thx. btw, ur link to the bleach chaps didnt work, but i found the site anyway and it looked cool too. i think some of the other chapter titles are in chinese too, so im gonna work on translating those. ch 49 literally means "starting a fight", but i think it would be better to find a prettier way to say that. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 18:49, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>well, that would be all of the ones that are blank, so that would be 42, 45, 49, 55, 61, &amp; 62, so if u could get any of those that would be great. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoselia92_c090.html" title="User:Roselia92">Roselia92</a> 21:13, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
