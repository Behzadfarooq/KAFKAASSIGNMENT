	    <p>This article was horribly unbalanced (and I tried to fix it a bit). The original article didn't reflect the fact that the term "anchor baby" is deeply offensive to many. A couple of points to consider.</p>
<p>1. The term is used in an exclusively derogatory way by one side of a contentious political debate.</p>
<p>2. It is hard to imagine the term being used as anything other than a slur. Do you think a mother would call her daughter "my anchor baby"? Can you imagine using this term to describe a co-worker?</p>
<p>There is also a problem with the description of the core idea of the 14th amendment as a "loophole" which clearly reflects a political bias.</p>

<p>This is inaccurate: "While a parent of a US born baby can apply for citizenship, I believe that, legally, the parents do not get any automatic claims of citizenship upon the birth of their child in the US. There may be an advantage upon applying for citizenship, but until that porcess is done, the parents are still illegal and subject to deportation. I think seperate points on the perception of the people who use this term, the probably mistaken beliefs of the immigrants who try this, and the actual legal status of anchor baby parents needs to be clarified" 00:26, 18 November 2006 (UTC)<a href="../../../c/u/v/User%7ECuvtixo_68cc.html" title="User:Cuvtixo">Cuvtixo</a></p>

<p><b>"As a matter of historic legal precedent, an alien entering any foreign country subjects himself to the jurisdiction of that country, unless exempted by war or treaty. In application, a modern sovereign state has jurisdiction over all foreigners within its territory except foreign heads of state, diplomats and other high-level government figures."</b></p>
<p>The United States always considered children born in the western territories as alien children still under the jurisdiction of their native country and not the United States. When a visitor arrives to any of the states he/she is under no binding jurisdiction of that state and is free to return home at any time he/she chooses. Only time you can say anyone is remotely under the jurisdiction of a state or federal government is when he or she violates a law and is brought under the jurisdiction of a court having jurisdiction by a process of law. Quoting PA Madison here: <b>"The only recognized means for non-Americans to come under US jurisdiction for purposes of citizenship under the US Constitution is through the process of naturalization, which requires an oath of allegiance to the United States."</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>This statement is a nearly direct quote from a Supreme Court ruling, and is highly accurate as a statement of historical fact and current implementation. Perhaps, there is confusion over the term <i>jurisdicition</i>? There are different types and extents of jurisdiction. In reference to a state's authority to arrest and punish criminals, or provide civil services, being inside it's boundaries is all the jurisdiction it needs. This is referred to in Plyler vs. Doe. For example, even foreign diplomats can be issued traffic citations, and charged with capitol crimes such as murder. However, their children are not considered within the jurisdicition of the United States, in terms of their citizenship.

<p>If the statement is entirely correct then why did federal statutes make a distinction between an alien within the limits of the United States and an alien under the jurisdiction of the same? Also, wasn't the 14th's citizenship clause a virtue of "national law" and not "common law" as the Kim Ark court mistakenly believed? I think Madison and others have demonstrated beyond a doubt that the citizenship clause was simply declaratory of national law which was only persons born to parents owing no foreign allegiance to another country were US citizens.</p>
<p>The legislative history and text eventually trumps and rules over the Supreme Court...this how bad Supreme Court rulings of the past finally get corrected over time. If this wasn't true we still be living under Dred Scott jurisprudence.</p>
<p>You know, writings of J. Madison, T. Jefferson, C. Thomas, et. al, are not considered by liberals as objective "mainstream legal analysis" anymore. Only thing considered objective anymore is what 5 liberal activists justices say is mainstream&#160;:-)</p>

<p>I added some information about the Fourteenth Amendment, and some information about currently proposed legislation. I also tried to clean as much bias as possible out of the definition. The previous one was simply too opinionated, and read as though written by someone who hated the term. I must say, I had always thought that everyone born in the US was an automatic citizen, until I researched this.

<dd>Please don't add novel legal interpretations based on your own reading of the Constitution and case law. As it happens, the practice of giving citizenship to the native-born children of foreign nations is part of the common law and has been recognized since beofer the 14th amendment.
<ul>
<li><i>It thus clearly appears that by the law of England for the last three centuries, beginning before the settlement of this country, and continuing to the present day, aliens, while residing in the dominions possessed by the crown of England, were within the allegiance, the obedience, the faith or loyalty, the protection, the power, and the jurisdiction of the English sovereign; and therefore every child born in England of alien parents was a natural-born subject, unless the child of an ambassador or other diplomatic agent of a foreign state, or of an alien enemy in hostile occupation of the place where the child was born. The same rule was in force in all the English colonies upon this continent down to the time of the Declaration of Independence, and in the United States afterwards, and continued to prevail under the constitution as originally established.</i></li>
<li><i>The decision in Elk v. Wilkins concerned only members of the Indian tribes within the United States, and had no tendency to deny citizenship to children born in the United States of foreign parents of Caucasian, African, or Mongolian descent, not in the diplomatic service of a foreign country.</i><a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=169&amp;invol=649" class="external autonumber" title="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=169&amp;invol=649" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>

<dd>I will point out that in both <i>Elk v. Wilkins</i>, and <i>Wong Kim Ark</i>, the Supreme Court reviewed the historical precedent (pre-Constitution and pre-14th Amendment), and found that both <i>jus sangui</i> and <i>jus soli</i> were practiced in the different jurisdictions, without any particular uniformity. <i>Jus soli</i> was more common, but its applications to foreigners was varied. For example, some jurisdictions didn't recognize the children of visitors, while others did. Magic pumpkin 21:59, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An editor changed the adjective describing the term "anchor baby" from "pejorative" to "colloquial" with the edit summary "in no way is it intended to be pejorative". I beg to differ. The term is only used by immigration restrictionists, immigration reductionists, and racists to label the children of "illegal" immigrants. The use of the term is pejorative in that it presumes that children born to these immigrants are born specifically and only for the purpose of "anchoring" the family in the U.S. This supposition is offensive to the children and the families they are born into because it assumes that the children are being birthed for financial gain and doesn't take into consideration a wide range of other factors that bring about children. The term may be colloquial, but it is also highly offensive, and denigrates the children and their parents.--<a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockero_6950.html" title="User:Rockero">Rockero</a> 20:49, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The term is often used in presentations, papers, and news articles. However, I do agree that it can be used in a derogatory manner; although, that honor, it seems, is more often reserved for Jackpot Baby. I think the best solotion is to leave it adjective-less, with reference to its sometimes offensive character. Since we have merged Jackpot Baby with this article, the term <b>should</b> be mentioned. As to the history of these terms, do we really know from where they originated? Magic pumpkin 21:05, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just because a term is used as derogatory by some or many people does not make it so. Often times people are refered to as conservativeor as liberal... often as talk show hosts, reporters and activists, not just politicans. Both times it is as a way to place insult to the person it is refering to (liberal judges, conservative radio host). But these are not prejorative. Likewise, the term "anchor" is a descriptive term meant to describe the situation, not what a mother would call their own child. So, when somebody like myself uses anchor baby, it is to place a desciption that explains the real occurance (there, you now have seen the term used without hate or prejuduce). So I say we should remove the adjective "prejorative" or add a second sentance stating the some or many people believe the term to be so. Otherwise we would have most adjectives that might be offensive like "fat", "liberal", "christian", "powerful" and and race aimed descriptor. 68.48.174.136 14:45, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wikipedia already has a nice definition for Wong Kim Ark (WKA). For purposes of being concise, this section was shortened to include only the immediatley applicable facts of WKA. Specifically, I am refering to Paragraphs 2, "Wong Kim Ark was born in", through 4 (exclusive), "There have been several subsequent". Paragraph 3 mostly contained snippets from the decision; however, containing random snippets, cited out of context, is befitting of an AP news wire, not a proper definition. More importantly, these snippets were either moot, not part of the actual opinion (although cited as such), or cited with improper context. The first, was the opinion of the the Collector of Customs, which was overturned. The second quotation was NOT the opinion of the court. It was a fact presented to the court, which both parties (plaintif and defendant) were in agreement to, and restated in the sumary of the ruling. The third was indeed part of Section V of the opinion, but it's context is as a hypothesis, not a conclusion.</p>
<p>Also, in paragraph I, the phrase, "the Supreme Court extended U.S. jurisdiction to include all aliens", was incorrect. The decision in WKA is <b>only</b> applied to the children of aliens who are amicably within the US with the permission of the US, as indicated by the conclusions of the High Court:</p>

Such allegiance and protection were mutual,-as expressed in the maxim, 'Protectio trahit subjectionem, et subjectio protectionem,'-and were not restricted to natural-born subjects and naturalized subjects, or to those who had taken an oath of allegiance; but were predicable of <b>aliens in amity</b>, so long as they were within the kingdom.</i> -The finding in Section II of the ruling.</li>

<p>Is anyone aware of any legal basis whereby a US-born child of illegal aliens might be deemed not to be subject to US jurisdiction for purposes of the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause (and thus not a US citizen) — and yet <i>would</i> be deemed to be subject to US jurisdiction for purposes of criminal prosecution if he/she were to be accused of committing a crime later on? It seems to me that such a person could end up being immune to prosecution (for exactly the same reasons that foreign diplomats have <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diplomatic_immunity.html" title="Diplomatic immunity">diplomatic immunity</a>). I really doubt this is what the people pushing for limits on "anchor baby" citizenship would want. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichwales_1fa0.html" title="User:Richwales">Richwales</a> 04:55, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Diplomatic Immunity" is pretty much a Hollywood creation. Foreign diplomats may be issued traffic citations, interviewed for investigations of capitol crimes, and may be charged with capitol crimes, such as murder. There are multiple types of jurisdiciton. For purposes of arrest and trial, being within a country's borders is enough. Plyler v. Doe established that, for purposes of providing civil services, being within a state's borders is enough. However, for purposes of citizenship, simply being within the country is NOT enough. This is outlined in both Elk v. Wilkins and Wong Kim Ark. Both of these rulings recognize that <i>jurisdiction</i>, in terms of citizenship, is a two-way street. Not only does the country need to recognize the parents as part of its society, but the parents must subject themselves to the authority of the country.

<dd>It amazes me at how a single footnote in Plyler v. Doe is taken out of context to support arguments of jurisdiction which pertain to citizenship. The footnote references Justice Gray's review of <i>Jus Soli</i> and jurisdiction, in which he concludes that being within the territory is equivalent to being within the jurisdiction. This was necessary because the State of Texas asserted that illegal aliens were not within its jurisdiction, for the purposes of "equal protection" and "due process", as stated in the phrase which referenced the footnote. <i>In appellants' view, persons who have entered the United States illegally are not "within the jurisdiction" of a State even if they are present within a State's boundaries and subject to its laws. Neither our cases nor the logic of the Fourteenth Amendment supports that constricting construction of the phrase "within its jurisdiction."</i> A footnote is a <b>reference</b>, and in this case, Plyler v. Doe only references a discussion in Wong Kim Ark, and does not add to or alter that discussion on citizenship.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Further more, Plyler v. Doe was <b>only</b> about "equal protection" and "due process". To conclude that Plyler v. Doe somehow recognizes the US born children of illegal aliens as being natural citizens goes beyond the fundamentals of Law. As Chief Justice Marshal stated, <i>It is a maxim, not to be disregarded, that general expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions are used. If they go beyond the case, they may be respected, but ought not to control the judgment in a subsequent suit when the very point is presented for decision.</i> What this means, is that when jurisdicition is discussed in Plyler v. Doe, it is discussed as it pertains to "equal protection", not citizenship. Wong Kim Ark and Elk v. Wilkins still stand as the predominant Supreme Court rulings on citizenship. Within Justice Gray's referenced discussion from WKA, for the purposes of citizenship, he does briefly touch on the principle of allegiance as being an important factor in determining citizenship. Plyler v. Doe does nothing to contradict this. Moreover, Plyler v. Doe really does nothing for the topic of jurisdicition in general, as it only references the previous works, and developes no new logic. It only re-affirms the concept that a person within the boundaries of a state is subject to the laws of that state.</dd>

<dd>BTW, it is my opinion that the State of Texas simply used the wrong arguments to support its education funding legislation. After PvD, many states granted unconstrained access to the public schools only to citizens, with a vetting process which required non-citizens to petition the local school districts for admission to the local schools. It is rare for non-citizens to be denied admission to a public school, but it does happen, usually if the district has reason to believe the prospective student will not attend the school regularly, lacks the fascilities to make proper use of the school, or may only attend a fraction of the school year.

I also recommend that redirects from PRUCOL and 'Anchor baby' be created and pointed to the new article.71.74.209.82 20:50, 4 August 2006 (UTC) Also that all content in the 14th Amendment of the United States article on the topic of the citizenship of illegal immigrants born in the USA be merged with this article as well.71.74.209.82 21:04, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This article should retain its current name without additions. Just because some consider it perjorative is not grounds for change.

<dd>I concur. Simply because some people take offense to a term is no reason to abandon an article. Not only that, but the term 'Anchor Baby' is <b>widely</b> used in various publications. Even testimony before Congress, provided by recognized scholars, uses the term. As for cutting and pasting the 14th Amendment article into this one..... As with all articles in Wikipedia, things change here and there. For example, as this issue is being more thoroughly investigated, many researchers are finding that Wong Kim Ark, the ruling frequently cited as giving the domestic children of illegal aliens citizenship, actually excludes the children of illegals. The 14th Amendment article has been recently updated to properly reflect this, but those updates won't be automatically reflected here. In fact, I think we may have too much legal content within this article, which is frequently edited by people who have not thoroughly researched their edits.

<p>Keep the discussion of immigrant children in the article on the 14th -- it's an important aspect of the amendment which is going to be more important going forward. Put in a refernce and hot link to "anchor baby" -- that is the appropriate course. The whole "anchor baby" concept stems from the 14th, not the other way around.</p>
<p>Strongly disagree. As the comment above says, the 14th amendment is an extremenly important topic, its title doesn't inherently convey any political bias and it probably receives a lot more hits than "Anchor baby" (a phrase which I'd never even heard of until I saw it on Wikipedia). <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrover_cleveland_cc48.html" title="User:Grover cleveland">Grover cleveland</a> 14:57, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<i>Disagree with merger.</i> "Anchor babies" are an issue in the news and current public controversies and that justifies an article on the topic for those who hear the term for the first time and are looking for more information. Also, this article could really go into specifics about what government services actually ARE available to the "anchor babies" themselves and to their undocumented family members-- that would get into areas that are far afield of the 14th Amendment. Also, talk radio and Sunday morning news shows notwithstanding, the 14th Amendment actually comes into play far more often in other, completely different areas of the law, such as criminal cases. A brief mention on that article stating that the 14th Amendment was the basis for certain court decisions that established access to government services for children of immigrants should be sufficient, and people can read this article on the "Anchor babies" issue if they are interested in more.<a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDismasMama_d61d.html" title="User:DismasMama">DismasMama</a> 16:35, 11 October 2006 (UTC)DismasMama</p>

<p>I'm still confused about suggestions I've heard that the concept of being "subject to the jurisdiction" of the United States could be split into subcategories — e.g., that an illegal alien (or an anchor baby) could be subject to U.S. jurisdiction for purposes of criminal law, but <i>not</i> subject to U.S. jurisdiction for purposes of <i>jus soli</i> citizenship.</p>
<p>It seems pretty clear to me that if illegal aliens and their U.S.-born children were declared to be immune from U.S. jurisdiction (in order to deny U.S. citizenship to the children), an inevitable — and unwanted — side effect would be that illegal aliens would have to be treated the same as foreign diplomats (with <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diplomatic_immunity.html" title="Diplomatic immunity">diplomatic immunity</a> and subject only to being declared <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persona_non_grata.html" title="Persona non grata">persona non grata</a> and deported).</p>
<p>Otherwise, I would expect the courts to rule that exempting "anchor babies" from U.S. jurisdiction was merely a political ploy designed to deny them U.S. citizenship, but without truly granting the kind of immunity from the laws that has long been granted to foreign diplomats.</p>
<p>I would propose to at least bring up this issue in the article — and probably make other edits in order to come close to achieving NPOV. Comments, anyone? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichwales_1fa0.html" title="User:Richwales">Richwales</a> 01:53, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The characterization of the term as a pejorative has been sourced. How does it violate <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>?

<p>Two source claiming somthing as pejorative does not make it a majority opinion. Wikipedia is based on majority. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.17.0.101 (<a href="../../../7/0/2E/User_talk%7E70.17.0.101.html" title="User talk:70.17.0.101">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.17.0.101_617d.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.17.0.101">contribs</a>).</small></p>
