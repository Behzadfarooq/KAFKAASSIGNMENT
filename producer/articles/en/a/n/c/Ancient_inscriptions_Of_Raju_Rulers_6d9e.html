</ul>
<p>The record is important for the historical information contained in it.

Finally he visited Sriparvata, where he had the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandapa.html" title="Mandapa">mandapa</a> built in the car street of the temple. The epigraph refers to the gift of the villages Paramanchala and Atukuru formerly made to the god of the place in the year Srimukha. It also mentions the remission of levies on loads (Kanchi-kavadi), pack-horses, bullocks, asses and head-loads.</p>
<p>The details of the date given for the said Srimukha viz., Vaisakha su. 11 and Thursday do not agree for the year. But they work out correctly for the previous year Bhava. Hence assuming the cyclic year to be a mistake for Bhava, the date would correspond to 1514 A.D., May 4.</p>
