<h2><span class="mw-headline">The LIST</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><i>"Prodromos" may be a Greek/Latin word but it exists in Slavonic also via a variant</i></li>
</ul>
<p>What the hell is a Greek/Latin word? Are you afraid to say "Greek" or something? "Dromos" (ΔΡΟΜΟΣ) is the popular word for "street", and "Dromoi" (ΔΡΟΜΟΙ) is its plural. "Pro" means "before", and it's used as a prefix or on its own. What are you chatting about next?</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Hetairoi = comrade, fellow soldier; Cheta = military company, group, squad; Although not commonly used, the word "Chetar" could be used to refer to a single member of the "Cheta", however more common would be a "Komita" or "Vojnik". Present in modern Greek as "Heteroia" meaning "Company".</i></li>
</ul>
<p>"Hetairoi" (plural of "Hetairos") is a Greek word that's even attested in <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homer.html" title="Homer">Homer</a> (meaning comrade), and "Hetairia" is its noun form. What you just said is equivalent to saying "Hetairoi: Macedonian-&gt;<i>Friends</i>, Greek -&gt;<i>Friendship</i>, Slavic-&gt;<i>Fasiufywer234owski</i>, hence a Slavic cognate". Another example for those who are infamiliar with Greek grammar would be "Philosophos, Philosophoi, Philosophia". Someone has intentionally manipulated the tense of those words in order to bring up a "similarity" instead of stating that it's the same damned word. This is why I didn't want to participate from the start, but obviously the hoax was not as obvious to everybody. As for Macedonian for "death", it is actually "Danos", not "Danom" (or whatever you said), and the Attic-Ionic equivalent is "Thanos" (hence "Thanatos"). Even the word "Macedon" itself is identified as Greek, but the person who compiled that listed conveniently missed it. Nevermind, you can just check Perseus for it (and for all other definitions I gave), it's also attested in <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homer.html" title="Homer">Homer</a>. By the way I find the rate of change in your confidence quite interesting. First you give a large list and claim cognates between Macedonian and Slavic Macedonski words, then you realise that we discover that those are in fact simply <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavic.html" title="Slavic">Slavic</a> words and decide to claim a Slavic-Macedonian linguistic connection. Little by little it is explained to you how none of those words prove anything remotely close to your claims, so the list is eventually reduced to 5 words. I wonder where will this go. In my opinion you should be applying those elimination algorithms before humiliating yourself in public. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 03:44, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Greek/Latin = Greek (slash) Latin = Greek or Latin, clear enough? Miskin, you seem very disturbed and upset,as about your Hetairoi break down, you once again try to twist words, the word in modern Greek means "company" just like in modern Macedonian. How do you know so much about Slavonic again, oh that's right you don't, you just assume you know like for everything else. The information is there to see, wether you agree with it or not I could care less, in fact I don't really value your opinion at all so all the talk directed at me is pointless. And for the record I have not changed my stance on anything, I still believe most of my words are cognates. You on the other hand have done nothing but blabber on, you seem accustomed to it, keep up the good work.<a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoldier_of_Macedon_cf7d.html" title="User:Soldier of Macedon">Soldier of Macedon</a> 06:05, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Prodromos</i> is a Greek word, period. SoM, you really shouldn't be editing articles on languages, let alone in an aggressive manner, if you lack basic linguistic expertise. This is a friendly reminder to stick to the topics you are familiar with. Nobody here is interested in what you "believe", your personal beliefs go on your userpage, if you want to share them. Provide the references, or let more proficient editors do the job. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 14:14, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't remember saying it wasn't. I haven't edited any articles Dab, and what aggresive manner is this that you people here have been talking about since I began posting? Is it my name that concerns you, why have I been insulted since I arrived? I could care less about any of your beliefs either, I just posted ancient words that can be located in Wikipedia and modern Macedonian words that can be located in the official Macedonian-English Dictionary, Dusan Crvenkovski, Kultura Nasa Kniga, 1989. Just because mainstream linguists haven't realized a link yet does not mean it does not exist. I think you and Miskin neede the same antidote.... <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoldier_of_Macedon_cf7d.html" title="User:Soldier of Macedon">Soldier of Macedon</a> 00:31, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>no, I think you need a better understanding of "<a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">Encyclopedia</a>" -- <i>Just because mainstream linguists haven't realized a link yet does not mean it does not exist</i>, this is eminently possible, but purely a matter of belief, and has no place here. The Internet is big, and you are free to voice your beliefs on a homepage somewhere. On Wikipedia, they are extremely uninteresting, and entirely beside the point. We should only even discuss these things if you could come up with a published linguistic reference.

<dd>Speaking of the list, I still plan on making a list of which words were actually cognates from Soldier's list, and which are unverified. Those that are not cognates won't be listed. I won't take up much space on this talk page when I do this (if I do this), it will be a simple list. I plan on doing this to silence accusations that anyone is ignoring "Slavonic claims". Though in the future, they will probably be ignored (again, not chauvinism or racism; I would "ignore" claims that ancient Macedonian was a Celtic or Albanian language also). Alexander 007 14:39, 14 November 2005 (UTC) (I will not however take up anymore space on this talk page by refuting each word one by one as I did earlier; I'll just post a list when I'm done with it)</dd>

<dd>One more thing: Theathenae claims that the idea that ancient Macedonian was an independent Indo-European language is a "fringe theory". That is a misconception. It is a legitimate theory. I myself would rather go for the Greco-Macedonian hypothesis (not the Greek dialect hypothesis) out of what one might call mathematical probability. But the article has to be fair to the independent theory (which is totally different from any claim that ancient Macedonian was close to Slavonic, Celtic, Germanic, Albanian, or whatever else one might like).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">On Linguistics again!</span></h2>
<p>As I said earlier, linguistics is a highly fallible science and extremely hypothetical. Without hard evidence of some sort of script for Slavic prior to these tribes' migration southward from north of the Danube and their subsequent learning of letters (by Cyril and Methodius), then there can be no certainty as to claims between ancient Macedonian and the Slavic tongues. What can be attested however is the numerous loanwords from Greek to Slavic (as was previously pointed out, drum for dromos = "a road, a path to tread") henceforth giving false cognates. So finding supposedly common linguistic cognates between Slavic and ancient Macedonian is based on pure wishful thinking and on pseudo-linguistics. Ancient Macedonian names have no cognates in old or modern Slavic languages (as pertaining to their meaning) for eg. Philippos = "lover of horses", Drukalos (Drykalos) = "he who is of the wood of the oak" or even "beautiful oak-wood". For the most part the language was Doric or Aeolic and Slavic was not attested until the 7th C of CE so it makes no sense. I can find cognates between ancient Greek and Hawaiin however that doesn't mean that the Hawaiins are actually re-settled Greeks who landed there on some magnificent journey to Hades of the Americas (although some may like to think otherwise - what was that fellow's name?, that American who made "Journey of the g'ds"? I can't remember). Oh and here are some cognates between Hawaiin and Greek thrown in for good measure: The first is Hawaiin, the second is Greek and the third the relative meanings in Hawain then Greek separated by a semi-colon. Aeeto; Aetos (Hawk; Hawk), Heene or Wahine; Gyne (Female person; woman), Nou-nou; Nous (Mind; Thought), Pehea; Pos (How?; How?), Mana'o; Manthano (to think; I learn), Kahiko; Archaikos (old; olden or ancient/first-born one) and inoa; onoma (name; name).</p>
<p>Ok ok the last one is a bit far fetched but you get the idea now don't you? That's all I have to say for now. Shalom l'olam.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You underestimate linguistics. The Slavic sound laws are well known. For one thing, unlike Greek, it is a <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satem.html" title="Satem">Satem</a> language. If there was any evidence of Slavic or Satem properties of the XMK lexicon, we would note it. There <b>isn't</b>, however. And why should there be? For all we know, the Slavs only came <i>near</i> Macedonia a full millennium later. This is like looking for Spanish etymologies of Quechua words. So, there is neither evidence, nor any sort of circumstantial likelihood. It is really just wishful fantasy, not worth all the time we spent on it here. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 09:21, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Therefore why should the modern Macedonian(sic)-slavonic be called Macedonian when it isn't? I prefer the German etymology of "Mezedonien" which is what the Germans call modern Macedonian(sic)-slavonic and not "Makedonien" which only pertains to the ancient Doric/Aeolic Greek spoken in Macedonia. The world has a lot to learn still. Shalom l'olam.</p>

<dd>This is beside the point. This article is about the language spoken in the 1st millennium BC. It is a fact that there is a Slavonic language now known as <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian_language.html" title="Macedonian language">Macedonian language</a>. It is a simple case of disambiguation, and the adequacy of the name is not an issue on this talkpage. I have specifically only this article on my watchlist, but not the Slavonic one, precisely to be spared this kind of discussion. thanks, <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 14:21, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Izela</span></h2>
<p>If anybody out there has spare time and wants to do something constructive for the article, try finding a reference for the etymology of Macedonian <i>izela</i> ("good luck"; in anc. Gk. <i>agathe tuche</i>, I think). I find this word very interesting. If it is from PIE <i>*wesu-</i> (or some such), "good", then cognates would include the Illyrian <a href="../../../t/o/p/Toponym.html" title="Toponym">toponym</a> <i>Veselia</i>, the Gothic word <i>iusila</i>, the Slavonic word <i>veselu</i>, and the ancient Greek word <i>eus</i> (known mostly as a prefix, <i>eu-</i>). If <i>izela</i> is from PIE <i>*wesu-</i>, and if it is native to Macedonian and not a loan from Paionian or Thracian (an Illyrian loan is not as likely , see below why I say this), this one word would have the power to disprove the Greek dialect theory. But there is currently no way to prove whether or not it was a loan, and the etymon may not be PIE <i>*wesu-</i>. So <i>Izela</i>, good luck. Alexander 007 15:59, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Izela</i> is not likely to be from Illyrian, because Illyrian had the form as <i>Vesel-</i> or <i>Ves-</i> (cf. <i>Veselia</i>, <i>Vescleves</i>), and even if it lost the <a href="../../../v/_/_/V.html" title="V">v</a> when borrowed by Macedonian, it seems to be a big change from Illyrian <i>vesel-</i> to Macedonian <i>izel-</i> (but not impossible, one might say). If it's a loan, I'm going with <a href="../../../p/a/i/Paionian_language.html" title="Paionian language">Paionian</a>, maybe Thracian.

<p>His point was that he should by any means necessary try to fool any potentially naive users into believing that there's actually a link between "Ancient" and "Slavic" Macedonian. I think that this was demonstrated when he kept removing the word "unrelated" that I added on his "disambiguation".

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Question for dab</span></h2>
<p><i>The Pella katadesmos, a Doric Greek text found in Pella in 1986, dated to between the 4th and 3rd centuries BC, has been forwarded as an argument that Doric Greek was spoken by the general populace of Macedon in that time.</i></p>
<p>This sentence implies that the only thing we can derive from the Pella katadesmos is that the Macedonians might have been fluent with Doric. So my question is, why does the scenario of the "Macedonian language" being a dialect of Doric completely crossed out? Masson and even Badian classify Macedonian as North-Western Greek (same branch as Doric), and Herodotus explicitly mentions Macedonians as settlers of the "extremely migratory Dorian nation". So, why on earth is there a POV in the article? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 23:34, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>what do you mean? Doric is mentioned as a possibility. Just Doric cannot account for the full picture, but it <i>may</i> at least be part of the solution. So, no, I wouldn't say "completely crossed out". What we <i>are</i> saying is

<p>What I meant was that there's already evidence which supports the view of Macedonian being a dialect of Doric or NWG. The phrasing <i>"an argument that Doric Greek was spoken by the general populace of Macedon in that time"</i> implies that Macedonians <i>might</i> have also had a knowledge of Doric, in the same way that English is spoken by the general populace of Israelis (as a second language). It doesn't state that the Macedonian language might have actually been Doric, which is what the Pella Katadesmos and the related theories actually support. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 01:45, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>As it's been awhile that I stopped trusting Decius' neutrality, and as I really doubt that he has actually read and compared every single academic point of view on this topic, I'm seriously questioning the factual accuracy of the above statement. And frankly, the "references" section of the article doesn't imply that anything remotely close to that. To follow standard WP procedure, I'm requesting sources first. I want the quotation from the scholar who has actually performed the related research and concluded the above statement. If there is no such reference, then much of the article falls under the category of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, which means that it has to be re-written. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 02:58, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>check the archives. We've been through this often enough, I won't repeat the exact same arguments I brought forward a couple of months ago.

<p>I've been following this discussion closely and there's no such sourcing in the archive. No mention of a scholar who has concluded that the majority of scholars tend to think as Macedonian as a non-Greek dialect. In other words you can't convince anybody that much of the article is not based on original research. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 14:41, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Regarding your last edit summary, I wasn't drawing conclusions for the 5th century from a 3rd century text, I'm stating what Masson and all those others had in mind. I don't understand why you're so fixed on believing that it was not a Greek dialect. I'm continuing this discussion because I <b>randomly</b> keep running into scholars whose views are opposing your own, something which enrages me when I think about the content of this article. I'm gonna ask from Decius to compare credible sources by providing quotations, something we should have done a long time ago. The party which comes up with the greatest number of sources, will have the right to revise the article according to the dominant academic view. Isn't that after all what wp:policy would suggest? Lastly I really don't know why do you continue to regard Decius as an unbiased editor. He has openly admitted that he supports the non-Greek view (despite all lack of evidence), and I would feel silly to think that he has no agenda on the topic. Besides Romanians are involved in the history of modern Macedonia as much as the Slavs, and you see how psychotic the latter can get. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 14:41, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>yes, but the statement you edited was referring to the katadesmos. I am happy to say that some scholars favour the interpretation as a Greek dialect, this is no problem, but it has nothing to do with the katadesmos. The opinion of most linguists is that it is not "Greek as we know it". I realize there is the attempt to extend the definition of "Hellenic" to include XMK <i>by definition</i>, but that's just circular. My reference for this, yes, as discussed earlier, is among others the <a href="../../../e/i/e/EIEC_0f4f.html" title="EIEC">EIEC</a>, quoted in the article. We <i>are</i> saying that "Greek dialect" is within the range of possibilities, so I don't know what you want. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 14:54, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I edited the statement to demonstrate exactly what my observation was about. The general affiliation of Macedonian as a Greek dialect has not much to do with the Katadesmos, as most of it was published before the latter was discovered. The Katadesmos however <i>does</i> back up the much older "Macedonian Doric" theory. The paragraph I edited implies that Doric might have been used as a second language within the Macedonian people (something completely unsourced), it doesn't actually back up the <i>existing</i> theory of the Macedonian language being "Macedonian Doric". So why is that? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 15:38, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<i>The opinion of most linguists is that it is not "Greek as we know it".</i></p>
<p>I haven't seen an official counter on who thinks what, hence this has yet to be proved. Assuming though that it's 100% accurate, it's far from what the article's content implies. In other words, it is blatant that the article was written by someone who has a POV towards the non-Greek dialect view. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 15:47, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>sigh, we have been through <i>exactly</i> this discussion, months ago. I have no preconceived opinion on the matter (unlike most editors around here, I might add). The simple fact is that there is not enough data, and there is evidence very difficult to reconcile with "Greek". That's it. I have little doubt there were Dorians in Macedonia from 1000 BC at least, but it does not follow that they are identical to the XMK speakers. The Greek "view" has sufficient representation in the article. Nobody is censored. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 16:39, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Two questions: 1) Who is Decius? 2) Why not give the Greek dialect hypothesis a more favorable light? However, to call ancient Macedonian a Doric dialect is kinda weird---if Macedonian was a Greek dialect, it was Macedonian Greek, not Doric Greek, since we've seen features peculiar to Macedonian. The dialect-schoolers should pick up on this soon. Alexander 007 18:20, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Officially it should be "Doric of Macedonia" as opposed to "Doric of Crete|Sicily|Sparta". However terms such as "Spartan|Sicilian Doric" are also in use. Attic was the only dialect to have a common oral structure. All the other dialects varied from location to location and had their distinct features peculiar to the region (Tonnet Henri). In that respect, a Western or Doric classification of Macedonian would not differentiate it that much from Cretan. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 20:05, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think the "Greek dialect" hypothesis is under-represented. It is right there in the intro, and it has its proper section. I really don't think we can say much more than is already here, there is simply not enough data. What we lack is a reference discussing explicitly how the voiced aspirates are reconcilable with "Greek dialect": Does the hypothesis (A) posit a soundlaw changing them <i>back</i>, or does it (B) assume that the unvoicing was post-Proto-Greek, or (C) does it dispute the etymologies of the words in question?

<p>I have two very credibly sources that support the "Greek view", but none of them is strictly linguistic. On the other hand the "Greek dialect view" doesn't necessarily mean "Macedonian Doric" (which is not too under-represented). The very quotation of Masson makes an affiliation with <a href="../../../a/e/o/Aeolic.html" title="Aeolic">Aeolic</a>, and therefore generalizes XMK classification into Western. Anyway I don't understand why important evidence such as Strattis' "Makedones", and Livy's reference on the 2nd Punic war are only briefly mentioned. I also think that Macedon's ethnic label and XMK's unsure classifications should remain apart. I'll gather more credible sources and divide them according to topic (linguistics and history), for XMK and Macedon respectively. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 20:05, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I very much doubt that there is agreement among those who propose that ancient Macedonian was a Greek dialect. They are, it seems, in confusion and disagreement about the affiliation of this hypothetical dialect. See for example this paragraph from Katerina Rhomiopoulou's essay (copyright 1980, Greek Ministry of Culture and Science; translated into English by David Hardy) from <i>The Search for Alexander: An Exhibition</i>, 1980, New York Graphic Society, published by Little, Brown and Company, pg.21 of the First Edition:</dd>

<dd><i>"The <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedon.html" title="Macedon">Macedonians</a> drove another Greek tribe, the <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pieria.html" title="Pieria">Pierian</a> Thracians, out of this area and made themselves masters of the fertile plain that was essential to the survival of a people whose economy was based on agriculture and stock-raising. They expanded initially in the direction of the modern village of Vergina, where Perdiccas founded the capital of the kingdom, Aigai, and thereafter toward the northwest fringes of the plain---the region, that is, between Veroia and Edessa. The Macedonian language was an early dialect of Greek, while the royal house spoke the Doric Greek of that period."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Some things are vague in her paragraph (besides the fact that she refers to the Pierian Thracians as a Greek tribe), but this is quite interesting: "<i>The Macedonian language was an early dialect of Greek</i>, <b>while the royal house spoke the Doric Greek of that period</b>". I'm not sure what exactly she had in mind when she wrote "an early dialect of Greek" (perhaps she was referring to the Greco-Macedonian hypothesis with its view of XMK as a dialect/language akin to Proto-Greek; or maybe she just meant an unclassified dialect of Greek), but what's interesting is that she mentions the idea that I mentioned before: that in ancient Macedon before the Koine period XMK and Doric Greek were in use among the ancient Macedonians. When I presented this idea to Chronographos, he thought it was crazy and I must be "drunk as usual" to believe it. If so, Katerina Rhomiopoulou (whoever she is) was "drunk as usual" when she wrote her essay. However, once again we encounter the vagueness so often found in non-linguistic references on the subject (her essay is a historical summary not a linguistic discussion; sponsored by the Greek Ministry of Culture and Science, 1980) .Alexander 007 21:07, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It would help if someone brought references describing how many Doric features have been noted in the actual XMK material, excluding for now the Doricish writings found in Macedon, because as noted by Rhomiopoulou (and others no doubt) Doric Greek may have been a second language/dialect. Considerable differences between Doric and Macedonian on the other hand are readily apparent and already known. Pisani hypothesizes that <i>mageiros</i> entered Doric from Macedonian earlier in the Migration period; Pisani realizes that if <i>mageiros</i> was native to Doric, and if it is indeed from PIE <i>*magh-</i>, it would have to be <i>macheiros</i> or some such (PIE <i>*gh</i>--&gt;<i>ch</i> is the rule in the known Greek dialects, including Doric, unless I'm mistaken). My old Liddel &amp; Scott's has another etymology for <i>mageiros</i>, suggesting a derivation from PIE <i>*mag-</i>, "to knead, fashion", in which case it poses no problem within Greek phonetics and a proposed Macedonian origin would be needless (however, I'm kinda going for a derivation from PIE <i>*magh-</i>, like Pisani proposes).

<p>New Info from another user not one above In recent years, a wealth in unprecedented numbers (over 5,000) of Greek inscriptions from archaeological excavations in Greek Macedonia, have furnished concrete evidence of the Greek identity of the language of Ancient Macedonia. The most recent authoritative assessment of the Ancient Macedonian dialect is provided by the eminent Emeritus Professor of the University of Paris, Olivier Masson, in the recent edition (1996) of “THE OXFORD CLASSICAL DICTIONARY” 3rd edition, 1996, Oxford U. Press, (Oxford, New York) pp. 905-6: “For a long while Macedonian onomastics, which we know relatively well thanks to history, literary authors, and epigraphy, has played a considerable role in the discussion. In our view the Greek character of most names is obvious and it is difficult to think of a Hellenization due to wholesale borrowing... Macedonian may then be seen as a Greek dialect, characterized by its marginal position and by local pronunciations. Yet in contrast with earlier views which made of it an Aeolic dialect we must by now think of a link with North-West Greek... We must wait for new discoveries, but we may tentatively conclude that Macedonian is a dialect related to North-West Greek (Macedonian Greek)</p>

<p>I can verify that Doric had the native cognate (h)āgetās (leader) rather than Attic hēgetēs (from the stem hāg-; to lead). I am in some doubt as to whether the Doric would have been aspirated or not. Attic was very conservative as to retaining word-initial aspiration (which is not necesarrily true of Doric). I believe, however, that since the form (h)āgetās was native to Doric, the same can be presumed of (h)āgēma (as it is also derived from the stem hāg-). <a href="../../../d/r/u/User%7EDruworos_48b2.html" title="User:Druworos">Druworos</a> 23:46, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

There are "multiple sources" that promote the Greek dialect hypothesis (to quote Theathenae), but there is no consensus---there are "multiple sources" for all three of the basic hypotheses. Since there is no consensus, adding ancient Macedonian to a Greek template with the simple note that this is "disputed" creates the false impression that the consensus is that ancient Macedonian was a dialect of ancient Greek, but this is "disputed" by some.

<dd>Agree with Alexander. As a non-Greek, non-Macedonian, and as someone with only a passing interest in any of these issues, I would personally be annoyed by a template that suggests that Macedonian was a Greek dialect if, in fact, there is no consensus on this. The debate should be carefully characterized, without sticking a big advertizement for one particular conclusion onto the page. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 05:33, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The modern linguistic/historical debate dates back to a time when (at least the 19th century, unless I'm mistaken; will verify), according to Greek nationalists, the modern ethnic group known as Macedonians/Macedonian Slavs didn't even exist. Nor is the debate kept alive by the Rep. of Macedonia camp. The debate continues because of the sparsity of the evidence. At the time Fs wrote that comment, the Greek dialect hypothesis (as in the current version of the article) was well-represented. As the article develops, all the valid hypotheses will be further detailed. Alexander 007 04:51, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've removed that comment on purpose just after was posted, to avoid starting a flamewar and now you dig it up from the changelog. Ok, since you brought it up, I find it really sad that a page full of ancient greek and greek derived words, from texts easily read by those that can read ancient greek, to not have the greek dialect explanation _at least_ as the primary one. Anyone that knows what's going on here would understand behind all the big talk presented - and the sad fact of pissing the whole science of Linguistics as I just noticed above in this page - that what is hidden is radical nationalism of Greeks and Macedonians. I'm Greek and I'm happy to call you Macedonians here, hope it proves the fact I respect what you want to be called. I've known for long, reasons that may have made some Greeks rush into radical nationalism (it involves local politics of the early nineties that I've posted in Macedonian related articles) and I'm trying hard to ease spirits on both sides of the fence. I'm sorry if you think I'm _de facto_ a radical nationalist to you simply because of the fact I'm Greek because in that case, better not discuss this further. If you don't please try to see beyond, and realize how funny it is a page full of ancient greek to have the ancient greek dialect case in some weird spot in the middle. --<a href="../../../f/s/_/User%7EFs_35e5.html" title="User:Fs">Fs</a> 10:14, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is a misunderstanding here. The glossary shows: some words that are plain Greek; many words that are similar to Greek words, but different enough to suggest the Greco-Macedonian hypothesis of Macedonian as a language adjacent to Greek on the Indo-European language tree, but not necessarily a dialect of ancient Greek; other words have no Greek correspondances. Taken together, the evidence does not <i>obviously</i> point to a Greek dialect as the term is understood. The dialect hypothesis can be mentioned first in the order rather than second as it is now, but unless the references for consensus are brought, there is no justification to drastically rewrite the article so that it overemphasizes the dialect hypothesis. Be careful before you make claims of pseudo-science. If anything, taking some Doric inscriptions as the ultimate evidence and ignoring all the other linguistic data is pseudo-science. I have not alluded to you being a nationalist nor have I made an issue of your ethnicity. It appears rather that you are acting on good faith, but you have the impression that the glossary obviously supports the <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialect</a> hypothesis. Actually, it suggests even more the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language.html" title="Language">language</a> hypothesis. There is no consensus among the scientists, so claims of pseudo-science are completely unfounded. Alexander 007 10:32, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hello Alexander. I believe we can lower the tone with each other. I have a question. How about the grammar of ancient macedonian texts? I'm lost in "scholars haven't decided yet" "arguments". Is it that different from ancient greek?

<dd>Virtually nothing is known of ancient Macedonian grammar, because there are no surviving passages that are clearly written in the language. As we've seen, the Doric-like inscriptions are not agreed to represent the ancient Macedonian language. So excluding the Doric texts, the evidence does not obviously suggest a dialect. The article has a summary of some of the evidence, and the various hypotheses present in the scientific community---not the nationalist community. The article, as you may have noticed, does not discuss the idea that Macedonian was a Slavic language, because that is pseudo-science. If the article was written by nationalist Macedonians, wouldn't you expect to see the claim of Macedonian being a Slavic language included? But interestingly...it is not.Alexander 007 10:53, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see. Well, my non-linguistic common sense tells me now that I haven't heard of a language using the greek alphabet and at the same time not using greek grammar. More certainly I haven't heard of a language with greek words written with the greek alphabet not using greek grammar. I get the notion it's easier to assume another language with the same alphabet and words but with fundamentally different grammar, if one is coming from a Latin alphabet background since it's common there. But I've always felt alone in this world by using this weird greek alphabet&lt;/feeling&gt; and I honestly can't find it very possible we are talking of a fundamentally different language here in its grammar. OK, I don't believe I can contribute anything further in this talk since I'm not a linguist or anything close to it. I appreciate your patience. I'm tired of both greek and macedonians radical nationalists flamewaring about the naming issue all over the net, but I believe it's obvious if an article is to talk about what ancient macedonians talked, to assume the greek hypothesis, obviously first. --<a href="../../../f/s/_/User%7EFs_35e5.html" title="User:Fs">Fs</a> 11:10, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see that the evidence does not support the dialect hypothesis. But I find your statement troubling, Alexander, because your wording seems to imply that it does support the language hypothesis, which it also doesn't. You probably had no such intention, I am just pointing out that your wording has that effect. Furthermore, I just feel like I must state two things. First of all, it is perfectly conceivable that Macedonian and Greek could have split together from the rest of their linguistic group, and developed their differences later, although I must admit, I am more likely to admit that Greek split first, and Macedonian lost its aspiration together with the rest of the group, before also splitting. More importantly, I find the language/dialect debate besides the point. What is the criterion for being a language? A language has been famously defined as 'a dialect with an army and a navy'. Mutual inteligibility is no criterion. The dialects of Chinese are not mutually inteligible, yet we call them dialects. Norwegian and Swedish are largely mutually inteligible, yet we call them languages. Historical sources indicate that Macedonian was largely uninteligible to speakers of, say, Attic (while Doric, for instance, was largely inteligible). This however is no reason to call it a separate language. I am inclined to call it a language myself (albeit a very closely related language, if not the one language closest to Greek than any other). However, I trully fail to see the point of lengthy arguments on whether it was a dialect or a language. Much better to state that it was 'a dialect or language, closely related to Greek, which was, however, probably not inteligible to Greeks, based on historical sources' Or that's how I feel about it, at any rate. <a href="../../../d/r/u/User%7EDruworos_48b2.html" title="User:Druworos">Druworos</a> 00:14, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The point being that Macedonian is a language because Macedon was independent. I suppose that can be agreed upon, yes. But still, I think it would be more useful to place emphasis on whether it was inteligible by Greeks, not on whether it was a dialect or language. And the evidence seems to suggest that it wasn't inteligible. And I insist upon this, because it would be more meaningful as evidence on the relation of Macedonian and Greek in classical antiquity, than to, somewhat arbitrarily, call it a dialect or a language. <a href="../../../d/r/u/User%7EDruworos_48b2.html" title="User:Druworos">Druworos</a> 21:36, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>if you call it "Greek" or "Hellenic" is pretty much a matter of terminology. The question is, "what is Hellenic" by this definition. By some hypotheses, it's Proto-Greek. By others, it's Proto-Indo-European. An intermediate position would be, "Proto-Graeco-Armenian". I tend towards this latter view, i.e. if Macedonian is genetically "Hellenic", so is Phrygian and Armenian. But as Alex says, Old News.

<dd>Lieber <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAsteraki_d43c.html" title="User:Asteraki">Asteraki</a>, resorting to calling Dbachmann und Alexander 007 "propagandists" is a sign of desperation on your part. Latinus is correct in realizing that it is a matter of caution and NPOV: ancient Macedonian being an independent descendant of Proto-Greek is one (rather widely held) theory. Other serious theories are that it may have been simply a Greek dialect or that it did not even descend from Proto-Greek. Alexander 007 22:44, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the anon is disputing mentioning the Greco-Armenian theory. I must say, googling for it in the .edu namespace yields only one result and it does not mention Ancient Macedonian. I'm sure that Dbachmann did have sources when he wrote the article, but I think it'd be better to link mentioning this theory to a footnote with the actual source, so that we can say so-and-so says that - it's not propaganda as we're not presenting it as a statement of fact. I'm certain that this anon will not be the last person to object to mentioning it (as much as I love the sound of this theory - it may mean that the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greeks.html" title="Greeks">Greeks</a> are no longer an "έθνος ανάδελφο"). --<a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatinus_7925.html" title="User:Latinus">Latinus</a> 22:54, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>yes, we do not usually mention hypothetical or controversial <i>genetic</i> classifications in the language boxes. My offer was that <i>if</i> we mention Greek as a possible classification, we will also mention the other two possibilities.

<li>I am tired of arguing these things with people with no knowledge of historical linguistics. It is one thing to show interest in a field that you are not familiar with, by polite inquiry on Wikipedia talkpages. It is another thing to reveal your ignorance using what you intend to be scathing sarcasm. User Politis asks me to "do a little bit of research" because he couldn't find my usage of 'genetic' within two clicks on Wikipedia. His anonymous sidekick switches to German for some random insults. Be aware: I made a good faith attempt to explain the situation, using current terminology, <i>even though</i> you can read it all up, both in literature, and in the talk archives. If you do not understand the terminology, you may politely ask for clarification, of course, but nobody is obliged to take you by the hand and tutor you. However, since Wikipedia <i>is</i> for absolutely everyone, Politis violates no policy by making an utter fool of himself instead, but he has obviously disqualified himself from being in a position of contributing anything useful here.</li>

<dd>It is only natural that contributors exchanging views, often experience problems of communicating the register and the tone of their communications - especially on anonymous sites where anyone around the world can contribute (and that is great). So it is best to ask questions. My question to Dbachmann is, what did you mean by stating above: "User Politis [...] His anonymous sidekick switches to German for some random insults". What do you mean by 'his anonymous sidekick' and who is beiing 'insulting'? I think that is a fair question (forwarded to dab's talk page).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">XMK origin</span></h2>
<p>Reading your comments and the article, I understand (I think) that there are five options for the 'genetic' origin of XMK:</p>
<ul>
<li>IE-&gt;Ancient Greek-&gt;XMK</li>
<li>IE-&gt;Paleo-Balkan-&gt;XMK,</li>
<li>IE-&gt;Graeco-Armenian-&gt;XMK,</li>
<li>IE-&gt;Proto-Greek-&gt;XMK and</li>
<li>IE-&gt;XMK.</li>
</ul>
<p>My questions are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is it possible under any of these five options for XMK to have been influenced or to have originated by any Slavic language?</li>
<li>What are the probabilities (or how many are the professional linguist supporters) for each of the options?</li>
<li>Is it NPOV to include the answers on the questions above in the article?</li>

<dd>It is not possible for the ancient Macedonian language to be the ancestor of any Slavic language, and if you find a historical linguist who says that it is possible, that would be quite a find. All Slavic languages descend directly from the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Slavic_language_d6f4.html" title="Proto-Slavic language">Proto-Slavic language</a>, and there is no evidence of direct ancient Macedonian influence on any Slavic language that I know of. By the way, "Paleo-Balkan languages" is not a real language family, just a convenient geographical/historical grouping. There is no evidence of an actual Paleo-Balkan language branch; there is no strong evidence for even a Thraco-Illyrian branch. Alexander 007 10:07, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Your list of five is trimmed down to 4 (because no serious linguist proposes that ancient Macedonian descends from a language not included in the Paleo-Balkan languages, so IE&gt;XMK is repetitive).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Ancient Greek&gt;XMK;</dd>
<dd>Proto-Greek&gt;XMK;</dd>
<dd>Graeco-Armenian&gt;XMK;</dd>
<dd>IE&gt;Undetermined Paleo-Balkan&gt;XMK.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To that, one can add</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>IE&gt;Thraco-Illyrian&gt;XMK, etc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>No one AFAIK has counted every linguist in support of each theory or published the official "probabilities". Alexander 007 10:33, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Greek itself is considered Paleo-Balkan, and Graeco-Armenian would also be, if it existed. The options are thus:</p>
<ol>
<li>IE&gt;Paleo-Balkan&gt;XMK</li>
<li>IE&gt;Paleo-Balkan&gt;Graeco-Armenian&gt;XMK</li>
<li>IE&gt;Paleo-Balkan&gt;"Hellenic" (Graeco-Macedonian)&gt;XMK</li>
<li>IE&gt;Paleo-Balkan&gt;[optional Gr-Arm]&gt;Proto-Greek&gt;XMK</li>
</ol>
<p>nobody claims XMK is descended from any attested Greek dialect, and nobody (reasonably) claims Slavic connections. You'll note that all four possibilities include "Paleo-Balkan", but that is not a single language but rather a <a href="../../../s/p/r/Sprachbund.html" title="Sprachbund">sprachbund</a> and would be left out in 'genetic' classification ("Thraco-Illyrian" for all we know is pretty much another term for "Paleo Balkan"). That's exactly the point of insisting on 'genetic', since nobody would dispute Greek <i>influence</i> on XMK by sprachbund or superstratum phenomena. Much like the influence of French on English: English is heavily influenced by French, but it is not <i>genetically</i> related to French (except via PIE). <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 10:46, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So you mean that apart from option #1 above, all other three options relate XMK in a very high degree with relatives of Greek (or Graeco-Armenian or Graeco-Macedonian or Proto-Greek). If this is true, can't we make a google search or smthng to see how many are the supporters of the first option? And when we do that and find what I suspect (that it is a minuscule portion of the linguists worldwide), wouldn't it be fair to include the following intro sentence?:</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>It is as yet undetermined whether the language was a separate yet sibling language which was most closely related to Greek, a dialect of Greek or an independent Indo-European language not especially close to Greek. <b>However, the vast majority of linguists relate Ancient Macedonian very closely to Greek.</b></i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Wouldn't that clear things out for the rest of us ignorants, or do you think a phrase like that can be considered POV? <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikoSilver_52ee.html" title="User:NikoSilver">NikoSilver</a> 12:33, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, the option "Undetermined Paleo-Balkan" doesn't imply any particular closeness to Greek, at least not <i>genetic</i> closeness, as dab rightly said. I don't see why we should need to push the assessment of the comparative merits and weights of the different hypotheses ever more towards the top paragraph. It's all adequately dealt with further down in the body of the article. All the top paragraph has to state is that there is uncertainty. Terms like "very close" (highly suggestive but at the same time incredibly vague!) have no place there. And the proportion of linguists who don't see XMK particularly close to Greek is certainly not a "minuscule portion" either. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 12:54, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>and needless to say, a google search is worthless for establishing academic communis opinio, even for topics <i>without</i> interest to nationalists of all couleurs competing for online dominance.

<dd>Thank you for the response, Lukas and dab. I was not aware that the proportion is not <i>minuscule</i>. Furthermore, I suggested a google search <b>or smthng</b>. I am not in a position to assess if it is possible to provide portions of scientific references, since I am not the expert here. I specifically noted that I am merely ASKING questions. dab, if you meant to include me in the above group then I hope we will have the chance in the future for you to see that it just isn't so. And, yes, I am unwilling to do my own research, since I am not exactly qualified for that. Questions is all I ask, just to clear things on my mind as you educated specialists mostly have. So here goes (and nobody is obliged to answer ofcourse): What do you personally feel? Is XMK closely related to Greek (3 out of 4 options) -OR- is it not (option 1 with hypothetical(?) Paleo-Balkan language)? Sorry for being a pain in the ass, I just want to know what I should believe, and I don't get it out of the article or discussion texts.

<dd>Thanks a lot, let's hope this will set a signal of moderation here too. - I'll try to answer your question too. I personally really don't know enough about the topic. My impression of what I've seen from the specialised literature is that at least a rather deep-seated skepticism about XMK-Gr closeness is very common. As for what I can see of the evidence, the Macedonian words in the glossary don't look particularly close to their supposed Greek cognates, certainly not the kind of closeness one would expect between dialects (there's much more that distinguishes them from each other than just a single sound change or so.) On the other hand, the well-known proper name examples of the type Pherenike-Berenike etc. seem to suggest that there were parts of the language system that were pretty close except for some fairly transparent sound relationships. - That said, one possible scenario that I've sometimes had in mind would be something similar to High German - Low German. You know, L.G. is historically-genetically really quite far away from H.G., because there were some rather radical sound shifts that moved H.G. away about 1.5 millenia ago, and L.G. has remained more akin to Dutch or even English on those sound-change criteria. But still, L.G. is today counted by its own speakers as a dialect of German, owing to the last few centuries of parallel development and social convergence. So, I wouldn't be too surprised if some degree of this type of "secondary" closeness had obtained between XMK and Greek. But that's just idle speculation on my part. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 17:43, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>our views are all over the talk archives. Do you have a specific question? The case is really very simple, it's a fragmentarily attested language that was in close contact with Attic/Ionic from the onset of historical tradition. There are <i>many</i> cases like that, we could just pile on the similes. This is only a "special case" because Greek and Slavic Macedonian nationalists have elected to make it their pet subject. Linguistically, it's a language of fragmentary attestation and uncertain genetic affilation. period. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 11:36, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Attic"</span></h2>
<p>what is it with all the "Attic" tags in the glossary? Hesychius doesn't etymologize, he gives <i>translations</i> into "Attic" (Koine). We have to distinguish between merely quoting Hesychius' translation, and making a claim (Wikipedia's) of the XMK and the Attic term being cognate. "Attic" should only apply to the latter case. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 13:17, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>XMK has to be compared to Attic and not to Koine Greek, as the latter didn't exist when XMK was alive. Hesychius doesn't explicitely say so, but it's blatant that he's using Attic as a point of comparison. For example 'Pherenike', which is standard Greek to Hesychius, would most likely be 'Pherenika' in Doric. Hence 'Pherenike', common Greek during the time of Hesychius, was not at all common during the time that XMK was spoken. It's imprecise to refer to Attic as 'common Greek' at a time that it was almost restricted to Attica. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 12:05, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Koine Greek and XMK co-existed for a time. It's very unrealistic to think that a week or a month or even a year before or after Koine Greek was instituted, XMK vanished in a puff of air. The beginning of Koine Greek is dated back to ca 330--300 BC, and I don't think you will find an appreciable number of scholars who will dogmatically say that XMK went extinct in 340 BC, 330 BC, 301 BC, 290 BC, 280 BC, 270 BC or thereabouts.

<dd>Miskin, Hesychius was not choosing Attic for linguistic reasons. He was just giving <i>meanings</i> in his standard language, as we would do in English. Did anyone get my original point? We need to say "Att." when we make a linguistic comparison, and we shouldn't say "Att." when we're merely quoting Hesychius. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 21:34, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Extinction</span></h2>
<p>What do the references say on when ancient Macedonian became extinct? Do the references agree within a certain window of time (ca 100 AD), or is it very spread out as if they have no clue (180 BC---300AD even)? I mean the extinction of the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language.html" title="Language">language</a>, not necessarily the ethnicity, because I know of many cases where ethnic groups outlive the extinction of their original language for awhile (see for example the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchu.html" title="Manchu">Manchu</a> of <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>). By the way, try to respond with references and citations, not guesses and inferences. I would <i>guess</i> that XMK could have went extinct as early as 50 BC or earlier — or centuries later — but I have no citations besides Linguist List and its broad "early first millenium AD" quote. Alexander 007 00:51, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Judging by Livy and Strabo, the individual ethnic feeling of the Macedonians (assuming that one ever existed), had already perished by the 2nd or 3rd century BC (you know of those references already). Judging by Philip's epistle's to the Athenians, no such feeling had ever existed. IMO, by the 6th century AD the Macedonians had been past the stage of regarding themselves as "Hellenes", and would regard themselves "Romans", just like all Christian Greek-speakers did at the time. I don't think that the cultural influence of the Chinese civilisation can be compared to the Hellenistic and Greco-Roman ones. I don't think that you can find medieval or late Antiquity reference on a non-Greek, non-Slavic Macedonian ethnic group. You'd first have to find a reference from Antiquity, because despite what the Greeks wrote, there's no evidence from the Macedonians that they regarded themselves separate. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 09:13, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<p>No doubt he used sources Andreas, but what I'm trying to understand here is the scholarly interpretation of Hesychius' Greek dictionary as a source on the Macedonian language. After having seen the dictionary myself and read about Hesychius' work, I haven't been able to understand where the implication of a Macedonian language lies. The glossary has entries of Laconian and Cypriot words which are no more recognisable as Greek than the Macedonian ones. This is why I'm asking for enlightnenment from someone who might have read those sources on his own. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 16:47, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not sure how credible this site can be, but Hesychius' glossary contains much more Macedonian words than the ones we have gathered. Secondly, unlike what most editors here tend to believe, Hesychius never compiled a glossary of the "Macedonian language" as most editors believe. In fact the term "Macedonian language" was alien to him, let alone compiling a work under that name. I think the recent debates on this subject have lead some editors into misinterpreting the nature of Hesychius' work. According to the sources, Hesychius compiled a dictionary of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek language</a>, where he made sure to include all rare words of various Greek dialects (including non-Greek words assimilated into Greek). Hesychius' sources are of course earlier lexicographers, including the Macedonian Amerias. His dictionary entries are not much different than a modern dictionary's, except the definition is much shorter. They are of the form "&lt;word&gt;: &lt;translation&gt;, (used in &lt;region&gt;[if available]). Maybe that's something worth-mentioning in the article. I'd like to see a citation of a source where it is claimed that Hesychius' glossary can be used to draw conclusions on the Macedonian language. After having seen the glossary myself, many other forms of Greek (presented by Hesychius as Greek dialects) can be given the status of separate language. The dictionary's aim is to gather rare words, a large majority of which are not recognisable as Greek. Others, are simpy loan words. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 18:11, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, according to Pokorny, Hesychius also glossed Thracian and Phrygian words, besides Macedonian; anyone can find them if they look through Pokorny's Indo-European etymological dictionary online. Pokorny, like many linguists, uses the Macedonian, Phrygian and Thracian glosses to — draw conclusions — about the Macedonian, Phrygian, or Thracian languages. I will link one example, you folk can find the rest <a href="http://www.indo-european.nl/cgi-bin/response.cgi?single=1&amp;basename=\data\ie\pokorny&amp;text_recno=639&amp;root=leiden" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.indo-european.nl/cgi-bin/response.cgi?single=1&amp;basename=\data\ie\pokorny&amp;text_recno=639&amp;root=leiden" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. Alexander 007 20:00, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>So according to you or Pokorny, what kind of dictionary is Hesychius trying to create by mixing random words from random languages? The Britannica article said that Hesychius' dictionary is one on the Greek language, where it includes many rare words from many dialects. It does however include words which were by his time assimilated into Greek from other languages. I don't see how this can be the case with Macedonian, as he takes the glossary directly from Amerias. Apart form that, the lexicon has over 80 Macedonian words, whereas entries on Thracian, Armenian and Roman loan words are extremely fewer. Unfortunately I don't own and glossary and it won't be easy for me to paste it here, or send it to someone via email. I could only copy the entries by hand but that would take forever. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 16:25, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Contrary to what you apparently assume, neither I nor Dbachmann "tended to believe" that Hesychius wrote a specific manuscript compiling Macedonian words. Hesychius' compilation is a Greek compilation primarily, as the <a href="../../../h/e/s/Hesychius_of_Alexandria_3d8a.html" title="Hesychius of Alexandria">Hesychius of Alexandria</a> article states (BTW, through that article, you can go to Hesychius on Wikisource, where it's been since dab posted it there last year); besides Greek words, Hesychius mentions Macedonian (disputed classification at present) words, and sometimes Thracian, Phrygian etc. (according to Pokorny etc.), so I would not assume that Macedonian was a Greek dialect because Hesychius glosses Macedonian often. Neither do many linguists etc. In any case, in the case of kálithos---from what language would it be a loan? It's not attested in Illyrian; the Greek cognate is different; and the Thracian cognate shows a satemization, so it's not Thracian. So taking into account words like these (kalithos is not the only example), one is still left with a distinct language-area (possibly dialect, but a rather different dialect) corresponding to Macedonian. Alexander 007 17:00, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not trying to prove that Macedonian was a Greek dialect because Hesychius grouped it as such. Many Greco-Roman scholars would also classify Latin as a Greek dialect, that doesn't mean they were right. I'm just pointing out that Hesychius, at least in his own mind, was compiling a dictionary of the Greek language. There's a surviving epistle in which Hesychius explains the purpose of his work and provides some of his sources, if you read it you'd get my point, but I'm not sure it can be found on the internet. You claim that many linguists who support the separate language theory, cite Hesychius as their primary source. Did those linguists read the glossary and pick out its Macedonian words, or were they given the list directly. Honestly I'm not doubting, I'm only trying to understand. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 17:41, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"what kind of dictionary is Hesychius trying to create"? Miskin, how naive are you, exactly? The man lived in the 5th century, that's at the inception of the "<a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Ages_1e14.html" title="Dark Ages">Dark Ages</a>" for chrissake. Linguistics as a science was non-existent. Not to mention genetic classification of languages. It is astounding that Hesychius showed the interest he did in collecting dialectal words in the first place, you make it sound like he was the head of a linguistic research project or something. Look at articles on Wikipedia like <a href="../../../g/h/i/Ghillie.html" title="Ghillie">ghillie</a>, <a href="../../../k/o/h/Kohl.html" title="Kohl">kohl</a>, <a href="../../../g/h/e/Ghee.html" title="Ghee">ghee</a> etc. These are words that are in use in English. If we made an English glossary, we would say
<ul>
<li>ghillie "boy servant" (from the Gaelic)</li>
<li>kohl "eye makeup" (from the Arabic)</li>
<li>ghee "melted butter" (from the Sanskrit/Hindi)</li>
</ul>

</dl>
<p>Dbachmann you're about to begin a big debate now. I think you overestimate the intellectual level of antiquity. The Greco-Roman World was intellectually much more advanced than Medieval Europe 800-1000 later. In fact it was the re-discovery of Classical scholarship which enlightened Europe's science and art during the Italian renaissance. Columbus used <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strabo.html" title="Strabo">Strabo</a> as his primary source, doctors applied the discoveries of <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galen.html" title="Galen">Galen</a>, and lawyers studied the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_law.html" title="Roman law">Roman law</a>. Alexandria had direct access to all Greek scholarship since the days of Homer, which was some thousands times greater in size of what survives today. You can't simply go "it was the 5th century, what did they know?". So my question stands, according to Decius' sources, what kind of glossary is Hesychius trying to compile. Again, my purpose is not to refute but to understand. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 17:41, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks Lucas, I personally was not aware of this article, it seems to be complete. From the articles I've read, Hesychius compiled a lexicon on Greek. I'll rephrase my question dab, I'm trying to understand how the separate language theory can be implied through Hesychius Macedonian entries. As far as I'm concerned, Hesychius provides some 80 Macedonian words as part of the Greek language. Assuming that the roots of those 80 words are completely alien to Greek, why are we under the assumption that the rest 99.999999% of the Macedonian vocabulary is not provided by Hesychius because it was lost? Is it completely irrational to assume that Hesychius provided <b>only</b> the Macedonian glossary which was different from common Greek? That it way, Macedonian entries would fall under the "rare vocabulary" that Britannica talks about. I assume that linguistics much have already answered that question. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 18:00, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'll make it short: Did you read our article? I mean this one, <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Macedonian_language_41c2.html" title="Ancient Macedonian language">Ancient Macedonian language</a>? You should. See the part about the voiced aspirates and things? That's the main point. I don't get your point at all. Are we also to assume that Thracian was identical to Greek except for the words glossed by Hes.? Lukas just told you, Hes. made a glossary of the foreign words he encountered in Greek literature, he didn't travel to Macedonia and did field research or wrote grammars of the natives' idioms. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 18:04, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Due all the respect but now I'm convinced that you're the one who has missed some episodes. According to Britannica, the vast majority of the glossary is attributed by Hesychius to other Hellenistic lexicographers (which we know by name). Hesychius' original research was mainly on the Homeric dialect. Much of this is summarised in his epistle, which unfortunately lacks an english translation on the greek server. Linguists attribute the Macedonian glossary of Hesychius to the Classical Macedonian Lexicographer <a href="../../../a/m/e/Amerias.html" title="Amerias">Amerias</a>. As a native to the language, he probably did travel his country and did field research on the natives' idioms. The status of Thracian can by not means be cited as an equivalent example. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 18:24, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Furthermore it's almost impossible that Hesychius personally extracted the Macedonian glossary from Greek literary works. Many of the Macedonian definitions are "&lt;word&gt;: &lt;synonym&gt;, &lt;as it is called in Macedonia&gt;". At some specific point there's a reference on a "Macedonian speech" (phone). I'm not sure whether in this context it can be interpreted as "glossa". <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 18:34, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Your Amerias might account for the comparatively large number of Macedonian words not otherwise attested anywhere in Greek literature. The specific reference to a Macedonian <i>phone</i> is interesting (which gloss is that?), but we are of course agreed, aren't we, that the current language in Macedonia at the time was Attic anyway, and the words glossed by Amerias/Hesychius would <i>at best</i> be XMK loans into the local variants of Attic (much like the occasional Gaelic loan into <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scots_language.html" title="Scots language">Scots English</a>, but just because a word is "in use in Macedonia[n Attic]" doesn't <i>automatically</i> make it an XMK loan). If XMK was still alive in the 5th c., it would have been spoken by remote mountain hillbillies well beyond the reach of Greek literacy. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 13:10, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Agree</b> in principle (merge/move). I too disagree with the tone of the <i>dialect</i> article. However, I think that the <i>language</i> article is indeed <i>too</i> toned down. I would appreciate if it could be relatively emphasized that the vast majority of linguists, based on the little evidence that have unfortunately been discovered, assume that XMK is a daughter or a sister language of Ancient Greek. Of course there are those that state that it could be an <i>independent Indo-European language not especially close to Greek.</i> But, the wording of the article is unfair towards the other probability/acceptance by linguists (I thought I'd never have to use that again: <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue weight</a>). <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikoSilver_52ee.html" title="User:NikoSilver"><font color="white"><font style="background: #777;">&#160;<font style="background: #888;">N<font style="background: #999;">i<font style="background: #aaa;">k<font style="background: #bbb;">o<font style="background: #ccc;"><b>S</b></font><b>il</b></font><b>v</b></font><b>e</b></font><b>r</b></font>&#160;</font></font></a> <sup><font size="-2"><a href="../../../n/i/k/User_talk%7ENikoSilver_3667.html" title="User talk:NikoSilver">(T)</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_NikoSilver_2661.html" title="Special:Emailuser/NikoSilver">@</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NikoSilver_1a4a.html" title="Special:Contributions/NikoSilver">(C)</a></font></sup> 21:58, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Sorry, anon, I don't think your additions make much sense there. Some of them seem to be just loanwords into Slavic from Greek (<i>kreveti</i>), others are trivial cognates (<i>obrve</i>; we could just as well add English <i>brow</i>, which is no more and no less related.) I'm not saying that these words are wrong, but they are irrelevant as long as you can't show a reputable linguistic reference that actually argues that these words can be used as an argument for a closer Slavic-XMK connection. Otherwise, to present them to the uninformed reader <i>as if</i> they could be the basis for such an argument (which clearly seems what you want to suggest) is wrong. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 09:31, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No there's no source, that was just Decius' POV-pushing.

How about <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:-ize_%28derived_terms%29" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Appendix:-ize_(derived_terms)">Atticize</a>? The same Britannica article I'm quoting above refers to <i>a people of unknown ethnic origins who called themselves Macedonians</i>. So, for all we know, they could have been ethnically Greek.

<p>The 5th century AD date is based on <a href="../../../h/e/s/Hesychius.html" title="Hesychius">Hesychius</a> compiling an XMK glossary at that time. If the language had been completely dead, Hesychius would have had no informers. XMK was <i>marginalized</i> in the 5th century BC. It is very common for marginalized languages to linger on in remote areas for several centuries, case in point, Etruscan was marginalized in the 5th century BC, and lingered on until the 1st century AD. Full nine centuries of such 'lingering' seems like a long time, I admit, but the 5th c. AD date is intended as the latest possible period for the last speaker. I should say that there were likely scattered XMK speakers <i>at least</i> until the 1st c. BC/AD, and <i>possibly</i> until as late as the 5th c. AD. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 21:36, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hesychius' entries on Macedonian words were taken directly from the 5th c. BC lexicographer <a href="../../../a/m/e/Amerias.html" title="Amerias">Amerias</a>, whose work 'glossai' was most likely to be found in the library of Alexandria.

<dd>fair enough. Can you establish the 5th c. date for Amerias (his entry is unaware of his lifetime), and can you establish that all XMK in Hesychius are from Amerias? Or, if there are any other, later sources for XMK entries in Hes.? I do suppose extinction of XMK was much earlier than the 5th c. AD, but I am still open to the possibility that it lingered on until the 1st c. BC or so (since language death usually takes a couple of centuries). <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 15:29, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It's impossible to know which or what exact proportion of words (if not all of them) were taken from Amerias, but it's unlikely that Hesychius made an original research.

<dd>Seriously though, you can delete this comment if you want, but Decius apparently was not the one who brought up the glosses of Hesychius as indications of a late Macedonian survival. It was in fact Dbachmann: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ancient_Macedonian_language&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=11907894" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ancient_Macedonian_language&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=11907894" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ancient_Macedonian_language&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=11907894</a> . Nor do I recall Decius or Alexander 007 ever arguing that those Hesychius glosses prove a late survival; and from what I remember about Decius and Alex, they really did not give a shit how late the language survived, since neither Decius or Alex would have anything to gain from a late survival, since neither Decius or Alex were <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian_Slavs_39ee.html" title="Macedonian Slavs">Macedonian Slavs</a>. It is annoying to see monkeys attributing arguments and "points" to Decius or Alex which he never advanced.

The lead is also confusing, contradicting all the sections of the article, favouring only the minority opinion poorly presented in sections 2.1 and 2.3. --<a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 23:01, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>There is absolutely nothing self-contraditory or confusing about presenting several legitimate scholarly opinions side by side, which is exactly what the article does. And your assessment that the one is an insignificant minority position (it was held by <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antoine_Meillet_8281.html" title="Antoine Meillet">Antoine Meillet</a>, for Chrissake!) is amateurish and baseless.

<dd>I did not say that Antoine Meillet's position is insignificant, but that this is a minority position, and this is evident by the references and sources on this article. self-contraditory or confusing is to present several legitimate scholarly opinions as if they all are equally accepted and as if they all are in the 'mainstream academic sphere'. only a minority of modern scholars (and no ancient or medieval scholars) hold the position that ancient Macedonian was not a Greek dialect. however, this position has lead to a misleading first paragraph, and to a really sad template which says:</dd>

Also, I know that the prominence of each of the scholars may well be more important than their number, but just for the sake of the argument, since I am not a linguist and the article is kinda blurry on that, can someone please tell me how many refs are there for each of the hypothesies (sister/daughter/alien of Greek)? <a href="../../../n/%21/_/User%7EN%21_8b75.html" title="User:N!"><span style="color:#fff;background:#88b">•N<span style="background:#99c">i<span style="background:#aad">k<span style="background:#bbe">o<b><span style="background:#ccf">S</span>il</b></span><b>v</b></span><b>e</b></span><b>r</b>•</span></a> 00:05, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In the lead of classification section (where all theories are presented) there are: 7 scholars who say it was a greek dialect, 2 that say it was an illyrian and 2 saying it was an independent Indo-European language. later on i found one more saying it was greek (Ahrens, F. H. L. in the references section) and 1 (A. Garrett) saying that it was part of a balkan dialectal continuum (including greek). i think it is evident which is the majority opinion (once more: ancient and medieval sources excluded!). The info-box that i said before, is only one of the things on which the position of minority has been imposed over the majority's. in the section 'Independent Palaeo-Balkan language' and in the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thraco-Illyrian_a97b.html" title="Thraco-Illyrian">Thraco-Illyrian</a> article, the very existance of Thraco-Illyrian is disputed... however, in this article it is presented as a prominent theory! id est "the speculation of a speculation" or else "the theory of a theory"...

<dd>Where has that bizarre idea sprung up suddenly that scholarly consensus is a vote and that Wikipedia should weigh competing opinions by (perceived) numerical majorities? Apart from the fact that the truly prevailing majority opinion is probably one of complete agnosticism. For all I can see, no linguist worth his mettle (except Greek nationalists) proposes identification as Greek with any amount of certainty. Just read that short summary by Masson (<a href="http://www.ucc.ie/staff/jprodr/macedonia/macanclan.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ucc.ie/staff/jprodr/macedonia/macanclan.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>): He sums up the state of the art as being exactly the way this article presents it, as a situation of competing "schools of thought". Fine, he then proceeds to give his own opinion on the matter, which comes down "tentatively" on the one side. That doesn't mean he would dare to marginalise the other side, being the serious scholar that he is. Live with it: the matter is uncertain and will remain so forever unless a miracle happens and we find actual texts. The competing opinions, which are basically all just guesses, are qualitatively on a par. The only case where Wikipedia would be justified to clearly promote one over the other would be if one was truly fringy and held by an <i>insignificant</i> minority. This is most definitely not the case here. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 08:18, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'm removing one of the tags again, for now. If you find the article "confusing", that's okay; but you have made no case at all for it being "self-contradictory".

<p>Huh? does this article <i>sums up the state of the art as being exactly the way Masson presents it</i>? compare the leadings, the conclusion, the validity he gives to the majority opinion, pls. Not that Mason's opinion should be the one to 'conquer' the article, as u mentioned this as well. i never said that the issue is not disputed! i said that it is unscientific and unencyclopedic to give to opposing opinions the same validity, space, 'promotion', despite the long history, numerical strength among scholars, archaeological findings, etc that <b>only one</b> of them has. as i have said before, almost all wikipedia articles (especially those related to ethno-linguistics) have disputes. however, i have not come across another article to be so equally "balanced" and to favour so much the minority opinion; cause like it or not, the view that ancient Macedonian was not a greek dialect is a minority opinion (and saying this, does not make me a nationalist, but just realistic...). feel free to remove the other tag as well (i do not want to be seen as the 'stupid' one in here who cannot understand an article! i perfectly understand it!). however, i would invite (and insist on that) all the users who prefer this article to be in the current form, to provide more references and examples for the opposing theories: there are whole lists of words in this article showing the relation between this language and greek. so, i challenge everyone to present at least as many illyrian or thracian or (?) words related to ancient macedonian. pick them up from any scholar's work, if u find any... lastly, i see that the infobox has not changed... isn't this an impose of the minority opinion over the majority? in addition, there have been some requests for citations that have never been provided... i am not going to re-add the tags. maybe it would be interesting to list <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek language</a> as descending from <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-European_fc7a.html" title="Indo-European">Indo-European</a>-&gt;<a href="../../../g/r/a/Graeco-Armenian_97e1.html" title="Graeco-Armenian">Graeco-Armenian</a> (i know, it is a minority opinion, but who cares? afterall, even Meillet supports this!).

<dd>I'm very far from convinced about the "identical with" bit; and the "loosely connected" comprises "about as loosely as Phrygian or Thracian", i.e. basically not radically more closely than Latin or Celtic or whatever.

<dd>I agree on this. saying "identical with" is a rather strong wording... (everyone accepts that it was different from the other greek dialects, and that the other greek dialects were different from each other). but the "loosely connected" i think it's good: it represents the view that it belonged to a group of languages of the "Hellenic branch" (though this is also disputed). and according to this theory, on which the whole theory of A.Mac. been a "sister language" of Greek is based here, it was at least as close as Thracian and Phrygian (i think this one is not disputed to having been very close to Greek-from the time when <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plato.html" title="Plato">Plato</a> pointed out the similarities). and definately, closer than Latin or Celtic, that belong to another branch(es) of IE. <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 05:08, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It does not seem to agree with what the same author writes two years earlier on the same topic, in Brixhe/Panayiotou (1994: 218f.). If I understand them correctly, they say that words like "Berenika" are in fact authentic representatives from a language that had been separate from Greek since a time when they still had the inherited *bh, *dh, *gh, but that later Macedonian Greek might have acquired some new instances of /b,d,g/ corresponding to Greek /ph,th,kh/ by way of analogy, and after Greek /b,d,g,ph,th,kh/ had shifted to /v,δ,γ,f,θ,x/. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 19:40, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>According to my knowledge, this summary is accurate. I am not in a position to know if the the specific author had written something else before. But these differences do not justify Macedonian been a separate language from Greece. Similar developments can be seen in Aeolic Greek as well. In addition, the pronouncation of 'β' as 'φ' alone, would not be a distinctive characteristic of a separate language, even if we did not similar cases in other languages/dialects. u said: <i>later Macedonian Greek might have acquired some new instances of /b,d,g/ corresponding to Greek /ph,th,kh/ by way of analogy, and after Greek /b,d,g,ph,th,kh/ had shifted to /v,δ,γ,f,θ,x/</i>: i am not sure if i can understand this. Greek /b,d,g,ph,th,kh/ shifted to /v,δ,γ,f,θ,x/ during the hellenistic age (always according to <a href="../../../e/r/a/Erasmus.html" title="Erasmus">Erasmus</a>). so, at that time, the Macedonian language had already long ago stopped been spoken and so, such new instances could not had been acquired by an already extinct language/dialect. according to what we know, even before the reign of <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_II_of_Macedon_e643.html" title="Philip II of Macedon">Philip II of Macedon</a> the ancient Macedonians were speaking Attic (unless someone finally provides those "legendary" citations that A.Mac. continued to be spoken <i>by the early centuries of the Common Era</i> and <i>may at the end have survived only among a few individuals</i> and <i>fell out of favor and became relegated to the remote inland areas</i>-this last request for citation will be added right away). <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 04:57, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Checked sources</span></h2>
<p>Okay, I went and checked the literature. Here's the result:</p>
<ul>
<li>The current section on the various interpretations is very closely based on the state-of-the-art report in Brixhe/Panayiotou (1994). (We should clarify that a bit in the text). This, in turn, heavily draws upon the earlier state-of-the-art report by Katicic (1976), apparently the standard work on the topic. This is where the "agnostic" view comes from. We can safely take that as the mainstream.</li>
<li>Brixhe/Panayiotou themselves then go on cautiously arguing in favour of a rather complex and sophisticated language mixture scenario, where however the upshot is that Macedonia had become predominantly Greek-speaking by classical times. They raise the question, however, whether that Greek dialect is really what we should refer to as "Ancient Macedonian". Basically, what the later Greek collectors of "glossai" called Macedonian may not in fact have been a unified linguistic entity at all. I'm not yet sure how to incorporate this in the article (and I must admit my French is not too good.)</li>
<li>I then went on checking the secondary/tertiary literature to see what the "consensus" or "majority" was in the wider field: general histories of Greek, compendia and specialist encyclopedias of ancient languages, and so on. I've seen:
<ul>
<li>A. Meillet &amp; M. Cohen (1952), <i>Les langues du monde</i>;</li>
<li>A. Klose (1987), <i>Languages of the world: a multi-lingual concordance of languages</i>;</li>
<li>J.P. Mallory / D.Q.Adams (1997), <i>Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture</i>;</li>
<li>G. Horrocks (1997), <i>Greek: A history of the language and its speakers</i></li>
<li>A. Dalby (1998), <i>Dictionary of languages</i>;</li>
<li>B. Joseph (2001), "Ancient Greek", in <i>Facts about the world's major languages: an encyclopedia of the world's major languages, past and present</i>;</li>
<li>H. Haarmann (2002), <i>Lexikon der untergegangenen Sprachen</i> ['Dictionary of extinct languages']</li>
<li>O. Masson (2003), in <i>Oxford Classical Dictionary</i></li>
<li>R. Woodard (2004), <i>The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the World's Ancient Languages</i>;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Result: with the exception of Masson, all these works firmly maintain the "agnostic" view, agreeing that the question about the exact nature of Macedonian isn't decided and probably can't be decided at all. All of the more recent works seem to come to this conclusion based on the standard references of Brixhe/Panayiotou and Katicic - these are invariably the principal sources cited.</li>
<li>So, there is no doubt that there is a very strong consensus in the wider field of Greek and Indo-Europeanist studies, until today, that the issue is undecided and all the existing older theories must be taken seriously on an equal basis. However, after reading Brixhe/Panayiotou and that short cautious summary by Masson, I come away with the impression that there <i>might</i> (!) be a <i>trend</i> (!) among a smaller circle of experts that goes cautiously towards a more "Greek" view.</li>
<li>I'm not yet at all certain about this latter finding. I believe the main emphasis of the article should still follow the established consensus-about-no-consensus as embodied in the standard reference handbooks. What's good enough for the <i>Cambridge Encyclopedia of the World's Ancient Languages</i> (2004) is good enough for us. However, it might be feasible, after clearly presenting this "agnostic" state-of-the-art summary, to then go on and present Brixhe/Panayiotou and Masson in a bit mmore detail, sort of assuming they represent more of the cutting edge. Maybe that Garrett guy too. But I would only be prepared to do that in collaboration with one or two other competent linguists. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 19:40, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Absorbed vs assimilated</span></h2>
<p>If we are talking about a seperate language, then it got assimilated. but if we are talking about a dialect, i think that the word 'absorbed' is the most suitable. a dialect preserving many characteristics with the standard form of the language, can loose them, and become identical to that standard form. The dialect continues to exist, without its basic characteristics. but if we say assimilated, we mean that the Ancient Mac. language ceased to exists and was replaced by Koene. the most commonly accepted theory is that the ancient greek dialects changed somehow during the hellenistic era; changed their characteristics they did not share with koene. thus, they did not got assimilated, since they lost <b>only</b> the characteristics they did not share with Koene (and those characteristics were few compared to those they preserved). not very important revert, but i think that the previous wording was better. <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 04:35, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Unrelated?</span></h2>
<p>The note above the lead directing users to modern (Slavic) Macedonian begins: <i>"For the modern, unrelated, Slavic language..."</i> In fact, these are both Indo-European languages. They are related. Can we find better wording? <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> 00:02, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Good work, old chum. I suspect that numerous editors---besides you---noticed that months ago, and indeed probably when it was first added into the article by whoever added it (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">User:Theathenae</a>? who knows). But they willfully ignored it. It appears that you have stumbled upon a form of silent, organized <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_corruption.html" title="Police corruption">corruption</a> at the highest levels in Wikipedia. Don't dig too deep. You might not like what you find. 69.106.205.63 11:39, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, Wikipedia is really run by the Elders of Zion. Our agents are at present hunting down and terminating user 69.106.205.63. It is true that Slavic and XMK are related via PIE, of course. The point is that their sharing the same name is not due to any relationship but merely to a geographical coincidence. We might indeed try to find a better wording for this. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 12:09, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We could try: "For the modern, Slavic language..." or "For the modern Slavic language called Macedonian..." or "For the more distantly related Slavic language..." or "...also called Macedonian..." I'd vote for the first, but many things might work here. And there could be other ideas. But as we know that the languages <b>are</b> related, they should not be called <b>unrelated</b>. <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> 20:45, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, Dbachmann was right. It is the Elders of Zion. I am <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/img/music/yauch.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/img/music/yauch.jpg" rel="nofollow">Agent Židovský</a>. My address is Na Jezerce 4, Nusle | Praha 4, 6121-2043. For you slow-minded people, that means I am in <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prague.html" title="Prague">Prague</a>, where I last saw <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casino_Royale_%282006_film%29_af91.html" title="Casino Royale (2006 film)">007</a> packing his Meerschaum. I am appalled that the complaints of Jd2718 continue to be ignored on this page. I know 007 only ignored it because he was an asshole on his high horse, and he wanted somebody else to do it. Just like he wants someone to archive this talk page already. 69.106.107.162 03:53, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
