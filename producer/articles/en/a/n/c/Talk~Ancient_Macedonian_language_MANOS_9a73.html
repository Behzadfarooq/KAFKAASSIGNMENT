I guess u can't.<br />
Why don't u post the scholar opinion that Macedons were Chinese? Let me tell u. Because it can not "explain" any historical evidence.<br />
Why do u post the scholar opinion that Macedons were non Greek? Because it can "explain" a minor number of historical evidence. Can explain the above post of mine? NO. So it's a wrong theory, too.<br />
Why I support the scholar opinion that Macedons were Greeks? Guess what. Because it can explain ALL ANCIENT EVIDENCE.<br />
<br />
Could u plz tell me then, why do u still insist claiming that the Macedons language might not be Greek?<br />
Can u explain why Macedons said that they were speaking Greek? Why Hesiod said that? Why Hellanicus said that? Why they all insist that they were Greeks?<br />
If u can not explain it, u prove that ur theory is wrong.<br />
<br />
U can not claiming that this web site is an encyclopedia when u don't post the truth. When u post whatever u want.<br />
So stop be stubborn and post the truth.<br />
Is there any Admin out there that can explain me why the heck u have an article that can not "explain" all the historical evidence and u don't post ONLY the scholars opinion that can explain ALL the historical evidence?<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Plz tell me,<br />

Wiglaf, don't say bull**** (I comment ur post, not urself. The same thing that dab did to me and u said is not a personal attack). If u believe that their theory is true then support it. Explain the facts.<br />
Just explain what&#160;;lead them in their conclusion, that Macedons might not be Greek. I don't ask too much.<br />
I think I have the right to know where did u based that that the specific scholars opinion that is written in the article are correct and the rest are wrong.<br />
Why nowhere mentioned that Macedons speak Slavic? That is a scholar opinion, too.<br />
They didn't even post 1... 1 single proof that could prove that my thesis is wrong. I did. I didn't post just 1. I post many. What else do u want?<br />

"don't stop your AOLese spelling (yes, the "net language", not even leet, according to that article),"<br />
<br /></p>
<p>The only reason that I'll answer u is because u called me noob.<br />
The net-language as I called it, Wikipedia calls it <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_slang.html" title="Internet slang">Internet slang</a>.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>"Internet slang consists of slang that users of the Internet have developed and utilized. Many of its terms originated with the purpose of saving keystrokes, (for example, "u" for "you", "r" for "are", "4" for "for", etc.) "<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Keep in mind that I didn't use difficult words.&#160;;)<br />
I would suggest u to read the article. U will have difficulties to communicate in the net, if u can't write and read the internet slang.&#160;;)<br />
