<p>After much research into the actuall beleifs of the Ancient Egyptians - I have come under the impression that the following text&#160;: "Motivating and organising these activities were a socio-political and economic elite that achieved social consensus by means of an elaborate system of religious belief under the figure of a (semi)-divine ruler (usually male) from a succession of ruling dynasties and which related to the larger world by means of polytheistic beliefs." - may be incorrect.</p>
<p>The ancient egyptians did believe in a single entity that produced many groups of sub-gods..</p>
<p>This would suggest a different ideology. A possible reference to deism - [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] or Gnostic [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnostic" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnostic" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] due to it's mystery aspect - Henotheist [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henotheism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henotheism" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>] due to the different aspects of the religon in various locals of Egypt - Pantheism [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheism" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>] Due to multiple aspects of relating nature with the divine "</p>
<p>Under the current definition of the above terms - it is my beliefe that the text in the original article should be changed to to "Motivating and organising these activities were a socio-political and economic elite that achieved social consensus by means of an elaborate system of religious belief under a general theist [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theist" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theist" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>] belief system "</p>
<p>This is referenced in the book by Dr. Ramses Seleem "The Egyptian Book of Life" <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1 84293 066 4</a> on page 5. The Creation - Atum-Raa (God) exsited before any notation of space or time.</p>
<p>I shall para phrase the idea..</p>
<p>Atum-Raa uttered the creation word to create sub-dieties or the eight primordials. These were the following: Kek &amp; Keket - Heh &amp; Hehet - Nunu &amp; Nunit - Emen &amp; Emenet -</p>
<p>These primordials in turn created offspring - Tehuty (Hermes) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes_Trismegistus" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes_Trismegistus" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>] - Ptah &amp; Khnemu</p>
<p>With the reference to Atum-Raa - it is feasible to suggest that a monotheistic approach to the spiritual ideology is present. --<a href="../../../t/e/m/User%7ETemplemaat_d153.html" title="User:Templemaat">Maa-Kheru</a> 20:11, 9 December 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../t/e/m/User%7ETemplemaat_d153.html" title="User:Templemaat">User:Templemaat</a></p>

<p>In the article it says: "A 2006 bioanthropological study on the dental morphology of ancient Egyptians shows dental traits most characteristic of indigenous North Africans and to a lesser extent Near Eastern populations. The study also establishes biological continuity from the predynastic to the post-pharaonic periods."</p>
<p>Actually the study only refers to the continuity from predynastic to post-pharaonic periods, not Near Eastern or North African matches. If anything the references are to ancient indigenous populations like the Badarians, not peoples from the Near East or North Africa. The findings of the study, and a weblink to them are shown below so all readers can verify the wording for themselves. This statement is misleading and will be modified to more actually reflect what the study actually says, versus what is claimed. Quote:</p>

<dd>"These findings are contrasted with those resulting from previous skeletal and other studies, and are used to appraise the viability of five Egyptian peopling scenarios. Specifically, affinities among the 15 time-successive samples suggest that: 1) there may be a connection between Neolithic and subsequent predynastic Egyptians, 2) predynastic Badarian and Naqada peoples may be closely related, 3) the dynastic period is likely an indigenous continuation of the Naqada culture, 4) there is support for overall biological uniformity through the dynastic period, and 5) this uniformity may continue into postdynastic times." <i>J.

<p>Are you familiar with academic journal articles? This is merely an abstract of the paper, but the actual paper can only be accessed from the journal <a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/112169242/ABSTRACT?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/112169242/ABSTRACT?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>?! Dr. Irish wrote, "all 15 [Egyptian] samples exhibit morphologically simple, mass-reduced dentitions that are similar to those in populations from greater North Africa (Irish, 1993, 1998a–c, 2000) and, to a lesser extent, western Asia [ie. Near East] and Europe. Similar craniofacial measurements among samples from these regions were reported as well". This is what the section noted about the Egyptians' relationship with other populations before you deleted it. I'm reinstating that information.</p>
<p>I'd further like to point out that spending oodles of megabytes editing the one small section about the people of ancient Egypt just to add information about their biological affinities is quite beyond the scope of this article and what it needs, which is more information about the material culture, history and belief system of this civilization. — <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZerida_3f0f.html" title="User:Zerida"><font face="Tahoma">[<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">zɪʔɾɪdəʰ</span>]</font></a> <b><font color="#DAA520">·</font></b> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZerida_6b56.html" title="User talk:Zerida"><big><font color="RoyalBlue"><span class="Unicode">☥</span></font></big></a> 20:35, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fair enough. I quite understood it was an abstract, but queried it in more detail, and oodles of megabytes have hardly been spent just a simple copy and paste from the journal abstract. It is a fair reference that should not have been initially taken out without some time allowed for response. Point taken. I think the reference should also stand alongside others that point to Saharan affinities as regards the peopling of Egypt. I will add a few sentences to that affect with associated reference. Shifts and population blends over time account for a lot of variability. As for more data being needed on maerial culture, history etc, that too is a fair point. Will add new material, although one wonders if there needs to be a separate Predynastic article when the information there could flesh out this one more.<a href="../../../e/n/r/User%7EEnriquecardova_b15b.html" title="User:Enriquecardova">Enriquecardova</a> 04:07, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But you yourself (correction: whoops- sorry Zerida)introduced racial characteristics with reference to a limited 15 sample dental study. The data I post is standard mainstream data current in the field on the peopling of Egypt by such respects mainstream scholars as Bruce Trigger. If anything it casts doubt on what you have written. As for overwhelming I dont see 7, 8 or 12 lines as "overwhelming". What you are really saying is that you want your limited reference to stay in, while excluding my mine because it contradicts yours. Sorry to do it, but unless there are better scholarly reasons as opposed to personal preference or a buddy system, I will have to revert..<a href="../../../e/n/r/User%7EEnriquecardova_b15b.html" title="User:Enriquecardova">Enriquecardova</a> 08:39, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fair enough. Rather than start rounding up supporters for yet another edit war, I suggest a compromise. The main issue for me is scholarly. Do you quote one study as gospel, or do you present a balanced, scholarly discussion of the subject that does not ignore decades of solid, mainstream scholarship on the peopling of ancient Egypt? That's the main issue- to not have a one-sided view. The weight of scholarly opinion contradicts some of what is in the dental blurb, and that can be proven by objective review, and assessment of sources.</dd>

<dd>The "To Do" List for the article calls for Checking facts, adding references from academic sources, and rewriting more scientifically which is what I am doing. As for length, it could well be argued that the dental section blurb is too long anyway. The length issue cuts both ways. So a compromise. I will redit my discussion of the wider research to no more than 9 lines, which is the currently same as the dental blurb, and we will all call it a day, or alternatively we can zap all controversial references saving about 20 lines in the whole section. I prefer the 9-line settlement and we all can concentrate on adding to other sections, rather than start the edit dance.

<dd>You are right about dodigness. The "ancient battery" in "achievements" and some other terminology appears dubious. I will remove the battery reference unless a citation is provided. The "open problems" section is another open problem so to speak. I think it should be boiled down to 4-5 blurb and linked to the "Unsolved Egyptopogy problems" article. Egypt attracts alot of interet from all over. Some folks are sincere, others sincerely misguided, and others are trolling, plugging in easily refutable info to score points againt "fringe" groups. Will look at the whle thing again. The whole article could use some work. Is it primarily a "shell" or "survey" type article that collects a bunch of links branching off elsewhere, or is the concept to provide in-depth content.

<p>You are still making inaccurate assumptions about a study that you're not familiar with and clearly haven't bothered to look up. The 15 samples are not the number of mummies examined, but 15 different locations across Egypt from successive times periods. The actual number of mummies is 996. It is at least a very recent study by an Egyptological bioarchaeologist published in a peer-reviewed journal that directly addresses the topic, not an arbitrary statement from a 1984 Britannica entry using outdated, discounted terminology like "Negroid". Even then, I have had to delete some of the information that was previously included in that section just to accommodate those "short" paragraphs you added.</p>
<p>The latest paragraph you introduced to the section, far from being a "balanced, scholarly discussion of the subject" (right!), is the definition of <a href="../../../o/r/i/Wikipedia%7EOriginal_research_757d.html" title="Wikipedia:Original research">original research</a> with its use of the words "Sudanic tribes" being the "primary peopling" element of Egypt. This is not suggested in any of the references you provided and to suggest that they were the primary group is misleading at best, not to mention it would also <i>not</i> make it indigenous as claimed. The people of the Sahara prior to its desiccation were a diverse group of peoples. Trigger (1978) never suggested that the lower Nile Valley was primiarly "peopled" by a "Negroid" or Sudanic population from south of the Sahara, nor did any other mainstream archaeologist, nor was that ever suggested by Lefkowitz. This is Trigger (1983) on the predynastic communities <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521284279&amp;id=OiiUcYOHX74C&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;ots=ZmuiXbsUcY&amp;dq=ancient+egypt+trigger+negroid&amp;sig=W5kk9XRSM-6euw92URm6__2mWCI" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521284279&amp;id=OiiUcYOHX74C&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;ots=ZmuiXbsUcY&amp;dq=ancient+egypt+trigger+negroid&amp;sig=W5kk9XRSM-6euw92URm6__2mWCI" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. Egyptologist Frank Yurko summarized the archaeological findings in the latest volume edited by Lefkowitz (1996), saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Climatic cycles acted as a pump, alternately attracting African peoples onto the Sahara, then expelling them as the aridity returned (Keita 1990). Specialists in predynastic archaeology have recently proposed that the last climate-driven expulsion impelled the Saharans...into the Nile Valley ca. 5000-4500 BCE, where they intermingled with indigenous hunter-fisher-gatherer people already there (Hassan 1989; Wetterstorm 1993). Such was the origin of the distinct Egyptian populace, with its mix of agriculture/pastrolaism and hunting/fishing. The resulting Badarian people, who developed the earliest Predynastic Egyptian culture, already exhibited the mix of North African and Sub-Saharan physical traits that have typified Egyptians ever since (Hassan 1985, Yurco 1989; Trigger 1978; Keita 1990; Brace et al. 1993)... Language research suggests that this Saharan-Nilotic population became speakers of the Afro-Asiatic languages... Semitic was evidently spoken by Saharans who crossed the Red Sea into Arabia and became ancestors of the Semitic speakers there, possibly around 7000 BC... In summary we may say that Egypt was a distinct North African culture rooted in the Nile Valley and on the Sahara.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much of this information is actually already mentioned in the history section. It's also worth noting that none of the other articles on ancient civilizations, such as <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greece_e4c9.html" title="Ancient Greece">Ancient Greece</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Libya_fcd6.html" title="Ancient Libya">Ancient Libya</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Rome_6564.html" title="Ancient Rome">Ancient Rome</a> have a section like the "People" section here, so I think there's no harm in eleminiating entirely. Brief archaeological information can be integrated into the history section or into a new origins section. — <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZerida_3f0f.html" title="User:Zerida"><font face="Tahoma">[<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">zɪʔɾɪdəʰ</span>]</font></a> <b><font color="#DAA520">·</font></b> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZerida_6b56.html" title="User talk:Zerida"><big><font color="RoyalBlue"><span class="Unicode">☥</span></font></big></a> 23:35, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But you said 15 samples without specifying whether they were individual mummies rather than locations. Now you clarify that there were 15 locations. That is fine. However you say now that the Encyclopedia Britannica info is "arbitrary"? On what logical grounds? Also note it was not only Britannica given as a reference, but well established research on the ground by E. Strougal, and recent reanalyses, that confirms the Britannica statement. This is hardly "arbitrary". Do you somehow find that reference "arbitrary" because it may contradict some of the info you posted? As for the term Negroid it is very much in use in the literature, just as vague terminology like "Near Eastern" is in use. Some scholars discount race, others do not. In any event, you yourself had no problem referencing "tropical" which is sometimes used as a substitute for "Negroid" in the literature. See Keita reference. You yourself also use the term "Nilotic" which is also considered outdated by many. Is your use of these terms OK, but my use somehow "outdated"? As to "outdated" information, the Trigger reference I gave dates to 1982, and the Britannica article you object to dates at 1984, AFTER Trigger. The Trigger reference you yourself provide below dates to 1978, and 1983. The Yurco ref to only 1989. Somehow you don't appear to have a problem using these "outdated" references when if fits a certain approach.</dd>

<dd>Actually the reference you quote above confirms the questions I rose about earlier statements in the article regarding various tropical types. Quote: <i>"<a href="../../../n/i/l/Nilotic.html" title="Nilotic">Nilotic</a> or tropical body characteristics were also present in some later groups, as the Egyptian empire expanded southward during the [[New Kingdom</i>. OK, but your own Yurco reference shows that said tropical types were there from pre-dynastic times. That should be clearly stated, rather than the implied shifting of these elements to somewhere near the New Kingdom. Ironically, this Yurco quote (which is mainstream scholarship) appears more balanced than your truncated reference to the dental study, as regards the consensus in the field as a whole. That is the whole point- a balanced presentation of what is going on in the literature.</dd>

<dd>As for LEftkowitz, I did not suggest that the folks were solely Negroid, but only that Negroid or "tropical" elements were clearly there, whereas your statements implied they were not there at all, or merely happened to appear sometime later as part of a tropical group during the New Kingdom. Those outh of the Sahara would also include the missing Sudanic elements. I simply added balance to scales badly out of kilter. Leftkowitz noted the peopling of Egypt by groups south of the Sahara, and this would exclude any significant northern "Near Eastern" influx. Quote

<dd>A new origins section, may cause the same issues to crop up but we'll see. As for zapping both, I have no problem eliminating the passages in question altogether. But I have a better idea. This discussion has acutally yielded something else we can agree on. Why not go ahead and post the Yurco quotation in full as the central blurb on the subject. Something like: "The people of Egypt have shown a range of types and characteristics over the millenia. In the worlds of one established scholar:.. --&gt; then go ahead and quote the Yurco blurb.. In this way (a) the general consensus in the field is presented, (b) room is still in the Yurco quote to allow for all types of scenarios and mixes.

<p><i>I</i> did not add the tropical body stature study and <i>I</i> am not at all inclined to have a debate about this topic. No, I personally no longer think it is a good idea to include any information of any kind about the race or biological characteristics or types or origins of the ancient Egyptians in this article except in the most neutral archaeological terms (Saharan hunter-gatherers and pastoral agriculturalists), which are already mentioned in the history section. If the sad archive is any indication, or for that matter the history of the "racial characteristics" article, it is bound to be misunderstood, abused and will eventually lead more people to expand it to explain why the ancient Egyptians were <i>actually</i> black or white or some other nonsense on that order. — <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZerida_3f0f.html" title="User:Zerida"><font face="Tahoma">[<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">zɪʔɾɪdəʰ</span>]</font></a> <b><font color="#DAA520">·</font></b> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZerida_6b56.html" title="User talk:Zerida"><big><font color="RoyalBlue"><span class="Unicode">☥</span></font></big></a> 05:54, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. I am also a newcomer. I would like to adress the fallacy of Egyptian being Europeans or people who today would be considered white. Clearly, from the Egyptian peoples depictions of themselves they are a people who by todays standards would be defined as black. Though I find the issue alone unimportant, in the context of the current state of the racialization of people around the globe this point should be noted. There are far too many films, movies and books published by academics that may be perceived as propoganda spreading the notion that somehow these people could not be "black". My point is not made on the grounds of biology as race is not a biological category recognized by any credible scientific body, but rather an acknowledgement from a "white" person that had these people been living today they would be considered "black". To those would will inevitably argue that this point is unimportant to the understanding of who the Egyptians were, please consider the psychological effect that the "whitenening" of arguably one of the greatests civilizations to grace the earth has on a "black" child when he/she looks at the drawings and statues of other "black" people. In my opinion the closests match to the facial features, as well as the style of art of the Egyptians would have to be the modern day Ethiopians.</p>
<p>Certain Kings or Pharaohs &amp; noble egyptians are depicted with blue eyes in the Museums in cairo &amp; in other Museums, I can email you some pictures.

Also I am not saying that all egyptians were caucasian, but many of the ruling egyptians were, their is a great variety of evidence which proves this, but most of all the egyptians themselves depicted themselves, for eg: noble classes of egyptians as having blue eyes. Their is also evidence which suggests that certain Pharaohs &amp; Nobles had a nubian african background, darkish hair, eyes &amp; skin &amp; evidence also suggests that certain Pharaohs &amp; Nobles had a mediteranean background with fair to olive skin with brown eyes &amp; brown hair. We note that their is 10,000 years of history here to deal with in regards to ancient egypt &amp; egypt is North Africa, near the middle east, close to the levant being israel-lebanon-Jordan-Syria also a boats ride to southern europe for example italy &amp; greece where my family come from. And dont be hard on the so called whites after all only 1 in 6 americans are white anyway &amp; they should not be ignored even though they are a minority in this world. Egypt was a multicultural society, much evidence suggests that the ruling classes were often white but they were not exclusively white. Note the original wooden statue of the Egyptian King Hor (circa 1783 - 1633 BC) is inlaid with striking blue eyes.(On display at the Cairo Museum), face showing the Nordic eye coloring.</p>

<p>I noticed a short mention in the Culture section about the diet. I had heard that terrible dental health was a direct consequence of their diet. The sandy environment and their technique for making flour caused the bread to be very coarse, so over time their teeth would be worn down. This happened to everyone, whether they were common folk or nobles. I could probably find some decent sources and write something up, then add it to the culture section. Any objections?
