<p>I cannot believe their are people who still type about an Aryan invasion or migration. THis is a racist theory made up by Europeans and most people today confirm that the Aryans came from ancient India. Can u please change that its really sad. 71.107.54.199 01:29, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Paul you have obviously not done your research...The Aryan invasion theory is a racist theory...Europeans made this theory up, because they wanted to take credit for having an older civalization then the Indians. They were saying that since the Aryans supposedly came from Europe &amp; invaded India, then that means that all of Indian culture, religions, and ways of life was influenced by the Euorpeans....Seconldy, this gave them an excuse to rule India, because if the Aryans came from Europe then that means it is justified for the British to rule India...Thirdly, the invasion theory was made up because many Euorpeans were trying to explain why SOUTH INDIANS ARE DARK SKINNED and WHY NORTH INDIANS ARE LIGHT SKINNED....And last but not least....ADOLF HITLER BELIEVED IN THE ARYAN INVASION THEORY....Now Paul im not sure what kind of person you are...But i have just given you 4 facts on how this is a racist theory....THIS IS NOT MY OPINION, it is a fact...Look it up on GOogle, Yahoo, or AOL....The Aryan invasion theory is a racist theory <a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EARYAN818_b489.html" title="User:ARYAN818">ARYAN818</a> 07:49, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm actually surprised that most of the given information is based on the "historical facts" from Max Muller, an individual who admittingly changed dates of Ancient India due to his belief that the world was created 4000 B.C.E years ago. Carbon dating proves that the Rig Vedas were written significantly before 1000 B.C.E., specifically 3100 B.C.E, while the Egyptian pyramids were built before 6000 B.C.E. Someone should look into this...</p>
<dl>
<dd>Pehaps <i>you</i> should "look into this". Then you might discover that Muller did no such thing. There's no evidence in any of his writings for this this endlessly repeated Hindutva fantasy. In any case modern dating estimates have nothing to do with Muller. And how exactly do you "carbon date" the Vedas? <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 09:46, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Paul were exactly are u doing your research? Many scholars, Indian and non Indian, have made books, articles, and websites showing in detail how people like Max Mueller and others have made up racist, phony, and idiotic historical writings on India and its religions....I mean if u dont believe me just go to any search engine and type in "Aryan invasion theory" or something similar and read for yourself....We are all not crazy people who just hate max mueller and others similar to him, for no apparent reason...We have done our research, and it really sounds like you havnt <a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EARYAN818_b489.html" title="User:ARYAN818">ARYAN818</a> 07:24, 11 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>so why do you keep bringing up Muller in all possible and impossible places? <i>nobody</i> believes in anything because Muller came up with the idea, that's just of research historical interest. If you want to allege character flaw's of Muller's, go to <a href="../../../m/a/x/Talk%7EMax_Muller_e436.html" title="Talk:Max Muller">Talk:Max Muller</a>, the only place on Wikipedia where this is on topic.

<dd>Go and read some proper scholarly books, not propaganda websites. What I know about Müller derives from <i>reading his books</i> and from academic literature about him. The Vedas don't mention an "invasion" because there is no reason why they should. They are not written as a narrative of events, like Exodus. They are collections of hymns and rituals. In any case, no-one believes these days that there was an an organised military invasion. Müller didn't believe that either. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 11:12, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>the scope of this article is unclear. You cannot lump "India BC" under "ancient" as a single "civilization". "Ancient India" would normally be taken to refer to the "golden age" 500 BCE - 500 CE or so. Maybe include the Vedic period, so 1500 BCE - 500 CE. But you cannot lump four millennia (including prehistory, down to the Neolithic) as "Ancient India", that's nonsense; articles covering all the topics mentioned here exist, therefore split and merge. (in fact, just redirect, since there is nothing here not already covered in greater detail elsewhere) <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 12:29, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I agree that Neolithic age, Bronze age (IVC), etc. should not be covered in this article. It should start with Iron age civilizations. I've studied in my middle school textbooks that the end of Harshavardhana's (590–647) reign is one of the more accepted dates for the end of the Ancient period in India, although there is hardly ever any complete unanimity on such issues. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 13:32, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>no, that was <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Ussher_47f9.html" title="James Ussher">James Ussher</a>. your point being? nobody in their right minds would believe such a thing, it is off by a factor of about 1,000 (the appearance of humans, not creation of the universe). The <i>Indians</i> had the idea that the universe came into being <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalpa_%28time_unit%29.html" title="Kalpa (time unit)">77,000 billion years ago</a>, which is off by a factor of about 5,000.

<p>I recognize the existence of the term (unlike "Ancient Pakistan"), and I still maintain it should redirect to <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdoms_of_Ancient_India_2c9e.html" title="Kingdoms of Ancient India">Kingdoms of Ancient India</a>. Your article states:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Generally, the period from the Harappan civilization (3000 BC) until the life and time of Shankaracharya (788-820) is considered to cover Ancient India, although there exists difference of opinions.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>says who? "Ancient India" spans prehistoric times as well as the Middle Ages? And even if so, what will be in this article that is not in <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdoms_of_Ancient_India_2c9e.html" title="Kingdoms of Ancient India">Kingdoms of Ancient India</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Kingdoms_of_India_527a.html" title="Middle Kingdoms of India">Middle Kingdoms of India</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harappan_civilization.html" title="Harappan civilization">Harappan civilization</a>? The only thing I can see at this title is a discussion of the <i>term</i>, but it seems you are creating this article to imply some sort of cultural identity over 4,000 years, making this a pov-fork from <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_India_d42c.html" title="History of India">History of India</a>. We have perfectly fine articles on every period you want to cover here, so if you have anything to add, kindly go to the pertinent article. If you want to make some rhetoric point, try to make it on <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_India_d42c.html" title="History of India">History of India</a> and see if it sticks. The last thing we need is further unmotivated fragmentation of the alreaty scattered India-related topics. I suspect that there are many pov-forks hanging around as it is (and somebody should take the time to hunt them down and slap them with {{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMerge_8f97.html" title="Template:Merge">merge</a>}}). "Ancient India" usually refers to <i>exactly</i> what we have under "Middle kingdoms", with a component of legend/mythology, hence the redirect to the literary article. Of course the IVC/ the Vedic period are even more "ancient", but when we say "Ancient Greece", we do not mean to include <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neolithic_Europe_0e42.html" title="Neolithic Europe">Neolithic Europe</a> either. Usage of "Antiquity" <i>de facto</i> refers to the <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Age_6948.html" title="Iron Age">Iron Age</a>. You may well dig up references that say otherwise, and discuss those, at <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antiquity.html" title="Antiquity">Antiquity</a>, but you cannot presuppose such usage and build an article on it. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 16:18, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>fine, if you don't like the redirect, I've made it a disambiguation page. Now it is up to you to present <i>evidence</i> that the term refers to anything beyond the existing topics linked. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 17:56, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>your next step will be to argue about the scope of the term, Bhadani. Am I right in giving the possible meanings I do? If not, on what grounds? If you present evidence for different opinions about the meaning of the term, I am open towards making this an article about the <i>term</i>. If you agree with the scope I give, do argue why you want to turn this into a separate article, on topics already covered fully elsewhere. The article you keep re-instating is worthless, it makes some hand-waving claim about the term's definition and then proceeds to duplicate material. I argue that it is pointless to have an article covering 4,000 years beyond <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_India_d42c.html" title="History of India">History of India</a>. You are reproducing sections 3-7 out of 12 sections there, i.e. <i>half</i> of the scope of that article. We have main articles, and we have sub-articles. But we don't need intermediate articles covering half of the scope of other main articles. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 18:28, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My intention is very simple: to have a comprehensive page about Ancient India. I do believe that you agree with this, but you may have reservations about the contents. Yes, the contents may be properly modified to reflect the historical reality. In case, you do not agree to have a separate page, this page with the contents as were existing before the redirection/disambiguation, may be placed for AfD for consideration of a wider spectrum of the fellow-wikipedians. --<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a> 06:42, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>you are not making clear what you mean by "Ancient India". The disambiguation page lists possible meanings; pick the meaning of your choice and go there. If you are trying to argue that the term has a single, well-defined meaning, convince me, citing a source. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 11:24, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We are here to create sum total of human knowledge and nothing less. There are many references to Ancient India in its own right.

<dd>you are not making sense. I have no desire to delete anything. I recognize that "Ancient India" is a valid term, and should rightly be redirected to <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdoms_of_Ancient_India_2c9e.html" title="Kingdoms of Ancient India">kingdoms of Ancient India</a>. Or, if you prefere, that article can be moved here. The point is that I am against <i>duplicating</i> material. I am not aware that I have removed any <i>content</i> not already covered, better, elsewhere. Since you are still unhappy, I suggest that we make this again a redirect to<a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdoms_of_Ancient_India_2c9e.html" title="Kingdoms of Ancient India">kingdoms of Ancient India</a>. If you have anything useful to add, do it there. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 11:22, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am not unhappy at all. It is my pleasure to inter-act with you, though I may have been impatient at times. I will try to make the point more clear in few days after I collect more information.
