<p>Why is Stonehenge included in this list? I understand that we may not know too much about Stonehenge, but that goes for almost all pre-historic sites.

<p>Stonehenge remains on the list because there are many open questions about it as the main entry on Stonehenge in Wikipedia discusses. In answer to the question of why not include all henges, etc. that have mysteries surrounding them, that obviously would not be practical and Stonehenge is included because it is the largest and most famous. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn1014_151f.html" title="User:John1014">John1014</a> 19:54, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

A rename to "Subjects Popularly Considered Ancient Mysteries" might allow us to keep things such as Easter Island, Stonehenge etc., since while we recognize that they perhaps might not still qualify as such, the History Channel does not agree with us, and that seems to be where many people get their ideas about "ancient mysteries." &#160;:P --<a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurabianNights_0009.html" title="User:TurabianNights">TurabianNights</a> 18:16, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've tried to edit this article a bit, but it still bothers me. Is there anything really encyclopedic here?

<p>The entries I've made in the article are not pseudo-history but involve folklore and historical questions. No claims of "magic" or the supernatural have been made by me. Folklore is an academic discipline, often under cultural anthropology, and legends are part of folklore. Read my entires carefully and you will find no claims of the extraordinary other than stating belief by the "folk." I am reverting the edit by <a href="../../../e/l/o/Elonka.html" title="Elonka">Elonka</a> because the focus of the piece should be on folklore and legends which by nature involve the mysterious and they are perfectly justified under a folkloric or phenomenological approach. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn1014_151f.html" title="User:John1014">John1014</a> 00:12, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I reverted only your most recent edit, which was panoramic and changed the entire meaning of the article. I do not claim ownership but your edit changed the entire tenor of the piece.

<dd>Since I believe we both have the goal to craft something good here, why don't you add that there is a fair amount of historical revisionism and sloppy research that results in unsubstantiated claims in pulp literature, or something to that effect, but don't equate folklore and legends with pseudo-history. In fact, I think it would be a good addition as a section in the article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn1014_151f.html" title="User:John1014">John1014</a> 03:56, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>One final thought, I am amused that you accuse me of bad faith when you go in and completely change the direction of the article with your repeated assertions of "pseudohistory" (sic), "fraudulent claims," and "hoaxes" (which as I have explained are completely non-applicable) and then suggest it should possibly be deleted.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/c/Talk%7EAncient_mysteries_76e6.html" title="Edit section: Definition">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Definition</span></h2>
<p>It strikes me that this article lacks definition. As it stands, the article asserts, "They [ancient mysteries] can include artifacts, structures, sites, or people with which mysterious events are associated. The ancient mystery can be how the object or site came to be, its mysterious properties, what has become of it, or other open historical questions." As it stands, this definition applies to essentially all archaeological sites, most pre-historic monuments, and a great many other things. There are persistant questions about almost all artifacts/sites/structures of a great age. When do those questions constitute 'mysteries'? Also, when is a given subject sufficiently 'ancient' to meet these criteria? Bérenger Saunière is a late 19th/early 20th century priest! He's not ancient by an streatch of the imagination. Granted, he is eledgedly related to the activities of a supposedly ancient/mysterious (but probably fraudulent) group, but that hardly makes <i>him</i> an ancient mystery!</p>
<p>It seems to me that this is not a list of "ancient mysteries" (whatever that means) so much as it is a catalogue of historical/archaeological artifacts, topics, sites, &amp; structures that <i>frequenly attract occultist and/or pseudo-scientific specuation</i>. I do NOT mean to desparage the topics in question catagorically. Many are legitimate and interesting objects of historical study. The rest are at least interesting as modern cultural/social phenomena when studied anthropologically. The subjects listed are not themselves "Bad," but they do tend to attract bad scholarship because of their percieved "esoteric" cultural cache.</p>
<p>With all this in mind, I propose that some change in the article as it stands is need. It should either be:</p>
<dl>
<dd>A) Retitled/redefined within the article to reflect the <i>actual</i> selecting criteria being used (not 'ancientness' or 'mysteriousness' but rather association with esoteric theories/beliefs). Something along the lines of "Legitimate areas of study which are frequently subjected to bad methodology" or "Sites/Beliefs/Objects frequently associated with the esoteric" but less cumbersome.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>B) Merged with the Pseudoarchaeology &amp; History articles</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>C) Deleted</dd>
</dl>
<p>These are of course not the only possibilities, they are simply the ones that have occured to me. As it stands the pseudoarchaeology article needs some editing anyway, which I may go do. Regardless, I will wait several days for replys. If none are forthcomming I will proceed as I think best.</p>

<p>I respectfully disagree with your assessment of the article. As has been stated above, the study of folklore; which includes cultural anthropology, history, archaeology, legend, and mythology; is a completely legitimate academic endeavor. In fact, in many universities it is taught by an interdisciplinary faculty from these various disciplines. I also cite as examples two books, both of which have university faculty as authors, and both use either the term "ancient mysteries" or the words "ancient" and "mysteries" in their titles. These books are Ancient Mysteries by Peter James and Dr. Nick Thorpe ISBN: 0345434889 and The Seventy Great Mysteries of the Ancient World: Unlocking the Secrets of Past Civilizations by Prof. Brian M. Fagan ISBN: 0500510504. Dr. Thorpe is part of the archaeology faculty at King Alfred's College, Winchester and Dr. Fagan is Professor of Anthropology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Here are SOME of the topics these books cover: King Arthur and the Holy Grail, the story of Atlantis, Garden of Eden, Ten Lost Tribes of Israel, the Nazca lines, the Maya, Robin Hood, etc. As to mentioning people like Sauniere, it's their connection to ancient mysteries that make them relevant. I feel the article is completely legitimate and should remain as it is. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Templar_918e.html" title="User:The Templar">The Templar</a> 23:14, 10 August 2006 (UTC)l</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have read Peter James and Dr. Nick Thorpe's book three times, enjoyed it thoroughly each time, and have no doubts as to its strength. However, to the best of my memory (admittedly I do not have the book with me at this location) the standard for inclusion in the book is essentially the one I proposed. That is to say, the authors explicitly state that they are trying to explore topics which often attract pseudoscientific theorizing with an open yet skeptical mind - cutting a moderate position between the "beliver" and the dismissive skeptic.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As I tried to make clear in my critique, I do not challenge the validity of, "the study of folklore; which includes cultural anthropology, history, archaeology, legend, and mythology" as an academic endeavor. But this article is not entitled "subjects in popular western folklore" or any other permutation of that idea. The article, as it stands, certainly mentions folklore, "Ancient mysteries are often featured prominently in a culture's folklore, mythology or legends." But it <i>does not actually use</i> 'folklore' as the standard for inclusion/exlusion of items on this list.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There needs to be a consistant, clear, and <i>useful</i> definition of what constitutes an "ancient mystery" <i>for the purposes of this article</i>. At the moment there is not one. That is not to say the article does not imply a definition. Clearly the following section vaguely attempts a definition - "They [ancient mysteries] can include artifacts, structures, sites, or people with which mysterious events are associated. The ancient mystery can be how the object or site came to be, its mysterious properties, what has become of it, or other open historical questions." However, it is far from concise.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The above, to me, seems to imply the following definition - an 'ancient mystery' is any relatively old object, site, practice, or belief, be it real or mythical, about which there are or have recently been persistant unanswered questions. If that is not the definition of an "ancient mystery" as you se it please advance another concise one that is not simply an appeal to authority. The above is not a bad definition in any way. However, it is not, as far as I can tell, the definition that has been used to determine the entries in list of "ancient mysteries." If that were the case, many other topics would be included. To cite just one example, the 'Anglo-Saxon' migration/invasion to Britain during the 5th &amp; 6th centuries is a topic about which there are many unanswered questions. Yet it is not present. At the same time the questions surrounding Sauniere, Rennes-le-Chateau, the Priory of Sion, &amp;c are widely considered to be settled by the vast majority of legitimate experts in the relevant fields, as the articles on the subjects note. Yet these are included.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My point is not that this topic is in any way illigitimate. I would like to try to renevate the article. BUT it must have more consistancy and clairty. Either the definition of an ancient mystery must be narrowed, or the list of ancient mysteries must be dramatically expanded. And regardless the definition at use needs to be clarified. An appeal to authority that books exist which use the worlds "ancient" and "mystery" in their titles is not a sufficient basis for a definition in an encyclopedia. On a separate note, the fact that there are NO citations in the article is proof that it should not and cannot remain as it is according to wikipedia policy. I hope I have cleared up my position and that we can work together to make this article the best it can be.</dd>

<dd>Perhaps I misunderstood you and for that I apologize. I guess my point was that this article explores the folklore, history, and other issues which surround what are generally termed ancient mysteries. Although it is not the fallacy of 'appeal to authority' when the question is one of perception by an accepted expert in the field being discussed, I do understand the point that you are trying to make. I, for one, would greatly appreciate your assistance in this article. I thought the introduction was fairly clear in explaining the value of legend and mythology (which by nature meld history and fictional tales) and how ancient mysteries often arise out of this, but if you feel it needs a tightening up, I am certainly okay with that. I DO appreciate your interest and I look forward to your input. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Templar_918e.html" title="User:The Templar">The Templar</a> 05:20, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would also like to add that ancient mysteries do combine fact and fiction and are studied from a variety of disciplines. This fact makes a concise definition difficult. Cultural anthropology is aware of this and in fact cultural anthropologists fight over definitions of what cultural anthropology is. Definitions are often not clear cut and academia recognizes this. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Templar_918e.html" title="User:The Templar">The Templar</a> 05:30, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Dunraven that this article's existence needs to be questioned. In the past, I have tried editing the article to try and find a better focus for it (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ancient_mysteries&amp;diff=57036066&amp;oldid=57031773" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ancient_mysteries&amp;diff=57036066&amp;oldid=57031773" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and talk page discussions above), but my edits were wholly reverted by <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn1014_151f.html" title="User:John1014">John1014</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn1014_3cee.html" title="User talk:John1014">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_John1014_4cc5.html" title="Special:Contributions/John1014">contribs</a>) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ancient_mysteries&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=57036755" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ancient_mysteries&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=57036755" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> who seemed to be claiming ownership of the article (Templar, was that your old account?

In any case, I haven't seen much improvement. Why is Sauniere, a 19th century priest, considered an "ancient mystery"? What outside references are being used for the information on this list? How is "ancient mystery" defined? Either this article needs to have its focus better described, or the information should be merged into other established Wikipedia articles. If we cannot reach agreement on the discussion page, I recommend a formal AfD proposal to bring in other opinions as to whether or not the article should be deleted. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 06:52, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Ohh, I just spent twenty minutes writing up a long comment, and it got deleted.&#160;:( My problem with this article is that it appears to conflate "ancient mysteries" - that is, objects and ideas of a certain antiquity which have lingering questions about their origin, purpose, etc. - with plain conspiracy theory or folklore. For instance, there is nothing mysterious about "et in Arcadia ego" - it is merely the subject of a conspiracy theory (and one rooted in a poor understanding of Latin, I might add). Not ancient, and not a mystery. The same goes for Sauniere - he was involved in a conspiracy theory from the early twentieth century which happens to deal with ancient things, but is by no means ancient itself (and not even considered a mystery by many, anyway). A modern-minted myth is not an ancient mystery - that sort of thing belongs in conspiracy theory. And why is Robin Hood here? What's mysterious about him? He and Merlin and King Arthur surely belong more in a folklore article. Arthurian legend has its mystique, to be sure, but wouldn't the <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_Man_of_Wilmington_cd30.html" title="Long Man of Wilmington">Long Man of Wilmington</a>'s inclusion here be more appropriate?</p>
<p>Overall, this article needs a much tighter definition of "ancient mystery," preferably one based more heavily on physical remains, since there are innumerable WP articles on ancient folklore and oral tradition. As it stands now, the article reads more like a list of "stuff some guy thought was mysterious and maybe kind of old, too." I would axe most of the conspiracy theory and the non-mysterious folklore (Robin Hood goes but the Maya prophecy stays). I would also add linguistic and semiotic mysteries - Etruscan language and Masons' marks come to mind. And speaking of Masons, most of the Masonic stuff in this list could surely be consolidated. Not everything the Masons ever did was mysterious (and most of it certainly wasn't ancient) - again, a lot of this stuff belongs over in conspiracy theory article.</p>
<p>(To be honest, in the end, I feel this would work much better as a category than an article. Categories don't need to be so rigidly defined, and if the article is basically going to be a laundry list anyway, why not use a category instead? That's what they're for.)--<a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurabianNights_0009.html" title="User:TurabianNights">TurabianNights</a> 15:36, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I've been thinking about all of this some more, and I've arrived at the following. My ideas are, of course, completely open to challenge/rejection/whatever. This is no more my page than it is anyone else's. That having been said, the problem, as I see it, is that "ancient mystery" is not a technical scholarly term in archaeology, history, cultural anthropology, or the study of folklore. It is a popularly used general discriptor not a precise category. There are many things in this world which are both ancient and mysterious, but they would not commonly be considered "ancient mysteries" - witness the Anglo-Saxon example. Furthermore, some subjects which are considered "ancient mysteries" are, according to the relevant scholarly consensus, either not ancient, not mysterious, or neither of the two - withness the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priory_of_Sion_9df8.html" title="Priory of Sion">Priory of Sion</a>. Which makes this article somewhat problematic if left as is. The title, in particular, prividges the notion that the is a fixed, widely know, rigorously defined, and scholarly catagory of things/practices/places which are commonly refered to as "ancient mysteries." But that is not really the case, is it?</p>
<p>HOWEVER, we cannot simply ignore the appelation "ancient mystery(ies)" as it is a definite, prominent, and noteworthy feature of popular culture. There is a steady stream of books and television shows about "ancient mysteries" that <i>cannot</i> and <i>should not</i> simply be ignored. BUT, this article needs to make it clear that those subjects which are labled ancient mysteries come to be so out of <i>popular interest</i> not out of a particular scholarly definition. I believe that James &amp; Thorpe actually back me up on this (which would be nice, since regardless, we need more citations). I'll be back "in range" of my copy of that book by the middle of next week, but if I recall correctly, in addition to being constrained by temporal concerns, they set forth a definition which is in part dependant on popular interest - they write that subjects they address are ones which people frequently ask them about, or something to that effect.</p>
<p>With all this in mind, I think we should re-name the page to, <i>Subjects Popularly Considered "Ancient Mysteries"</i> with a redirect from "Ancient Mysteries." Then we can go about clearly laying out the actual, <i>popular</i> criteria for ancient mystery status, using book's like the one written by James and Thorpe, and explain that the term, while worthy of an encyclopedia entry, is not a strict scholarly definition. Thus subjects like <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter_Island_8966.html" title="Easter Island">Easter Island</a> (currently excluded but included at least in the book by James and Thorpe) and the Sauniere/PS complex can be included, as I think people would <i>feel</i> they should be, on the basis of their <i>popularly percieved status as mysteries</i> irrespective of the scholarly consensus on the matter. I hope all of this make sense to someone other than me!</p>

<dd>This seems reasonable to me. It would certainly lend us a lot of flexibility, which would resolve many of the problems we all seem to be encountering with the article as it currently stands. Perhaps we could also add some explanatory text on why each thing we list is considered an ancient mystery. Easter Island would be a great addition.--<a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurabianNights_0009.html" title="User:TurabianNights">TurabianNights</a> 16:22, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I generally like the methodology being proposed and I agree that there needs to be a more precise criteria applied, but I do feel the title should remain as it is. One might find an article entitled <b>Ancient mysteries</b> in a regular encyclopedia but I doubt seriously that one would find an article named <b>Subjects Popularly Considered "Ancient Mysteries."</b> Remember that Dr. Thorpe's book uses just the term <b>Ancient Mysteries</b> in its title. I feel this other "title" belongs more in the definition. Speaking of the definition, I believe it should be clear that there is no causal connection to magic or extraterrestrial methods implied, just that there are "mysteries" out there that are open, unanswered questions. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Templar_918e.html" title="User:The Templar">The Templar</a> 21:21, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I like the re-titling idea, or turning this into a category, since I agree that there is a perceived link between topics as diverse as Atlantis, Easter Island, the Pyramids, the Voynich Manuscript, and the Knights Templar. When dealing with this subject in other articles (such as trying to document the claims in <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>), I've found some success with starting sections such as "&lt;subject&gt; in popular culture". Another possible category title might be: Category:Perceived ancient mysteries, which could be linked to the above subjects, plus parent/children categories such as:

<dd>There appears to be somewhat a fixation on "pseudo" here. My university background is in history, with an emphasis in the ancient and medieval periods. "Mysteries," if defined in a in a way that does not imply a paranormal cause (meaning magic or alien), are perfectly acceptable in academia. Once again, I feel the title should remain as it is, and the article kept, but with a more exact definition. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Templar_918e.html" title="User:The Templar">The Templar</a> 22:00, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As discussed above, the leading opinion seems to be that this collection of topics would be better served on Wikipedia by being a category, instead of an article.

<li><b>Oppose</b> because of the reasons I have previously cited above.

There are definitely <b>mysteries</b> associated with the topics listed, with the term <b>mysteries</b> being defined as open historical questions as to the origin and purpose of the subjects listed in this article. This is made clear in the definition of <b>mysteries</b> on the article's main page. "Ancient mysteries are often featured prominently in a culture's folklore, mythology or legends. They can include artifacts, structures, sites, or people with which mysterious events are associated. The ancient mystery can be how the object or site came to be, its mysterious properties, what has become of it, or other open historical questions. Ancient mysteries can be an integral part of a nation's psyche as England's King Arthur and Merlin are in Arthurian legend, which is also known as the Matter of Britain, or as the Egyptian pyramids and the Sphinx are in Egypt. As argued by the noted mythologist, Joseph Campbell, and the esteemed psychiatrist, Carl Jung, the intrinsic value of studying these aspects of a country's mythology and folklore lies not in the actual veracity, or lack thereof, of the legend, but in the understanding of a culture's archetypes and the psyche of individuals and the society itself." No assertion of actual paranormal activity is listed in the definition.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Templar_918e.html" title="User:The Templar">The Templar</a> 22:58, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Compromise?</b> Is that even a valid WP vote? While I believe that this makes a far better category than article, that is largely because the article as it stands needs some work. Most great WP categories have "Main Articles" that explain the category - if this article could withstand some vigorous cleanup , it might do very well. Honestly, I do not believe one might find an article entitled <b>Ancient mysteries</b> in any respectable encyclopedia. But that's the beauty of Wikipedia, and I think that, with some cleanup, this article can stay. We <i>need</i> to tighten the definition - however, "mystery" is so subjective, I believe we will find this difficult... particularly since many things people <i>popularly consider</i> ancient mysteries are not in fact very mysterious, but certainly deserve inclusion here. Easter Island, for instance, completely belongs on this list, even though it is not generally considered mysterious by experts. It is a "perceived" ancient mystery, a subject "popularly considered" an ancient mystery. That's what's nice about the titles "Perceived ancient mysteries" (which is in no way pejorative!) or "Popularly considered ancient mysteries." Those titles are merely stating the fact.</li>

<dd>I therefore <b>support</b> the name change and <b>oppose</b> the article's conversion to a category, at least for now.

<dd>Titanium Dragon, I suggest you check the history of the article. <b>Quest is credited from day one as the origin of the piece.</b> You are completely wrong about who took what from whom. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Argonaut_f594.html" title="User:The Argonaut">The Argonaut</a> 07:42, 24 February 2007 (UTC) In fact, as per Wikipedia policy on sources, Quest should remain listed as a source as long as the article remains on here. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Argonaut_f594.html" title="User:The Argonaut">The Argonaut</a> 09:45, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
