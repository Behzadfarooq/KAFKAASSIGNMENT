Being an expert of the Ancient Greek language, I can assure the readers that the reconstructed pronunciation is indeed 100% valid, and it is found in <b>all</b> respectable handbooks, also in the most recent ones. Even if the pronunciation of the "dasea" as <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fricative.html" title="Fricative">fricatives</a> may have been anticipated in certain dialects and in certain registers in the Classical period already, nothing suggests that it was adopted universally until the Roman period. --<a href="../../../e/n/k/User%7EEnkyklios_88b5.html" title="User:Enkyklios">Enkyklios</a> 16:40, 22 December 2005 (CET)</p>

<p>It seems Thrax can't be stopped from bloating talk pages with rambling, repetitive confrontational stuff. Maybe it's just as well for the moment, for anybody who comes in on the RfC to see immediately what's going on. But in the future I propose we should find a way of keeping talk pages reasonably clean.</p>
<p>Thrax, please, put your argumentation somewhere, in <b>one</b> place together, once. I suggest you make it a sub-page of your own talk page. Then, whenever you feel you have to remind us of some argument of yours, just link to it with one <b>short</b> remark here.</p>
<p>Else, I might adopt a policy of deleting anything you write <i>even on the talk page</i> if it exceeds some reasonable limit (i.e. moving it to an archive of its own, or to your talk page, and replacing it with only a link.)</p>

<dd>Deleting a contributor on the talkpage is a rather extreme measure, but seeing what Thrax just did to the new sections "Summary of previous discussions" (which went from two-and-a-half lines on my screen, to 15, and is no longer a summary) and "Responses to RFC", a section specially provided for <b>outside</b> comment, I agree with Lucas. Thrax, nobody wants to stop you from responding to comments, even in those sections, but please do it in the way Lucas requests, or he will IMO be justified in removing your comments to a more convenient place and linking to them. Incidentally, writing in ALL CAPS is seen as shouting. Please don't greet people who are here to help (specifically at your own invitation, on the RFC page), with a shout of "WRONG!" It's just counterproductive. Please be friendly, calm, and welcoming. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 10:43, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Putting aside the preposterous claims of Thrax, it recently occurred to me that the word <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">μέλι</span>(=honey) is attested in Linear B myceanean. I find it amazing that this word has probably remained totally unchanged in both pronunciation and meaning in 35 centuries! So Agamemnon would have pronounced it the same way as any speaker of Greek alive today. It would be fun to find other words like that one but I cannot think of any.<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannos_b558.html" title="User:Yannos">Yannos</a> 23:21, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I see that Thrax has ignored Lukas' and my pleas above ("Anti-bloat measures") for keeping this page managable, civil, and useful, and has continued to try to shout down all opposition and add long posts to the wrong section.

<dd>This is deliberate censorship and the tactics of dishonest charlatans who know that their lies and falsifications cannot stand up to the evidence against them so they are now trying to prevent people form reading the evidence at all. The reconstructed pronunciation of ancient Greek is an unscientific theory based on the false notion of Germanic supremacy and everyone who has read the evidence against it and the racist slurs made by its advocates against the Greeks, and every expert in Semitic linguistics, knows it is an untenable 19th century academic fraud. --Thrax 18:45, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The proof of this deliberate censorship and dishonest tactics is shown by Macrakis recent attempt to delete my above contribution from this page. Macrakis wants to conceal the fact that modern linguistics does not support the reconstructed pronunciation as a scientific theory but only acknowledges it as an Erasmian based convention used in teaching in English speaking countries. Modern linguists are all unanimous in the fact that there is no evidence whatsoever to support the reconstructed pronunciation and Semitic linguists support that ancient Greek was pronounced exactly like modern Greek. --Thrax 20:46, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Now that we have a few hours of Thrax vacations, we might try to make up our minds whether the Semitic connection is in any way worth following. I strongly suspect that Thrax has been making it up completely, but I know next to nothing about Semitic. Obviously, he has been unable to cite any scholar who actually endorses the view that the development of Semitic might provide evidence that would necessitate revisions to the received reconstruction of Greek. Is there anybody here who can verify if anything along those lines has ever been discussed in the literature? (Enkyklios, perhaps?) Of course, if it's just pure Thracian original research, there's no need bothering about it. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> 12:08, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>My knowledge of Semitic is also rather limited. Apparently, Thrax' Semitic arguments has two parts:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1) The Semitic letters, from which β, δ, γ were derived, could indicate the voiced <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fricative.html" title="Fricative">fricatives</a> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[β, ð, γ]</span>. It is true that Hebrew and Aramaic ב ד ג have fricative <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allophone.html" title="Allophone">allophones</a> between vowels. Yet, I am not sure that it is generally agreed that this allophony can be projected back to Phoenician or Proto-Semitic. And even if it can, it does not follow that the Greek sounds written by these letters were also fricatives because the Hebrew and Aramaic have also <i><a href="../../../s/t/o/Stop_consonant.html" title="Stop consonant">plosive</a></i> allophones, and furthermore, a language that had voiced <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stop_consonant.html" title="Stop consonant">stops</a> but no voiced <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fricative.html" title="Fricative">fricatives</a> could re-interpret foreign letters indicating voiced <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fricative.html" title="Fricative">fricatives</a> if that was the only solution for an adequate rendering of its own phonetic system.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2) The <a href="../../../s/e/p/Septuagint.html" title="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> trabscribe Hebrew <a href="../../../a/y/i/Ayin.html" title="Ayin">ע (‘ayin)</a> is transcribed with Greek γ in words like <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">Γομορρᾶ</span> (עמורה) and <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">Γάζα</span> (עזה). It is assumed that the Hebrew sound derives partly from the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Semitic_0c88.html" title="Proto-Semitic">Proto-Semitic</a> <a href="../../../u/v/u/Uvular.html" title="Uvular">uvular</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fricative.html" title="Fricative">fricative</a> *<i>ġ</i> (: Arabic غ) and partly from <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharyngeal.html" title="Pharyngeal">pharyngeal</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fricative.html" title="Fricative">fricative</a> *<i>‘</i> (: Arabic ع). However, the Greek forms <i>do not</i> attest that Greek &lt;γ&gt; was a <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fricative.html" title="Fricative">fricative</a> [γ] (a language that had only [g] would probably use this phoneme for rendering a foreign [γ] as well); it would only prove that Hebrew <a href="../../../a/y/i/Ayin.html" title="Ayin">‘ayin</a> was still something like <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʁ]</span> in such words.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A language that had plosive g would never have used it to represent a sound that had virtually became a breath of near silence in the spoken language and was no longer represented in the written language. The only reason why the Hebrews would have written gomorra with a gamma is if gamma was a fricative sound which resembled a breath, otherwise they would have left it out altogether. In fact almost every consonant in the Hebrew bible is translated into Greek using the fricatives gamma, deta, beta, hi, th, and fi even though the Greek alphabet have plosive k, t and p which could have been used instead as can be seen from these examples.</dd>

<dd>The Septuagint dates to 280 BC and the Hebrew experts who translated it learned to speak Greek as children in the time of Alexander 50 years earlier which dates their Greek to the end of the classical period. Since the Septuagint proves that the mediae and dasea were already fully formed as fricatives any changed that occurred must have began before the classical period. For example the changes that tool place in Germanic which changed p to f took at least 400 years. This evidence is enough to demolish the claims of the reconstructed pronunciation as un-provable. --<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntiCensorship_379d.html" title="User:AntiCensorship">AntiCensorship</a> 17:55, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>AntiCensorship claims that "A language that had plosive g would never have used it to represent a sound that had virtually became a breath of near silence in the spoken language and was no longer represented in the written language". In Classical Hebrew and Aramaic, Proto-Semitic *<i>ġ</i> had indeed merged with Proto-Semitic *<i>‘</i>, which would perhaps be conceived as virtually silent by most non-Semitic speakers. If עמורה and עזה were pronounced as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʕamo:ra], [ʕaz:a]</span> (like in Standard Hebrew), the Greek transcriptions <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">Γομορρᾶ</span> and <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">Γάζα</span> would be rather surprising whether one takes &lt;γ&gt; as the plosive [g] or the fricative [γ]. However, since <a href="../../../a/y/i/Ayin.html" title="Ayin">ע</a> is ignored in the Greek transcription in most cases (e.g. עמלק &gt; <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">Ἀμαλέκ</span>, עלי &gt; <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">Ἡλί</span>), the names in which it is transcribed with &lt;γ&gt; were most likely pronounced differently, namely <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʁ]</span>, at least in some varieties of Hebrew. Then, it could without any problems be rendered with [g] in a language which had no fricative [γ] just like Modern Greek [γ] is rendered with [g] in most European languages.</dd>

<dd>Admittedly, I am <i>not</i> an expert on Semitic, but I think that my account conforms with the <i>communis opinio</i> of Semitologists; a similar interpretation is given on the wikipedia pages on <a href="../../../g/o/m/Gomorra.html" title="Gomorra">Gomorra</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/z/Gaza.html" title="Gaza">Gaza</a>. By the way, if the letter <a href="../../../a/y/i/Ayin.html" title="Ayin">ע</a> could be pronounced like a fricative in Phoenician as well, one would expect the Greeks to use it for /g/ if this phoneme was pronounced as [γ] already around 800 BC (as suggested by Thrax) since it would have been more precise than <a href="../../../g/i/m/Gimel_%28letter%29.html" title="Gimel (letter)">ג</a> which was a plosive [g] initially. The fact that <a href="../../../a/y/i/Ayin.html" title="Ayin">ע</a> was converted into the vowel <a href="../../../o/m/i/Omicron.html" title="Omicron">Ο</a> would be an argument against the fricative pronounciation of Greek /g/.</dd>

<dd>Your opinion is not something that Semitic linguists agree with. Ayin is not what the 72 Hebrews translated as fricative gamma in the Septuagint. They translated the fricative Gamma in the spoken language as fricative gamma in Greek. Even in Arabic fricative gamma is still used in the Arabic name for Gomorrah which is spelled Ghamara using fricative gamma. Why would the Hebrews translate RaMH (where "a" represents ayin) as "regma" (Raamah in English) unless gamma was totallty fricative. It would be completely ridiculous if plosive g were inserted into a word where it does not exist when the Hebrews could have used "aa" instead as in Abraam. Why would the ancient Greeks have used ayin for fricative gamma when the Phoenician alphabet already had g as an allophone for it. The Phoenician letter Ayin in the Greek alphabet became Omicron which is an "o" sound. In proto-Sinaitic script it even resembles the letter "o". All of the evidence from Hebrew translations into Greek proves that the mediae and dasea were fricatives and that is the opinion of all Semitic linguists. Look at the examples above. Where the Hebrews had a choice in 90% of all cases they chose Greek fricatives. The only time they used the Greek letter kappa was when translating the Hebrew letter Quof whereas when they translated Kaf they always used the Greek letter Hi (X) to denote that fact that it was the fricative allophone for Kaf that was being sounded in Hebrew. --AskMelegi 18:21, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Jewish translators of the Septuagint chose to render Hebrew רעמה with Greek <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">Ρεγμα</span> because they thought that the <a href="../../../a/y/i/Ayin.html" title="Ayin">ע</a> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʁ]</span> could not be transliterated with nothing and the Greek γ was in their eyes the most adequate solution, being a voiced velar. If may have been a fricative in some varieties of Greek. My point is that even if it was always a stop, it was close enough to be used as the proper rendering of a velar fricative. And therefore it proves nothing about the actual pronunciation of Hellenistic Greek. <a href="../../../e/n/k/User%7EEnkyklios_88b5.html" title="User:Enkyklios">Enkyklios</a> 13:12, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fairy tales, fairy tales, fairy tales. The Hebrew translators DID NOT translate Ayin as gamma. They translated Semitic fricative g in the spoken language as Greek fricative Gamma. Ayin was translated as "o" since that is what ayin became in the Greek version of the Phoenician alphabet. The fact that Greek gamma was used to translate a "g" sound which in the spoken language was little more than a breath proves that gamma was a fricative in the Greek language. These Hebrews would have never translated a breath as hard g. A breath would have been translated as either η or a fricative and that fact that this fricative was gamma and that this gamma coincides with the proto-Semitic fricative gamma in other Semitic spellings of Gomorra is irrefutable as proof that ancient Greek gamma was fricative like it is today. --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHansChristianAnderson_64b7.html" title="User:HansChristianAnderson">HansChristianAnderson</a> 16:59, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In all likelihood the double treatment reflects two different pronunciations in Hebrew, namely <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʁ]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ˤ]</span> respectively. To repete myself, the Greek sound may have been a fricative in some or all contexts and in some or all registers, but even if it was always a stop, it would have been the most adequate letter for transliterating a voiced velar (or uvular) fricative. In the standard alphabet there was no independent grapheme for the "breath" (&lt;η&gt; was /e:/), and the Greek phoneme /h/ would have been inappropriate anyway since it was voiceless and quite different in force compared to <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʁ]</span>. <a href="../../../e/n/k/User%7EEnkyklios_88b5.html" title="User:Enkyklios">Enkyklios</a> 13:19, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have no idea what Thrax, sorry, AntiCensorship wants to prove with his long list of Greek transcriptions of Hebrew names. Perhaps that Hebrew <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">פ /p/</span>, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">ת /t/</span>, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">כ /k/</span> was often transcribed with &lt;φ&gt;, &lt;θ&gt;, &lt;χ&gt;? We already know that the Hebrew stops had fricative allophons in the position between vowels, and that it was customary for Greek to render foreign voiceless fricatives with the <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">δασέα</span>. To the best of my knowledge, the Septuagint proves nothing about the nature of the Greek <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">δασέα</span> and <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">μέσα</span>. They <i>could</i> have been fricatives, but the transmitted forms are explained just as adequately if one maintains that they were in fact aspirated and voiced stops respectively. <a href="../../../e/n/k/User%7EEnkyklios_88b5.html" title="User:Enkyklios">Enkyklios</a> 13:43, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On the contrary: All linguists working with Ancient Greek agree that Hellenistic Greek was pronounced like Classical Greek in some aspects and like Modern Greek in other aspects. The vocalism was close to that of Modern Greek (even though the differences of quantity was not given up in all varieties of Greek until late in the the Roman age); the aspirated stops and the voiced stops may have become fricatives during the Hellenistic period, but we do not know when that pronunciation was adopted universally. But that is not the same as saying that Hellenistic Greek was pronounced exactly like Modern Greek. <a href="../../../e/n/k/User%7EEnkyklios_88b5.html" title="User:Enkyklios">Enkyklios</a> 13:12, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sven-Tage Tedorsson, who has done the most thorough investigations of the phonological development of Hellenistic Greek, concluded that the μέσα started to become fricatives during the Hellenistic age starting with /g/ in the 2nd century BC (documented by the occasional loss in writing); /b/ and /d/ followed only later (there is no confusion of &lt;ευ, αυ&gt; and &lt;εβ, αβ&gt;). The fricativization of the δασέα seems to be post-Hellenistic. According to Teodorsson, the diphthongs /ai/, /ei/, /oi/ were monophthongised to <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">ɛ:</span>, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">i:</span>, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">ø:</span> already in late Attic. <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">ø:</span> was raised to <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">y:</span> later, and the loss of distinctive vowel length seems to be a phenomenon of the Roman Age. (Summarised after my memory.) In other words, it is the nationalist dream of an ever unchanged Greek language that is a pseudo-scientific fairytale. <a href="../../../e/n/k/User%7EEnkyklios_88b5.html" title="User:Enkyklios">Enkyklios</a> 13:19, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wasn't involved in this initial, volatile battle, but recently my personal experience, in taking classical and "modern" greek has led me right into a similar place. I wasn't aware until recently of the real defensiveness and hostility that at least some contemperary hellenic speakers hearing any reconstructed pronunciation of ancient greek arouses. That experience, as I have just encountered, I postulate has to with perhaps merely a political, even religious confrontation. Politics and religion seem to always involve the way someone speaks. For natural Greek speakers, the words of the many reconstructed pronunciations are not the sounds they know. That much is certain. However when people are hot-headed and coming around with "the modern pronunciation is the correct one" etc. with no argument, it is of little value to an honest discussion of this subject. For one thing, ancient Greek has an aspect of meter which follows long and short syllables, for another thing, the greek pronunciation makes no distinction, and even people teaching greek don't know, the correct so called "breathing marks" used with words which begin with vowels. From these things it seems to hold the morphology of the writing doesn't reflect the greek pronunciation in current use. Therefore, because of this at least establishable difference in morphology I must conclude that the matter of pronunciation has taken on a political attribute which isn't helpful for a factual discussion of the ancient phonology. What also an be observed is that the christianization of hellenic culture had profound impacts on the nature of art and religion in greek society. by and large the orthodox religion seems to be tied closely to contemporary pronunciation. As stated before however arguments to authenticity in pronunciation based on merely contemporary greek identity seem to be based on analogy. It is also demonstrable that ancient greek had several dialects, the language of Homeros uses words that Platon doesn't and visa versa. Therefore there is an empirical demonstration of the language changing over time, or perhaps more accurately over time and within different dialects. It is unclear that in antiquity, being so unreachable because it has perished, leaving only artifacts like bones, if you will permit me a poetic metaphor, if although we can trace the morphological developments, how one dialect influenced another. Another example of this is the difference between shakespeare's english, american english, the language of Beowulf and the "boston accent" or the southern "drawl." It seems claims to know the "correct" pronunciation are posturing without basis. It also seems that ancient greek, and contemporary greek both use an "indo-european" grammar and are written left to right. to address the question of semitic language above, the grammar of any greek has more relation to sanskrit than to semitic languages, which use consonants as roots and change the vowel pattern to conjugate, while "indo-european" language relates roots to specific syllables and has other specific suffixes and prefixes it uses in conjugation. I think there is however a comparison that could be made which potentially complicates this issue a lot: even in vedic sanskrit a "sandhi", or rules of pronunciation, is expressed in a morphology. However this expression is the result of the writing used being a been invented for an oral language. sandhi is the alteration of actual sounds to make the language sound a certain way. Could "modern" greek in fact reflect a kind of "sandhi" that is not refleted in morphology, but was nevertheless used while speaking any form of greek? Could the written language have always reflected an arbitrary form, perhaps originating from a time before it was used, but even then pronounced differently? This is a question I've begun to ask myself. I don't know what evidence exists that could shed light on this, or if the comparison with sanskrit is useful. I think claims to know the correct ancient pronunciation are debatable, anymore than perhaps we should interpret the art of classical athens in relation to the tradition of byzantine art. They represent different ideas. It seems at one point it was desirable to see the naked male as a great symbol, and this was not needed later. the appreciation of male beauty seems something christianity suppressed, and continues to treat with scorn. this comparison is something i would like to ask those who believe the contemporary pronunciation must be the only correct one. would the orthodox church set up, say a naked apollon, or zeus, or dionysos in the place of christ?</p>
<p>I'd like to add however that there is another reason, perhaps not a logical one, which isn't represented, that seems to weigh in favor of the contemporary pronunciation. it wouldn't surprise me that the western european nations who gained political power wouldn't plunder a nation's language and set up it's utterance with its own rules, just like it wouldn't surprise me that it would do the same with with that nation's artistic treasures. the only thing to see about it is that there's obviously a schism in the traditions, and that schism is marked by the pronunciation. these two groups don't seem to have any room for the other.</p>
<p>Indeed there is third piece of evidence, one that points to something else. the word of water in ancient greek is, as everyone knows, hydor or idor. The modern word is nero. It seems perhaps that what Thrax says oversimplifies a subject which i quite complicated. There are a lot of possible explainations. One of which is that modern greek preserves archaisms not in classical greek, or that classical greek has archaic words replaced by others. There's not enough evidence on this subject, at least that i've seen, to really know.</p>

He is not a linguistics researcher and has never published any papers of original research on ancient Greek pronunciation so why should we take his word for anything.

<dd>Once again Thrax makes unfounded allegations and projects his own insufficiency on others. The fact is that both the specialists of Ancient Greek and the Indo-Europeanists all agree that Ancient Greek was not "pronunced exactly like Modern Greek" (which would be an absurd allegation), but had its own phonological and phonetic system somewhere between Proto-Indo-European and Modern Greek. Thrax continues to assert that his excentric opinion has support from a majority of linguists even though he has not been able to cite <i>one single modern author specialised in Ancient Greek</i>.

<p>I beg your pardon, but can someone point me at any linguistic resources that refute Caragounis' study? I know Caragounis is not a linguist, but his research has asked some interesting questions, which I haven't seen answered by anyone (but I haven't searched much). So could someone point me to some text that scrutinises Caragounis' paper? I know most of the linguists have not even commented on Caragounis or outright dismissed his views, but so were they initially doing for Erasmus. 195.173.80.1 16:25, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm afraid I'm not aware of a published refutation in the linguistic literature either. But several fairly competent linguists among the contributors here have at least hinted at reasons why they find Caragounis' work unsatisfying, and to be honest, much of what is objectionable in it is really self-evident to the more-or-less-expert reader. Of course, that's not the stuff to write into the article, as it would be "original reasearch", but you can be assured it is a well-informed judgment. I'd be happy to provide a summary of my own thoughts, perhaps on my talk page, if you asked me to do that (and if I find the time). If you want to discuss this further, would you mind providing your username (or getting one)?

Another one, by Moises Silva, due to have appeared in <i>Westminster Theological Journal</i> in autumn 2005, was apparently going to be scathingly negative, according to pre-published excerpts here: [<a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/b-greek/2005-July/035132.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/b-greek/2005-July/035132.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>].

<dd>Hi and thanks. I haven't decided on a user name and one more password to remember yet (my usual username is taken), but I will as soon as I find something I can contribute to. I am mainly interested on the spelling errors Caragounis has identified, and especially the ones where EU is misspelled as EB. I would like know how others think regarding this and how could it be justified because I found it very interesting. I am sure that at some point Ancient Greek was pronounced the way that is prevelent today, but not sure what point in time they changed. Cheers! 195.173.80.1 11:14, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree with this article using such a bad scholarship as Caragounis. I gave up reading his paper when the "proves" ancient ευ had the sound of ef/ev, because Latin inscriptions show ev, only paragraphs after saying Latin phonology was an useless approach to greek phonology, he just forgot to mention that v only appeared in the Latin alphabet in the XVI century, and that it is above all doubts that what is v in modern languages was a "w" sound. I don't think any serious scholar would care to write a rebuttal to such a thing.<a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBruno_Gripp_4bd7.html" title="User:Bruno Gripp">Bruno Gripp</a> 14:41, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I found two authors (Sydney Allen and Michel Lejeune) who claim that the diphthong <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">οι</span> underwent the following evolution in pronunciation: <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[oi]&gt;[øi]&gt;[øː]&gt;[yː]&gt;[y]&gt;[i]</span>. In classical times it would have been [øi] already. The monophtongization to <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[øː]</span> would have occurred in roman times and the closing to <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[yː]</span> soon thereafter (starting to be confused with upsilon). Then, the story goes, the loss of vowel quantities accross the board (second-third century AD) reduced the sound to [y], with the modern sound [i] being set no earlier than the 9th century AD! Should we include all that in the article, or is it becoming a long article already? <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannos_b558.html" title="User:Yannos">Yannos</a> 07:03, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I guess we shouldn't load the article with too much detail. Of the 4 intermediate stages you mention above, one <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[yː]</span> is already explicitly mentioned, one (the loss of length) is implied in the sentence preceding it. Monophthongization is the explicit subject of the whole paragraph, and that something like <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[øː]</span> would be another stage on that way is pretty self-evident, isn't it? Perhaps we can find a way of adding a bit more precision to the wording, but I wouldn't recommend adding more than at most one more sentence for that purpose. Perhaps I'll give it a try later. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> 07:45, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To complicate the case even more, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[oi]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[øi]</span> were perhaps in fact <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɔʏ]</span> (like German <i>eu</i>) and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[œʏ]</span>. Anyway, the monophthongisation to <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[øː]</span> was probably beginning already in the Classical period (Teodorsson) and should perhaps be included in the article. <a href="../../../e/n/k/User%7EEnkyklios_88b5.html" title="User:Enkyklios">Enkyklios</a> 09:23, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The detailed <i>phonetic</i> changes are interesting, but less important, I think, than the <i>structural</i> changes. The crucial stages are those which change the phonemic inventory of the language, or which change the position of a sound within the overall system, e.g. from long to short or diphthong to monophthong. They are also the changes for which we have the best evidence. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 15:01, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As it is well-known, the diphthong <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/au/</span> is normally pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[aʊ]</span> in English and German, i.e. the second vowel of the diphthong, <a href="../../../n/e/a/Near-close_near-back_rounded_vowel.html" title="Near-close near-back rounded vowel"><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʊ]</span></a>, is slightly less closed and less back-tongue than the "clear" archetypical <a href="../../../c/l/o/Close_back_rounded_vowel.html" title="Close back rounded vowel"><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[u]</span></a>. The fact that Greek <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/au/</span> ultimately becomes <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[av, af]</span> speaks against a more open quality of the second vowel. On the other hand, misspellings like <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">ΑΟΤΟΚΡΑΤΗΣ</span> for <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">Αὐτοκράτης</span> (Attica, IG II(2).10706) indicate that <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[aʊ]</span> may have been a possibility in some varities of Greek. As a matter of fact, the non-standard spelling &lt;αο&gt; for &lt;αυ&gt; is rather frequent in inscriptions from the Ionic-speaking cities in both Asia Minor and the Black Sea area, which indicates that <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[aʊ]</span> was in fact a typical feature of Ionic. (An alternative explanation would be that the scribes considered &lt;ο&gt; more appropiate for <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[u]</span> than &lt;υ&gt;, which normally stood for <a href="../../../c/l/o/Close_front_rounded_vowel.html" title="Close front rounded vowel"><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[y]</span></a>.) I think it is better to avoid the more specific <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[aʊ]</span> and stick to the more general <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[au]</span> given that our sources give no unequivocal indication of the proper pronunciation. But it should be the same in the two articles. <a href="../../../e/n/k/User%7EEnkyklios_88b5.html" title="User:Enkyklios">Enkyklios</a> 08:20, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's slightly silly because in IPA <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/d̥ʰ/</span> is an aspirated voiced dental plosive, but the circle denotes that the voicing is removed so we get an aspirated unvoiced dental plosive, i.e. <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/tʰ/</span>. So there is no disagreement with the French as to what the pronounciation was, but they have chosen an awkward way of representing it. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdinborgarstefan_14d5.html" title="User:Edinborgarstefan">Stefán Ingi</a> 00:20, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am not sure that <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">d̥</span> = t. The circle denotes devoicing, which is not the same thing as inherent voicelessness. I would normally use <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">d̥</span> if I wanted to point out that it is an allophonic variant of plain <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">d</span>.

<dd>In my own langauge, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danish_phonology.html" title="Danish phonology">Danish</a>, the old opposition between voiceless and voiced stops has been given up in favour of an opposition between aspirates <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[b̥ʰ, d̥ʰ, g̊ʰ]</span> and non-unaspirates <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[b̥, d̥, g̊]</span> (voice being irrelevant and absent in the normal pronunciation). The stops in question do not have the muscular tension characteristic of the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortis.html" title="Fortis">fortis</a>, but at the same time they lack the voice normally associated with the <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lenis.html" title="Lenis">lenis</a>. In Ancient Greek, however, where we have a system of three articulations, voiceless, aspirated and voiced stops, the notation <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[b̥ʰ, d̥ʰ, g̊ʰ]</span> is probably misleading since it would be natural to articulate the three rows with the greatest possible distance. <a href="../../../e/n/k/User%7EEnkyklios_88b5.html" title="User:Enkyklios">Enkyklios</a> 07:47, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>By that means, one also has the opportunity of putting the later parallel development of the <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">δασέα</span> and <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">μἐσα</span> into fricatives on a common formula, viz. [÷tension] &gt; [+fricative]. However, the <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">δασέα</span> was in all likelihood fricativised hundreds of years later than the <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">μἐσα</span>. Furthermore, the very category of the voiceless lenis is disputed. Thus, in Paul Laver, <i>Principles of Phonetics</i> (Cambridge 1994), a rather comprehensive handbook of phonetics, we are told (pp. 343-4):
<dl>
<dd>"Second, a question is prompted about whether devoiced and voiceless segments are phonetically identical in all respects. One possible ground for maintaining that they are not identical would be that when a segment is fully voiced, various phonetic features (over and above the phonatory difference) have different values than when the corresponding voiceless segment is produced. These differentiating factors may include, potentially, the degree of muscular effort being exerted throughout the vocal system, particularly in the muscle system of the supralaryngeal vocal tract. Such differences of overall muscular effort have been posited as the basis for a distinction that is sometimes drawn between <b>fortis</b> sounds with high overall muscle tension (normally voiceless) and <b>lenis</b> sounds with low overall muscle tension (normally voiced). The argument would then run on to say that if the only change from a lenis voiced segment in producing its devoiced counterpart were a change of phonatory state from vibrating vocal folds to an open glottis, then the lenis devoiced segment would still be differentiated from its fortis voiceless counterpart by factors of overall muscular tension.</dd>
<dd>"The fortis/lenis distinction remains to be confirmed empirically, however, and until it is, a more cautious position would be to accept the equivalence of fully devoiced and voiceless sounds, as a limit to the descriptive power of phonetic theory. Both categories should then be treated as instances of voiceless sounds."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>At any rate, even if we accept <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[b̥ʰ, d̥ʰ, g̊ʰ]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[b̥, d̥, g̊]</span> in Danish and Icelandic (see <a href="../../../d/a/n/Talk%7EDanish_phonology_73be.html" title="Talk:Danish phonology">Talk:Danish phonology</a>), there is no reason for assuming that the Greek voiceless aspirated plosives <i>must</i> have been lenis as well (unless one denies that the aspirated tenuis exist).

<p>Sorry, I've never been able to find enough time to finish the French article and to quote my sources: Michel Lejeune, <i>Phonétique historique du Mycénien et du grec ancien</i>, Éditions Klincksieck, mainly §56 and §61 about the fact that, for him, so-called aspirated consonants were <i>lenis</i> consonants, that were distinguished from <i>fortis</i> (unvoiced stops, for instance)&#160;; hence φθ, χθ (<i>lenis</i> [de]aspirated + <i>lenis</i> aspirated) are not equivalent to πφ or κχ (gemminated consonants). See also §42 (). Michel Lejeune quotes epichoric inscriptions that confirm his views. If Lejeune is the only one to consider aspirated as <i>lenis</i> consonants opposed to <i>fortis</i> ones, I suppose that should be corrected. <a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVincent_Ramos_af8d.html" title="User:Vincent Ramos">Vincent Ramos</a> 16:39, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Greek versification speaks against a knacklaut. The liaison of a final consonant and the elision of a final vowel suggest that Ancient Greek behaved like most languages (including Modern Greek):

<p>I'd like to see someone more knowledgeable tackling with all the crazy divergence in phonetic nomenclature circling round the consonants, which will drive to tears any student dealing with the third declension in different grammars, particularly grammars in different languages. For instance, Georg Curtius puts daimon with the dentals; in a portuguese language grammar I have the third declension consonant groups divided in oclusives (or obstruents): labials (pi, beta, phi), dentals (t, theta, delta) and guturals (k, gamma, X); then liquids (rho and lambda), nasals (n and m) and sibilants (sigma). With Goodwin a whole other matter etc. Has any grammarian made something out of this mess; or is there any more authoritative classification in currency?</p>

<p>There is one Greek dialect that preserves eta as an eta sound and logically even keeps nu at the end of neuter singular nouns, and has other traces of the way ancient greek must have been pronounced. I consider, as those above me that an unchanging greek pronunciation or a correct greek pronunciation is somekind of dialectism (rather than nationalism) and disregards an empirical approach. It seems to me the pronunciation of the greek is something that certain people identify with prestige, and due to the many varying dialects, having been in greece recently, that the idea that there is one way to say greek is kindof like someone saying there is only one chinese and it has always been pronounced only one way and speakers of other dialects are just wrong. It is empirically a fact that there is no one dialect of greek currently spoken and written, there are many. None of them is ancient Attic, Epic, old Ionic etc.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.182.213.114 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.182.213.114_5ca7.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.182.213.114">contribs</a>).</small> [pasted from previous version by <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasJS_121f.html" title="User:AndreasJS"><span style="color:white;background:blue;border-style: double">&#160;Andreas&#160;</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndreasJS_db1e.html" title="User talk:AndreasJS"><font size="-2">(T)</font></a></sup> 21:43, 16 December 2006 (UTC)]</p>

<p>These charts are introduced with, "the following scheme proposed by Allen (1968) is generally accepted." But Allen (p. 60) says the sounds represented by ε and ο are "rather like the vowels of English <i>pet</i> and German <i>Gott</i>." Thus Allen held that ε = the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open-mid_front_unrounded_vowel.html" title="Open-mid front unrounded vowel">open-mid front unrounded vowel</a> and ο = the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open-mid_back_rounded_vowel.html" title="Open-mid back rounded vowel">open-mid back rounded vowel</a>. Certainly his examples show that he was not suggesting the values indicated in this chart, and repeated in the articles <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greek_c878.html" title="Ancient Greek">Ancient Greek</a> and <a href="../../../e/p/s/Epsilon.html" title="Epsilon">epsilon</a> (where it's not specified Ancient Greek or Modern Greek—but in neither, according to Allen, was ε = the <a href="../../../c/l/o/Close-mid_front_unrounded_vowel.html" title="Close-mid front unrounded vowel">close-mid front unrounded vowel</a>). Phonology is not my forte, but I think I'm reading Allen correctly. If so, either the chart needs to be changed to follow Allen, or references should be given supporting the values given (and the claim that the chart follows Allen modified). <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWareh_c537.html" title="User:Wareh">Wareh</a> 18:36, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the reminder, and sorry I forgot to answer earlier. As I haven't got Allen here at home, I can only answer (as so often) with Horrocks and Babiniotis. Both of these authors don't comment on the exact (mid-open or mid-close) phonetic nature of short &lt;ε&gt; and &lt;ο&gt;. Both use /e/ and /o/ as phonemic renderings, just as we seem to be doing here. The point is, since the short vowels didn't have a four-heights distinction, the mid ones could easily have had either quality, or could have varied between both, or simply been in between (as they are in Modern Greek). It's common practice in phonology that if a language has only a three-heights distinction, the middle members are phonemically rendered as e and o irrespective of their exact phonetic nature, these being simply the more familiar and easy to use symbols. And since lengthening and contraction of /e, o/ led to &lt;ει, ου&gt; (i.e. /e:, o:/, <i>not</i> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[/ɛː,ɔː/]</span>), I was under the impression that a distinctly mid-open phonetic quality would have been unlikely at that stage. – By the way, if Allen really uses only his impressionistic analogies with "Gott" and "pet", and doesn't give a distinct phonetic description, it's actually not quite easy to reconstruct what he meant. The English "pet" vowel at least has quite a large range of possible realisations, and in some forms of RP British English it's pretty much extactly "mid". <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 17:58, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
