<p>Many Egyptian temples are still standing today. Others are in ruin from wear and tear, while others have been lost entirely. The Egyptian structures are among the largest man-made constructions ever conceived. They constitute one of the most potent and enduring symbols of Ancient Egyptian civilization. King Tut's rock cut tomb in the Valley of the Kings was full of jewellery and antiques. <a href="../../../p/t/a/Ptah.html" title="Ptah">Ptah</a> was the primordial mound, and had called creation into being, he was considered the god of craftsmen, and in particular stone-based crafts. <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Egyptian_architecture_2c85.html" title="Ancient Egyptian architecture">Ancient Egyptian architecture</a> stretches over at least ten thousand years.

<p>The ancient Egyptians had some of the first monumental stone building (such as in Sakkhara). How the <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptians.html" title="Egyptians">Egyptians</a> worked the solid <a href="../../../g/r/a/Granite.html" title="Granite">granite</a> is still a matter of debate. Dr. Patrick Hunt <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> has postulated that the Egyptians used <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emery_%28mineral%29.html" title="Emery (mineral)">emery</a> shown to have higher <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardenability.html" title="Hardenability">hardness</a> on the <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohs_scale_of_mineral_hardness.html" title="Mohs scale of mineral hardness">Mohs scale</a>. Regarding construction, of the various methods possibly used by builders, the lever moved and uplifted <a href="../../../o/b/e/Obelisk.html" title="Obelisk">obelisks</a> weighing more than 100 <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tonne.html" title="Tonne">tons</a>. Any rigid object that is used with an appropriate fulcrum or pivot point to multiply the mechanical force that can be applied to another object. This is also termed mechanical advantage, and is one example of the principle of moments. The principle of leverage can also be derived using Newton's laws of motion, and modern statics. It is important to notice that the amount of work done is given by force times distance. The lever allows less effort to be expended to move an object a greater distance. For instance, to use a lever to lift a certain unit of weight with an effort of half a unit, the distance from the fulcrum of the spot where force is applied must be twice the distance between the weight and the fulcrum. For example, to halve the effort of lifting a weight resting 1 meter from the fulcrum, we would need to apply force 2 meres from the other side of the fulcrum. The amount of work done is always the same and independent of the dimensions of the lever (in an ideal lever). The lever only allows to trade effort for distance. Levers are one of the six <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_machine.html" title="Simple machine">simple machines</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../o/b/e/Obelisk.html" title="Obelisk">Obelisks</a> were a prominent part of the architecture of the ancient Egyptians, who placed them in pairs at the entrance of temples. In 1911, Encyclopedia Britannica wrote, "The earliest temple obelisk still in position is that of Senwosri I. of the XIIth Dynasty at Heliopolis (68 ft. high)". The word "obelisk" is of Greek rather than Egyptian origin because Herodotus, the great traveler, was the first writer to describe the objects. Twenty-seven ancient Egyptian obelisks are known to have survived, plus the Unfinished obelisk found partly hewn from its quarry at Aswan. The obelisk symbolized the sun god <a href="../../../r/a/_/Ra.html" title="Ra">Ra</a> and during the brief religious reformation of Akhenaten was said to be a petrified ray of the aten, the sundisk. It was also thought that the god existed within the structure. The Egyptians also used <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pillar.html" title="Pillar">pillars</a> extensively.</p>
<p>The Ancient Egyptians had knowledge to some extent of <a href="../../../s/a/i/Sail.html" title="Sail">sail</a> construction.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> This is governed by the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">science</a> of <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerodynamics.html" title="Aerodynamics">aerodynamics</a>. A primary feature of a properly designed sail is an amount of "<a href="../../../d/r/a/Draft_%28sailing%29.html" title="Draft (sailing)">draft</a>", caused by curvature of the surface of the sail. When the sail is oriented into the wind, this curvature induces lift, much like the wing of an airplane. It is unknown if the Ancient Egyptians had <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kite.html" title="Kite">kites</a>, but a team lead by Mory Gharib raised a 6,900-pound, 15-foot obelisk into vertical position with a kite, a system of pulleys, and a support frame.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> Maureen Clemmons developed the idea that the ancient Egyptian used kites for work.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> Ramps have been reported as being widely used in Ancient egypt. A ramp is inclined plane, or a plane surface set at an angle (other than a right angle) against a horizontal surface. The inclined plane permits one to overcome a large resistance by applying a relatively small force through a longer distance than the load is to be raised. In civil engineering the slope (ratio of rise/run) is often referred to as a grade or gradient. An inclined plane is one of the commonly-recognized simple machines.</p>

<p>Irrigation as the artificial application of water to the soil was used to some extent in Ancient Egypt.

The <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptians.html" title="Egyptians">Egyptians</a> made small jars and bottles using the core-formed method. Glass threads were wound around a bag of sand tied to a rod. The glass was continually reheated to fuse the threads together. The glass-covered sand bag was kept in motion until the required shape and thickness was achieved. The rod was allowed to cool, then finally the bag was punctured and the rod removed. The Egyptians also created the first colored glass rods which they used to create colorful beads and decorations.

<p>Egypt was one of the most important places in the development of <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">astrology</a>, although astrology first originated in Babylon. Early Egyptian culture identified celestial objects with gods and spirits. They related these objects (and their movements) to phenomena such as rain, drought, seasons, and tides. It is generally believed that the first "professional" astronomers were priests, and that their understanding of the "heavens" was seen as "divine", hence <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronomy.html" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a>'s ancient connection to what is now called astrology. Ancient structures with astronomical alignments (such as Pyramids and temples) probably fulfilled both astronomical and religious functions. Egyptian astrology had star charts have been found in Egypt that go back as far as 4,200 BC. It is thought that some of the astrological signs of the zodiac originated in Egypt, although most did originate in Babylon. Aries the ram appears for the first time in an Egyptian zodiac, although the head of a goose was also used as a symbol by the Egyptians. It is also possible that the sign of Gemini the Twins first appeared in Egypt, named after the two bright stars Castor and Pollux, which were called the 'Two Stars' by the Egyptians. There is also evidence of a Babylonian origin for Gemini however, as the symbol of the twins appears there too. Leo the Lion is almost certainly Egyptian in origin, as the Babylonian name for the same constellation was the Great Dog. Virgo the virgin is quite likely to have originated with the Egyptian grain goddess Nidaba, as in Egypt the harvest began when the full moon was in Virgo.</p>

<p>Claims have been made that precession was known in <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Egypt_c49a.html" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a> prior to the time of Hipparchus. Some buildings in the <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karnak.html" title="Karnak">Karnak</a> temple complex, for instance, were allegedly oriented towards the point on the horizon where certain stars rose or set at key times of the year. A few centuries later, when precession made the orientations obsolete, the temples would be rebuilt. Note however that the observation that a stellar alignment has grown wrong does not necessarily mean that the <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptians.html" title="Egyptians">Egyptians</a> understood or even cared what was going on. For instance, from the Middle Kingdom on they used a table with entries for each month to tell the time of night from the passing of constellations: these went in error after a few centuries because of their calendar and precession, but were copied (with scribal errors) for long after they lost their practical usefulness. The <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dendera_Zodiac_2168.html" title="Dendera Zodiac">Dendera Zodiac</a>, a star-map from the <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hathor_temple.html" title="Hathor temple">Hathor temple</a> at <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dendera.html" title="Dendera">Dendera</a> from a late (Ptolemaic) age, supposedly records precession of the equinoxes (Tompkins 1971). In any case, if the ancient Egyptians knew of precession, their knowledge is not recorded in surviving astronomical texts, which suggest they were not assiduous observers of the sky (Parker).</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edwin_Smith_papyrus_74d9.html" title="Edwin Smith papyrus">Edwin Smith papyrus</a> is one of the first medical documents still extant, and perhaps the earliest document which attempts to describe and analyse the brain: given this, it might be seen as the very beginnings of modern <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neuroscience.html" title="Neuroscience">neuroscience</a>. However, while <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptian_medicine.html" title="Egyptian medicine">Egyptian medicine</a> had some effective practices, it was not without its ineffective and sometimes harmful practices. Medical historians believe that ancient Egyptian pharmacology was largely ineffective. <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[16]</a></sup> According to a paper published by Michael D. Parkins, 72% of medical 260 prescriptions in the Hearst Papyrus had no curative elements.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[17]</a></sup> According to Michael D. Parkins, sewage pharmacology first began in ancient Egypt and was continued through the Middle Ages,<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[18]</a></sup> and while the use of animal dung can have curative properties,<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[19]</a></sup> it is not without its risk. Practices such as applying cow dung to wounds, ear piercing and tattooing, and chronic ear infections were important factors in developing tetanus.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[20]</a></sup> Frank J. Snoek wrote that Egyptian medicine used fly specks, lizard blood, swine teeth, and other such remedies which he believes could have been harmful.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="../../../m/u/m/Mummy.html" title="Mummy">Mummification</a> of the dead was not always practised in Egypt. Once the practice began, an individual was placed at his/her final resting place through a set of rituals and protocol. The Egyptian funeral was a complex ceremony including various monuments, prayers, and rituals undertaken in the dead's honor. The poor, which could not afford expensive tombs were buried in shallow graves in the sand, and because of the arid environment they were often naturally mummified.</p>
