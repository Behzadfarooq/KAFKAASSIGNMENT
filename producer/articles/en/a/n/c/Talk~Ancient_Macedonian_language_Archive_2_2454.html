<h2><span class="mw-headline">Doric</span></h2>
<p><i>kalan ameran</i>, everyone&#160;:) — for the purposes of the Macedon article, do we have any example word that shows Doric as well as (<i>Berenice</i>-style) XMK-characteristics? <i>alixa, aliza</i> "alder" (PIE *ol-, *el-) could be one? BTW, I am getting the impression that there were <i>several</i> languages in Ancient Macedonia, but we don't have enough data to resolve them. There would have been Doric Greek, I suppose, and there was also XMK, and maybe others (or, to put it differently, "XMK" didn't exist, there were several unknown languages). To put it like this would amount to original research, since I've only just thought of that. But probably someone somewhere would have published a similar idea? no? <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 08:58, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<i>Queen Veronica (gasping)</i>: "Cleo, how <i>could</i> you do dis?!? I-am-your-<i>moder</i>!"<br />
<i>Princess Cleopatra (leering)</i>: "Yeah, but your name, like, <i><b>lacks aspiration</b></i>, and I aspire to be, like, <i><b>QUEEN OF EGYPT</b></i>. And to, like, marry that hunk, your husband and my brother Ptolemy! Now, <i><b>DIE!</b></i>"<br /></p>

<dd>Well, if you take off thinking that Alexander <i>might</i> have not identified himself as a Greek, but as a Macedonian instead, and then, after getting drunk, you conclude that he <i>actually did</i> the latter rather than the former, then I say that the old adage "in vino veritas" is strictly true about <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wine.html" title="Wine">wine</a>, not <a href="../../../g/i/n/Gin.html" title="Gin">gin</a>. You state what is "often viewed". In <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galileo.html" title="Galileo">Galileo</a>'s case who was right? He or what most people "often viewed"? What most people often think or say does not define the truth by necessity. Well, maybe we should ask Alexander himself. Some quotes of his exist <i><b>verbatim</b></i>, you know. Do you recall what inscription he ordered written when he sent 12 Persian shields to be hanged on the west architrave of the Parthenon as trophies? <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">Chronographos</a> 14:47, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it says something like Alexander son of Philip, a Hellene,... conquered Asia from the barbarous nations. Decius 15:02, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I give you an F for "fail". I was frankly hoping that, someone who states that Language A is a different one than Language B, should be able to read Language B (since there are no intact A texts). Here is the translation: "Alexander son of Philip and the Greeks, <i>with the exception of the Spartans</i>, from the barbarians who inhabit Asia". The Spartan jab has to do with the fact that the Spartans refused to join the expedition because "every expedition in which Spartans participate should always be headed by a Spartan". The Spartans were living in the past, and Alexander was pointing that out most, er, pointedly. That piece of sarcasm apart, what does the inscription tell you on the matter of Alexander's own perception of himself and his troops? Something more than gin, one should hope ... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">Chronographos</a> 15:41, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alexander the Great may well have identified as a Greek, since he got along more with his mother, who was a Greek, and there is also his father's Argive ancestry. Decius 15:22, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>what evidence is there that Epirotes were Greeks? What Argive ancestry? That's a very vague claim. The Argeads were <i><b>way</b></i> more specific: they claimed to be descendants of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hercules.html" title="Hercules">Hercules</a> himself. <i>Maybe</i> they were just aggrandizing themselves. Surely they didn't have the certificates matching their DNA to Hercules' DNA, did they? Is this the kind of "evidence" you prefer? In other words: your opinion is that Alexander's Parthenon inscription is unreliable because he had ulterior motives, whereas the Argeads' claim that they were descendants of .... Hercules (!) is sound and <i>could not possibly have had an ulterior motive</i>. <i><b>Yeah right ...</b></i> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">Chronographos</a> 16:17, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>See above. Alexander dictates the inscription on behalf of the victors: himself (as king) and his troops (<i>the Greeks with the exception of the Spartans</i>). What now? Had he no Macedonians with him, that he should honor their part in the war? <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">Chronographos</a> 15:41, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hmm, maybe because the inscription was written in Athens, he didn't want to take pride away from the Greeks by underlining the Macedonian part, and maybe identifying Greeks with Macedonians was part of the policy of the Hellenization. Who knows. Decius 15:51, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I can't read ancient Greek off the top, but if I would've checked Perseus I could've done it. I got lazy and just looked in my Scott &amp; Liddel's book, and didn't find enough info. I can read it now, what really tripped me up was the use of 'plen' and I confused katoikounton with kat-oikeo, 'to be governed over', and I thought of 'govern over'&gt; conquer.

<p>The fact that I'm a <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbarian.html" title="Barbarian">barbaros</a> from the North&#160;:) who can't yet read ancient Greek without comprehensive dictionaries isn't relevant to the article or what it says. However, I am for the Greek dialect view being given more prominence, since enough scholars support it. Now, the Epirotes question: I can ask you the same thing about the Macedonians. Decius 16:33, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My point exactly! There is similar dearth of existing <i>hard</i> evidence about the Epirotes and what they spoke. Yet you remain "unconvinced" about the Macedonians while accepting the Epirotes as Greeks. <i>Maybe</i> you just don't know enough about either of them, Decius .... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">Chronographos</a> 16:45, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm looking for a quote about Epirotes that I read last night that is relevant here. B back. Decius 16:52, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>According to R. Malcolm Errington, in his <i>A History of Macedonia</i> (paraphrasing): "the fundamental Greek nationality of the Epirotes, Acarnanians, and Aetolians was never doubted", "unlike the Macedonians", whose Greekness was called into question. See chapter 1, pg. 4. I might quote it exactly later, but that's what he says. Decius 16:57, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've been looking for more linguists who support the Macedonian-Greek dialect camp, but so far I have only collected more historians who believe that. R. Malcolm Errington himself in that 1986 book that I just mentioned views Macedonians as speakers of a Greek dialect. Errington was a Professor of Ancient History at the Philipps-Universität in Marsburg, West Germany (sic). Decius 17:22, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>So, if I understand correctly what you wrote, Errington says that <i>he himself</i> thinks that Macedonians spoke a Greek dialect, whereas their Greekness has been <i>questioned by others</i>? Is this the meaning of the Passive Voice ("never doubted", "called into question") Errington uses? Do I get it right? <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">Chronographos</a> 17:27, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>You got it right. Errington believes that Macedonian was a Greek dialect, but he discusses how their Greekness was called into question by the Greeks. He remarks how Macedonians, Epirotes, Acarnanians, and Aetolians all led the same "alien way of life" (verbatim): "<b>This alien way of life was, however, common to the western Greeks in Epeiros, Acarnania, and Aitolia, as well as to the Macedonians, and their fundamental Greek nationality was never doubted.</b>" In the context of the paragraph &amp; the text, he is remarking how the Macedonians were singled out as non-Greeks for some reason, while those others weren't, according to Errington. Decius 17:35, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>However, I've been reading Errington's book and he seems to be deceptive or selective, claiming for example in one place that the Greekness of the Macedonians was only questioned when the dispute with Athens developed, while <i>in another place</i> he discusses and admits how Herodotus recorded that the Macedonians were excluded from the Olympics until Alexander the I....so...Errington isn't the book I go by. Decius 17:42, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The contradiction will be found as you turn from page 3 to 4, if somebody's curious, and I'll probably quote it later. I've noted that type of juggling of the facts before, which is why I trust linguists more than historians and classicists who are overflowing with pan-hellenism---not that that's bad, but it colors their interpretations. Decius 17:45, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Pg 3:<b>This claim</b> (Greek descent)<b>was already made by Alexander I, who wished to participate as a runner in the Olympic Games, which apparently no Macedonian before him had done. But because participation was traditionally restricted to Greeks, Alexander had to prove his Greek ancestry, which he was able to do brilliantly with the tale of the Argive origins of his family.</b> Errington doesn't proceed to question that Macedonians were excluded because Greeks viewed them as non-Hellenes. He seems to accept that fact, and he moves on. On page 4 however, he says this: <b>Ancient allegations that the Macedonians were non-Greeks all had their origin in Athens at the time of the struggle with Philip II.</b>---That's not only false, it is a contradiction. Decius 18:35, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>So, that is why I am suspicious of the real motives and of the scholarly integrity of individuals like Errington, Hammond, monsieur Masson, and others of their ilk. Decius 18:37, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Gosh, Decius, for a fellow who gets confused by "plen" (Greek kids learn <i>plen</i> at 1st Grade, when they are taught how to subtract: three oranges <i>plen</i> two oranges equals one orange), you're awful quick to be passing judgement on the Oxford Classical Dictionary, and the <i>Grand Professorial Conspiracy</i> which <i><b>you</b></i>, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trajan.html" title="Trajan">Decius Maximus</a>, so bravely exposed . Medical students who do this at Rounds get "pimped". Some <i>have</i> been driven to suicide after being repeatedly pimped. The rest learn rather quickly. Nevertheless all you do is quote, quote, quote, and then opine, opine, opine on the quotations, quotations, quotations. Yet your scientific training in the relevant field appears to be zero. My insistence, rather, is quite <i>simple</i>: focus on the <i>evidence</i>. Evaluate what's there. Coins, inscriptions, even poor old Hesychius writing ten centuries after the "crime". Hesychius, Hesychius, wheretofore art thou, Hesychius? <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">Chronographos</a> 19:20, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC) (PS I don't know the specifics of your self-described alcohol-related issues, but please read <a href="../../../d/r/y/Dry_drunk.html" title="Dry drunk">this</a>.

<p>You seem to have gotten frustrated. I wonder why. More evidence indeed is needed here, so feel free to bring it.

<p>That's rather contradictory. It hasn't been two days since I randomly found myself in the basement of Gilbert Jeune by St-Michel, going through a book that was called "Façons de parler grec à Rome". The editor's presentation reads: "César selon Suétone serait mort dans les deux langues, s'adressant en latin à ses ennemis politiques, en grec à son fils". There was no Roman citizen who couldn't speak Greek. Of course the question that comes up is "what was ever a Roman" other than a title of power? The people who were originally "ethnic Romans" were assimilated into their own Empire. I suppose the Roman Empire was so great that got all Romans extinct... I think I'll stick with the empire of Alexander III.

Your question regarding why some people like Demosthenes did call Macedonians barbarians (while nobody ever wasted his time on Aetolians and Epirotes) can be easily answered by considering the military power of Macedon under Philip II. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 14:34, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<i>In the meanwhile, I pride myself on not being able to translate that ancient Greek sentence off the top of my head, because I identify myself as a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Citizen_5f2a.html" title="Roman Citizen">Roman</a>.

<p>That's rather contradictory. It hasn't been two days since I randomly found myself in the basement of Gilbert Jeune by St-Michel, going through a book that was called "Façons de parler grec à Rome". The editor's presentation reads: "César selon Suétone serait mort dans les deux langues, s'adressant en latin à ses ennemis politiques, en grec à son fils". There was no Roman citizen who couldn't speak Greek. Of course the question that comes up is "what was ever a Roman" other than a title of power? The people who were originally "ethnic Romans" were assimilated into their own Empire. I suppose the Roman Empire was so great that got all Romans extinct... I think I'll stick with the empire of Alexander III.

<p>I agree with you on some points. For instance, Greeks can call themselves Romans (if they want to) as much as any Italian can. It does not have to do with Rome, but with the empire. Decius 14:39, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>No. Doric is undisputedly Greek. XMK is not. I agree it's a compelling that XMK was marginal even in the 4th century, and maybe was never more than a mountain dialect. I.e. it may be argued that <i>Ancient Macedonian</i> is a <b>misnomer</b>, since typical Macedonians spoke Doric. Maybe. But that does not in the least suggest that XMK = Doric. Where is the Doric vocalism in XMK? Where is the XMK voicing in Doric? Also, it would be more compelling if the katadesmos was 5th century. <i>Everybody</i> agrees Greek became dominant from the 4th century. An interesting text.

<p>Oh please, you sound as if you're quoting from Makedonija.com. How the hell has this false idea got stuck in your head?

There is no basis on <a href="../../../d/o/r/Doric.html" title="Doric">Doric</a> being an imported language.

<p>Sigh, maybe that's because such "sound-change patterns" could not be reflected in Classical <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greek_c878.html" title="Ancient Greek">Ancient Greek</a> where the alphabet consisted of raw capital letters.

<p>I thought about an unlikely explanation myself: the katadesmos writer may have decided to not indicate the sounds properly in the text, representing them rather by standard sounds (ph, th, etc.), the reason being to make Macedonian look like more standard Greek in writing. But I don't believe that. The evidence is conflicting, and the solution I see is that in ancient Macedon, speakers of Doric (Pella katadesmos) lived beside speakers of XMK (Berenike, danos, kombous, kebala, etc.).

<p>After all is said and done, I'm confident that ancient Macedonian would qualify as a language: there would be enough differences to support that.

<p>Theathenae, be careful: Attic <i>amalos</i> is an alpha euphonicum added to the stem <i>mal</i>, meaning 'soft', from PIE *mel, 'soft', while the Macedonian word is claimed by some to be from PIE *amma, from which comes Latin <i>amare</i> (to love). Decius 21:00, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Actually, if Macedonian <i>amale</i> is also a euphonic alpha added to <i>mal</i>, then it can be a cognate.

<dd>Judging from that glossary, XMK looks like an archaic form of Greek with a few loanwords from neighbouring Thraco-Illyrian languages. Either that or it preserved more IE vocabulary than the southern Greek dialects, which had heavy pre-Hellenic (non-IE) substratal influences. Macedonian will probably be proven beyond any reasonable doubt to be archaic Greek within our lifetimes, just like <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linear_B_f07f.html" title="Linear B">Linear B</a> was.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 22:44, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>One reason why I never incorporated the Babaev glossary is because I wanted to verify more of his info. I was satisfied to leave it as an external link.

<p>Chronographos, you came in here making various accusations and insults, none of which stick.

<dd>Decius, your continual alcoholic stupor has probably deprived you of all sense of time, place and especially judgement. I came home <i>very late</i> last night from my Med School class reunion, sat down at the PC for half an hour, took care of the downloads, email etc that had transpired during my absence, answered all pertinent points in this discussion, and went straight to bed <i>as the sun was about to rise</i>. So, according to you, I should have stayed online, sleepless on a Sunday morning, and waited for your esteemed person to respond to me. <i><b>The fact that I did not, and went to sleep at 5 AM, proves that I am wrong and a liar to boot???</b></i> You are <i>severely unbalanced</i>, Decius, and that's all there is to it. To sum things up: I will be on Wikipedia on MY spare time, as fits MY schedule, I will respond WHENEVER I please, and THERE AIN'T NOTHIN' YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT EITHER. On to the substantive points:
<dl>
<dd>The links on Babaev's site <b>don't work</b> as of 12:42 Greek time, Sunday, June 26th 2005. As of 7 or 8 hours ago, the Lidell-Scott search facility at Perseus found <b>no</b> entries under <i>ankulos</i>, <i>ankos</i>, <i>ankistron</i>, <b>because there aren't any</b>. The words proper are <i>άγκιστρον</i> etc. Indeed I doubt that <i>any</i> Greek word exists with the complex -nk- in it. So you can take the <i>American Heritage Dictionary</i> and shove it where it best pleases you. As <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> pointed out to you, ν turns to γ before κ. <i>Always</i>. Therefore there is <i><b>no</b></i> Attic word <i>ankalis</i>: the word is <i>agkalis</i> and it means "bent arm" and by extension whatever can be held in bent arms. Hence the modern Greek usage: <i>agkale/agkalia</i>, a hug or an armful. Which is exactly how manual laborers harvest wheat: they hug as many wheatstalks as they can, and then cut them with the sickle. So don't you "email AHD" me. When Perseus comes back online at 7:00 Eastern Time, you can check for yourself. Otherwise I'll be happy to scan and post the relevant page(s) from my Liddell-Scott (Greek 4-volume Edition, 1948). Now it <i>is</i> conceivable that you think AHD a higher authority on Classics that Liddell-Scott. Which ties perfectly with your stated preference to urinating out of windows over the study of Greek.
<dl>
<dd>I asked you <i><b>why</b></i> are the two <i>amalos</i> words <i>considered</i> to stem from two different roots and you failed to explain. It seems that, whenever something does not suit your outlandish, unscientific theories, a mysterious Passive Voice comes out of the blue and vindicates them. Not to mention that the "Attic"" cognate in your Glossary has an H (δασεία) which should not be there. Was this in AHD too? A dictionary that can't even spell? This is pathetic, Decius. Under different circumstances, I'd urge you to <i>do better than that</i>, but it seems you are incapable of doing better. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">Chronographos</a> 10:57, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>O <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">Chronográphe</a>, to be fair, the traditional Roman transliteration of the -γκ- cluster is -nk-, not -gk-, as that is how it was pronounced. Hence <a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankylosis.html" title="Ankylosis">ankylosis</a> in English, rather than <i>agkylosis</i>. Also, the <i>hamalē</i> with the <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">δασεῖα</span> was put there by yours truly as that's what L&amp;S gives as the <i>Attic</i> form (<b><span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">ἁμαλός</span></b>), immediately after the main entry <b><span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">ἀμᾰλός</span></b>, which I presume is the general (non-Attic) Greek form.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 11:21, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You are obviously right about "Roman transliteration", but this is not about how a Greek word is transliterated <i>for use in the Latin language</i>: this is about how a Greek word is transliterated <i>so that people without Greek fonts may visualize the Greek word</i>. And the proper pronunciation is "ang". If <i>ank</i> were pronounced <i>ank</i> in Greek, there would be no need for the <i>k</i> to uniformly turn into <i>g</i> before <i>n</i>. Remember the cardinal rule of Ancient Greek "spelling": you don't read what is written, you write what you pronounce. There is a (Thessalian, I believe) inscription that reads "εμ πόλει" (in the city). It is <i>not</i> a "spelling error". As for the <i>amalos</i> entry, I'm sorry but my 1948 LS print edition only lists it with a ψιλή. Since Perseus is down for maintenance right now, I cannot check if an entry with δασεία currently exists as well.<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">Chronographos</a> 11:40, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)

As for <b><span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">ἁμαλός</span></b>, it is listed in my 1997 LS abridged edition, so its absence from your 1948 print edition is mysterious to say the least.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 12:08, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>The <i>nk</i> vs. <i>gk</i> question is really a red herring. It matters for the alphabetical ordering, but that's about it. Indeed, I imported the list so it can be checked and improved.

<dd>Dab, can you please talk some sense into Decius? And can we please have some decent conversation here? Decius is really impossible to deal with: one moment he says that this young Russian diplomat is not trustworthy, and five minutes later he proclaims that, given a difference of opinion between LSJ and Babaev, the issue is unresolved. If the opinion of an "untrustworthy source" is given equal gravity to the opinion of the standard Greek Lexicon, there is <i>no way</i> arguments can be advanced to a satisfactory conclusion. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">Chronographos</a> 12:30, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>But would we do that just for the Attic, or for the Macedonian too? Decius may not appreciate the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_alphabet.html" title="Greek alphabet">Greek alphabet</a> being used for XMK, and bring out his <a href="../../../a/k/-/AK-47_b9b4.html" title="AK-47">AK-47</a>.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 12:32, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Which brings up another grave concern of mine. I do not want to insinuate <i>anything</i>, but it will not be flattering to Wikipedia if someone had trouble with the law down the line.

<dd>I don't get it. Of course XMK was written in the Greek alphabet <i>as far as it was written at all</i>, what else? Linear B? Babaev is really not an issue. I mean, he hacked together an online glossary, that's great, and for some time that was the only XMK resource on the internet. Why would we bash him because it is not up to academic standards? Nobody ever claimed it was. That was just our <i>starting point</i>. Now if everybody is really so confused by <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transliteration.html" title="Transliteration">transliteration</a>, let's just move back to the Greek alphabet, for the glossary. This is likely to cause more confusion, of course, since the Greeks (who seem to pass through here in droves) will just think beta is [v] and eta is [i] etc, but at least we'll be just giving the attested forms. Using <i>one-to-one</i> transliteration of the Greek alphabet, a gamma is just rendered as <i>g</i>, no matter if it corresponds to [g] or not. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 12:57, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>also, transliteration is useful from keeping apart the language from the script. Note that I wrote the entire <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_grammar.html" title="Arabic grammar">Arabic grammar</a> article without using a single arabic letter, and that's not because I don't know how to.

<dd>Ladies and gentlemen, see my Perseus link, which is up once again now. Each of those three words are transliterated by Perseus exactly as I transliterated them: <i>ankulos</i>, <i>ankos</i>, <i>ankistron</i> (and <i>agkalis</i> is transliterated as <i>ankalis</i>, and the Macedonian word is even mentioned in the Perseus text <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3a1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3d%23545" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3a1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3d%23545" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>). We are writing for English readers, and I never heard of "agkylosis" in English. Decius 18:39, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As I said, it's a matter of transliteration and phonology. We fully understand Greek phonology, and therefore we know that <i>agk</i> is rendered <i>/ank/</i>. We can assume as much for XMK, of course, but with an unknown language, it is more safe to use a lossless transliteration. Greek transliteration of alpha-gamma-kappa is <i>not</i> lossless. it collapses with hypothetical alpha-nu-kappa. Only, we know that alpha-nu-kappa will not occur, or be equivalent to alpha-gamma-kappa. Can we say as much for XMK? If in doubt, trasliterate without loss of information. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 19:00, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>When I search LSJ online with the "ank" string, only the word <i>anakrites</i> (!) comes up. LSJ's transliteration (e.g. ankalis) is <i>unacceptable</i> unless either one of two conditions exist: (1) readers are alerted that γ before κ is always transliterated as <i>n</i>, or (2) the Greek script is exhibited alongside in the printed edition. In any other case, your comments about "losslessness" apply fully. And I cannot accept that LSJ have been so sloppy. Therefore one of the two conditions must be actually present in print, possibly both. The fact that the online version does not meet them means that people ignorant of Greek (e.g. Decius) are handicapped. 212.251.109.253 21:47, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Chronographos, your gloss on Macedonian <i>ankalis</i> is unlikely: more likely it did not refer to an armful of anything, but to the bent sickle (PIE *ank): it is a singular noun. In Attic, the singular noun referred to the (bent) arm. Decius 19:59, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I fully agree with LSJ's comments on <i>agkalis</i>. I never said that it meant "an armful". I explained how the term evolved afterwards. Ignorant people, like you, should show express gratitude at such tutoring.

In other words, more IE, as the other Greek dialects arrived much earlier and absorbed significant pre-Hellenic substratal elements. I guess that begs the question, how do you define "Greek"? Perhaps the traditional definition is no longer valid.

<p>On the subject of the glossary again, Perseus has a lot of these Macedonian words in its database: I've found <i>ankalis</i>, <i>abagna</i>, <i>akrounoi</i> (that spelling, and it is related to <i>akros</i> as I guessed), <i>argipous</i> (Mac.=aetos), <i>arkon</i>, <i>baskioi</i>, <i>kombous</i>, <i>sarissa</i> (of course, common), <i>kanadoi</i>, <i>adis</i>, <i>danos</i> (&gt;Macedonian word mentioned by Plutarch according to Perseus), and no doubt others, but I'll check later.

<p><i>Berenike</i> dates back to the time of Alexander the Great (was a common name among the Ptolemies who succeeded him, etc.), so <i>extremely</i> doubtful that the Pella Katadesmos is Macedonian (lacking voiced aspirates, etc.), and it's no wonder that Borza and others reject it, I assume (one of Borza's latest works is from 1999, so he would have known of the katadesmos). Borza by the way is in fact a highly regarded authority in Macedonian studies, not just linguistics. His works are even referenced as authoritative by Errington who I mentioned before, among others. So Borza carries as much weight as Hammond in the field: Borza of course has also criticized Hammond and is directly opposed to him. I'm going to look for works by both authors and compare. It seems, judging by criticisms I've read, that Hammond has also made contradictory statements in the manner of Errington (no concerted conspiracy going on, it's apparently a tendency among many of these individuals).

<dd>Well, your question is too vague. I know more than nothing and less than everything, obviously &#160;:-)) Is there something specific you'd like to ask? Βερενίκη and Φερενίκη "aren't all that different" because they are the same word. It is interesting that the likes of Decius focus on it alone, for some weird reason, and refuse to examine the evidence offered by all surviving Macedonian names. Indeed what the survival of Βερενίκη as a personal name until Roman times (to the exclusion of the <i>Koine</i> form Φερενίκη) suggests, is that Macedonians were justly proud of their particular pronunciation and names, and sought to conserve them. Which suggests that the Macedonian personal name list is probably the single most valuable resource we have. The "strange sounding" words by Hesychius do not impress me at all. He, writing 10 centuries too late, is far more likely to select "exotic" words rather than plain Greek ones. Imagine the linguistic history of Macedonian and plain Greek <b>reversed</b>: &lt;scenario mode&gt; plain Greek has all but disappeared whereas Macedonian is a living language to this day. A certain <b>Thorybius</b> (the opposite of Hesychius) writes a compilation of Greek <i>glossai</i> around 500 AD and includes "chrysos" (gold) in it.

<dd>I'll sidestep your question re <i>Vox Graeca</i> with the following: There is a 3rd century BC Beotian inscription that says "ΕΥΔΟΜΟΝ" instead of "ΕΒΔΟΜΟΝ". This means that ευ was already pronounced ev and β was pronoumced v <i>at that time in that region</i>, or the mistake would not have happened. There is an inscription from Elis (I think) saying "Άσμητος" instead of "Άδμητος". This means that δ was already pronounced "th" <i>at that time in that region</i>, and just like any German pronounces "that" as "zat", the scribe wrote σ (σ before μ is pronounced z). Spelling was diverging from pronunciation and the poor guy was at a loss. Aristophanes in the "Acharnians" has the Spartan envoy swear "μα τω σιώ" (by the Two Gods, i.e. Castor and Pollux, a standard Spartan invocation to the two Spartan royal princes who were deified). The form should be "μα τω θεώ" (Dual number). This means that the Spartans already pronounced θ the "modern" way, and Aristophanes had no way of writing it down as his θ was pronounced differently (aspirated T). So he wrote σ. Etc etc etc. <b>Do not make me write the whole article right now, please</b>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Briges</span></h2>
<p>I just stubled upon a passage in Herodotus (7.73, I think) where he says that the Macedonians (in ca. 500 BC) claim that the <i><a href="../../../p/h/r/Phrygia.html" title="Phrygia">Phruges</a></i>, before they migrated to Anatolia (around 1200 BC), had called themselves <i>Briges</i>. This is quite interesting. I take this to mean that the Macedonian re-voicing could have taken place between 1200 and 500. This is no proof in any way, but I suppose that if the Macedonians had never de-voiced in the first place, they would just have called the Phryges Phryges, as a foreign ethnonym, like everybody else. Also note that the claim isn't just that "the Phryges are called Briges in Macedonia", but that the Macedonians actually claim that the Phrygians themselves changed their own name. The other possibility of course would be that the Macedonians were right, and there is really a Proto-Macedo-Phrygian, and the Phrygians de-voiced only when they were in Anatolia. This seems much less likely to me, but I have to review the Phrygian corpus first. The upshot is, if you follow me, that XMK was <b>Greek</b>(yes!), with a strange <i>re</i>-voicing of the aspirates. No proof, of course. Anyway, since we're not supposed to do original research, I'll just mention the <i>Briges</i> bit in the article for now. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 29 June 2005 07:14 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, I know about that. <i>Briges</i> was also recorded as the name of a Thracian tribe. A third possibility is that the Macedonians later incorrectly identified <i>Briges</i> (=Thracians) with Phrygians.Decius 29 June 2005 07:19 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>no, I think it is quite established that the Phrygians did, in fact, emigrate from Thrace. <b>Note</b> however that we may be claiming that, if both Macedonian and Phrygian are "Greek", the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_language.html" title="Armenian language">Armenian language</a> <i>may</i> also need to be considered Greek. I.e. if you want to argue the Macedonians are "Hellenes", linguistically, you'd need to admit that the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenians.html" title="Armenians">Armenians</a> are Hellenes too. After some very weird sound changes, of course. I do think the term "Graeco-Armenian" is better suited for the theory than "Hellenic", in any case&#160;:) <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 29 June 2005 07:33 (UTC)

<dd>It's all a matter of degree and interpretation, ultimately, as all those languages are related to a greater or lesser extent. Macedonian was clearly closer to "Greek" than Armenian, even if Armenian is <i>now</i> the closest language to Greek. The "closest" doesn't necessarily mean all that "close", however. XMK is clearly recognisable to me as a Greek language; Armenian is not.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 29 June 2005 09:45 (UTC)

<dd>sure, but <i>if</i> Armenian is descended from common Graeco-Phrygo-Armenian, historically, we'd have no choice but to classify Armenian as a really far out Modern Greek dialect. Just like we classify <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a> as <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Aryan_3705.html" title="Indo-Aryan">Indo-Aryan</a>, although it doesn't really preserve much of the grammar of Sanskrit. This is all uncertain, but "Graeco-Macedonian" is the superior terminology, because it is unambiguous. Calling Graeco-Macedonian "Hellenic" because people <i>want</i> the Macedonians to be Hellenes is just as bad as <i>not</i> calling Graeco-Armenian "Hellenic" because people <i>don't</i> want the Armenians to be Hellenes.

<p>I don't think it's been established, it may be a myth. And see also John Wilkes (Roman archaeologist), <i>The Illyrians</i> (1992), pg. 145: "<i>Other coincidences of ethnic names supported notions of a connection between the Balkans and Asia Minor, the Mysians in the latter matching the Balkan Moesians and the Phrygians corresponding to the Briges</i>". Besides the Briges in Thrace, there was also a tribe known as <i>Briges</i> near Epidamnus in Illyria. It's too hazardous to be convincing. Elaborate myths were often woven around these similar ethnonyms (see <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dardani.html" title="Dardani">Dardani</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dardan.html" title="Dardan">Dardan</a>).

<p>ok, I just noticed that the famous Phrygian <i>bekos</i> "bread" shows "Macedonian" behaviour, i.e. it would be <i>*phegos</i> in Greek.

<dd>I'm skeptical about all these migration theories. Obviously migrations <i>did</i> happen in prehistorical times, but I wonder if they can be reconstructed now with any degree of accuracy. Witness all these conflicting theories about IE migration (Gimbutas vs. Renfrew etc). While we can be certain that some of these myths <i>do</i> contain an attavistic handdown of genuine collective memory, as opposed to pure mythical baloney, it's practically impossible to say which is which. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">Chronographos</a> 29 June 2005 08:52 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I hope you guys are not serious about this. This is one of the oldest hoaxes in the book and it's been on the internet for some time now. Its main page is the geocities site and then it could also be linked by a Bulgarian or Slavo-Macedonian universities (imagine the level). Yes, I know what you're thinking, like Wiglaf said some people are pretty desperate. The fact that you people linked this site here automatically degrades the level of the the article. Yes, yes I know how you were all discussing what an "interesting hoax" it is, but having to discuss over something like that could also pose a problem. I mean, for crying out loud, even if you've missed all technical obvious reasons to it, this text is to Ancient Greek what Swahili would be to Latin. The hoax-master was such an amateur that he even used the word "Greek". I mean besides the fact that the word "ΓΡΕΚΙΣΤΙ" has absolutely no meaning in Ancient Greek as "Graecus" is spelled with an 'AI', the term "Greek" was <b>never'</b> used as a collective term for the Greek-speaking peoples prior to the rise of <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>. The collective names were "Hellenes" or "Ionians" (used by Greeks and Asians respectively). The Graeci were originally a tribe of Thessaly whose colonisers came in contact with the Romans until their name became gradually a collective term. And as I said earlier, prior to the 9th century BC, there is no reference of collective term. I never meant that Greeks have been a nation (in its modern meaning) since 900BC dab, stop trying to present me as a extremist by manipulating my words. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 29 June 2005 10:59 (UTC)</p>

<p>By "ethnos" I would refer to a collective term that describes peoples of common cultural and linguistic elements. In that sense we can talk about the Keltic ethnos, the Germanic ethnos, the Thracian ethnos, the Hellenic ethnos, and even the modern Arabic ethnos etc. The modern notion of "nation" (which also translates into Greek as 'ethnos'), refers to the unity of a large group of people under a common <b>state</b>. In that respect, Greeks and Cypriots are two different nations of the Hellenic ethnos. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 29 June 2005 11:34 (UTC)</p>

I wouldn't take anything on these sites even remotely seriously.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 29 June 2005 10:41 (UTC)</p>

<dd>this is really funny then, anarchists from Thessaloniki taking the piss out of frowning nationalists, also from Thessaloniki?

<p>Ancient Ethiopians were not savages, according to Greek mythology they were Gods' sacred race (of course propagandists didn't know that). Anyway the "ancient Greeks were immigrants from Egypt and Ethiopia while Macedonian Slavs are the oldest people in the region" hoax, is another amusing attempt from Bulgaro-Slavic nationalist to lay claims on Greek soil. I never really understood the point of that hoax. Is it just supposed to trace some "Macedonian genes" back into time and at the same time "insult" Greeks by inventing an African origin for them? Imagine that in those people's minds, a non-european (non-white) origin is something degrading. I hope Dab and Decius see with what kind of backwards inbreds do people like me have to deal with. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 29 June 2005 11:34 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Andriotes</span></h2>
<p>In the book of Andriotes it is mentioned the name of another lexigographer of Macedonian, which I personally had never heard of. The name is ΑΜΕΡΙΑΣ, in English "Amerias" maybe? I haven't found anything on the internet. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 29 June 2005 13:17 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually I just found something: <a href="http://www.hri.org/docs/macque/text4.html" class="external free" title="http://www.hri.org/docs/macque/text4.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hri.org/docs/macque/text4.html</a> I know that for some people this site can't be considered neutral, yet it's the <b>only</b> source on the internet that refers to this name. It says that Amerias was a Macedonian lexicographer on which Hesychius was based. Therefore the assumptions of the Macedonian dialect surviving until the 5th century AD becomes moot... <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 29 June 2005 13:29 (UTC)</p>
<p>That's fine if the Macedonian language became extinct earlier than the 5th century AD. The note in the website says that info is from <i>The History of Greek Writing</i>, Ant. Thavoris. Decius 29 June 2005 13:35 (UTC)</p>
<p>Are you suggesting that Amerias didn't exist because he's only seen so far in Greek sources? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 29 June 2005 13:41 (UTC)</p>
<p>No, I didn't suggest that. I actually think that info is 80% credible. I was pointing out it's from an actual book (actually two books, Andriotes and Thavoris), not just a website. Decius 29 June 2005 13:45 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Excellent job, both of you. Now strike out the linguistically irrelevant stuff, like "Olympus, a mountain in Macedonia", or that <i>Nysa</i> mountain that exists in 15 places around the globe. Next thing to be done (I think) is classify the entries into 3 categories: obviously Greek, obviously IE but not obviously Greek, and totally inexplicable. Right? Furthermore, what should be taken into account is the "broken telephone" effect. For non-Greeks, "broken telephone" is a kids' game where a number of kids take turns whispering each other a word in the ear very fast. The last kid has to guess what the first kid said. This is what must have happened with poor Hesychius transmitting almost <b>a thousand years</b> after those words were actually used. Therefore many totally inexplicable words have to fall into this unusable category. As for Hesychius himself, I think he was a very <b>QUIET</b> person, if you get my drift. &#160;;-))))))) <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">Chronographos</a> 29 June 2005 23:12 (UTC)

<p>Decius have you honestly went through <b>all</b> or even <b>most</b> linguistic studies on this glossary and discovered that the majority differentiates Macedonian from Greek? First of all it's evident that the words are NOT picked at random. Chances are that this glossary contains an amount of words which do stand out from the rest of Greek dialects. If you take into account all Classic sources in which Macedonians are said to speak Greek and feel Greek (Strattis, Kallisthenes, Livy), chances are that this glossary contains some of the most characteristic Macedonian words. None of the ancient Greek dialects contained the exact same vocabulary. Ancient Greek is by definition the mixture of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Greek_3541.html" title="Proto-Greek">Proto-Greek</a> with the Pre-Hellenic languages such as <a href="../../../p/e/l/Pelasgian.html" title="Pelasgian">Pelasgian</a> and many others. In that respect, every Greek dialect has vocabulary and linguistic particularities which are inherited from the local pre-Hellenic peoples. Besides we already know that Upper Macedonia was inhabited by Thraco-Illyrian tribes who were independent from the Macedonian Kingdom, and were therefore NOT ethnic Macedonian. So it's only reasonable that the Macedonian dialect would have linguistic particularities different to the rest of Greece. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 2 July 2005 15:24 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree: it is <b>not</b> all we have.

<dd>Miskin, you might be totally right, but let's go by what the experts say. They still disagree strongly on the classification of ancient Macedonian as of 2005---who is leading the race in terms of numbers of linguists? That will determine the article's emphasis. The separate language guys seem to be ahead, from what's been collected so far---no, I haven't seen most of the references, but if the dialect-school was ahead, we would have found out by now.

<dd>We do not know how Hesychius chose the Macedonian words he included. He also included some Thracian words in his glossary (&gt;<i>brynchos</i>, a guitar among the Thracians), so one can't assume that he only chose different/interesting words while ignoring words that were identical to Greek.

<dd>We don't even know whether it's the same glossary since we only have fragments of his work.

<p>Dammit. I didn't realise it when this article got created. Anyway I just checked out the edits and you have nothing to do with it, so I'm sorry. It's that parasite VMRO. I seriously can't believe that there's people like him and Albanau free to edit all over the place, freedom of speech is such a disease. This article has to either be removed or cleaned up, I don't see a single reason for its existence apart from VMRO having a private space to dump his crap. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 3 July 2005 05:42 (UTC)</p>

<dd>VMORO is known to keep a close watch on these Bulgaria-related articles, so you &amp; he will get into a Wiki-war over that article. He's an ethnic Bulgarian living in RepOfM I think. His agenda is very Pro-Bulgarian (obviously). He voted for <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian_Slavs_39ee.html" title="Macedonian Slavs">Macedonian Slavs</a> being called Macedonian Slavs, so he's not pro-FYROM.

<p>Well that's where the problem lies, this is <b>not</b> a Bulgaria-related article. Honestly, Bulgarians have been bitter against Greeks ever since the days of <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basil_II_6250.html" title="Basil II">Basil II</a>. They lost the Balkan and the World Wars, and they still don't get the bloody picture. Anyway, you're probably right this will be a wiki-war, it's a shame because I had been working on some interesting stuff which will inevitably be interrupted. What I don't understand is how did the other wiki-people allow this article to stay there. They're either completely ignorant or just don't give a toss. Anyway this officially becomes my priority right now. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 3 July 2005 06:13 (UTC)</p>

<p>What do you guys think of my "ancient Macedonians" section in <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonians.html" title="Macedonians">Macedonians</a>? I tried to make it as neutral as possible by providing authentic and unbiased arguments. In the beginning I only wanted to edit the previous disgraceful version of the section, but on the way it came out quite smoothly. If we manage to get rid of the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonians.html" title="Macedonians">Macedonians</a> article, we could stick that section in <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedon.html" title="Macedon">Macedon</a>. If you approve it of course. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 4 July 2005 05:02 (UTC)</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../h/e/g/Hegemony.html" title="Hegemony">hegemony</a> argument doesn't indicate that the Macedonians were not viewed as foreigners. You used this hegemony argument before, and I don't see how it makes sense. Other than that, the text is not extremely biased, but people will of course challenge its inclusion in <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonians.html" title="Macedonians">Macedonians</a>, make edits to it, etc. I think it is too slanted to one side to include it in <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedon.html" title="Macedon">Macedon</a>. I'm not criticizing the style, just the viewpoint and some of the arguments. What is acceptable in a book by Errington or Hammond is not necessarily acceptable in an open encyclopedia. Hammond clearly expresses his personal views, for instance, which are challenged by other scholars of equal standing, so in Wikipedia one shouldn't just sponsor Hammond, Errington, etc. unless they were unchallenged by other credible scholars. Decius 4 July 2005 05:14 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I didn't base it on Errington and Hammond, I wrote it from scratch. Those were actually pretty much my personal conclusions, based directly on ancient sources that I've either read or just come across with. Nevermind <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedon.html" title="Macedon">Macedon</a> then, but for the standards of <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonians.html" title="Macedonians">Macedonians</a> it's probably even too neutral. I still don't think it's one-sided because I'm commenting on every single argument, including the bashing of Demosthenes and the common refereces on "Greeks and Macedonians". You know that there are tons of quotations that imply the exact opposite. I don't think I've ever brought up in here the quotation of <a href="../../../a/e/s/Aeschines.html" title="Aeschines">Aeschines</a>. It proves that Macedon took place in the pan-hellenics before Philip II. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 4 July 2005 05:30 (UTC)</p>
<p>I might've read of it. I remember reading of Greeks from Macedonia who participated in early Olympics, but Greeks from Macedonia doesn't necessarily mean Macedonians from Macedonia---or are you talking about another quote (which I either don't know of, or forgot). I just checked, and the quote I'm talking about is from Pausanias (5.8.11), so you probably mean another one.Decius 4 July 2005 05:35 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's not about the Olympics this one. "For at a congress of the Lacedaemonian allies and the other Greeks, in which Amyntas, the father of Philip, being entitled to a seat, was represented by a delegate whose vote was absolutely under his control, he joined the other Greeks in voting to help Athens to recover possession of Amphipolis." <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 4 July 2005 06:04 (UTC)</p>
<p>We discussed that in <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedon.html" title="Macedon">Macedon</a> before some months back (in April, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Macedon&amp;action=history&amp;offset=20050406202304&amp;limit=50" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Macedon&amp;action=history&amp;offset=20050406202304&amp;limit=50" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>), and the only thing that can prove is that the Macedonian Royals were generally accepted as Greeks. I don't know of a scholar who would read more into that fact in itself. Decius 4 July 2005 06:08 (UTC)</p>
<p>And of course you realise that this interpretation is as POV as the <a href="../../../h/e/g/Hegemony.html" title="Hegemony">hegemony</a> one. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 4 July 2005 14:34 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>what's</i> pov about it? the statement "the royals were accepted as Hellenes" is <i>agnostic</i> about whether the general populace would have been considered Hellenes. Having considered Phrygian (<i>eberet</i>!) and Armenian, I am back to assuming a Paleo-Balkans group, including Graeco-Macedonian, possibly Graeco-Illyrian or even Graeco-Armenian, with Macedonian <i>not</i> a member of the Graeco- part, but just a member of the group in general. There will not be a proof either way, ever, so you may as well live with the agnostic state of affairs. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 4 July 2005 18:11 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The POV is the fact that we can't know for certain whether Amyntas had a seat because he was a Macedonian Royal (therefore of Greek descent) or just because he was simply Macedonian (therefore a Greek). In fact there's nothing to support the first theory. Imagine that the Athenian citizenship was inherited by blood (both parents had to be Athenians), and that Demosthenes was mocked for his barbarian mother; I really don't think the Greeks of the 5th c. BC would take fall so easily for the "my great-great-great-great grandmother had a cat named Hercules"-type of excuse in order to let <b>all</b> Macedonian royals to take part in the pan-hellenics. And think that this is prior to Phillip II's bullying, so they did have the guts to him home packing. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 4 July 2005 21:15 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A POV-neutral statement would be that "at least the ruling house were accepted as Hellenes". The statement "the royals were accepted as Hellenes" implies that the rest were not. As for Amyntas' seat, would a Greek ruling over a manifestly non-Greek population ever be given a seat?

<p>Whichever one is correct, that's what we should list. The <i>goda</i> spelling was taken by dab from the references, as they should be taken. <i>Gola</i> may or may not be correct. If it is, it once again suggests Greco-Macedonian, considered along with the other words. The PIE root of that Greek word is unknown as far as I know, though another apparently unrelated Greek 'kolon' word (with an omega rather than omicron) is considered to be from PIE *skel, 'crooked, to bend' (which seems to make sense for an intestine also, but the linguistic references don't trace it to *skel) .

<p>I know---the linguists know, regardless of how they classify ancient Macedonian---that many Macedonian words are quite Greek in etymology (argiopous, aortes).

<p>Actually, the main article lists a single proponent of the Graeco-Macedonian theory, compared to three scholars for the Greek dialect option. None is proffered for the Independent Palaeo-Balkan school of thought. And yet we are somehow to believe that the Greek dialect theory is "less accepted" or marginal today, when the most recent pronouncements appear to favour it (Masson, Mallory &amp; Adams).

<dd>My LSJ (print edition, 1948) lists <i>bedu</i> as water in <i>Ορφικά</i> (<a href="../../../o/r/p/Orpheus.html" title="Orpheus">which, as we all know, should make it a <i>Thracian</i> word, not a Macedonian one</a>) and it is apparently also quoted by Clemens (Κλήμης) of Alexandria.

<dd>So far, I've found an early Christian writing by Clement of Alexandria, <i>The Stromata</i>, where one Neanthus of Cyzicus is quoted as saying that Macedonian priests invoked a divine power or quality named <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water.html" title="Water">Bedu</a> <a href="http://mb-soft.com/believe/txv/clemenaf.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://mb-soft.com/believe/txv/clemenaf.htm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> (Chapter VIII).

<dd>What appears to have happened rather is that among the Macedonian priests (presumably, Orphics), as among some non-Macedonian Orphics (cf. Philydeus), <b>Bedu</b> (water) was mystically interpreted as 'life-giving air' ("which they interpret to mean the air"). Bedu may even have been introduced into Macedon along with the Orphic cult. It is definitely related to the Thracian and Phrygian forms, from PIE *wed/*wod. The only question to me: is it a mere foreign borrowing, that came along with the Orphic cult? And the answer to that is: no one can as yet say.Decius 5 July 2005 14:00 (UTC)

<p>BTW the "digamma switches to occlusive" that occurs in <i>bedu</i> is a transformation that also occurs in Aeolian, as manisfested in the new Sappho poem (<b>βροδόπαχυν</b>, original <i>Fροδο-</i>, Attic <i>ροδόπηχυν</i>, "with pink forearms"). <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">Chronographos</a> 5 July 2005 16:37 (UTC)</p>

My point is to present both datings <i>as are</i>, without introducing value judgements of our own (i.e. there is dating A and dating B, so the truth <i>must</i> be somewhere in between A and B) <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">Chronographos</a> 6 July 2005 16:32 (UTC)

<dd>If he says later inscriptions from Macedon avoid voicing of consonants contrasted to earlier ones, that obviously means earlier ones should show voicing of consonants---that would be interesting. Decius 7 July 2005 05:56 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think, he is talking about the inscriptions from Macedon written later in the <i>Koine</i> and the contrast refers both to the Doric forms used in neighboring areas (maybe Aeolic, Locrian, Aetolian, Phocidian) or the “Macedonian'” glosses (maybe those attested in Hesychius) that somewhat show voicing of consonants. The abstract (intriguing as it is) gives us little in that respect. But the dating is clear. On a side note, how did you come up with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Macedonian_language&amp;diff=15887909&amp;oldid=15886922" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Macedonian_language&amp;diff=15887909&amp;oldid=15886922" rel="nofollow">2nd century BCE</a>? <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinio_7792.html" title="User:Ninio">Ninio</a> 7 July 2005 06:48 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wouldn't say the date is "clear" yet, seeing as how 1) sources disagree on the date; 2) lead cannot be dated precisely, and most likely the Pella tablet was dated by epigraphical methods, which are always questionable more or less. If it was dated according to <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stratification_%28archeology%29.html" title="Stratification (archeology)">archaeological stratigraphy</a> or something, that would be more convincing maybe.

<dd>Was it buried or thrown down a well? If it was thrown down a well, stratigraphy would come in handy possibly (curse tablets in ancient Greece were sometimes thrown down wells according to references I've read). Decius 7 July 2005 08:41 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I never said the dating of artifacts is clear or absolute in general. The date is crystal clear in the source mentioned (James L. O'Neil). The only source so far that "dates" it in the 3rd century BCE is <a href="http://www.brynmawr.edu/classics/redmonds/csts212w4.html" class="external text" title="http://www.brynmawr.edu/classics/redmonds/csts212w4.html" rel="nofollow">brynmawr.edu</a> and that looks like a mistake judging from the evidence. The whole reference (translation text) looks like a direct quotation from Voutyras, Emmanuel: Dionusofontos gãmoi. Marital Life and Magic in Fourth Century Pella (Amsterdam 1998) pp 15-16 as shown here <a href="http://www.history.ccsu.edu/elias/MakedonesNY.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.history.ccsu.edu/elias/MakedonesNY.htm" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. The drawing used also seems to be Voutyras' drawing No. 5 (somewhere in pages 8-34), with photographs provided at the end of the book. Voutyras and every other source we have so far dates it on 4th century BCE.</dd>
<dd>The accuracy of the dating can only be judged if we know the method or methods used, the reproduction of these methods by other scholars or labs and the scrutiny of the results. I have no problem in mentioning the 3rd century BCE even though that I think that it's an honest mistake by Prof. Edmonds. I find a bit odd though, that you are trying to build an argument on a typo (one-liner comment by dab). <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinio_7792.html" title="User:Ninio">Ninio</a> 7 July 2005 08:27 (UTC)

<dd>Ninio, welcome and thanks for your input and links. The Voutyras external link shows something I found extremely interesting: Philip II says that Macedonians call "την σκάφην, σκάφην", which is a saying still used by Modern Greeks <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">Chronographos</a> 7 July 2005 08:44 (UTC)

<dd>Ninio, Decius will build an argument out of anything. He has already argued that, if undoubted data support a Northwestern Greek dialect, then Macedonians must have been bilingual and spoken it <i>along</i> with XMK (the XMK he has formulated in his mind, of course).

<dd>That I call authorities in the field "wacky theorizers". Your wacky theory is that this "previously unknown dialect" (your words) may have been spoken along with your version of XMK.

<dd>It's not based on anti-hellenism I can tell you that much. I formed my opinion from general reading over the years, and it was enforced by the fact that I find the idea of a new unknown language that was very close to Greek yet not Greek very interesting, rather than yet another Greek dialect. I guess I have visions of an archaic semi-Greek language that may have had many points in common with Thracian or Illyrian or Phrygian (a "vision" based on the XMK words, not <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wine.html" title="Wine">wine</a> or <a href="../../../g/i/n/Gin.html" title="Gin">gin</a>).

<dd>If anyone accused you of "anti-hellenism", it wasn't me. I should think that the elucidation of what XMK actually was is a very exciting issue, regardless of whether it was "yet another Greek dialect" or not. In general, I consider the whole IE affair, linguistic and otherwise, a fascinating story. Witness all the Renfrew/Gimbutas etc theories. I am a firm believer in <a href="../../../w/i/t/Wittgenstein.html" title="Wittgenstein">Wittgenstein</a>'s aphorism: "The limits of my world are the limits of my language". Therefore, and since the vast bulk of human knowledge has been accrued by IE-language speakers, anything that will shed light on this age-old affair is something that fascinates me <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">Chronographos</a> 7 July 2005 10:54 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not building any argument on Dab's typo. Forget about the "2nd century BC". What I'm underlining is that the sources may not agree on the date (4th or 3rd or even another BC date maybe). And also, we don't know how they dated it. Decius 7 July 2005 08:33 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't know where the 2nd c. date came from, I thought Decius had introduced it. So maybe it was my typo, I was trying to refer to the brynmawr date, 3rd century, sorry. As for two populations sharing the same territory, hey, I'm Swiss, that idea comes naturally to me, in some parts in Switzerland, every valley has a different language, almost. So yes, my idea of 6th c. BC Macedonia is that Doric speaking and XMK speaking populations were present, and probably Phrygian and similar, as well. What we get through Hesychius is a <i>very</i> grainy image of a complex linguistic situation. Personally, I am happy with the 4th century date, I merely noted that it was dated 3rd on brynmawr, I do not know with what merits. I maintain that this difference is insignificant for our purposes here. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 7 July 2005 09:25 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Phrygian</span></h2>
<p>picking up a thread from above, why are you so adamant that "Phrygian is not Greek", Chronographos? I mean, I was suggesting that Graeco-Phrygian could be referred to as a "Hellenic" subgroup of IE, just like Graeco-Macedonian has been. If you can change nomenclature for Graeco-Macedonian, why not for Graeco-Phrygian (which are, in all likelyhood, the same group anyway, Graeco-Phrygo-Macedonian). I don't really care if the group is called "Hellenic", it's just that we cannot make up terminology here, we have to go along with established terminology as it stands. If you really press me to define Greek, I'd say, de-voicing of aspirates, loss of prevocalic <i>s</i>, and a few features of vocabulary and morphology, like the <i>gunaik-</i> stem. This definition already excludes "Phrygo-Maceonian", but there can be a larger group, probably best called <i>Balkanic</i>, but for all I care also <i>Hellenic</i>, or maybe better, <i>Sedlenic</i>. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 7 July 2005 12:29 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks Chrono, I'll accept <i>hyperberetaios</i> as another mark towards the Greco-Macedonian school. Intervocalic 's' then was probably lost in Macedonian (unless some scholar has a good counter-argument). Decius 7 July 2005 15:05 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In defense of Dab (not that he needs defense here), I've seen some Phrygian sentences, and the closeness to Greek is unquestionable, more than just between Greek and other IE languages. But I do not advise anyone to call Phrygian "Greek", though they can if they want to I guess. It's pretty likely that Greek and Phrygian come from a common proto-language that branched off from PIE. Macedonian would also be part of that, whether it was a language or dialect. Decius 7 July 2005 12:48 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>it all boils down on where you put <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Greek_3541.html" title="Proto-Greek">Proto-Greek</a>, which will always remain unattesed anyway. Common practice is to include de-voicing, and that would make XMK descended from <i>pre-Proto-Greek</i> <b>by definition</b>, unless you assume XMK re-voicing, an assumption I haven't seen published anywhere yet. We can agree that Greek, Phrygian and Macedonian are <i>very</i> close, within IE, and Armenian is probably descended from the group, too. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 7 July 2005 12:59 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, Demiraj could be wrong---or he might be right. *<i>Pel-</i>, 'to push, drive', might be the root for both. Pokorny didn't do all the work in the field. The problem is, Albanian has strange sound-changes (gh&gt;d), so even <i>acherdos</i> (*gher--&gt; a-cher-) might be cognate to Albanian <i>dardhë</i> (*gher--&gt;dardh), as Pokorny and Demiraj say.

<dd>Wouldn't know about pears. Pokorny's entry is full of Doric though. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">Chronographos</a> 23:50, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>One way to double-check Demiraj's theory is to see whether any other references derive <i>pôlos</i> from *<i>pel-</i>, 'to drive'. I don't see what the big deal is: if the derivation was phonologically impossible, Demiraj would have noticed. It is not semantically improbable (the change in meaning is not a big deal, it's noted in many cases). He's not saying <i>pelë</i> is from <i>pôlos</i>. Decius 00:14, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not interested in horses that much.

Yeah, I've seen that connection proposed (<a href="../../../p/e/l/Pella.html" title="Pella">Pella</a> to <a href="../../../a/p/e/Apella.html" title="Apella">Apella</a>, etc). It seems likely. More likely than Albanau's idea anyway. However, Macedonian <i>peltastai</i> is from PIE <i>*pel-</i>, 'skin, hide'---hide-covered <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shields.html" title="Shields">shields</a>. Decius 00:49, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It has been proposed (German <i>pelz</i>: fur), but I wonder how definitive it is. <i>Peltastai</i> also carried javelins and Pokorny does say "*pultus (vorausgesetzt from pultāre `bump, poke')". Anyways that's a minor point. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">Chronographos</a> 09:22, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Actually Chronographos, you are wrong: the root is <i>*pel-</i>, 'skin, hide'. <i>Peltastai</i>, masc. nom. plural; <i>Peltastes</i>, singular, 'one who carries a light shield', from <i>peltê</i> (Dor. <i>pelta</i>), 'a small light shield of <i>leather</i> without a rim'. You do not, as a rule, <i>strike</i> with your shield. However, light shields were usually covered with hide (<i>*pel-</i>). In ancient Greek, we even find the word <i>erusipelas</i>, 'inflammed skin' (<i>erusi</i>=red; <b>-pelas</b>=skin). So, <i>-pelas</i> meaning 'skin' existed in Greek (see also Latin <i>pellis</i>, 'skin'). The root of <i>peltastai</i> is PIE *pel, 'skin, hide'. Decius 17:57, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, but if linguists agree that <i>peltastai</i> is from PIE <i>*pel-</i>, 'hide', they have a good reason for it. And a little search would have shown why they prefer <i>*pel-</i>, 'skin, hide', rather than other options. You apparently like bashing linguists such as Pokorny and Demiraj before you even fully research their points, which is not the way to do it. Decius 19:32, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

<p>hey Chronographos, you seem to misunderstand something here. The point is that the Greeks lost <i>PIE</i> prevocalic <i>s</i>. They reintroduced <i>s</i> from other sources, so of course there are Greek words beginning in <i>s-</i>. The only couterexamples I am aware of are <i>selene</i> and Homeric <i>sus</i>, and they have to be explained as loans somehow. PIE <i>s</i> was dead and gone by 1300 BC, so it is rather unlikely that Homer would have had remnants. Selene I suppose can be explained as a "Balkanese" loan or something; I'm not sure about <i>sus</i>, that may indeed be a spurious leftover. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 08:54, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I fully understand the issue, and your interpretation of it. My point was <i>not</i> the genesis of Greek from PIE; rather the Doric/Macedonian cognates. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">Chronographos</a> 09:22, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I trust you understand the issue. you just have a tendency for erecting strawmen&#160;:) So are you sayng that by indirect evidence we can assume that XMK preserved prevocalic <i>s</i>? And the Spartans had taken a few XMK words with them? Is there any evidence that Selene was a Dorian goddess in particular? You do realize that this assumption implies that XMK was a non-Greek language that was in loan-contact with the early Dorians? <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 11:00, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That is not necessarily the case. Although <i>Sellasia, Selloi, Selene</i> and the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homer.html" title="Homer">Homeric</a> <i>Sys</i> remain puzzles, I was more concerned with <i><a href="../../../p/e/l/Pella.html" title="Pella">Pella</a>-<a href="../../../a/p/e/Apella.html" title="Apella">Apella</a></i> and the month <i>Apellaios</i>, as well as <i>Hyperberetaios</i>.

<dd>I don't think anyone has made the claim that XMK systematically preserved prevocalic <i>s</i>. Chronographos cited <i>Hyberberetaios</i> as an example which would indicate the contrary. The survival of a few <i>s-</i> words in "Greek" means that even if a few Macedonian glosses with prevocalic <i>s</i> were found, such a finding would not be conclusive.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheathenae_64b7.html" title="User:Theathenae">Theathenae</a> 12:30, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My AHD says <i>benthos</i> is from PIE <i>*gwadh-</i>, 'to sink', in which case it wouldn't be an example of that type of sound-change (it would be a common PIE *gw --&gt; Greek 'b' change). A Greek 'b' often derives from PIE *gw-. Decius 18:35, 15 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>True, see <i>βούς</i> (ox). Pokorny says that <i>bathos</i> derives from <i>*gwadh-</i>, which makes perfect sense, and that <b>"βένθος `depth' secondary after πένθος&#160;: πάθος;"</b>, as obviously a <i>*gwadh-</i> derivation does not account for the <b>-n-</b>. I wonder how valid this "roundabout" etymology is. The <i>*bhudh-m(e)n</i> one looks much more straightforward, as the <b>"metathesis *bhundho- "</b> is accounted for .

<dd>Hmmm... I agree that βένθος=fundus is pretty convincing.

<dd>PIE <i>*bh-</i> changing to 'p' seems to be ocassionally attested in Greek, but PIE <i>*bh-</i> to 'b' is considered to be pretty much impossible for Greek. That's why linguists do not derive <i>benthos</i> from <i>*bhudh-</i>. Circular reasoning? May be, but these linguists have devoted many years to studying these sound-changes, while we haven't.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">PERSIANS NAMING OF THE GREEKS &amp; THE VARIOUS GREEKS TRIBES</span></h2>
<p>There are several types of Yauna in the Achaemenid Royal Inscriptions:</p>
<p>(1) Yaunβ in general: the same as the Greeks known as "Ionians", i.e., those living in Asia Minor. They can already be found in the Behistun Inscription, when the Persian rule had not yet reached Europe. This identification is 100% certain.</p>
<p>(2) Yaunβ takabarβ, the 'Greeks with shield-shaped hats'. First mentioned in DNa ( <a href="http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/DNa.html" class="external free" title="http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/DNa.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/DNa.html</a> ), where they are distinguished from the "normal" Yaunβ: an almost certain reference to the Macedonian sunhats.</p>
<p>(3 and 4) "The Yaunβ, near and across the sea": another division, for the first time found in DSe ( <a href="http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/DSe.html" class="external free" title="http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/DSe.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/DSe.html</a> ) and in a slightly different form in the Daiva Inscription by Xerxes (XPh: <a href="http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/XPh.html" class="external free" title="http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/XPh.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/XPh.html</a> ). The obvious reading is "the Asian Yauna and the European Yauna", i.e., -again- Asian Greeks and Macedonians.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Persian inscriptions are fairly stereotypical, and the fact that there is a small difference between the precise wording of DSe and XPh suggests that there is a difference. Perhaps, there is a difference between the "Yauna across the sea" and the sunhat-Yaunβ. If this is correct, the Yauna across the sea must be either Cypriot Greeks (but why didn't Darius, who seems to have subdued Cyprus, mention them?) or the Thessalians, Boeotians, and Athenians - nations that Xerxes could claim to have conquered.</p>
<p>(5) There is a seal from the age of Xerxes ( <a href="http://www.livius.org/a/1/greece/yauna_seal.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.livius.org/a/1/greece/yauna_seal.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.livius.org/a/1/greece/yauna_seal.jpg</a> ) in which the great king defeats someone looking like a Yauna. It is unique, because a second man appears to have a hand in the killing, and this man looks like a Yauna. Is this the Macedonian king Alexander who helps killing a Thessalian/Boeotian/Athenian??</p>
<p>Such instances are extremely rare since only a handful of original Persian texts have survived.There are of references by Darius I in the Behistun Inscription to Sardis (OP Sparda), Ionia (OP Yauna) and Cappadocia (OP Katpatuka). There are also a couple of statements concerning the Greeks and their tribes in the Babylonian tablets.</p>

{<br />
Due to the fragmentary attestation widely diverging interpretations are possible. The suggested historical interpretations of Macedonian include (Mallory and Adams (1997), p. 361):<br />
a Greek dialect mixed with Illyrian languages.<br />
a Greek dialect mixed with Illyrian and the Thracian language.<br />
a Greek dialect with a non-Indo-European substratal influence<br />
an Illyrian dialect mixed with Greek<br />
an independent Indo-European language close to Greek, Thracian and Phrygian languages.<br />
The discussion is closely related to the reconstruction of the Proto-Greek language.<br />
}<br /></p>
<p>How did u conclude in this?<br />
Let me guess. U assumed that the foreign origin words in the GREEK lexicon of Hesychius means that the Macedonian language was a non-Greek language.<br />
Damn... I like ur conclusions.&#160;:-P<br />
GREEK Lexicon... foreign language... lol yeah right. Maybe the word "bibliotheka" is Greek word, too.&#160;:-P<br />

<p><b>(2)</b> The article mentions the following:</p>
<p>{ Due to the fragmentary attestation widely diverging interpretations are possible. The suggested historical interpretations of Macedonian include (Mallory and Adams (1997), p. 361):</p>
<p>a Greek dialect mixed with Illyrian languages.<br />
a Greek dialect mixed with Illyrian and the Thracian language.<br />
a Greek dialect with a non-Indo-European substratal influence<br />
an Illyrian dialect mixed with Greek<br />
an independent Indo-European language close to Greek, Thracian and Phrygian languages.<br />
The discussion is closely related to the reconstruction of the Proto-Greek language.<br />
}</p>
<p>How did u came in that conclusion? I guess that because the origin of a few words were non-Greek, u assumed that the words were non-Greek, too. So the language was non Greek.</p>
<p>In that way, "bibliotheka" is a Greek word, because its origin is Greek and the English language is Greek language too, because "bibliotheka" as u know is an English word. But if u open a Greek lexicon u won't find that word. On the other hand, u will find it in an English lexicon. So obviously u can't claim that the ancient Macedonian language was non-Greek. The lexicon was Greek. So the Macedonian is a Greek dialect.</p>
<p>Also u can't claim that the language was mixed with foreign languages. The number of the survived Macedonian words from the Greek lexicon of Hesychius is too small (around 700 words) and the most of them have Greek origin. So we can not made such conclusions about the language.</p>
<p><b>(3)</b> The <a href="../../../h/e/s/Hesychius_of_Alexandria_3d8a.html" title="Hesychius of Alexandria">Hesychius of Alexandria</a> article states that "Hesychius of Alexandria, a grammarian of Alexandria, (probably flourished 5th century CE) compiled the richest lexicon of unusual and obscure <b>Greek</b> words that has survived".</p>
<p>So according to u although that the words were Greek, the Macedonian language was non-Greek. But how is that possible? Is there any other x language that is constructed by non-x words?</p>
<p><b>(Conclusion)</b> It was a Greek lexicon, which means that the ancient Macedonian language was a Greek dialect. So we should change the article. If you can't prove me wrong within 48 hours (till 14:08, 1 August 2005) then I will change the article.</p>

<dd>The conclusion is <b>wrong</b>: Hesychius collected <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thracian.html" title="Thracian">Thracian</a> words in his glossary also.

<p>U have to prove that the lexicon had Tracian words. When I say Thracian, I mean Thracian. Not Greek words with Thracian origin. They were Greek words with Thracian origin in Hesychius lexicon. No doubt about that.<br />

<p>Also keep in mind that the lexicon was written in Greek and was in alphabetical order.<br />

<dd>You're wrong again. Those words are accepted as Thracian by most scholars.

<p>1. U didn't explain me why the above web sites are saying that the Hesychius lexicon was Greek.<br />
2. U didn't explain me why do u think that the Macedonian language might was:<br />
a Greek dialect mixed with Illyrian languages.<br />
a Greek dialect mixed with Illyrian and the Thracian language.<br />
a Greek dialect with a non-Indo-European substratal influence<br />
an Illyrian dialect mixed with Greek<br />
an independent Indo-European language close to Greek, Thracian and Phrygian languages.<br />
3. U didn't explain me why in the Hesychius of Alexandria article says that the Hesychius lexicon is the "richest lexicon of unusual and obscure Greek words that has survived". Why doesn't say Macedonian words? Thracian words? or multi-language lexicon or something?<br />

<dd>Manos, I don't know if you are fourteen years old, but that section you're quoting, describing the various theories, was quoted or paraphrased by Dbachmann <i>from a linguistic reference</i>, as indicated (<i>Mallory and Adams</i>, 1997, pg. 361).

<p><br />
Decius, I think u can't understand smth. In order to prove ur thesis u MUST explain these first:<br /></p>
<p>1. Why the 10 web sites I mentioned are saying that Hesychius lexicon was Greek<br />
2. As u said... linguistic. The only way to come to this conclutions is if u take the Greek lexicon of Hesychius and search for non-Greek origin words. Then u prove that it came from non-Greek origin and u are claiming that ancient Macedonian wasn't Greek dialect. The problem is as I told u, that u can't prove from the word origin, that the whole language, even the word itself, that it is non-Greek. Imposimble. Then as I told u, anyone can prove that English is a Greek language.<br />
3. U have to explain why the Hesychius of Alexandria article says that the lexicon is the "richest lexicon of unusual and obscure Greek words that has survived".<br />
4. Why the lexicon was in alphabetical order?<br />
5. Why Hesiod and Hellanicus said that Macedonians are from Aeolian branch? Keep in mind that Hesiod said that around the year of the creaton of the Macedonian nation.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>I'll suggest u not to try to insult me in order to prove ur thesis. If u explain me the above, then u can start explaining me why Macedonian language might be non-Greek.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>U have a lot of work to do.&#160;;)<br />

Decius, u can not get it, do u?<br />
<br /></p>
<p>1. U can not prove that a word is not Greek, because it's origin it's not-Greek as u did in the discussion page. 2. ALL the evidence are proving that Macedons were Greeks. Not a single one evident is supporting the opposite. So don't waste my time with non-sense.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>I like this one from the Macedon's article: "because I have current linguistic references that support a separate extinct Macedonian language. "<br />
lol Yeah right. And I'm Santa.&#160;:-P As I told u Ancient Macedonian language and Macedons were Greek. If u disagree prove the opposite. Don't tell me that we don't know for sure. We do.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Hesiod said they were Greek.<br />
Hellanicus said they were Greek.<br />

Macedons said they were Greeks<br />
The rest Greeks said they were Greek<br />
They were participating in Olympic Games<br />

Yeah, I don't disagree. Do u know that in Albania they are saying that the Greek ancient cities there are Albanian? Do u know that a scholar said that Homer was Turk? Do u know that many scholars are saying that Alexander was Illyrian? Do u know that a whole SLAVIC nation believes that are descendants of Macedons?

"quote doesn't say I have references that prove it was separate." U meant that u have references that supporting the possibilitie of a non Greek dialect. But did u read the word that u use? "linguistic" I already told u, that u can not prove with a linguistic way that the language is non Greek. On the other hand we know that the ancient Greeks are saying that the language was Aeolian. Also from the Greek lexicon of Hesychius we found out that it's true that the Macedonian language was Aeolian. All the Greek words were showing that their language was Aeolian.&#160;;) So u have zero proofs. Nothing. U can not even claim the opposite. Because if u do, then u are either a propagandist or a person with lack of history in the specific subject.<br />

I wont say it again. U CAN NOT PROVE LINGUISTICLY THAT THE MACEDONIAN LANGUAGE WASN'T GREEK. It's imposimble. Use ur logic.<br />

If u really believed that I'm just a kid, u would already post at least one evidence supporting the opposite. But u didn't. No one did. Even Decius.

Yeah, right. Come on Wiglaf. Convince him to post a historical evidence supporting the opposite of my thesis.<br />

I guess u can't.<br />
Why don't u post the scholar opinion that Macedons were Chinese? Let me tell u. Because it can not "explain" any historical evidence.<br />
Why do u post the scholar opinion that Macedons were non Greek? Because it can "explain" a minor number of historical evidence. Can explain the above post of mine? NO. So it's a wrong theory, too.<br />
Why I support the scholar opinion that Macedons were Greeks? Guess what. Because it can explain ALL ANCIENT EVIDENCE.<br />
<br />
Could u plz tell me then, why do u still insist claiming that the Macedons language might not be Greek?<br />
Can u explain why Macedons said that they were speaking Greek? Why Hesiod said that? Why Hellanicus said that? Why they all insist that they were Greeks?<br />
If u can not explain it, u prove that ur theory is wrong.<br />
<br />
U can not claiming that this web site is an encyclopedia when u don't post the truth. When u post whatever u want.<br />
So stop be stubborn and post the truth.<br />
Is there any Admin out there that can explain me why the heck u have an article that can not "explain" all the historical evidence and u don't post ONLY the scholars opinion that can explain ALL the historical evidence?<br />

Wiglaf, don't say bull**** (I comment ur post, not urself. The same thing that dab did to me and u said is not a personal attack). If u believe that their theory is true then support it. Explain the facts.<br />
Just explain what&#160;;lead them in their conclusion, that Macedons might not be Greek. I don't ask too much.<br />
I think I have the right to know where did u based that that the specific scholars opinion that is written in the article are correct and the rest are wrong.<br />
Why nowhere mentioned that Macedons speak Slavic? That is a scholar opinion, too.<br />
They didn't even post 1... 1 single proof that could prove that my thesis is wrong. I did. I didn't post just 1. I post many. What else do u want?<br />

<p>---from PSI XII 1284: a papyrus fragment discovered at Oxyrhynchus early in the 20th century.

<dd>You don't seriously consider the passage(s) you quoted as <b>news</b>, do you?!? They have been debated <i>ad nauseam</i> by linguists and historians, and they actually prove nothing. As you may (or, most probably, may not) know, Alexander's army was a hodgepodge of Greeks, but some corps were exclusively Macedonian: the sarissa-carrying phalanx was one, the Hetairoi was another. There would be many reasons why the officer dispatched to deliver a crucial command in the heat and din of battle would be one of <i>them</i>. Such occurences were not rare. A notorious Athenian strategem involved some complicated nightly manoeuvres against the Spartans at close quarters: except the Athenians had somehow secured some Dorian allies whom they had shout erroneous commands <i>in Doric</i>. The Spartans were confused by the familiar voices in the darkness and fell right into the Athenians' hands. Herodotus details how the 12 Ionic cities of Asia Minor spoke <i>4 different Ionic dialects</i> between themselves. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">Chronographos</a> 22:40, 21 August 2005 (UTC) (BTW nobody said Macedonian was Doric.

<dd>That's a bad argument Decius. Besides the fact that Plutarch doesn't say "switched from Greek to Macedonia" but he says "spoke in Macedonic(?)" (ανεβόα μακεδονιστί), it's pretty naive to deny the importance of perfect intelligibility in certain situation. And what do you mean when you say that Attic was close to Doric? The difference between two dialects of the same language and two <a href="../../../i/d/i/Idiom.html" title="Idiom">idioms</a> of the same <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialect</a>, is that the intelligibility of the dialects comes with a significant factor of difficulty. I traslated μακεδονιστί into "Macedonic" instead of "Macedonian", because its termination -ιστί is oftenly used to describe many Greek dialects (δωριστί, αττικιστί ιωνιστί), so it might actually imply the contrary of what you're trying to prove. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 00:37, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Decius that's really old news, and not particularly different from Plutarch's (who by the way never mentions "he switched from Greek to Macedonian"). It could mean a different language but it could also mean a different dialect, so this reference alone doesn't serve as anything. What you have to have in mind is that Greeks would snobbishly almost never refer to a non-Greek speech by anything other than "barbaric", let alone by its individual name as you're suggesting. Even high-classed barbarians like the Romans against low-classed Greeks like <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyrrhus_of_Epirus_1fef.html" title="Pyrrhus of Epirus">Pyrrhus of Epirus</a> didn't qualify as an exception to this stereotype (as Plutarch's homonymous work informs us). <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 23:44, 21 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Decius, being unfamiliar with the Greek language, should be forgiven for his comments. One has to read the original texts, inscriptions and literary works alike, in order to understand the sheer cruelty of mockery involved, not to mention the divergence of the various pronuncations.

<dd>I was watching Antenna news last night and couldn't for the life of me make heads or tails of what some of the Cypriot relatives of the plane crash victims were saying.

<dd>What often makes such local dialects difficult to understand is not so much the difference in pronunciation <i>per se</i>, but the non-standard "music" of the spoken phrase. A typical example is the speech of the <a href="../../../i/o/n/Ionian_Islands_d3d4.html" title="Ionian Islands">Ionian Islands</a>, where pronunciation is rather straightforward, but the different intonation of phrases and the inclusion of Venetian-derived words can render such speech tough to catch for an untrained "mainland" ear. It is unfortunate that such regional differences are being wiped out by <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a>-induced uniformity. Indeed, when speaking a non-native language such as English or French, phrasing intonation is far more important for comprehension than proper phonemic pronunciation.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">WHAT HISTORY SAYS</span></h3>
<p>It is a fact that before the time of Alexander "philhellene", the Macedonians were not viewed as Greek, no ancient authors have wrote as such until Herodotus, who in any case made reference only to the royal lineage of Macedonia and not the general population. It is important to note that all other ancient Greek historians followed Herodotus' lead in regards to the argive descent of the Macedonain kngs, no other sources of the time corroborate these version of events. The closest following was Thucydides, who almost 25 years younger, would almost certainly have had access to Herodotus' Histories. Thereafter, ancient authors begin to consider Macedonia within the sphere of Greece, however the native population of the lands and even their kings were, even until Roman times, considered semi-barbaric. There is the suggestion that the ancient Macedonian language was a mere dialect of Greek, however considering the lack of authentic words(and access to them) and contrary historical evidence, this theory is not very plausable. Historians make several remarks that indicate distinction between ancient Macedonian and the Greek language. For example, Thucydides, book 4, 109; "Brasidas, after the capture of Amphipolis, marched with his allies against the place called Acte. This is the jutting out headland, with the Kig of Persia's canal on the landward side, and with the high mountain of Athos at the end facing the Aegean sea. The cities in Acte are Sane, a colony of Andros, which is just by the canal on the sea facing towards Euboea, and also Thyssus, Cleone, Acrothoi, Olophyxus, and Dium - <b>all these latter towns being inhabited by mixed foreign races, speaking both Greek and their own dialects</b>. There is a small Chalcidian element, but the majority are Pelasgian, of the Tyrrhenian race that once lived in Lemnos and Athens, together with Bisaltians, Crestonians and Edonians." <i>Penguin Classics</i></p>
<p>"Brasidas after the capture of Amphipolis marched with his allies against Acte, a promontory running out from the king's dike with an inward curve, and ending in Athos, a lofty mountain looking towards the Aegean sea. In it are various towns, Sane, an Andrian colony, close to the canal, and facing the sea in the direction of Euboea; the others being Thyssus, Cleone, Acrothoi, Olophyxus, and Dium, <b>inhabited by mixed barbarian races speaking the two languages</b>. There is also a small Chalcidian element; but the greater number are Tyrrheno-Pelasgians once settled in Lemnos and Athens, and Bisaltians, Crestonians, and Edonians." <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200&amp;layout=&amp;loc=4.109.1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200&amp;layout=&amp;loc=4.109.1" rel="nofollow">[37]</a></p>
<p>The texts above are in regards to near coastal areas and Hellenic colonies in Macedonia. Notice how it states that there are two languages spoken in the region, the barbaric language with its own dialects and the Greek. This is only in reference to the regions inhabited by both natives and Greek, the second language of Greek being imported along with the founding of new colonies. Further north the inhabitants would have been more ignorant of the Greek language. A clear distinction is thus made with this fragment, where a native language with its own dialects is assumed to exist alongside Greek. Evidence like this should not be ignored. Of the native inhabitants of Macedonia, Strabo writes; "<b>Thracians, Illyrians, and Epirotæ</b> are settled even at present on the sides of Greece. Formerly the territory they possessed was more extensive, although <b>even now the barbarians possess a large part of the country</b>, which, without dispute, is Greece. <b>Macedonia is occupied by Thracians</b>, as well as some parts of Thessaly; the country above Acarnania and Ætolia, by Thesproti, Cassopæi, Amphilochi, Molotti, and Athamanes, Epirotic tribes." <i>VII, 7, 1.</i> Making it absolutely clear that even during Stabo's lifetime, the Thracian living space extended further south than Macedonia. Of these barbaric tribes so often mentioned by the Greeks many would indeed have been linguistically related, as is demonstrated with the above text in regards to the natives of Macedonia and the Thracians. This text is also very revealing for it places the Epirote in the Thraco-Illyric category identified as barbarians. Thus the next quote supplements the "related barbarians" theory by demonstrating a linguistic and cultural connection between the Macedonians and the Epirote, Strabo; "They gave the name of Upper Macedonia to the country about Lyncestis, Pelagonia, Orestias, and Elimia. Later writers called it Macedonia the Free, and some extend the name of Macedonia to all <b>the country as far as Corcyra</b>, at the same time assigning as their reasons, <b>the mode of cutting their hair, <i>their language</i>, the use of the chlamys, and similar things in which they resemble the Macedonians;</b> some of them, however, <b>speak two languages</b>. On the dissolution of the Macedonian empire, they fell under the power of the Romans." <i>VII, 7, 8.</i></p>
<p>Macedonia is of course, a part of Greece according to Strabo, however what Macedonia is he refering to? And in that same 'matter of fact' manner, he just as easily states that the Macedonians themselves are barbaric Thracians who are also linguistically relate to the barbaric Epirote. Curtius Rufus is even more exlicit in his detailed trial of Philotas, once again making it clear that the native language of Macedonia was not mutually comprehensible with Greek; "Philotas had ridiculed his countrymen, calling them Phrygians and Paphlagonians, this from a man <b>who Macedonian born, is not ashamed to use an interpreter to listen to men who spoke his own language</b>." Philotas speaks; "One charge made against me is that I disdain to communicate in <b>my native language</b>, that I have no respect for Macedonian customs. That native language of ours has long been <b>rendered obselete</b> through our dealings with other nations, and conquerers and conquered alike must learn a foreign tongue." This Curtius text is only as confusing as certain neo-Hellenes try to make it, reading objectively it demonstrates a definite existence of a native language other than Greek in Macedonia. The neo-Hellenic claim of Philotas learning Persian and forgetting his native Greek(as opposed to Macedonian) is an absurd claim, for how can the base-language of the future 'Koine' be "rendered obselete"?</p>
<p>Even Isocrates, in regards to the apparent argive descent of Phillip II, states; "For they endeavored to win this honor by engendering factions, disorder, and bloodshed in their own cities; he, on the other hand, <b>held entirely aloof from Hellenic territory, and set his heart upon occupying the throne of Macedon.</b> For he knew full well that the Hellenes were not accustomed to submit to the rule of one man, while the other races were incapable of ordering their lives without the control of some such power." <i>107.</i></p>
<p>Macedonia, entirely aloof from Hellenic territory and their inhabitants who are of a non-kindred race to the Greeks. If Wikipedia is to live up to its claim of neutrality, then evidence of the type above must be considered in the equation. All statements I have made contain a source, they should be given due respect for they are precise and credible. The natives of Macedonia were a people related to the Thraco-Illyrians, cultural similarities with their Greek neighbours is a formality given the geographic location of the region. Hesiod states that Deukalion had two daughters who bore two children each with Zeus. Pandora bore Graecus and Latin, Thyia bore Magnes and Makedon. Mythology is not ethnology, for if it was the Italians are blood-brothers to the Greeks. It must be asked, if Graecus is not upset that his brother Latin speaks a language different to him, why does it bother him if his cousin Makedon speaks different also?</p>
<p>"Aetolians, Acarnanians, Macedonians, men of the same speech" Livy, 31, 29. I showed above of the usage of more than one language in the Balkans, the native and the more popular(due to trade and admin) Greek, as today we have people here from various native &amp; linguistic backgrounds however we are united by our dialogue in the English language so thus it is fair to say, in comparison to the quote from Livy, "we have Macedonians, Greeks, Romanians, Germans, men of the same speech". If the internet had existed back then, we would all be writing in Greek instead of English due to it's wide spread use, however surely that would not make us all Greek, as it does not make us all English now.</p>

<p>Matia, I am well aware of the texts of Herodotus, Strabo and Isocrates, I do not recall any one of them stating the Macedonians are a Greek tribe. We both have our views on the matter, however the ancient quotes I cited above make it quite clear that the native population of Macedonia was akin to the Thraco-Illyric tribes, in language and culture. Strabo's work is called "geography", not "ethnography", what he considered Greece was, as he stated "anciently, a settlement of barbarians" who still "posses a large part of the country", <i>VII, 7, 1</i>. Strabo's Greece does not have a mono-ethnic element, besides that, there is much evidence that cannot and should not be ignored. As an on-line Encyclopedia, Wikipedia is viewed by many therefore people should have knowledge of all the facts, not just the one's that suit the individuals agenda. The particular issue at hand here is the ancient Macedonian language, and it is clear judging by the words of the ancients above that the native Macedonian language was not Greek. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoldier_of_Macedon_cf7d.html" title="User:Soldier of Macedon">Soldier of Macedon</a> 10:02, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>His militant username and tone, along with his use of bold text throughout, should have alerted you to his true intentions. A brand new user going by the username of User:Te1mak (a sockpuppet?) has just posted links to an internet forum where a <i>Soldier of Macedon</i> makes wild claims about a supposed connection between ancient Macedonian and the unrelated modern Slavic language spoken in what is now the <a href="../../../f/y/r/FYROM_4615.html" title="FYROM">FYROM</a>. The vexed question of whether or not ancient Macedonian was a Greek language is an entirely separate issue, and is discussed at length in <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Macedonian_language_41c2.html" title="Ancient Macedonian language">Ancient Macedonian language</a>. What <i>is</i> certain, however, is that a link between it and the <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavic_languages.html" title="Slavic languages">Slavic languages</a>, other than their common membership of the huge and diverse <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-European_fc7a.html" title="Indo-European">Indo-European</a> family of languages, has most definitely <i>not</i> been acknowledged by any serious scholar.

<p>Firstly I would like to thank Wiglaf for welcoming me here, and thank the rest who have made it clear where we stand. If I have broken any rules it has not been intentional. My name is symbolic and sentimental, I have not came here to cause trouble, it is not meant to have a military connotation, I am a new-age Soldier of Macedon thus I battle with my knowledge and my witts, in a respectful manner I have came here to stress my points of view. Prior statements in forums are not relevant here and it is a lame attempt at defaming an individual, nor is this a forum but a place of knowledge thus I provide a source for all my comments, I should be judged on the texts I bring here to Wikipedia and not for other matters in which have been taken out of context. So far I have heard a whole storyline of accusations and unkind words from the Greeks here, but not one of them have been specific in what actually is wrong or misinterpreted in the texts and sources I provided? Or is it that my opinion seems to bother them more, and the fact that what I write seems to make the most sense. I have not made any wild accusations about anything on Wikipedia, I am treading carefully and trying to go by the rules and providing credible sources, but my opinion under no circumstances will be silenced if I believe it to be true. Everybody has their thoughts and theories, I will only bring forth those of which I believe are solid and can be verified, my opinion is in accordance with the texts, other beliefs are my own and the simple fact is that a clear modern relation to the ancient Macedonian language has not, as yet, been determined. I didn't know somebody would find bolded text offensive, I was simply trying to add emphasis on that particular section of the paragraph. Wiglaf it would be much appreciated if I was to be allowed to continue using my name, let me be judged by my actions and deeds, and not for my name which represents much in terms of my determination and passion for Macedonia and its history, for I too have national feelings. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoldier_of_Macedon_cf7d.html" title="User:Soldier of Macedon">Soldier of Macedon</a> 13:48, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you Wiglaf, I respect your fairness. Matia, I have not taken a phrase out of the context of the paragpraph, I will ask again for you to be more specific before hurling accusations as such. With all the words written by Greeks here since my opening post, not one of them addressed what exactly is wrong with my texts and sources, and how is my opinion innacurate. I say enough of the bickering and lets get down to some scholarly discussion, a civil debate, if you want to prove me wrong then dispute my evidence with some of your own. I could care less if I am disliked by the majority so far, this is a discussion page on the ancient Macedonian language and our aim here is to discuss and attempt to determine certain facts in regards to it. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoldier_of_Macedon_cf7d.html" title="User:Soldier of Macedon">Soldier of Macedon</a> 14:36, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Throughout this debate, I've stuck to my <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desert_Eagle_1553.html" title="Desert Eagle">guns</a> and maintained that the ancient Macedonians did not speak a Greek dialect.

Soldier of Macedon has located some important quotes that I knew of but hadn't located, such as the Curtius Rufus passages. But let's all be careful on how we incorporate ancient passages into these articles. The importance of the passages from Strattis (used as evidence for the Greek-dialect argument), for example, have been blown out of proportion by various Wikipedians. I haven't seen scholars giving much weight to Strattis the Athenian Comic. Such exaggerated use of ancient passages borders on original research and can even become original research; for encyclopedia purposes, it would be much better to know what the published scholars have written about a given passage. ---Alex 17:22, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Phillip the II adopted the <i>Attic dialect</i> which had not yet developed into the <i>Koine</i> of the Hellenistic era. Macedon was in a cultural rise with the expansion of the kingdom thus for <i>administrative</i> purposes the foremost Greek dialect was adopted, due to its wide-spread use in Hellenic colonies in the mediterrainean continents and its growing influence. With the increasing links between Macedon and Greece such as colonies and trade, and also the "philhellenic" tendencies of the Macedonian kings first initiated by Alexander "philhellene", it should not be that odd, considering Thracians also adopted Greek words, characters &amp; figures for coin inscriptions. The question on the contrary is why, if ancient Macedonian was a Greek dialect, did Phillip II adopt another dialect of the same language? Assuming ancient Macedonian was not a Greek language, it was obviously not wide-spread although related amongst neighbouring kin tribes that were barbaric, it would not be a suitable <i>language of administration</i> for the empire Phillip was planning for. Why, if ancient Macedonians are Greek did they only adopt a Greek dialect in the era of Phillip II for there is no record of any other Greek dialect or language being used for administration in Macedonia prior? The first Macedonian king to come into close relations with influential Greek figures was Alexander "philhellene" and it is where we can date the earliest time Greek was used for anything in Macedonia, which was just coins at that time, the pella katadesmos suggests that there were Hellenes living in Macedonia which is something that I do not dispute for that time period. However there are Thracian inscriptions in the region close to the Rhodope that are from the Vth century bc, and historic proof that Thracians and related tribes lived in Macedonia longer than any Hellenes. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoldier_of_Macedon_cf7d.html" title="User:Soldier of Macedon">Soldier of Macedon</a> 14:17, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">ancient macedonian and slavic macedonian</span></h3>
<p>As Wiglaf stated this issue is not only about facts, but also people's national feelings. I am a Macedonian and I believe that my language along with other Slavic language of the Balkans and to a lesser degree north of the Danube are related to the Thraco-Illyric languages, <i>to what extent is in dispute tis the reason why I do not state it as a fact but rather a personal belief</i>. It is very convenient for some to use the term "slavic" in a negative way for the word itself only spread out when christianity began to take hold of the Balkans and was not recorded in ancient times. However it would be naive to suggest there is no linguistic connection between the words I will provide below, we are here to freely discuss our views on the ancient Macedonian language and its aspects, thus if it is to be truly objective my opinion should be stated also. I believe that two language families were present in the Balkans, Greek with its own dialects and nations, and the Pelasgi who later became known as Thracians, Paeonians, Macedonians e.t.c. That is why I have provided comparisons of words from various "barbaric" tribes of the Balkans, and a comparison in other languages also. My sources are from the Wikipedia, Indo-European glossaries, if specifics are required for a particular word, feel free to ask.</p>
<p>1. VODI = modern Macedonian, (<i>water(s)</i>), VEDY = Macedonian, VEDU = Phrygian, NERO = Greek, AQUA = Latin.</p>
<p>2. ZEMJA = modern Macedonian, (<i>ground, earth, land</i>), ZEMELO = Phrygian, SEMELA = Thracian, HOMA, GJI = Greek, BOTE, FUND = Albanian.</p>
<p>3. EZERA = modern Macedonian, (<i>lakes</i>), OSERIATES = Illyrian, LIMNI = Greek, LIQEN = Albanian, LACUS = Latin.</p>
<p>4. KAL = modern Macedonian, (<i>mud</i>), CHALAS = Thracian, LASPI = Greek, LIMUS = Latin, BALTE = Albianian.</p>
<p>5. ZLATO = modern Macedonian, (<i>gold</i>), SALTAS = Thracian, HRISOS = Greek, AURUM, CHRYSOS = Latin, ARTE = Albanian.</p>
<p>6. DZVER = modern Macedonian, (<i>beast, animal</i>), ZVERI = Thraciam, ZOA = Greek, FERA, BESTIA = Latin, KAFSHE = Albanian.</p>
<p>7. BRAT = modern Macedonian, (<i>brother</i>), BRA = Illyrian, ADELFOS = Greek, FRATER = Latin, VELLA = Albanian.</p>
<p>8. JASIKA = modern Macedonian, (<i>alder</i>), ALIXA = Macedonian, KILTHRA = Greek</p>

<p>10. ZELEN(A) = modern Macedonian, (<i>green, greenery</i>), ZILMAS = Thracian, PRASINOS = Greek, GJELBER = Albanian, CAERULEUS = Latin.</p>
<p><br />
The comparisons above do not seem to me like wild claims, on the contrary rather and there are more words which have a connection. I know there are other words as such that resemble Greek, my intention here is to determine the proximity of Slavonic and modern Macedonian in particular , not to claim direct descent. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoldier_of_Macedon_cf7d.html" title="User:Soldier of Macedon">Soldier of Macedon</a> 07:17, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The comparisons above are nothing new. You may be (or may not be) familiar with the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-European_fc7a.html" title="Indo-European">Indo-European</a> language family, with the concept of common root-words, and with the concept of <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognates.html" title="Cognates">cognates</a>. There are many cognates between Thracian and Slavic; a few cognates between ancient Macedonian and Slavic. There are many more cognates between ancient Macedonian and ancient Greek. A few cognates (as between ancient Macedonian and Slavic) do not indicate anything other than we are dealing with two Indo-European languages.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I can go in detail through your list, give the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Indo-European_b6da.html" title="Proto-Indo-European">PIE</a> roots, and cite other cognates, including ancient Greek ones you missed. Got anything else? ---Alex 17:32, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You only list three cognates between ancient Macedonian and modern Macedonian: Bedu/Vodi; Alixa/Jasika; Gotan/Goida. The modern Macedonian forms are from the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Slavic_language_d6f4.html" title="Proto-Slavic language">Proto-Slavic language</a>, though they are <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognate.html" title="Cognate">cognate</a> to the ancient Macedonian forms. Most of the other ones you list are Thracian, and here we have a big problem: even if ancient Macedonian and Thracian were part of the same Indo-European language-branch, Thracian was overall a <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satem.html" title="Satem">Satem</a> language, while ancient Macedonian was very <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centum.html" title="Centum">Centum</a>. So there is no good chance of seeing something like <i>zelena</i> (PIE *<b>gh</b>el-), <i>zemja</i> (PIE *(dh)<b>gh</b>em-), <i>zlato</i> (PIE *<b>gh</b>el-), or <i>ezera</i> (PIE *e<b>gh</b>ero-) in ancient Macedonian. For example, PIE <i>*e<b>gh</b>ero-</i> ("lake") in ancient Macedonian would have given rise to something like <i>Akeron</i>, and in ancient Greek we find <i><a href="../../../a/c/h/Acheron.html" title="Acheron">Acheron</a></i>. These are Ancient Macedonian sound-rules. I will go in detail through your list later, if the people are not convinced. ---Alex 17:59, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It would be better to give only cognates when comparing the words. Example:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Indo-European_b6da.html" title="Proto-Indo-European">PIE</a> <i>*wed-</i>, "water". Ancient Greek <i>'udôr</i> (not modern Greek <i>nero</i>); Latin <i>udus</i> (not "aqua"); ancient Macedonian <i>bedu</i> (though this may well be a loan from a Thraco-Phrygian Orphic cult, see above); Phrygian <i>bedu</i>; Slavic Macedonian <i>vodi</i> (from common <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavonic.html" title="Slavonic">Slavonic</a>).</dd>
<dd>PIE <i>*bhrater-</i>, "brother". Attic Greek <i>phrater</i> (a member of a <i>phratra</i>, e.g., a member of a brotherhood, a clan made up of kin; Doric Greek <i>patra</i>); Latin <i>frater</i>; English <i>brother</i>; Slavic Macedonian <i>brat</i> (from common Slavonic).</dd>
<dd>PIE <i>*dhghem-</i>, "earth". Ancient Greek <i>chamai</i>, Latin <i>humus</i>, Thracian <i>Semele</i>, Phrygian <i>Zemelo</i>, Slavic Macedonian <i>zemja</i> (from common Slavonic, etc.). The ancient Greek stem <i>cham-</i> meant "earth". PIE <b>gh</b> became <i>ch</i> (<a href="../../../c/h/i/Chi.html" title="Chi">chi</a>) in ancient Greek. In ancient Macedonian, it would probably have become a <a href="../../../k/_/_/K.html" title="K">k</a> sound. In the Satemized languages (Phrygian, Thracian, Proto-Slavic, etc.), it became a <a href="../../../s/i/b/Sibilant.html" title="Sibilant">sibilant</a> sound: <a href="../../../z/_/_/Z.html" title="Z">z</a> or <a href="../../../s/_/_/S.html" title="S">s</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Even if ancient Macedonian was on the same Indo-European branch as Thracian (which I doubt, but I've considered that), the Centum-Satem isogloss cuts through them and separates them. More likely, ancient Macedonian was grouped with Greek, not Thracian, but you all can feel free to argue the opposite. ---Alex 22:07, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Decius, I appreciate your approach towards my opinions. Considering the fact that not many authentic words of ancient Macedonian survive, how is it possible to determine wether it was satem or centum language judging by a handful of words? I am familiar with the indo-euro root words and languages, probably not as much as you, although the words I cited have a common proto-indo-euro origin they are nevertheless much closer to the modern Macedonian language than any of the other comparison languages, this must be of significance. I respect your opinion on the language groupings but I would still classify ancient Macedonian as a Thraco-Illyric language. Also there may be as yet more cognates between ancient Greek and ancient Macedonian however many of the words are from Hesychius, thus in a period where Latin and Greek would have influence on the native language. The only way is to review all of the ancient Macedonian words, currently the glossary on Wikipedia does not have all the words. Also Decius, this satem and centum distinction is also not clear-cut sometimes, for as it states on the Wikipedia page Illyrian is centum while Thracian is satem, yet many scholars group these together not only culturally but linguistically as well. By the way Decius, you stated that ancient Macedonian was very centum thus no chance of words such as "ezera, oseriates", however this word is Illyrian and so thus accordingly centum, why would it exist in Illyrian and not Macedonian? Alot of assumptions are made even by scholars, however when we have clear word matches as such they must be considered. I will post some more words later, at least you have an opinion and it is scholarly, unlike some others who embraced my presence here. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoldier_of_Macedon_cf7d.html" title="User:Soldier of Macedon">Soldier of Macedon</a> 04:41, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are often words in a given language that don't follow the expected Centum-Satem rule. There are a few Centum words known in Baltic and Slavic if I'm not mistaken, and there are some Satem words in ancient Greek (I think). Albanian has some Centum words, though it's classed as Satem. Phrygian is a bit of a mix of Centum and Satem. Illyrian is undetermined, but more scholars seem to think it was Centum. I haven't seen any legitimate scholars propose that ancient Macedonian was Satem. The examples consistently show Centum sounds. Your argument would have more to it if you found Satem examples in ancient Macedonian. I stand by my words: there is no good chance of seeing those Satem examples (mentioned above) in ancient Macedonian. I would say that ancient Macedonian was even "more Centum" than ancient Greek, though maybe Dbachmann might disagree with such a phrase as "more Centum", whatever that means. But when a Greek word has <i>ch</i>, and we see a Macedonian word with <i>k</i> in its place, I think you guys know what I'm talking about:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Ancient Macedonian <i>kalithos</i>, "wine" (&lt;PIE <i>*ghel-</i>)</dd>
<dd>Ancient Greek <i>chalis</i> "pure wine" (&lt;PIE <i>*ghel-</i>)</dd>
<dd>Thracian <i>zelas</i>, "wine" (&lt;PIE <i>ghel-</i>)</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Speaking of wine, I'll be back later. -----Alex 06:13, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the ancient Greek dialects there may have been differences to the extent of making it a little troubling for two not of the same to comprehend each other, however nevertheless they were still mutually understood. My belief of a broad language with many dialects in the Balkans other than ancient Greek stems from the historical evidence I initially posted, where a clear ethno-cultural and linguistic relation is made in regards to Macedonians, Thracians, Epirote and Illyrian. Thus I place them in the same group, influence over time is another matter, it could very well be that words such as "kalithos' is a loanword which was altered in time in accordance with the local language, the ancient writers place the native language of Macedonia with Thraco-Illyric &amp; Epirote. Most is speculation on our part in regards to a modern connection due to the lack of <i>authentic</i> words. However if we consider ancient Macedonian to be in the same "Pelasgic" family as Thracian, Phrygian, Illyrian, Paeonian and other sub-tribes in the Balkans, and we compare the survivng words with the Balto-Slavic language family there would be much in terms of similarities and links, possibly more than in other family. You asked for more words, whats your take on these two Paeonian words and possible etymology in modern Macedonian;</p>
<p><i>BYLAZORA</i> = BELA ZORA (white dawn)</p>
<p><i>DYSORUM</i> = DISI (breath), stemming from DUKH or DUSA(soul), mentioned by Herodotus 'dysorum' is the name of a mountain, etymology linked via fresh mountain air, fresh breathing.</p>
<p>I think Balto-Slavic, Slavonic in particular deserves much more respect in regards to the ancient words of the Balkans. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoldier_of_Macedon_cf7d.html" title="User:Soldier of Macedon">Soldier of Macedon</a> 08:45, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I do not know of any specialist in ancient Balkanic toponymy who accepts such an etymology for <i><a href="../../../b/y/l/Bylazora.html" title="Bylazora">Bylazora</a></i> or <i>Dysoron</i> (<a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Lat</a>. <i>Dysorum</i>). On the other hand, I read a recent work on Balkanic toponymy by a linguist (some guy named Paliga, I have the link) , and he did not mention any proposed etymology for <a href="../../../b/y/l/Bylazora.html" title="Bylazora">Bylazora</a>. Myself, I cannot accept such Slavic etymologies for those two examples unless a good case is made for them, beyond just outward appearance, which is very often deceiving.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Slavic_language_d6f4.html" title="Proto-Slavic language">Proto-Slavic language</a>, it, along with the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltic_languages.html" title="Baltic languages">Baltic languages</a>, preserved many <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Indo-European_roots_5e14.html" title="List of Indo-European roots">Indo-European roots</a>, so many <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognates.html" title="Cognates">cognates</a> will be found between Balto-Slavic and other <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-European_languages_7b20.html" title="Indo-European languages">Indo-European branches</a>, including ancient Balkanic Indo-European branches. And as noted above, many cognates have been found (though some are speculative; most are established) between Balto-Slavic and <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thracian_language.html" title="Thracian language">Thracian</a>, and because Thracian was a <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satem.html" title="Satem">Satem</a> language, the cognates often have similar forms.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, again this can be deceiving. There are a few close cognates between <a href="../../../p/h/r/Phrygian_language.html" title="Phrygian language">Phrygian</a> and Balto-Slavic (ex: Phrygian <i>belte</i>, "swamp"; Early Proto-Slavic <i>*balta</i>, "marsh" &lt;PIE <i>*bhel-</i>, "to gleam"), but as we know from Phrygian inscriptions (including many complete sentences), Phrygian was definitely not close to Baltic or Slavic, but is somewhat close to <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greek_c878.html" title="Ancient Greek">Ancient Greek</a>. I will probably quote some Phrygian sentences to demonstrate this to everybody.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Balto-Slavic <i>is</i> respected in the fields of ancient Balkanic linguistics, so no need to worry about that. It has supplied a number of cognates with Thracian (as pointed out several times above), but it has not supplied many <i>notable</i> cognates with <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Macedonian_language_41c2.html" title="Ancient Macedonian language">Ancient Macedonian</a>. For example, Proto-Slavic <i>*zab</i> (or <i>*zob</i>, not sure here) meaning "tooth", is cognate to Ancient Macedonian *<i>kombos</i>, "molar tooth" (attested in plural form <i>kombous</i> in Hesychius, according to Perseus Online). They are both from PIE <i>*gembh-</i>, "tooth", but the Slavic form is not a notable cognate. Ancient Greek <i>gomphios</i>, <i>gomphos</i> (also from PIE <i>*gembh-</i>) is much closer, and <a href="../../../t/o/c/Tocharian_language.html" title="Tocharian language">Tocharian A</a> <i>kam</i> ("tooth") and <a href="../../../t/o/c/Tocharian_language.html" title="Tocharian language">Tocharian B</a> <i>keme</i> ("tooth") are also closer than the Slavic, as well as showing the unvoicing of the velar stop (PIE *<a href="../../../g/_/_/G.html" title="G">g</a> ---&gt; <a href="../../../k/_/_/K.html" title="K">k</a>). Slavic shows the expected satem-reflex (<a href="../../../g/_/_/G.html" title="G">g</a>--<a href="../../../z/_/_/Z.html" title="Z">z</a>), and a denasalization, unless I'm mistaken (from <i>*zamb</i> or <i>*zomb</i> to <i>*zab</i>, <i>*zob</i>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for whether <i>kombous</i> is actually Macedonian, well ... If Hesychius says it is, then I would say that <i>kombous</i> is almost certainly a Macedonian word, as it shows the unvoicing of the <a href="../../../v/e/l/Velar.html" title="Velar">velar</a> stop encountered in other Macedonian examples (<i>kanadoi</i>, <i>klinotrochon</i>, <i>arkon</i>, etc.).

<p><b>ARGIVE DESCENT</b></p>
<p>The claim of apparent "argive" descent from Alexander "philhellene" has I am sure been published to death by the Greek here, who claim that Alexander thus must be Greek for Argos is in Hellas proper. This being the case, does that mean that the Spartans are not Greek, for Herodotus also states "The chiefs of the Dorians are <i>really genuine Egyptians</i>. -- book 6, 53". Another interesting paragraph of Herodotus is the following; "Men of Argos, king Xerxes speaks thus to you. We Persians deem that the Perses from whom we descend is the child of Perseus the son of Danae, and of Andromeda the daughter of Cepheus. Here by it would seem that <i>we come of your stock and lineage</i>. So then it neither benefits us to make war upon those of whom we spring, nor can it be right for you to fight on behalf of others, against us. -- Book 7, 150". If we follow the rule applied by Greeks in regards to Macedonians it would mean the Persians must be Greek also, Xerxes makes clear not only royal lineage but the whole Persian race is of Argive descent, we know for a fact the Persians were not Greek either. Many ancients believed in mutual ancestry and relations regardless of race, this should not be the basis of determining their nationality. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoldier_of_Macedon_cf7d.html" title="User:Soldier of Macedon">Soldier of Macedon</a> 14:45, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Soldier of Macedon Herodotus in this chapter or fragment mention the Digression on the Spartan royal families. So mention diffrents argyments (Egyptians, Assyrians e.t.c.). This is the analysis of this:</p>
<p>Digression on the Spartan version of how they came to have two kings, and how one line came to have first place; other Greeks do not follow this (52). Hdt prefers the Greek version, which makes the Dorians Egyptians and traces their family back only as far as Perseus (53). A Persian version makes Perseus an Assyrian (54). The prerogatives of the Spartan kings in declaring war and leading the army (55-56). A survey of the civic and religious functions of the kings: extra food and wine, appointing proxenoi and Pythioi (official oracle getters); his judicial role limited to heiresses and public roads, and adoption; his extra vote (?) in the gerousia (57). How the Spartans mourn a king who has died, including a ten day no-business holiday (58). Any debts to a king expire on his death; this is the same in Persia (59). Inherited jobs in Sparta: herald, flutist, and cook (60). Origin of the feud between Demaratus and Cleomenes: how the bride of Ariston (an earlier king) became the loveliest woman in Sparta through the intervention of the goddess Helen. She had been married to his friend, but he tricked him into giving her up. She bore Demaratus; at first, Ariston suspected that the boy was not his, but later he changed his mind (61-63). Demaratus became king on Ariston's death. Cleomenes got Leutychides, who was of the Heraclid line, to challenge Demaratus' birthright by promising him the kingship. Leutychides hated Demaratus for stealing his wife-to-be by 'capture' (cf Plut Lyc 15). Formal impeachment procedures are begun, and Sparta appeals to the oracle at Delphi; but Cleomenes fixes the oracle, and Demaratus is deposed (64-66). The deposed Demaratus questions his mother about his birth; she claims to have been raped by a local hero in the guise of Ariston, and also points out that he (Demaratus) was born prematurely (67-69). How Demaratus fled from Sparta to Asia and was royally treated by Darius (70). Leutychides became king; his son died young, but his grandson Archidamos was to succeed him (71). Later, Leutychides was convicted of bribery (while attacking Thessaly in the 470s) and banished (72). So Leutychides and Cleomenes in 491 BC went to Aigina, seized 10 leading citizens, and delivered them to the Athenians as punishment for Aigina's having given earth and water to Darius' heralds (73). Supporters of Demaratus then accused Cleomenes, who was banished; he went to Arcadia and tried to ally the Arcadians against Sparta; in fear, the Spartans took him back, but he then went crazy and committed suicide. This was divine punishment, but there is dispute over which impiety Cleomenes was being punished for (74-5). The Argives say that he had violated Argive suppliants during a Spartan invasion of Argos, the story of which is told at length (76-83). First, Cleomenes was prevented from crossing the Erasinus by bad omens and had to sail around to Tiryns (76). Relying on a riddling oracle, the Argive strategy was to follow the commands of the the Spartan crier themselves (77). Cleomenes used this to trick them into being busy eating while he attacked; many took refuge in a sacred grove (78). Cleomenes tricked some of these into coming out, then butchered them. He then burnt the grove (79-80). He whipped a priest who forebade him from sacrificing at Hera's shrine in Argos (81). He returned to Sparta and was accused of having been bribed, but successfully defended himself with a story of a bad omen at Hera's temple (82). How the native slaves then took over Argos, but were finally put down again in 468 BC (83). But the Spartans claim that Cleomenes went crazy from the strong wine which the Scythians taught him to drink, when they came to Sparta proposing a joint attack on Persia (84). With Cleomenes dead, the Aiginetans come to Sparta to demand justice; Leutychides is handed over to them, and they decide to take him to Athens and demand the release of the Aiginetans held there (85). Finding the Athenians reluctant, Leutychides tell the story of the Spartan Glaucus to illustrate that the breakers of oaths are punished by the gods (86). Still Athens refuses, so the Aiginetans ambush a religious procession en route to Sunium by ship and take prisoners (87). Nicodromus, an Aiginetan malcontent, agrees to help Athens get revenge (88). By agreement, Nicodromus seizes the acropolis of Aigina; but the Athenians arrive a day late, since they have to borrow 20 extra warships from the Corinthians. Nicodromus escapes with his men and is settled at Sunium (89-90). One of Nicodromus' partisans, about to be executed together with 700 of his fellows, takes refuge at Demeter's temple and is forcibly removed; a curse on the Aiginetan oligarchs culminates in their expulsion in 431 BC (91). War between Athens and Aigina; Argos refuses to aid Aigina this time, because Cleomenes had used Aiginetan ships for a raid in the Argolid; but 1000 Argive volunteers do help. Hdt seems unclear about who won. (92-93).</p>
<p>In the book 7-150,151(Reactions of the Greeks to Xerxes Invasion) Herodotus describe an another version of the Argive rôle: some say Argos had a prior mutual non-aggression pact with Xerxes on the basis of shared ancestry through Perseus &amp; Andromeda. Evidence for this on the authority of Callias the Athenian.</p>
<p>Just as historic Herodotus describe all the versions of that era. Last as of the Dorians specially the Macedonias the first written record of the Greek legend about the Macedonian Argaeads we may regard Aeschylus' lines in the play "The Suppliants," where the poet introduces Pelasgus, king of Argos, common ancestor of the Doric branch of Greeks, boasting that his race rules as far as the pure waters of the Strymon .On the basis of the age-long legend handed down by the Greeks from prehistorical times, Aeschylus indirectly proclaims the descent of the Macedonians from the Doric branch and directly tells us about their origin from the Argive Heracleids, as those who ruled "the land of the Perrhaibians," "beyond Pindus," "near the Paeonians," "in the Dodona mountains" and "all the territory through which the pure Strymon flows."( Aesch. Suppl. 250 ff. )</p>
<p>Best Regards <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Akritas" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Akritas" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>Akritas</p>
<p>Well, well, if it isn't my old friend Akritas, the fact is common lineage can be traced by many nations, if it is irrelevant that the Persian race claims descent from Argos, then why would it be any more relevant in regards to the apparent argive descent of the Macedonian kings, after all we are talking of a whole race compared to a royal lineage? And for that Aeshylus fragment, it states Pelasgus, king of Argos, of the Pelasgic race. It does not indirectly or directly say anything about Dorian descent, Argive Heracleads or Macedonia itself, check <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0016;query=card%3D%2326;layout=;loc=207" class="external free" title="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0016;query=card%3D%2326;layout=;loc=207" rel="nofollow">http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0016;query=card%3D%2326;layout=;loc=207</a>. The lands which are mentioned are Thracian lands by descent, all the region of which the pure Strymon flows is Thracian living space. Thus a Pelasgic king was still ruler of ancient Pelasgia(now called hellas), Pelasgi lived at Strymon and Pindus, Hellenes further south, there is nothing homogenous about the kingdom at hand. Your claim to the Argead dynasty is weak, I don't remember Herodotus mentioning king Pelasgus of Macedonian Argead Heracleids. By the way, that river "Strymon" has terminology in modern Macedonian, which is "<i>Stryi</i>" and/or "<i>Strymi</i>" meaning "to flow, to circulate", from where we get the modern Macedonian word for electricity which is "<i>Stryja</i>". <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoldier_of_Macedon_cf7d.html" title="User:Soldier of Macedon">Soldier of Macedon</a> 01:39, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>In the Macedon article it writes a statement from Nicholas Hammond, where it mentions the "greek" tribal name of <i>orestai</i> which means "mountain men". It is highly likely that this word is connected to the Phrygian <i>oru</i> and modern Macedonian word <i>gore</i>, which mean "up, high, mountain, ie. montenegro, Crna Gora", and is thus in accordance with Hammonds definition. What puzzles me is Hammond's confidence in passing the word over as Greek, without explaining why. The modern Greek words for "up, high" are <i>ipsi</i> and <i>apano</i>, thus leading to the assumption that the word <i>orestai</i> is pre-Hellenic and very much Pelasgic, thus naturally fitting for a Macedonian tribal name. A question for the administrators, can we, in the name of fair play, get a couple of modern Macedonian cognates for the ancient Macedonian sample glossary? As it stands presently not one is present and it seems as though there is an effort to intentionally avoid them, however this is not objective nor in the spirit of Wikipedia for there are genuine cognates that deserve a mention. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoldier_of_Macedon_cf7d.html" title="User:Soldier of Macedon">Soldier of Macedon</a> 07:16, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

Hammond in his book mention the orestai as a Greek-speaking political non-Greek depended from the Eperotical tribe of Mollosians. And as source Hammond mentioned the Ecataios the Milissean. (Macedonian State, chapter III) Also Strabo in the book 7, VII, 8 mention the Orestai as other tribe, non-Greek of course Now Orestai name came from the greek word Oresi=Mountain, a word that use from the Greeks and in the present without the -si. In the ancient Greek grammar when we want the characterized the people that live in a specific region we add the –ai. The region called Orestis, Orestias=Mountain region. So in the question of Soldier of Macedon to the administrators please add and my opinion concerning the etymological term of Orestai.Akritas 14:21, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>According to Herodotus, three brothers descended from the Heracleid Temenos, who founded the Heracleid dynasty of Argos, namely Gauanes, Aeropus and Perdiccas, left Argos and went to Illyria, whence they reached Upper Macedonia and were employed as shepherds by the king of the small city of Lebaea. This monarch, warned by divine portents of the future glory destined for the youngest brother Perdiccas - the bread baked for him by the queen swelled to double its size - sent them away, giving them in mockery the sun which came through the chimney hole as their wages. Young Perdiccas circumscribed the space occupied by the sun with a knife and with symbolic gestures put it three times in his pockets, clearly meaning that he was taking possession of the region. The king, realizing rather late what the youth had implied, sent horsemen after the fugitives to slay them. But the three brothers succeeded in crossing a river, which immediately after miraculously flooded, so that it became impassable to the horsemen. In this fashion the Temenids of Argos were saved and settled near the so-called "Gardens of Midas" beside Mount Bermion, where Perdiccas, the youngest, became founder of the Macedonian kingdom's dynasty, with Aegae for its capital(Herod. Hist. VIII, 137-139). Now if we go in the region that renamed after the invasion of Dorians Macedonia(before called Emathia, according Strabo) Herodotus(Herod. Hist. I, 56). said: the Makednoi (Macedonians) who crossed Doris and moved to Peloponnesos were later called Dorians. Since the term Dorians is much more well known than the term Makednoi we shall also use it to identify the latter people in the discussion to follow. The Dorians who formed the Macedonian state came in contact with the local Pelasgic population whose size was much smaller than the one residing at the sea shores and the islands of Southern Greece. It is for this reason that German Historian K. Belloch considered the Macedonians the purest Greeks of any other part of Greece (Gr. Geschichte, I, 1a, p92). The Dorians(Makednoi) of Macedonia were larger in number than those who moved southwards. This is because those who moved southwards were reduced in number either due to attrition or to settlements in the areas they visited along their movement to Southern Greece. Such a place of permanent residence for some Makednoi(Dorians) was Doris. When these Dorians (known until then as Makednoi only) moved to Peloponnesos they became known there as Dorians (that is, the people [coming] from Doris).. Of course there are some people claim that Makedmoi is not Macedonians we have to think what era Herodotus had written his work and what was the initial name of that Dorian tribe.

<p>I guess some things never change, your misinterpretation in particular. Ok, so according to you the word <i>Oresi</i> means "mountain" in Greek, can you provide a source for that claim? Is there any other context in which the word could have been used, for example to mean "up, high" as well as "mountain" like it does in modern Macedonian? Or should I treat this explanation of yours the same way I treated your third-rate effort in the explanation of Athena? By the way, I was asking for modern Macedonian cognates to the words present in the glossary and Hesychius, not to introduce <i>orestai</i> into it, but then again you are Akritas, the person who possibly tried to dirty up my name by providing a link here to the Maknews forum perhaps... But it's ok for you see all in all my posts are comrehensive, backed-up and make sense, whereas you spent 90% of your effort there disputing the particular letter of a particular word, so please let slip if I do not take you seriously, which I cannot after your perfomance there. Speaking of which I will not get into the same Herodotus argument with you, I have been through this over and over again, if you are not able to understand sentences it is your problem. Just read this; <i>For in the days of king Deucalion it inhabited the land of Phthia, then the country called Histiaean, under Ossa and Olympus, in the time of Dorus son of Hellen; driven from this Histiaean country by the Cadmeans, it settled about Pindus in the territory called Macedonian; <b>from there again it migrated</b> to Dryopia, and at last came from Dryopia into the Peloponnese, where it took the name of Dorian.</i> <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=1.56.0" class="external free" title="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=1.56.0" rel="nofollow">http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=1.56.0</a> If you cannot understand that the Dorian settlement was brief before they <i>again migrated</i>, that is your problem, nowhere in the above statement does it mention the Macedonians are of Doric or Hellenic origin, the fact that people like you continue to persist in something that does not exist is why I will very seldom respond to your posts.

Soldier you repeat again the same thinks when someone tell you the etymological meaning of the word in Ancient or modern Greek . Oresi or Orese (όρεση) is a common ancient term that you find in the plenty of ancient Greek texts.

Then after this he gave thought to inquire which people of the Hellenes he should esteem the most powerful and gain over to himself as friends. And inquiring he found that the Lacedemonians and the Athenians had the pre-eminence, the first of the Dorian and the others of the Ionian race. For these were the most eminent races in ancient time, the second being a Pelasgian and the first a Hellenic race: and the one never migrated from its place in any direction, while the other was very exceedingly given to wanderings; for in the reign of Deucalion this race dwelt in Pthiotis, and in the time of Doros the son of Hellen in the land lying below Ossa and Olympos, which is called Histiaiotis; and when it was driven from Histiaiotis by the sons of Cadmos, it dwelt in Pindos and was called Makednian; and thence it moved afterwards to Dryopis, and from Dryopis it came finally to Peloponnesus, and began to be called Dorian</i> .Akritas 14:23, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>All talk and no play makes Jack a dull boy. You still haven't answered Herodotus' accounts on the Dorian origin of Macedonians, nor the constant Macedonian claims that take pride on being Greek, nor any of the hundreds of ancient quotes that have been discussed in here again and again. Whether Macedonians or not were Greek is a different story. What we know for sure is that the Macedonian royal family was most certainly Greek, participated in the Olympics and took pride for it. The Macedonian people spoke a "Hellenic" language and fought for a King that called himself and his people Greek (rare for a pride barbarian nation). Furthermore we know that Macedonians were completely assimilated into the Greek population some 8000 before your <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavic.html" title="Slavic">Slavic</a> ancestors set foot in the Balkans. Take a look where Pella is in a map: in the heart of Northern Greece. Macedonians today ARE Greek, and Macedon is Northern Greece. The fact that some Bulgarian nation identifies itself as Macedonian (because a Serbo-Croat dictator chose to do so) is a different story. Every sane person knows that FYROM is urelated to the ancient Macedon region and people, but its ex-commie regime has brainwashed the public. For that and the other obvious reasons, any person of basic historical knowledge knows that your Slavic-Macedonian linguistic connection is a bunch of sad nationalist monkey-crap. It's also the reason I haven't even bothered to reply to your ludicrous edits during all this time.

<p>Soldier, if you want to go back through your notes and present on this talk page what you believe are the best cognates between Slavic and Ancient Macedonian, that would help. After presenting them, they will be reviewed. Those that are notable cognates (see below) may well be listed.</p>
<p>When dealing with these cognates, it's not a matter of NPOV so much as making sure a given cognate is actually a cognate (here, authoritative <a href="../../../r/e/f/References.html" title="References">references</a> are a must), and if it is a cognate, whether it is close enough or unique enough to merit being listed (this will be determined by making a comparison of known cognates). Anyway, listing cognates that are very different from the Macedonian complements will only serve to undermine any theory of Slavic being close to ancient Macedonian.</p>
<p>I don't know of many notable cognates between common Slavic and Ancient Macedonian. As the Phrygian example proves (discussed above), a few cognates can be very deceiving. A body of very close cognates (as between Macedonian and Greek), however, suggests something more. Alexander 007 05:50, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

But he was not saying (though he may believe this) that Ancient Macedonian was a Slavic language, which would have been idiotic (or maybe he did say that and I missed it).

<p>Well in order to conclude, as Soldier states in his section "ancient macedonian and slavic macedonian", he basically supports that Slavic has existed in the Balkans since antiquity, either as a child or parent branch of Thraco-Illyrian. With all non-Slavomacedonian historians as my witnesses I regard this opinion directly as idiotic. And as himself he puts it, his claims are not based on facts but on nationalist beliefs (=myths): <i>this issue is not only about facts, but also people's national feelings. I am a Macedonian and I believe that my language along with other Slavic language of the Balkans and to a lesser degree north of the Danube are related to the Thraco-Illyric languages, to what extent is in dispute tis the reason why I do not state it as a fact but rather a personal belief</i>. Well in that respect I think I have the right to discard something that a self-conscious nationalist considers a "personal belief". I'm already aware of some Slavomacedonian books that claim direct connection between Slavic Macedonian (Bulgarian) and ancient Macedonian (Hellenic). I'm sure they all think they're being scholarly as well, but that does not oblige me to regard them as such. What those people intentionally ignore, is that their language artificially broke off Bulgarian after Tito's reforms at the end of WW2. The fact that it's not called Bulgarian today is for purely social reasons, not linguistic ones. All of the words he pasted as "Macedonian" can be found unchanged in other Slavic languages spoken in Northern Europe (e.g. Russian:VODI=Water). This fact alone suffices to nullify his claims. And for crying out loud, if there really was some remote connection between Slavs and the known ancient word, would we really be expecting the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian_Slav_1ff1.html" title="Macedonian Slav">Macedonian Slav</a> scholars to discover it? Slavic intellectuality has an unbroken history of some 1000 years while Russian literature has dominated the international scene in the modern era, would the rest of the Slavs expect a 15-year old country with an artificial language and nationality to make new discoveries on the origins of the <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavic_language.html" title="Slavic language">Slavic language</a>??

It wasn't until today, about a month later, that I decided to continue and counter his ideas a bit more.

<dd>There were and there are some linguists who propose that ancient Macedonian may be affiliated with Thracian (though Illyrian is preferred more). Now, I have not seen any strong evidence of this. But the reasoning that Soldier apparently had was "Thracian has many cognates with Balto-Slavic; if ancient Macedonian was affiliated with Thracian, then perhaps ancient Macedonian was closer to the Slavic branch than to Greek"---I see this is as something worth addressing in a scientific manner. Though even if Macedonian was grouped with Thracian (despite one being <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centum.html" title="Centum">centum</a> and the other <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satem.html" title="Satem">satem</a>, which is a big problem for the theory), it still doesn't make much of a case, because some recent linguists propose that Thracian itself may have been grouped with Greek or Phrygian (and Phrygian is generally grouped adjacent to Greek).

Alinei has no convincing evidence nor are his ideas catching hold, but... you see, there is actually a linguist out there who is only a few degrees away from Soldier.

What we really have to consider is why haven't any other Slavic scholars emphasised such a possible connection, which as you said it yourself it might be a simple affiliation of IE languages. I'm sure that with some great deal of fantasy someone could find linguistic connections between Latin and Sanskrit. If Soldier's opinions were nothing but an innocent observation on the origins of the "Slavic language", then he wouldn't be labelling as "Macedonian" an group of words that can be found unchanged even in Russian. Even if the Slavo-Thraco-Illyrian connection did have a scientific basis, it still wouldn't back up any of Soldier's nationalist myths (connection between ancient Macedonians and Bulgarian Macedonians). The theory that "the Slavic invasion never happened" is not literal, and it's title is misleading. The Slav invasion did happen, and it's recorded in detail by Byzantine and other medieval historians, it's not based on an abstract reference like the Dorian invasion in Histories. The Southern Slavic linguistic group does undoubtly stem from that recorded Slavic invasion, which is independent to the fact that some Balto-Slavic populations might have had left traces in Thraco-Illyrian. If we take this phrase literally, it would be equally logical to state that the <a href="../../../b/r/e/Bretons.html" title="Bretons">Bretons</a>' migration in France never happened, because <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic.html" title="Celtic">Celtic</a> people had pre-existed in <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gaul.html" title="Gaul">Gaul</a>. In a caricature, Columbus never really went to America because the Vikings had most likely been there some centuries before him. I hope you can see where I'm coming from. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 13:15, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>On the other hand I'm not sure whether proto-Slavic refers literally to the first Slavs or just the people who just preceeded the Slavs in the Balkans. What I want to point out is that whether or not the Thraco-Illyrian group has a connection to the ancestor of Slavic, it's completely irrelevant to the vocabulary that Soldier provided us with. Unless of course someone supports that the Russian and Polish languages adopted or inherited linguistic elements from the Thraco-Illyrian peoples and their neighbours. This is why Soldier's claims are out of context and no worthy of attention. For example the Indo-Aryan invasion did happen and groups of IE-speaking peoples did dominate great part of Asian populations, but if a nazi ever used this facts to prove the existence of a superior race (connected to a nation X), I wouldn't be willing to discuss. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 13:23, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I agree on many points, but if you read page 37 of Alinei's text, you will see that he states that Thracians=Slavs. I can quote him exactly if you want, but you can just read it. He also challenges a number of the pillars of the Slavic invasion scenarios. Again, I am not supporting anything that Soldier wrote (or that Alinei writes---I reject most of Alinei's theories), but there were elements of Soldier's text that I wanted to address, because they surface often, especially on the internet.</dd>

<dd>And yeah, I may have been overly-dramatic when I said "a few degrees away", but Alinei identifies <i>Thracians with Slavs</i>. The next step, of course, is to identify Macedonians with Thracians...Alexander 007 13:32, 3 November 2005 (UTC) (and I can just imagine how User:Macedonian will react when he finds Alinei's paper, though it is in the fringe)</dd>

<p>To the USURPERS of history (aka "Macedonian"(sic)-Slavs) I think that history will judge you poorly. All I can say is that the Hebrews were right in their proverbs and I call to mind one such proverb that I think befits usurpurs of history (people of darkness). "Let us swallow them up alive as the grave, and whole, as those that go down into the pit" Proverbs (Mishle Shelomoh). &#160;: FYI. == Here are some external sources for the proofs that the ancient Macedonians were considered Greek, naturally. I suggest you learn HISTORY and not conform to pseudo-science (remember that Genetics paper in the journal published by some Spanish and Macedonian (sic) - slavonic nationals claiming the Macedonians as a separate ancient entity?). Well regarding such pseudo-science, the paper was published in an impact factor journal of just under 1.5 (meaning it's impact is akin to wiping one's bottom after relieving themselves). In addition, the paper is extremely flawed, considering it's implication is to say that Macedonian-slavs are different from Greeks... point taken, ofcourse they are... but purporting (by Slav nationals) that therefore the genes of the modern Macedonian(sic)-slavs means that they are the descendants of the ancient Macedonians. Where were those ancient genes obtained (Oh I know... they weren't as the researches DID NOT have access to ancient DNA from the ancient Macedonians so comparing Slavic Genes to Greek Genes is ofcourse going to be different). Ergo sum totali crappus!!! Hence, read these in ancient Hebrew... if you can and then see what the ancient Hebrews thought. Books: Daniel (chap.8, 1-22 chap.2 para.39 4-13, 26-28, 31, 38 chap. 7, 2-7) Isiaiah chap. 19, 20 chap. 19,23 Joel chap.3 v.6, Jeremy, Habacoum chap.2, v.5 and the books of the Maccabees (1st book chap. 1, v.1 &amp; 10 chap. 6 v.2, II 8, 20 III 8). Shalom l'olam, Sanser ha-Maqdon ha-Yewani ve-Melekh Yewanim. Hovevei Le'Ziyyon!!!!!!!</p>
<p>The Hebrews were right about many things actually. No point in bringing up references from the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>, the version of the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian_Orthodox_Church_8c91.html" title="Macedonian Orthodox Church">Macedonian Orthodox Church</a> has slightly "mistranslated" the above chapters (&lt;- no joke).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">On Linguistics</span></h2>
<p>May I also add in reference to Gora in Slavic.. it is related to Oros in Greek - it should be of no surprise that languages have common root words but in Ancient Macedonian the word was Orestai for the mountain people, not Goresti. The point to make is that Linguistics is hypothetical and very fallible... in deed at best one can draw any etymological relations beteween any indo-european language and say that they are related. Let us not forget that many Byzantine Greek words entered into Slavic and the language is inundated with Greek terms albeit changed to suit the etymology of Slavic (a lack of literacy records prior to the advent of Cyrillic) means that it is impossible to extrapolate what the pre-Slavic words were prior to that stage (yes yes it's all hypothetical people). At least with ancient Macedonian, the words that do survive were the peculiar words as such (local idioms being influenced by Pelasgian or Thracian or the Phrygian languages - mind you these are anatolian languages and as such share a very very close kinship to Greek). The remaining Macedonian language does survive, it is imbued in Koine Greek (after all Alexander commissioned the Koine Dialektos or Common Mode of Speech - he wouldn't commission something that is not COMMON to ALL the tribes of the Hellenic Kingdom he set out to create now would he and that includes Macedonian).

<dd>Shalom (and Salaam to the Arabs who read this). Slavic <i>gora</i> is not cognate to ancient Greek <i>oros</i>, or to <i>Orestai</i>. According to my references, <i>oros</i> and <i>Orestai</i> have not been traced to a PIE root. Slavic <i>gora</i> on the other hand goes back to PIE <i>*gwer-</i>, "mountain". PIE <i>*gw-</i> as a rule is represented by a <a href="../../../b/_/_/B.html" title="B">b</a> in ancient Greek, and a number of linguists think ancient Greek <i><a href="../../../b/o/r/Boreas.html" title="Boreas">Boreas</a></i> may derive from the same root as Slavic <i>gora</i> <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=boreas&amp;searchmode=none" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=boreas&amp;searchmode=none" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>. A curious thing is, that as Macedonian <i>gotan</i> may show (if it is from PIE <i>*gwou-</i>), PIE <i>*gw-</i> may have been at times represented by [g] in Macedonian. So Greek <i>Boreas</i> could conceivably have been <i>Goreas</i> in Macedonian, but this is a wild possibility, and it is irrelevant as far as the Slavic words are concerned, because it would just be a phonological coincidence.

<p>To clarify a few things, Miskin wrote "And as himself he puts it, his claims are not based on facts but on nationalist beliefs (=myths): <i>this issue is not only about facts, but also people's national feelings. I am a Macedonian and I believe that my language along with other Slavic language of the Balkans and to a lesser degree north of the Danube are related to the Thraco-Illyric languages, to what extent is in dispute tis the reason why I do not state it as a fact but rather a personal belief</i>", that is in line with what Wiglaf was trying to imply in his response to my first post, Wiglaf wrote "<i>Soldier of Macedon, you are entering a battle ground here on Wikipedia, but you username suggests that you are prepared for it&#160;:). Note that this issue is not only about facts, it is also about people's national feelings, and even if you are 100% right (which I personally believe), people are going to question your stance. You are very welcome to edit here, but pay attention to the principle of NPOV</i>". Also Miskin you wrote "<i>What those people intentionally ignore, is that their language artificially broke off Bulgarian after Tito's reforms at the end of WW2</i>", thanks for clarifying your idiocy, at least now I know, for anybody who actually believes that is hiding from the truth, so keep telling yourself we are artificial if it makes you feel better, while you are at it you might want to take a look at what was written about Greece and its peoples/languages/religions at the time of independence, or wait a minute, you may be one of those Greeks that actually believes you are a direct descendant of Pericles. "<i>And for crying out loud, if there really was some remote connection between Slavs and the known ancient word, would we really be expecting the Macedonian Slav scholars to discover it? Slavic intellectuality has an unbroken history of some 1000 years while Russian literature has dominated the international scene in the modern era, would the rest of the Slavs expect a 15-year old country with an artificial language and nationality to make new discoveries on the origins of the Slavic language?? That in my book is regarded as extremism not worthy of any attention</i>" Miskin you have nothing to offer, and your insults are rather pathetic but expected from an idiot like you. Do you not see how your childish ignorance blinds you? So even if ethnic Macedonians did discover an authentic link between Slavic and ancient Macedonian, you would not take is as the truth? Of course not, because there is much that you avoid and will continue to do so. Historic opinions do change with the uncovering of evidences, and if you honestly believe that this is all straightforward and it can be nothing other than Greek, Greek, Greek, then you are sadly mistaken, or just plain sad. How long did they think the world was flat before they realised it wasn't? The truth will come out you leech, rest assured the Macedonian nation lives. As for the person who changes his name everyday, Alex or Decius or whatever, the one who deep down probably believes that Romanians are ancient Macedonians, you should have maintained your respect towards me as I did towards you. It amazes me how people such as yourself and that Miska have so much to say about the Slavonic peoples yet neither of you are Slavs. All these cognates yet they are all somehow discredited by you "scolars" or "professors", you were both talking about the bla, bla, bla factor, you two specialise in it. As for the Slavic scholars yet to claim descendency from the ancient Balkan tribes, they already exist, and as time goes by there will be much more, this theory will gain ground because geography and linguistics support it, two important aspects neither of you have a clue about. From my last post till this one, all I saw in between was just ranting, no decent discussion, just the same old waste, i've read posts from both of you here, I didn't expect much from you Miskin for you are after all a racist Greek, Decius, well birds of a feather... <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoldier_of_Macedon_cf7d.html" title="User:Soldier of Macedon">Soldier of Macedon</a> 07:49, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Romanians are not involved in this, and I don't drag them into this. Ancient Macedonians were mostly Hellenized, not Romanized. Romanians arrived to the Macedonian area around 500--900 AD. I'm not a racist. Nor do I have any big problem about your people calling themselves Macedonians, though I had my qualms about it. I credit myself in part, by the way, with having Macedonian Slavs moved to <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonians_%28ethnic_group%29.html" title="Macedonians (ethnic group)">Macedonians (ethnic group)</a>, and I have links that show I greatly influenced this, since an administrator moved the page within 10 minutes of my "ultimatum". I just cannot seriously consider the idea of ancient Macedonian being close to Slavic in any notable degree. It's about linguistics, not genetics. Genetically, I'm probably as much a Slav as you are. As for names, I cannot change my name, though I can pull nice fantasy Latin names out of Latin dictionaries, then get tired of them. Alexander 007 03:04, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

In your case, your ignorance is completely unintentional, you probably believe in every thing you say. Instead of trying to question the validity of the myths you're being fed with, you choose to simply believe that Greeks, Bulgarians and Serbians are "bad, bad, bad" and hate the Slavomacedonian nation as much as anything. Well, that's the easy way.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Next time</span></h2>
<p>Next time a person comes by arguing for a theory of ancient Macedonian being closer to Slavic than Greek, it would be appreciated if such a person has linguistic references to back him up, as well as some more knowledge of the field. Vojnik was not even aware that Phrygian is <i>an attested language</i>, since he incorrectly included it as a language he expected to be close to Slavic. It is not. Alexander 007 05:13, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let it be noted Alex/Decius wrote "and after I read his response, I was considering ignoring him altogether", how very noble of you to reconsider, I am honoured. As for my knowledge, I am a Macedonian, a Balkan Slav with a very resourceful background when it comes to MY language. You made the move to "ethnic Macedonians", I commend you for that, but there was no reasn for you to initiate a slander towards me just because your pal Miskin couldn't get that stick out of his a....All of a sudden every Greek is a historian, only god knows what they'd be saying today had not the British "philhellenes" drawn up a nation for them. Also for the word "ore", as a person who has an interest in linguistics you should know that pronounciation varies according to the speaker, wether from a dialect or a different language altogether. Thus "ore" could also have been pronounced as "hore", thus leading to "gore", the "h" commonly replaced by a "g" or "k" or "ch". There is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that Slavonic "gore" stems from ancient "ore", many here spend more time discrediting a Slavonic link than proving your own.</p>
<p>Here is a list of Slavonic cognates for ancient Macedonian, some Greek cognates are mentioned but not all, just making it clear that they are not deliberatly excluded but used only where I see it as necessary. I am not denying a Hellenic influence in ancient Macedonian, but it is only an influence not an origin. And it is not only these word matches that we rely on, geography tells much of the story too, but that is for another time. Acording to "scholars" neither Illyrian nor ancient Macedonian can be safely concluded as "satem" or "centum" due to the lack of words, so much of the "assumptions" written here by people are just that, assumptions, so let us assume a different position. "<i>Know your enemy</i> and know yourself"-- Sun-tzu's The Art of War, you cannot assume we are wrong when you do not know us. Now you tell me if any are worthy of the list or not, I can see at least five that stand out in deserving a mention.</p>
<p><i>Ancient Macedonian</i></p>
<p><i>Ade, Adraia</i> = upper air, open sky Arija = air</p>
<p><i>Agkalis</i> = weight, sickle, arm Raka = arm Present in Greek in as "Agkalis" meaning "arm".</p>
<p><i>Akrounoi</i> = boundary (stones) Krajina = borderland, boundary The word "Akro" meaning "edge, end" is present also in Greek, the modern Macedonian version is "Kraj". The word is worth mentioning for the suffix of "unoi" is similar to "ina" so thus a likely cognate. Another Slavonic alternative would be "Ukraine", which means the same thing.</p>
<p><i>Aliza, Alixa</i> = alder Jasika = alder Elka = pine tree</p>
<p><i>Garkan</i> = branch, stick Granka = branch</p>
<p><i>Gotan</i> = pig(s) Goida = livestock, cattle, pigs</p>
<p><i>Danon</i> = killer Davi = kill, supress This word is also present in Illyrian as "Daunus", Phrygian as "Davos" and in Greek as "Thanatos". Stemming from indo-european "Dhaw", from where also derives the English "Death".</p>
<p><i>Darron</i> = gift, well thought out present Dar = gift, present This word is also present in Greek as "Doros".</p>
<p><i>Darullos</i> = wood Drvo = wood, timber The Thracian word for "spear" is "Taru" which is also linked. Present in Greek as "Ksileia" or/and "Dokari", and ancient Greek as "Drus".</p>
<p><i>Dorax</i> = spleen Dosada = spleen Also present in Bulgarian as "Dalak".</p>
<p><i>Izela</i> = good luck Vesela = in good spirit, celebrant The word for "good, kind" in Phrygian is "Vaso" and in Illyrian "Ves", thus the reasoning for a likely etymological link.</p>
<p><i>Lakedama</i> = salt-water with garlic Luk = garlic</p>
<p><i>Makisti</i> = pestilence, annoyance, trouble Maki = torment, annoyance, troubles</p>
<p><i>Skoidos</i> = appointed head of the judicial courts Sudo = the court, the case Sudija = the judge</p>
<p><i>Amale</i> = gentle Malo = small, tiny Milo = dear, peaceful Present in modern Greek as "Hamale" or "Hapale".</p>
<p><i>Bere</i> = to gather, bring Bere = gather, carry Also present in Greek as "Phere" and Phrygian as "Ber".</p>
<p><i>Grabion</i> = sort of oak wood Dab = oak wood Also linked is the word "Kreveti" meaning "bed, couch" which is similar in Greek.</p>
<p><i>Hetairoi</i> = comrade, fellow soldier Cheta = military company, group, squad Although not commonly used, the word "Chetar" could be used to refer to a single member of the "Cheta", however more common would be a "Komita" or "Vojnik". Present in modern Greek as "Heteroia" meaning "Company".</p>
<p><i>Kanadoi</i> = jaws Kandzhi = claws In Greek "Gnathos" means jawbone.</p>
<p><i>Oresti</i> = macedonian tribe, mountain dwellers Gore = up, mountain Present in Greek as "oros", in Phrygian as "Oru".</p>
<p><i>Pez</i> = walk Pesh = walk, on foot</p>
<p><i>Prodromoi</i> = scouter, pathfinder Pred = (in) front, ahead Drym = road, path, highway</p>
<p><i>Pudna</i> = southern macedonian place-name, border region Budna = on alert, guard, watchful</p>
<p><i>Sarissa</i> = lance, macedonian pike Zarinka, Zarica = to thrust or pierce into</p>
<p><i>Vedu</i> = air Vozdu = air, breath</p>

<dd>so, which five do "stand out" then? Can we have the reference claiming they are cognates, not just the list? Did it ever occur to you that non-Slavic words get loaned into Slavic? Did it ever occur to you that Slavic is Indo-European, and some cognates may still sound similar in <i>Greek</i> and in Slavic? "prodromos" is pure Greek, and you claim it for Slavic because of <i>drym</i>? That's really funny, because then you're just renaming "Indo-European" to "Slavic". The European Union, then, is really the "Slavic Union", isn't it? And Greeks are really "Greek Slavs"? We had people on <a href="../../../h/i/s/History.html" title="History">history</a>, claiming it was a Slavic word, because in "Macedonian", it is called <i>historija</i>. Since this is the sort of linguistic expertise we have to put up with on Wikipedia, you'll understand that we cannot chat with every person who dumps his opinion of "cognate" on the talkpage.

<dd>I took a long detour trying to find whether ancient Greek <i>oros</i> (mountain) is attested with an initial <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digamma.html" title="Digamma">digamma</a>, which would totally do away with any connection to <i>gore</i> (I indeed found this digamma form listed in my abbreviated Liddel and Scott's, p. 153; it is not shown with an asterisk so I will assume it is attested). Contemplating <i>gotan</i> I remembered some Romanian words, as well as a Bulgarian word. In Romanian, <i><a href="http://dexonline.ro/search.php?cuv=godin&amp;source=" class="external text" title="http://dexonline.ro/search.php?cuv=godin&amp;source=" rel="nofollow">godin</a></i> means 'little pig', as does <i><a href="http://dexonline.ro/search.php?cuv=Godac" class="external text" title="http://dexonline.ro/search.php?cuv=Godac" rel="nofollow">godac</a></i> and <i><a href="http://dexonline.ro/search.php?cuv=Godanac&amp;source" class="external text" title="http://dexonline.ro/search.php?cuv=Godanac&amp;source" rel="nofollow">godânac</a></i> (&lt;Bg. <i>godinak</i>). Interesting "cognate", ancient Macedonian <i>gotan</i> and Romanian <i>godin</i>, but unlike Vojnik I will not jump to a conclusion. It's late in my time-zone, I'll probably continue tomorrow. By the way, <i>drum</i> ("road, path") is also found in Romanian, and its etymology is from Late Latin, in turn from Greek <i>dromos</i>.

<dl>
<dd>are you sure about the <i>woros</i>? According to Pokorny, <i>oros</i> is from <i>ornumi</i> "rise, move" (<span title="Proto-Indo-European language" class="PIE Unicode" style="white-space: nowrap">*h<sub>3</sub>er</span>). Cognates would include <a href="../../../r/i/s/Rishi.html" title="Rishi">rishi</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arse.html" title="Arse">arse</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/m/Irmin.html" title="Irmin">Irmin</a>, <a href="../../../r/h/i/Rhine.html" title="Rhine">Rhine</a>, as well as Slavic <i>reka</i> "river". These are IE cognates, and the word isn't any less Greek because of them (meanings of "mountain, peak" are known from Greek, Germanic, Celtic and Indo-Aryan, not, as far as I can see, for Slavic, so the word is even pronouncedly un-Slavic). The comparison with <i>gore</i> is out of thin air and completely unfounded. Slavic <i>gore</i> is rather cognate to Greek <i>deiros</i> "hill", and maybe <i><a href="../../../b/o/r/Boreas.html" title="Boreas">boreas</a></i>. Just ask for sources, Alexander, you are wasting your time. It is pointless to discuss these things with people with no knowledge of the isoglosses separating Greek from Slavic, they will lump together all sorts of things just because they sound similar. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 10:09, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Vojnik, you are good-intentioned and I apologize for the mean-spirited (indeed, evil; but not racist;) things I said, but linguistics is a science, and we have to go by the books. Nevertheless, I will go through your list eventually. Alexander 007 10:18, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>regarding <i>drym</i>, it's possibly a Greek loan in Slavic, I don't know. Nevertheless, <i>drem</i> was an IE root, and is attested in Slavic. Greek <i>edramon</i> "ran" etc. is possibly directly cognate to Slovenian <i>drmati</i> "shake" and other words; there was a semantic shift from running to shaking, compare English <i>titter</i> (&lt; *<i>di-dra-mi</i>). Again, if there are Slavic words on <i>drm-</i>, that doesn't prove a closer relation, since they are inherited from IE anyway. If you want to prove Slavic elements in Paleo-Balkans languages, you'd need to concentrate on peculiarly Slavic, non-Greek sound-laws (some are listed on <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balto-Slavic_5694.html" title="Balto-Slavic">Balto-Slavic</a>, e.g. <a href="../../../r/u/k/Ruki.html" title="Ruki">ruki</a>) -- good luck. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 12:14, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I took that etymology of <i>drum</i> from here&#160;:<a href="http://soltdm.tripod.com/limbimod/romana/grecrom.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://soltdm.tripod.com/limbimod/romana/grecrom.htm" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>. This linguist is quoting established sources apparently. It's a basic vocab word in Ro., and unless I'm mistaken it's not found in East Slavic or West Slavic (?), possibly just in South Slavic, which reinforces the Vulgar Latin&lt;Greek etymology. Alexander 007 12:29, 12 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>sure, I believe you, and think it is very likely, especially since the meaning of the root changed to "shake" in Slavic. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 15:41, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No problem Alex, apology accepted, as for the words, in your own time, I just wanted to post the words so people such as yourself and others can evaluate them and then let me know your opinion. You know what the ancient words mean, for the modern Macedonian words just attain a Macedonian-English dictionary, they will all be there. A scholars opinion on these words I do not have for scholars today are much like you Dab, they assume without investigating, none of them have even contemplated in giving Slavonic a chance, as if some tribe unknown till the 6th centruy just suddenly appeared occupying almost half of Europe, forgive me if I don't buy that story as you may. Yes I do know that some words may be Greek-loan words or have a common indo-euro origin, I am not claiming them all as Slavonic I was just giving the Slavonic/ancient equivalents. "Prodromos" may be a Greek/Latin word but it exists in Slavonic also via a variant, I was trying to demonstrate a relation but you immediately identified me with another who had posted words such as historija or what not. If you view my posts as the "dumping" of information then that is your prerogative, I call that state ignorance. Here are the five I believe stand out above the rest; Alixa, Garkan, Gotan, Makisti, Skoidos.<a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoldier_of_Macedon_cf7d.html" title="User:Soldier of Macedon">Soldier of Macedon</a> 06:15, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Gotan</i> and <i>goida</i> may well be actual cognates, and it probably has the best chance of being listed once verified; but if listed, it will be listed alongside any close cognates found for that word (also, if listed, I would want to list it both in its contemporary and reconstructed Proto-Slavic form, since we are concerned with older forms). <i>Garkan</i> and <i>granka</i> is interesting, but has yet to be verified. <i>Arija</i>, which you listed earlier besides some ancient Macedonian words, is a lesson for you: it appears to be a loanword from Italian <i>aria</i>, which is from Latin <i>āēra</i>&lt;<i>āēr</i>&lt;ancient Greek <i>aēr</i>, "air". This ancient Greek word according to my reference probably derives from PIE <i>*we-</i>, "to blow". It is not only an Italian loan, but its etymology traces it back to a different root from the ancient Macedonian words, which go back to PIE <i>*aidh-</i>. <i>Arija</i> is found in numerous Slavic languages (such as Bosnian), and the Italian word has entered Romanian as <i>arie</i> and English as <i>aria</i>. I will at the end recap all of this into a list, paralleling yours. Alexander 007 02:15, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I do not rule out the possibility that some ancient Macedonian words could have passed into early Macedonian, but that is a totally different thing from saying that ancient Macedonian was similar to Slavic. But again, one would need a bonafide linguistic source for any modern word claimed to be derived from ancient Macedonian. Alexander 007 02:31, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Getting back to <i>granka</i>, I realized that this word also exists in Romanian as <i><a href="http://dexonline.ro/search.php?cuv=creanga&amp;source=" class="external text" title="http://dexonline.ro/search.php?cuv=creanga&amp;source=" rel="nofollow">creangă</a></i>, "branch"; according to DEX Online, it is a loan from Bulgarian <i>granka</i>. Pokorny notes that it is found in Russian, and the fact that it's found in Russian, Romanian and Bulgarian and probably many other languages makes an ancient Macedonian origin not worth considering. Pokorny gives the root as PIE <i>*gher-</i>, "to stick out". It may be a cognate to the ancient Macedonian word, but I wouldn't get too excited about it, as cognates with similar forms and meanings are a well-known phenomenon. I wouldn't be opposed to listing common Slavic <i>granka</i> in the glossary next to ancient Macedonian <i>garkan</i> (I have it in my notes that it is an ancient Macedonian gloss) once the etymology of anc. Mac. <i>garkan</i> is checked. Alexander 007 05:13, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I was looking in Pokorny under PIE <i>*gwou-</i>, and I didn't find <i>goida</i> (though I'm not saying it's not from that root, it probably is), but I did find ancient Greek <i>boton</i>, "a beast", found mostly in plural, meaning "grazing animals". Since <i>gotan</i> is also considered to probably be from <i>*gwou-</i>, I'm listing <i>boton</i> in the glossary as a cognate, going by references (I can't read German that well, so maybe somebody wants to double-check). By the way, what's Theathenae's source for <i>abagna</i> perhaps being a combination of <i>abos</i> and <i>agnos</i>? Just checking. Alexander 007 05:44, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Alex, for the word "granka", you say it is not worth mentioning due to so much languages using this word, but which languages are they? So far you have provided Bulgarian and Russian, both of which are Slavonic like modern Macedonian, and in Romanian via Bulgarian. Thus meaning it is essentially a Slav word, and is in accordance with my belief of a Slavonic link, unless it is found in other langauges. I see your point for "arija", I was aware that it is common, what about "makisti" and "skoidos"?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The fact that the word is probably common Slavic means I don't expect it to have entered Macedonian from ancient Macedonian, that's what I meant there. But as I stated below that I would agree to list it as a common Slavic (when I said found in other languages, I meant other Slavic languages, and possibly also Hungarian as a loan from Slavic; but it is a Slavic word) cognate, but only once we find what the references have to say about <i>garkan</i>. <i>Makisti</i> is from PIE *<i>mak-</i>, but I don't know about <i>maki</i>. The modern equivalent that you listed for <i>skoidos</i> doesn't look likely to me due to linguistic reasons, but I haven't checked it yet. Alexander 007 06:26, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I can't find an etymology for <i>skoidos</i> (which was also an epithet for <a href="../../../d/i/o/Dionysus.html" title="Dionysus">Dionysus</a>), but a possibility that occured is PIE <i>*skei-</i>, "to separate, discern", but that's just a guess and what's needed are references. <i>Makisti</i> has many Greek cognates, and after considering the ancient Greek cognates (Doric <i>makistos</i>, Attic <i>mekistos</i>; <i>makister</i>, "long and tedious") the root looks pretty certain: PIE <i>*mak-</i>, "long, thin". The meaning change appears to have been "long", "tedious', "torturous". There should be a reference that verifies this, another etymology would surprise me. Alexander 007 06:56, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Maki</i> I assume is equivalent to Serbian <i>muka</i> ("torment") (cf. M. zab, S. zub correspondance), which I assume is from Old Slavonic <i>monka</i> (from which comes Romanian <i>muncǎ</i>, "work"). If that's right, and the modern Macedonian <i>maki</i> derives from an older <i>monka</i>, then it's safe for me to assume no connection to ancient Macedonian <i>makisti</i>, which is cognate to Doric <i>makistos</i>. When dealing with Slavic words, one has to check their older forms in Slavonic before connecting them to even older forms.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't have a reference for this yet, but it's based on what I know of Slavic sound-changes. See Macedonian <i>zab</i> ("tooth", equivalent to Serbian <i>zub</i>) from Old Slavonic <i>zonbu</i> (zonb--zob--zab; compare to monk--mok--mak). Call it a guess.
