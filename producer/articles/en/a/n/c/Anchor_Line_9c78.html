<p>The company was founded in 1859 as the "<a href="../../../m/e/m/Memphis%2C_Tennessee_649e.html" title="Memphis, Tennessee">Memphis</a> and St. Louis Packet Line," principally providing service to these two cities and points in between. Two years after the line was founded, the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> broke out. Whereas many steamboat owners were forced to cease operations at the outbreak of hostilities, the Memphis and St. Louis Packet Line managed to remain in business by operating on the parts of the Mississippi River occupied by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_%28American_Civil_War%29_fad6.html" title="Union (American Civil War)">Union</a> forces. By the spring of <a href="../../../1/8/6/1862.html" title="1862">1862</a>, this included all parts of the River as far south as Memphis. One year later, all ports on the river except for <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vicksburg%2C_Mississippi_ea1a.html" title="Vicksburg, Mississippi">Vicksburg, Mississippi</a>, and <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Hudson%2C_Louisiana_aa2c.html" title="Port Hudson, Louisiana">Port Hudson, Louisiana</a>, were under Federal control. On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_4.html" title="July 4">4 July</a> <a href="../../../1/8/6/1863.html" title="1863">1863</a>, Union forces under <a href="../../../u/l/y/Ulysses_S._Grant_1b52.html" title="Ulysses S.

Pemberton">John C. Pemberton</a> to surrender Vicksburg, and the next day, Port Hudson surrendered, leaving the river open to commercial steamboat traffic.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/7/1874.html" title="1874">1874</a>, the company adopted the giant <a href="../../../a/n/c/Anchor.html" title="Anchor">anchor</a> as its symbol (and presumably changed its name at that date). In any case, by the mid-<a href="../../../1/8/7/1870s.html" title="1870s">1870s</a> it was known as the "Anchor Line." The anchor was prominently hung between the two tall <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smokestack.html" title="Smokestack">smokestacks</a> on each of its boats. It was also included as a logo on the furnishings of many of its boats, including the chairs manufactured for the boats' cabins.</p>

<p>By the early <a href="../../../1/8/8/1880s.html" title="1880s">1880s</a>, the company had acquired sufficient enough <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital.html" title="Capital">capital</a> to justify the building of several new steamboats. Almost all of these boats were built by the Howard Shipbuilding Company of <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeffersonville%2C_Indiana_a65e.html" title="Jeffersonville, Indiana">Jeffersonville, Indiana</a>. The Anchor Line spared no expense on the building of these boats, which became veritable floating <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palace.html" title="Palace">palaces</a> of the late American <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_era.html" title="Victorian era">Victorian era</a>. Between <a href="../../../1/8/8/1880.html" title="1880">1880</a> and <a href="../../../1/8/8/1887.html" title="1887">1887</a>, the Anchor Line built no fewer than ten of these extravagant steamboats, which averaged each about 275 feet (83.33 meters) in length from <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bow_%28ship%29.html" title="Bow (ship)">bow</a> to <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stern.html" title="Stern">stern</a> and about 45 feet (13.64 meters) in width. In contrast to the common practice of naming steamboats after people or after some pleasant-sounding idea, feeling, or animal, the Anchor Line chose to name these craft after cities along its route. The first of these to be built was the <i>Belle Memphis</i>, which after it steamed out of St. Louis in early <a href="../../../1/8/8/1881.html" title="1881">1881</a> and first docked at Memphis, was presented by the city with a gift of a set of flags.</p>
<p>Most of these boats survived the common disasters that were known to plague Mississippi River steamboats at the time, such as <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire.html" title="Fire">fire</a>, <a href="../../../s/n/a/Snag.html" title="Snag">snags</a> (large sticks or branches in the river bed that would often tear holes in boats' hulls), <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice.html" title="Ice">ice</a>, grounding on <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandbar.html" title="Sandbar">sandbars</a>, and so forth to remain in service with the Anchor Line from the day they were built until the company went out of business in 1898. One of them, the <i>City of Providence</i>, built for the Anchor Line in 1880, was sold when the Anchor Line was liquidated and was then operated by various excursion companies until it was finally destroyed by ice in January <a href="../../../1/9/1/1910.html" title="1910">1910</a>, some twenty-nine years after it was first put into service.</p>

<p>The Mississippi River proved throughout the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nineteenth_century.html" title="Nineteenth century">nineteenth century</a> to be a volatile and sometimes hazardous or unnavigable road for boat traffic. Despite the best efforts of the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Army_Corps_of_Engineers_c3d0.html" title="U.S. Army Corps of Engineers">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</a>, high water would swallow landings, making many smaller stops for unavailable for stops by steamboats. Likewise, low water would strand these towns far from any suitable site for boats to land (or, conversely, strand steamboats at landings in water with no outlet to a navigable channel), and increase the possibility that hazards such as snags would pierce steamboats' hulls. Floods, such as the great Flood of 1892 (during which all of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concordia_Parish%2C_Louisiana_9590.html" title="Concordia Parish, Louisiana">Concordia Parish, Louisiana</a>, was said to be underwater), could destroy crops that would comprise a sizable portion of the cargo transported by steamboats such as those of the Anchor Line, thus also cutting off a sizable portion of the steamboats' business. The early 1890s, particularly <a href="../../../1/8/9/1892.html" title="1892">1892</a> and <a href="../../../1/8/9/1894.html" title="1894">1894</a>, seem to have been years where conditions on the river significantly affected the Anchor Line's business.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/c/Anchor_Line_9c78.html" title="Edit section: Competition From Railroads">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Competition From Railroads</span></h4>
<p>Added to the problems inherent with river traffic was the increasingly expanding <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railroad.html" title="Railroad">railroad</a> network in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, which soon came into direct competition with steamboats for business, both from passengers and from cargo. Rail travel was not subject to the dictates of the river's course (tracks could be laid on ground virtually anywhere in the Mississippi valley), servicing directly more towns than any steamboat could. <a href="../../../t/r/a/Train.html" title="Train">Trains</a> were generally safer than steamboats, as well, being not prone to snags, sandbars, ice, or other problems particular to river travel. Finally, trains were faster, as they generally traveled much quicker than the 15 mph (24.3 km/h) averaged by late-nineteenth-century Anchor Line boats.</p>
<p><a name="The_1896_Tornado" id="The_1896_Tornado"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/c/Anchor_Line_9c78.html" title="Edit section: The 1896 Tornado">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The 1896 Tornado</span></h4>
<p>Historians say that the Anchor Line was ultimately doomed by the disastrous <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis-East_St._Louis_Tornado_27f3.html" title="St. Louis-East St. Louis Tornado">St. Louis-East St. Louis Tornado</a> that struck on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_27.html" title="May 27">27 May</a> <a href="../../../1/8/9/1896.html" title="1896">1896</a>. The <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tornado.html" title="Tornado">tornado</a>, which was the third large tornado to hit the area that day, wreaked a similar amount of destruction as the other two. It touched down in the core of the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City.html" title="City">city</a> and sweeping eastward across the river into <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_St._Louis%2C_Illinois_82ad.html" title="East St. Louis, Illinois">East St. Louis, Illinois</a>, at which point it became smaller in size but more intense. In all, the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_toll.html" title="Death toll">death toll</a> from the tornado stands at a confirmed 255 people, though estimates put the number at close to 400. This is in part due to the fact that the Anchor Line's floating palaces (as well as other steamboats) stationed at the St. Louis landing lay directly in the tornado's path. The Anchor Line's the <i>Arkansas City</i> and the <i>City of Cairo</i> were completely destroyed, and the <i>City of Monroe</i> was badly damaged. It is hypothesized that people on the boats at the time were dumped into the river and ultimately drowned, but since their bodies have probably never been found there is no way to add them accurately into the tornado's death toll.</p>
<p>The company did not give up, however. The same year of the disaster, it launched another boat, the <i>Bluff City</i>. In <a href="../../../1/8/9/1897.html" title="1897">1897</a>, the Anchor Line repaired, extended, and installed electric lights on the <i>City of Monroe</i>, renaming it the <i>Hill City</i>. It even issued a 22-page brochure, entitled <i>A Romantic Trip to the Sunny South</i>, in an attempt to lure passengers from the frigid Midwest down to the lower river, probably during <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mardi_Gras_092d.html" title="Mardi Gras">Mardi Gras</a> season. Nonetheless, that same year the <i>Bluff City</i> was destroyed by fire, and another of the Anchor Line's boats, the <i>City of Hickman</i> sank. The disasters ultimately proved too costly for the Anchor Line to weather, and in 1898 it sold off its remaining boats and ceased operations.</p>

<p>The Anchor Line served most cities between St. Louis and New Orleans, as well as many smaller landings on occasion or by special request of passengers. Main landings probably included <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cairo%2C_Illinois_9d7b.html" title="Cairo, Illinois">Cairo, Illinois</a>; <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Madrid%2C_Missouri_383c.html" title="New Madrid, Missouri">New Madrid, Missouri</a>; <a href="../../../h/i/c/Hickman%2C_Kentucky_173f.html" title="Hickman, Kentucky">Hickman, Kentucky</a>; Memphis; <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helena%2C_Arkansas_939f.html" title="Helena, Arkansas">Helena, Arkansas</a>; <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenville%2C_Mississippi_76e8.html" title="Greenville, Mississippi">Greenville, Mississippi</a>; Vicksburg; <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natchez%2C_Mississippi_c113.html" title="Natchez, Mississippi">Natchez, Mississippi</a> (and <a href="../../../v/i/d/Vidalia%2C_Louisiana_6d74.html" title="Vidalia, Louisiana">Vidalia, Louisiana</a>, across the river); Bayou Sara, Louisiana; <a href="../../../b/a/t/Baton_Rouge%2C_Louisiana_6596.html" title="Baton Rouge, Louisiana">Baton Rouge, Louisiana</a>; <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donaldsonville%2C_Louisiana_92f4.html" title="Donaldsonville, Louisiana">Donaldsonville, Louisiana</a>; and New Orleans.

<p>Beginning in 1880, all newly-built Anchor Line Boats were side-wheelers, meaning they each had two large paddewheels located on the starboard and port side of the boat, located about two-thirds of the way back from the prow. The lone exception was the <i>Bluff City</i>, which for some unknown reason was a stern-wheeler. Side-wheelers had proved to be faster than stern-wheelers, and more easy to maneuver.</p>

Stood for public inspection in Cincinnati on 21 January 1871, where an estimated 45,000 visitors boarded the boat. Bought from Pegram by the Anchor Line in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1878.html" title="1878">1878</a>. The boat could carry 3,200 tons, as evidenced by the cargo she transported on one trip in January 1881.
