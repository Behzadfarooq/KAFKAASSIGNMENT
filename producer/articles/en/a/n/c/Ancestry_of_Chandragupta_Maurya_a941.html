<p>The chronological establishment of Indian history has been a matter of academic contention for the past two centuries. The most difficult part of this study, until now, was to construct an agreeable framework of chronology. It is to the credit of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Jones_%28philologist%29_586a.html" title="William Jones (philologist)">Sir William Jones</a> that a systematic study and examination of this problem was first initiated in the late 18th century. Western scholars have done commendable and untiring work in the field of oriental studies. The researches well-recorded by them are of utmost importance even today<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>However, within decades, the political situation in India changed and this sincere study of history then became, in a way, a weapon to subjugate and win the people of India. The effects of European religio-political thought also crept into this investigation. In spite of the honest and genuine commencement of its study, it is quite unfortunate that the western indologists misinterpreted the historical data available, intentionally or by accident, and putforth theories based merely on speculation and pre-conceived beliefs. The result was that the antiquity of many events were highly underestimated and its continuity and greatness undermined. Nevertheless, it is quite futile to harp over the numerous shortcomings of early historical research, the mistakes of an era bygone.</p>
<p>A result of these biases was that even scholars like Sir William Jones could not believe in the antiquity of the Bharata War. This may also be because of his Christian faith which told him that Creation took place at 9-00 a. m, on 23rd October 4004 BC Similar were the impressions of other Britishers. They did not believe in the veracity of Indian history books. Their bias prohibited the Christians from accepting the antiquity of the Indian nation. Arthur A. McDonnell wrote, "Early India wrote no history because it never made any. The ancient Indians never went through a struggle for life like the Greeks, the Persians and the Romans. Secondly, the Brahmanas early embraced the doctrine that all action and existence are a positive evil and could therefore have felt but little inclination to chronicle historical events." All these Britishers looked from their own glasses. Their nation came into being after struggle for life and when they first got the rule of a single political power. Later, they propagated that India is a nation in making since the advent of the Britishers and their establishing a single political rule in this country.</p>
<p>Later scholars took this identity of Sandrokottas with Chandragupta Maurya as proved and carried on further research. James Princep, an employee of the East India Company, deciphered the Brahmi script and was able to read the inscriptions of Piyadassana. Turnour, another employee of the Company in Ceylon, found in the Ceylonese chronicles that Piyadassana was used as a surname of Asoka, the grandson of Chandragupta Maurya. The inscription bearing the name of Asoka was not found till the time of Turnour. In 1838, Princep found five names of the Yona kings in Asoka's inscriptions and identified them as the five Greek kings near Greece belonging to third century BC who were contemporary to Asoka.</p>

<ul>
<li>"The Greek records mention the kings before and after Sandracottus to be Xandramas and Sandrocyptus<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. The kings before and after Chandragupta Maurya were: Mahapadma Nanda and Bindusar. The kings before and after Chandragupta Gupta were: Chandramas and Samudragupta. The phonetic similarity is quite apparent for Chandragupta Gupta and not Maurya."</li>
</ul>
<p>On the contrary, Strabo properly identifies both Sandragupta and his son <a href="../../../b/i/n/Bindusara.html" title="Bindusara">Bindusara</a> "Amitragata" (Slayer of Enemies), and connects them to the 3rd century ambassadors Megasthenes and Deimakos sent to their courts:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Both of these men were sent ambassadors to Palimbothra (Pataliputra): <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megasthenes.html" title="Megasthenes">Megasthenes</a> to Sandrocottus ("Chnadragupta"), <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deimakos.html" title="Deimakos">Deimakos</a> to Allitrochades ("Amitragata") his son" (Strabo II, I, 9)<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>.</dd>
<dd>I don't find this mentioned in the reference given above.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also Plutarch directly connects Chandragupta to Alexander himself:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Androcottus, when he was a stripling, saw Alexander himself, and we are told that he often said in later times that Alexander narrowly missed making himself master of the country, since its king was hated and despised on account of his baseness and low birth." Plutarch 62-3<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"Greek records are silent about important figures like: Chanakya, Ashoka (kingdom much bigger than his Grandfather Chandragupta's.)"</li>
<li>"Greek records do not clearly mention the presence Buddhist monks who were very common in Maurya time".</li>
</ul>
<p>There are actually many Greek accounts of <a href="../../../s/r/a/Sramana.html" title="Sramana">sramanas</a> which are thought to correspond to them. "Well the above points says that there wasn't much mention of sramana's in India during Alexander period. Of course by then Buddhism had spread to Greece and several other places and the mention of sramana in other context doesn't disprove the above point."</p>
<ul>
<li>"Inscription on a Greek Tomb: "Here lies Indian Sramanacharya, Shakya monk from Bodh Gaya". Sramanacharya went to Greece with his Greek pupils. The tomb marks his death about 1000 B.C. Which means Buddha existed before 1000 BC."<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></li>

<p>The exact circumstances of this event are connected to 10 CE instead. <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicolaus_of_Damascus_5ee6.html" title="Nicolaus of Damascus">Nicolaus of Damascus</a> is famous for his account of an <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embassy.html" title="Embassy">embassy</a> sent by an Indian king "named Pandion (<a href="../../../p/a/n/Pandyan_kingdom.html" title="Pandyan kingdom">Pandyan kingdom</a>?) or, according to others, <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porus.html" title="Porus">Porus</a>" to <a href="../../../c/a/e/Caesar_Augustus_565f.html" title="Caesar Augustus">Caesar Augustus</a> around <a href="../../../1/3/_/13.html" title="13">13 CE</a>.

A tomb was made to the "Sarmano", still visible in the time of <a href="../../../p/l/u/Plutarch.html" title="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>, which bore the mention "ΖΑΡΜΑΝΟΧΗΓΑΣ ΙΝΔΟΣ ΑΠΟ ΒΑΡΓΟΣΗΣ" (Zarmanochēgas indos apo Bargosēs – The <i>sramana</i> master from <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bharuch.html" title="Bharuch">Barygaza</a> in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>).</p>
<p>Almost all of the ancient Greek works was lost because of the incidents like fire in the library of Alexandira and just because the mode of storing the knowledge was perishable. This is in stark contrast with much of ancient Indian work, which was in sanskrit and had to memorized from one generation to the next. There was no contradiction in the works from different parts of the country. The works attributed to Strabo, etc. are translations from the later work in Arabic and hence a lot got mixed into the actual facts. To analyze linguistically based on that is more than a streatch.</p>

<li>"The names of contemporary kings found on <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edicts_of_Ashoka_b2a5.html" title="Edicts of Ashoka">Ashokan inscriptions</a> are Amtiyoka, Tulamaya, etc. Amtiyoka ruled Afghanistan around 1475 BC, which then appears to be the approximate date of Ashoka.

<p>According to the Greek accounts, Xandrammes was deposed by Sandrokottas and Sandrocyptus was the son of Sandrokottas. In the case of Chandragupta Maurya, he had opposed Dhanananda of the Nanda dynasty and the name of his son was Bindusara. Both these names, Dhanananda and Bindusara, have no phonetic similarity with the names Xandrammes and Sandrocyptus of the Greek accounts.</p>
<p>In the Greek accounts, we find the statements of the Greek and Roman writers belonging to the period from 4th century BC to 2nd century AD None of them have mentioned the names of Kautilya or Asoka. Kautilya's work on polity is an important document of lndia's mastery on this subject. It was with his assistance that Chandragupta had come to the throne. Asoka's empire was bigger than that of Chandragupta and he had sent missionaries to the so-called Yavana countries. But both of them are not mentioned. Colebrook has pointed out that the Greek writers did not say anything about the Buddhist Bhikkus though that was the flourishing religion of that time with the royal patronage of Asoka. Roychaudhari also wonders why the Greek accounts are silent on Buddhism.</p>

<p>Some Indian literary traditions connect him with the Nanda <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynasty.html" title="Dynasty">dynasty</a> of <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magadha.html" title="Magadha">Magadha</a>. The <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> drama Mudrarakashasa not only calls him Mauryaputra (Act II) but also a Nandanvaya (Act IV). Dhundiraja, a commentator of 18th century on Mudrarakshas states that Chandragupta was son of <i>Maurya</i> who in turn, was son of the Nanda king Sarvarthasiddhi by a wife named Mura, daughter of a Vrishala (<a href="../../../s/h/u/Shudra.html" title="Shudra">shudra</a>). Mudrarakshas especially uses terms like <i>kula-hina</i> and <i>Vrishala</i> for Chandragupta's lineage. This reinforces <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junianus_Justinus_fb22.html" title="Junianus Justinus">Justin</a>'s contention that Chandragupta had a humble origin <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup>. On the other hand, the same play describes the Nandas as of Prathita-kula i.e illustrious lineage. The commentator on the Vishnu Purana informs us that Chandragupta was son of a <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nanda_dynasty.html" title="Nanda dynasty">Nanda</a> prince and a <i>dasi</i> (<a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a>:maid), <b>Mura</b>. Pandit Kshmendra and Somadeva call him Purvananda-suta, son of genuine Nanda as opposed to Yoga-Nanda i.e pseudo Nanda.</p>

<p>Other literary traditions imply that Chandragupta was raised by <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peacock.html" title="Peacock">peacock</a>-tamers (<a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>: <i>Mayura-Poshakha</i>), which earned him the <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurya.html" title="Maurya">Maurya</a> <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epithet.html" title="Epithet">epithet</a>. Both the <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist.html" title="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> as well as <a href="../../../j/a/i/Jain.html" title="Jain">Jaina</a> traditions testify to the supposed connection between the Moriya (Maurya) and Mora or Mayura (<i>Peacock</i>). While the Buddhist tradition describes him as the son of the chief of the Peacock clan (Moriya), the <a href="../../../j/a/i/Jain.html" title="Jain">Jaina</a> tradition on the other hand, refers to him as the maternal grandson of the headman of the village of peacock tamers (Moraposaga)<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup>. This view suggests a degraded background of Chandragupta. (The same Jain tradition also describes Nanda as the son of a barber by a courtesan).</p>
<p>According to some scholars, there are some monumental evidence connecting the Mauryas with peacocks. The pillar of <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashoka.html" title="Ashoka">Ashoka</a> in Nandangarh bears on its bottom the figures of a peacock which is repeated in many sculptures of Ashoka at <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanchi.html" title="Sanchi">Sanchi</a> <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup>. According to Turnour<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup>, Buddhist tradition also testifies to the connection between Moriya and Mora or Mayura or peacock. <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claudius_Aelianus_ac92.html" title="Claudius Aelianus">Aelian</a> informs us that tame peacocks were kept in the parks of the Maurya palace at <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pataliputra.html" title="Pataliputra">Pataliputra</a>. But scholars like Foucher <sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> do not regard these birds as a sort of canting badge for the dynasty of Mauryas. They prefer to imagine in them a possible allusion to the Mora Jataka. Moreover, besides the peacocks, there were also other birds like pheasants, parrots as well as a variety of fishes etc also kept in the parks and water pools of the Mauryas.</p>

<p>There is school of scholars like B.M. Barua, Dr J.W. McCrindle, Dr D.B. Spooner, Dr H.C. Seth, Dr Hari Ram Gupta, Dr Ranajit Pal and others who connect Chandragupta (Sandrokottos) to the north-western frontiers.</p>
<p>B.M. Barua calls him a man of <a href="../../../u/t/t/Uttarapatha.html" title="Uttarapatha">Uttarapatha</a> or <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gandhara.html" title="Gandhara">Gandhara</a> if not exactly of Taksashila<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Based on <a href="../../../p/l/u/Plutarch.html" title="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>'s evidence, Dr J.W. McCrindle and Dr H. R. Gupta write that Chandragupta Maurya was a <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punjabi.html" title="Punjabi">Punjabi</a> and belonged to the <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashvaka.html" title="Ashvaka">Ashvaka</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/s/Assakenois.html" title="Assakenois">Assakenoi</a>) territory <sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/p/p/Appian.html" title="Appian">Appian</a> of Alexandria (95CE-165CE), author of a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman</a> History attests that 'Antrokottos (Chandragupta), the king of the Indians, dwelt on river <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indus.html" title="Indus">Indus</a>'.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[22]</a></sup> This reference also seems to indicate that Chandragupta belonged to north-west rather than East India.</p>
<p>These scholars relate Sandrocottos (or Androcottos) with Sisicottos of the Classical writings. Sisicottos was the ruler of Paropamisos (<a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindukush.html" title="Hindukush">Hindukush</a>) who had helped <a href="../../../b/e/s/Bessus.html" title="Bessus">Bessus</a> of <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bactria.html" title="Bactria">Bactria</a> against <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander</a> but later co-operated with the latter throughout the <a href="../../../s/o/g/Sogdian.html" title="Sogdian">Sogdian</a> campaigns <sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[23]</a></sup>. During Alexander's campaign of <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabol.html" title="Kabol">Kabol</a> and <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swat_River_816b.html" title="Swat River">Swat</a> valleys, prince Sisicottos had rendered great service to Alexander in reducing several principalities of the <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashvakas.html" title="Ashvakas">Ashvakas</a>. During war of rock-fort of <a href="../../../a/o/r/Aornos.html" title="Aornos">Aornos</a>, where Alexander faced stiff resistance from the tribals, Sisicottos was put in command of this fort of great strategical importance. <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrian.html" title="Arrian">Arrian</a> calls Sisicottos the governor of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assakenois.html" title="Assakenois">Assakenois</a>. It is however not quite clear if this Sisicottos was same as Sandrocottos or if they were brothers or else they were related in someway. Dr J. W. McCrindle and Dr H. R. Gupta think that <i>they both possibly belonged two different branches of the Ashvakas</i> <sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[24]</a></sup>. Meri was probably another political centre of the <i>Mor</i> or Meros people. It is asserted by scholars of this school that the name Moriya or Maurya comes from the <b>Mor</b> (Modern name <i>Koh-i-Mor</i> i.e <i>Mor hill</i>---the ancient <b>Meros</b> of the classical writings) located in the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paropamisadae.html" title="Paropamisadae">Paropamisadae</a> region between river <a href="../../../k/u/n/Kunar_River_530f.html" title="Kunar River">Kunar</a> and <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swat_River_816b.html" title="Swat River">Swat</a> in the land of <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashvakas.html" title="Ashvakas">Ashvakas</a> (q.v.). It is pointed out that since Chandragupta Maurya belonged to Mor (Meros of classical writings) hence he <i>was called Moriya or Maurya after his motherland</i>. <sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[25]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is notable that Adiparva of Mahabharata (verses 1/67/13-14) also seem to connect Maurya Ashoka with the Ashvakas.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>Dr Spooner observes: <i>"After Alexander's death, when Chandragupta marched on <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magadha.html" title="Magadha">Magadha</a>, it was with largely the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> army (<b>Shaka-Yavana-Kamboja-Parasika-Bahlika</b>) that he won the throne of India. The testimony of the Mudrarakshasa is explicit on this point, and we have no reason to doubt its accuracy in matter of this kind"</i> <sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[28]</a></sup>. Thus, Dr Spooner's comments also point to the north-western origin of the Mauryas.</p>
<p>It is however interesting to see that the scholars also identify the <i><a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashvakas.html" title="Ashvakas">Ashvakas</a></i> as a branch of the <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kambojas.html" title="Kambojas">Kambojas</a>. They were so-called since they were specialised in <i>horse-profession</i> and their services as <i>cavalrymen</i> were frequently requisitioned in ancient wars.</p>
