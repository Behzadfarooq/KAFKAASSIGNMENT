The following is a discussion that <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Martin_ab83.html" title="User:Paul Martin">Paul Martin</a> and I had been having under the title <i><a href="../../../a/n/c/Talk%7EAncient_Roman_units_of_measurement_f8af.html#Impossible_precision" title="Talk:Ancient Roman units of measurement">Impossible precision</a></i> on the <i><a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Roman_units_of_measurement_ca80.html" title="Ancient Roman units of measurement">Ancient Roman units of measurement</a></i> talk page. It came about when I suggested that 25 mm exactly would be a better redefinition of the inch than Paul's suggested 25.4016 mm i.e. 7<sup>2</sup> x 5<sup>2</sup> x 3<sup>4</sup> x 2<sup>8</sup> nanometres. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimp_bb44.html" title="User:Jimp">Jimp</a> 16Dec05</p>

<dd>You want to have a "new inch" of 25.000&#160;mm exactly one&#160;!???&#160; &#160; — &#160; Impossibly, wholly unimaginable&#160;!<br />
In science the English inch is depreciated in the world entire since many decades. There is not the problem. But in technical fields, the English inch is always omnipresent.<br />
<b>Now, you want to let fabricate nuts and bolts in a new inch, which would be quite 125/127 of the "old inch".</b> Latter one would be exactly one 1.6&#160;% more than your new one.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The new hexadecimal metric system</span></h2>
<dl>
<dd><b>PS.</b> The decimal meter is, since 200 years, the predominant system. Since many decades it is – <i>and for good reasons</i> – prevalent in science.&#160; Not any longer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Soon, the new <b>hexadecimal metric system</b> – I really have this conviction – will replace this "poor <b>decimal</b> metric system", which has not even conserved the – certainly more than 5000 years old – foot measure.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At the moment, this <i>(not so new)</i> proposal <i>(it dates of the year 1989)</i> has not the right to be presented. Not even in Wikipedia.<br /></dd>
<dd>Because its inventor, a friend of mine, – especially in France where he lives – is dashed by the probably the most insolent censorship since <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galileo_Galilei_17f8.html" title="Galileo Galilei">Galilei</a>. <b>In France</b> because since more than 200 years, the long-cherished "decimal metric system" <b>is a kind of</b> "<b>state religion</b>", inspired by the celebrated and adored "Goddess Reason" of the French Revolution times herself.<br />
It's <i>not</i> fortuity, if the <i><b>official devise</b></i> of the decimal meter system is: "<i><b>For every people and for always.</b></i>"&#160; <i>(Very poor dreamers!)</i> &#160; However: "Vive la République!"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The foot of hexadecimal metric system has two definitions.</i> A scientific one (since 1990) and a technical one (since 2003). Both differ by about 0.0054&#160;%.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The scientific hexadecimal foot is defined: 19.109&#160;257&#160;m / 64. You can get the result by your hand-held calculator.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This, because the mayor radius of planet Earth, according to <a href="../../../w/g/s/WGS84_5dda.html" title="WGS84">WGS84</a>, is 6,378,137&#160;meters. Multiplied by the number pi, then divided per 1024 twice and rounded appropriated to six right-sided decimals gives: 19.109&#160;257&#160;m exactly one. <i>(19,109,257 is a prime number!)</i> This is the modern 64-feet chain. The sixteenth part of the modern hexadecimal foot is the so-called "universal digit". The half of the circumference of Earth <i>(little more than 20,037.5&#160;km)</i> divided three times by 1024: So, the "universal digit" measures about 18.6614 millimeters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The "technical hexadecimal digit" <i>(for uses outside of scientific and extremely high-level accuracy fields)</i> accepts a little error of about +&#160;0.0054&#160;% to measure 18.66<i><b>2</b></i>4&#160;mm <i>exactly one</i>. Because a defined universal "technical foot" of 1728 x 0.1728 = 298.5984&#160;mm better matches with the 5000 years old measuring system. <b>Thus the "technical hexadecimal foot" is defined to be <i>twelve power six</i> multiplied by <i>ten power minus seven</i> SI meter exactly one.</b> A <a href="../../../h/e/x/Hexadecimal_time.html" title="Hexadecimal time">hexadecimal time format</a> also exists, for uniting finally, space–time in the same frame of reference, in the modern "base sixteen". Man has not in vain "two thumbs and eight <i>other</i> fingers".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>I send an S.O.S. into the world entire</b> <i>(and especially to its the <b>English spoken part</b>)</i>, if there are not <i>at least</i> one serious media or publication, who dares to break the iniquitous censorship, to which my friend Michael and his scientific works underlies in France, the self-called "country of the Human Rights". I know, since almost 15 years Michael tempted without success to publish his researches and proposals in French medias. But in the eyes of <i>the French establishment,</i> "nothing can be better, superior then the French decimal meter system". So, any other serious proposal <i><b>can not exist</b></i>. But, I think so, the Anglo-saxon world is not so narrow-minded regarding this topo. At least I hope it.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">New feet and new inches</span></h2>
<p>Paul,</p>
<p>"Jimp's new inch standard" ... ha-haa, yes, but I'm afraid I'd be rather too late to be given that honour. Though perhaps I might have a chance at having my name attached to a certain decimal foot i.e. ten of these inches; a quarter of a metre; closer to the average length of an adult foot than 36 or even 35 barleycorns.</p>
<p>In fact being a quarter of a metre, this would fit nicely into a hexidecimal metric system. There's a third hexidecimal foot for you ... though, of course, this doesn't fit into your scheme of dividing the Earth's circumference but it does give a nice interger conversion to the current metric system.</p>
<p>No, you suggest dividing the Earth's circumference up by powers of two: a laudable plan but let me remind you of something. When they devised the metric system they had a system of decimal divisions of the arc to go along with it. The latter has been discarded and poeple still use nautical miles as a rival to the kilometre.</p>
<p>There's another possible base unit for you: 1024<sup>th</sup> of a nautical mile. But you really would have to settle on one hexidecimal foot. Having one scientific one and a different technical one would be a nightmare. This is one advantage of the metric system: it's unambiguous.</p>
<p>However if we're going to have a hexidecimal system, why not base 32 instead? 1024 is already used extensively in computing as a mulitplier. 32 is the square root of 1024. Of course, if my new foot causes aeroplanes to crash will your hexidecimal foot do any better?</p>
<p>I was ignoring such difficulties but ain't it about time the we all metricate anyway ...&#160;;-&gt;&#160;? The problems you mention about the 25 mm inch are problems of metrication. May nations and industries have metricised successfully. The problems are, admittedly, worsened because the new unit has the same name as the old one.</p>
<p>Anyway this is all well and good but what are the chances that any of these inovations of ours will ever be adopted on a large scale? I don't share your optimism on this. As I see it, the (decimal) metric system will continue to gain ground and eventually completely replace English units. You say "in technical fields, the English inch is always omnipresent." This may be true in North America &amp; perhaps the British Isles but it's not the case universally.</p>

<ul>
<li><i><b>Forget the nautical mile&#160;!</b></i> This is a wayward measure. It is great time to abolish it for ever&#160;! Dishonour for us that we always use this measure. It corresponds to nothing&#160;! It's a scholar example for the bad contemporary standards. <i><b>The theoretical value of this unit is 40,000,000 / 360 = 1851.<font style="text-decoration: overline">851</font>&#160;m.</b></i> Then, metre rounded to 1852, one adds exactly one 0.008&#160;%. You can calculate yourself at which latitude this definition is correct. Fine&#160;! The former GB Admiralty Mile and the Old U.S. nautical mile definitions were quite better. Both can be considered, rightly, to be "<b>nautical <i>submarine</i> miles</b>", upon condition that you find a U-boat going to depths of about 24,000&#160;ft.<br />
<i>But there is a second reason:</i> Why do you want that somebody who builts a new hexadecimal system, first divide the hexadecimal degree (=&#160;11° 15') into 675 parts?? This would signify, that the "twice sixteen hexadecimal hours a day" and its corresponding meridians would be, each one, shared first into 0x2A3 or 675 parts, before continue with the hexadecimal divisions&#160;!?? This proposal did <i>not</i> seem me to be consistent, sorry. <i>(Cf. <a href="http://www.hexadecimal.free.fr/" class="external text" title="http://www.hexadecimal.free.fr/" rel="nofollow">The hexadecimal Earthgrid.</a>)</i><br />
You wrote at this topo too: "<i>How about we make the Roman foot 296.32 mm exactly then ten Roman stadions will be exactly one international nautical mile?</i>"&#160; Yes, that's correct, since one Roman stadium is 10,000&#160;Roman digits, the Roman stadion with a digit of 296.32&#160;mm would give 1852&#160;m exactly one. But, any "international nautical mile" of 1852&#160;m (1/21,600 Earth circumference superior equal to 1855.325&#160;m) is only 99.82&#160;%, just "out of range". <i>In other words:</i> A hypothetical foot of 18.<b>55</b>3&#160;25 x 16 equal 296.<b>85</b>2&#160;mm. <b>This <i>is not</i> a Roman foot</b>, anymore! <i>Furthermore, all theories trying to proof that the old system is deduced from the Earth circumference are rightly accused to be pseudo-scientific.</i></li>
<li>You wrote above: "<i>When they devised the metric system they had a system of decimal divisions of the arc to go along with it. The latter has been discarded and poeple still use nautical miles as a rival to the kilometre.</i>" The 100 grade system of arc has been discarded because <i>the decimal time is not consistent</i>. The number ten has no integer with division by four. So the decimal clock-face even not marked all the four cardinal points with a main point. This lack of the decimal time format was so obvious that any reasonable man couldn't defend this one. Because the decimal system did not conquere the time format, the respective meridian system had also to stay in sexagesimal system.<br />
That's quite normal.</li>
<li>In the case of your place in history as creator of the "25 cm measure shared into ten pseudo-inches". (Pseudo-inches, because everybody knows that "inch" comes from latin "uncia". This word signify literally "divided into twelve parts". Thus, beside, also the pound of 16&#160;ounces is the same linguistic nonsense.) Also here you are too late! Some German länder allied to Napoleon did so before. Others defined a "new Fuß" shared in ten "new Zoll" of respectively 30 and 3&#160;cm. All in perspective to switch to the metric system. But people are not stupid. Did you ever see a thumb with a breadth of 3&#160;cm? Perhaps 25&#160;cm (size 37.5) is "<i>closer to the average length of an adult [woman] foot than 36 or even 35 barleycorns</i>", but you forget something. Generally we put all on our shoes! An average length of foot <i>with shoes</i>, very good matches, since ever, with about 30&#160;cm.</li>
<li>You wrote: "<i>Why not base 32 instead? 1024 is already used extensively in computing as a mulitplier. 32 is the square root of 1024.</i>" and just before: "<i>But you really would have to settle on one hexidecimal foot. Having one scientific one and a different technical one would be a nightmare. This is one advantage of the metric system: it's unambiguous.</i>"<br />
&#160;<br />
Concerning your first quotation, I understand you. I'll come back on in a moment. No, I don't share your expressed opinion of your second quotation.<br />
There are not only two variants of the <i>same</i> digital foot, <i><b>but there are also two terms</b></i>.<br />
Both, the "scientific digital foot" and the "technical digital foot" can each one – orally – designed by the popular term "foot".<br />
Either you have the intelligence to exprime you without possible misunderstanding or – in the most of cases – the difference of 0.0054&#160;% is without any significance.<br />
&#160;<br />
However, scientists will never use terms like "digit", "foot", "aune", "mile" or "league"; moreover different in each foreign language. This would be a real regression in comparison with one of the most progressive acquirement of the decimal SI, will say: the logical and practical prefixes of the same base unit like the <i>milli-</i>, the <i>mega-</i>, the <i>microunit</i> etc.<br />
This <i>must</i> be preserved, if not, none proposed system can successfully pretend to replace the former decimal system.<br />
It's true 1024 is very important. Because this is 16 power 2.5, the number 1024 <i>seems</i> not to match with the hexadecimal system of units. It's a false prejudice.<br />
&#160;<br />
Because the ingenious system of my friend Michael Florencetime integrates the factor 1024 in an easy and practical way.<br />
I have neither the time nor the place to explain all exhaustively <i>(even if you don't speak the French language, surely <a href="http://www.florencetime.net/xtr/support/telechargements/" class="external text" title="http://www.florencetime.net/xtr/support/telechargements/" rel="nofollow">this document</a> can help you.)</i><br />
<i>Nevertheless in short&#160;:</i><br />
The hexadecimal million is obviously 1024 x 1024, the mega. Like 1024 power 4, the tera, is the hexadecimal billion.<br />
(Of course compared to the decimal billion of the good old, consistent <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_and_short_scales.html" title="Long and short scales">long scale</a> which also has been <i>said dead</i> in France over decades by <i>all the encyclopaedia</i> of the 19th and in the beginning of the 20th century. This scale will <font style="text-decoration:underline">certainly</font> come back world-over, even in U.S.A. and in Brazil.)<br />
Because the hexadecimal million is 16 power 5, Michael groups great numbers always into five digits, what's practical, five digits are still easy to distinguish. For the five so-called "ranks" of each magnitude (kilo-, mega-, giga- etc.) he uses the five vowels not employed with his good and unambiguous <a href="../../../h/e/x/Hexadecimal_time.html#The_twice_sixteen_hours_a_day_format" title="Hexadecimal time">omni-literal digits</a> (much better than the IBM standard).<br />
The five vowels are arranged by linguistic criterions signifying respectively "i" = 1x, "e" = 16x, "a" = 256x, "o" = 4096x and finally "u" = 65536 times the magnitude of the unit.<br />
<i>Examples:</i> 1 x 1024 x 1024 equal one mega-i-unit, 256 x 1024 x 1024 equal one mega-a-unit. <i>In the same way:</i> 256 / (1024 x 1024) is the micro-a-unit.<br />
The magnitude between milli and kilo – in the opposite of the decimal system – has its own prefix: "hexa". Thus one hexadecimal is the hexa-i-unit.<br />
No problem also with the <i>odd</i> powers of 1024 which form an easy to understand deduced subsystem. <i>So:</i> 256 x 1024 equal one kilo-a-unit.<br />
<i>So, let's come back to the topo:</i><br />
In their works and professional use, <b>scientists <i>never</i> will employ the term "foot", but <i>always</i> the term "milli-a-metre", which refers, without any ambiguity, invariably to the scientific definition, <font style="text-decoration: underline">never</font> to the technical definition.</b> <b>In practice, if possible, they even prefer the basic unit: the hexa-i-metre (= 19.109&#160;257&#160;m / 16) exactly one.</b><br />
This basic unit, in its technical variant measures 1.194&#160;393&#160;6 current SI decimal metres exactly one and is called "aune", the appropriated popular name of this four-feet-ell.<br />
<i><b>You see, not a soupçon of ambiguity!</b></i> All is clear, limpid and well-defined. Ready for a worldwide use. This will come without fail and probably quicker than you now imagine.</li>

For the article, I'm confident, we'll find solutions. In particular the Nippur cubit reference seems me to be inevitable. It's the attested historical truth.</p>
<p>I'm aware, for reading and studying my long reply, I demanded much of your precious time. Never the less, I hope you account it as profitable for yourself.</p>
<p>For the rest, I really think that we'll go hexadecimal. <i>We have to understand our now day main tool, the computers.</i> Binary divisions are omni-present in ancient systems.</p>
<p>At the last, the modest but aright devise of the hexadecimal system of units: <b>" Two thumbs and eight <i>other</i> fingers. <i>Twice eight equal sixteen.</i> "</b><br />
is quite more sympatric than the bloated and hubristic devise of the decimal SI: <b>" For all people and <i>forevermore</i>. "</b> Such pretensions not prove true.<br />
Retrospectively, the <i>decimal metre</i> would have been a parenthesis of not much more than two centuries in our about five millennia old history of metrology.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hexadecimal feet</span></h2>
<p>I'll make this brief for I've got to go. I'm still not convinced that having two new feet would be of any use. It would be better to settle on one. Remember that most scientists would not be so concerned about their foot's being a close approximation to the circumference of the Earth divided by some power of two. This kind of relationship would be useful to airlines, pilots, sailors, and the like. Having two feet would just be cumbersome: nothing but a stumbling block.</p>
<p>"This will come without fail and probably quicker than you now imagine." if it comes at all it'll be quicker than I imagine. The beauty of ten is that we count this way. Had the ancients come up with your fancy style of counting to sixteen on their fingers then things may be different. Note also that you can count to 1023 (2<sup>10</sup>-1) on your fingers if you use binary. I don't see it happening.</p>
<p>One last point. Although we seem to disagree on every thing there is one place where we can agree. A billion is a million million. Long live the so-called <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_scale.html" title="Long scale">long scale</a>. I hope you're right that this one-billion-is-one-thousand-million nonsense is quickly &amp; forever forgotten.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hexadecimal foot</span></h2>
<p>I take serious your reiterate objection concerning the first-called "technical foot". I changed in the table above "technical definition" to "idealistic definition".</p>
<p>Because you are right, even in technical application fields we should have exactly the same hexadecimal foot as in science.<br />
<i>The difference is – you also know it – very exiguous:</i><br />
So, for example, six hexadecimal feet: 0x 6.00000 milli-a-metres would be superior equal to 0x 5.FFEA9 digital feet in the idealistic definition, <i>or a difference of exactly 97.55625&#160;µm in a length of man's size.</i><br />
This hexadecimal number of the example can be enounced: Five, fifteenty-fifteen thousand, fourteen hundred and tenty-nine millionth.<br />
Cf. The French common numbers like "quatre-vingt-dix-sept" literally: "four (times) twenty (plus) seventeen".<br />
<i>A quite unusual expression, but accepted in France and used by everybody without problems in the everyday life, because taught so in school since several centuries.</i></p>
<p>Yes, you are right, the digital foot has to be unique, with one only definition. The scientific one! Just this is coherent.<br />
However the idealistic Roman foot has and will have his appropriated place – at least in the science of ancient measures – because this idealistic value definition, devoid of being false, gives easy (not recurrent) values for all other obsolete historical units of lengths. Thus it simplifies and so contributes to the cognition. I remember you that a <i>definition</i>, if accepted – unlike a measurement – can have <i>any authoritative precision</i> they want.</p>
<p>I'm happy to meet you as a long scale adherer. Several years ago, I didn’t have determined opinion concerning this controversial subject. So, nobody can accuse me to have a personal, "subjective" preference. But the knowledge of the hexadecimal billion and my following studies of the (long &amp; short scale) history, gave me the awareness that only the <i>original</i> long scale model is consistent. By passing from the older six-digits-groups to the modern three-digits-groups, what's <i>by itself</i> is acceptable, but not is <i>not a sufficient reason to change the meaning of the numbers</i>. That's what the short scale defenders still seem not understand. Yes, the hexadecimal system will be the gravedigger of the short scale, world-wide.<br />
However there a new – I hope factoid – disagreement between us: The false "U.S.A.–Brazil–Harold-Wilson billion" should <i>not</i> "quickly &amp; forever forgotten". If not, soon, we will misunderstand historical texts of our now present times.</p>
<p>The 64-bit-bus stores numbers from zero up to sixteen (or "onety") trillions minus one: 0x F FFFFF FFFFF FFFFF.<br />
Exactly one the number of wheat grains, which should conceive the inventor of the chess-play according to a well-known legend.<br />
One hundred thousand hexadecimal (0x 100 000) don't exist. That's just the hexadecimal million (0x 1 00000).<br />
Further like a milliard hexadecimal don't exist, since 1024 power 3 is 0x 400 00000 (four hundred millions).<br />
Nor we should confound the binary kilo (x1024) with hexadecimal thousand (= 4096); the first one is only 0x 400.</p>
<p>Also in another point you misunderstood me:<br />
By the devise: "Two thumbs and eight other fingers. Twice eight equal sixteen." none propose to learn count in binary on the fingers. I also saw this – like you say it – fancy proposal at <a href="http://www.intuitor.com/counting/" class="external text" title="http://www.intuitor.com/counting/" rel="nofollow">intuitor.com</a> and I didn't take it for serious. Because we are living, serendipitously, in a time with algorithmic mathematics. All analogical "crutches" are hopelessly antiquated. In the opposite: As just like we had been "plagued" as seven years old boys 'n girls to learn by heart the decimal multiplication tables, our children soon will learn both, the decimal one and the hexadecimal one. In the modern omni-literal digits this will give for example: "K × T = SQ" or "X × Y = GS" etc. Sure many adults, first, will be too lazy. But the coming "BQQ&#160;€", "BQQ&#160;¥" and "BQQ&#160;$" bank notes, will seduce them to be more studious. Finally everyone will understand that the hexadecimal system is better and easier than the decimal one.</p>
<p>No, this devise is not an invitation to count all on his fingers. What idea! The intention is another one.<br />
Somewhere I read a hypothesis saying that the indo-european peoples originally possessed an octal system, counting eight-and-one, eight-two etc. The argumentation was the undeniable similarity in our indo-european languages between the number "nine" and the word "new": <i>French</i> "neuf/neuf", <i>German</i> "neun/neu", <i>Italian</i> "nove/nuovo", <i>Spanish:</i> "nueve/nuevo" etc. According to this hypothesis, due to a later contact with other people using the decimal, the number nine was the first of the two "<i>new</i>, added numbers". I don't know what this hypothesis is worthy. Because this change of base – if ever it happened – was before the invention of writing, we'll surely never descry if there are coincidence or not. Nevertheless, because in men's history other bases than ten are well attested, it's not completely excluded that already our ancestors used an octal system. Also in China, an old even <i>hexadecimal system</i> seemed to have been used.</p>
<p>But it's true, predominantly decimal counting was employed in our history. Certainly because our ancestry considered to have ten fingers. Now Michael Florencetime comes to assert (without arrogance regarding our forebears): Their point of view was perhaps a little plainly. We, <i>modern human beings,</i> can realise, that we sure have ten fingers, but also two fingers of another kind than the eight remaining ones. That's our two thumbs. Since twice eight equal sixteen, he suggest – catching this – that the modern base "sixteen" is certainly not less "human" than base ten.</p>
<p>You also wrote: "<i>Remember that most scientists would not be so concerned about their foot's being a close approximation to the circumference of the Earth divided by some power of two. This kind of relationship would be useful to airlines, pilots, sailors, and the like.</i>" No, not only pilots and sailors, we all, hence, will know that the Earth circumference at the equator is – by definition – <i>twonety</i> (twice "onety" or twice sixteen) million hexa-i-metres (0x&#160;20&#160;00000&#160;him, much better is: PQ&#160;QQQQQ&#160;him) i.e. two thousand hexadecimal leagues.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">One Billion hexadecimal feet</span></h2>
<p>No, I'll agree that we shouldn't simply forget the false billion (of 10<sup>9</sup>). You're right: we don't want to "misunderstand historical texts of our now present times."</p>
<p>Also, no, I won't suggest we count on our fingers. However, fingers are still quite useful for non-verbal signalling of numbers.</p>
<p>It is an interesting theory that the prehistoric Europeans used octal. I guess we'll never know for sure though.</p>
<p>Whilst on the topic of octal numbers ... one millilitre is one cubic centimetre, one litre is one cubic decilitre and one kilolitre is one cubic metre. This is the beauty of the thousand. It doesn't quite work with hexadecimal.</p>
<p>One thousand is ten to the <i>three</i>. Sixteen is two to the <i>four</i>. The number of dimensions that the universe we live in has is <i>three</i> (well, the String Theorists may have something to say about this but it ain't important here). There's an advantage of base eight over base sixteen. Eight is two to the <i>three</i>.</p>
<p>Perhaps you'll want to throw areas in there as well, though. This'll suggest sixty-four. Sixty-four is eight to the <i>two</i> whilst still being four to the <i>three</i>. Of course, on the other hand, octal fits in considerably worse with the 1024 scheme and base 64 worse still.</p>
<p>What kind of units of area and volume will we be using in this new age of hexadecimal? A cubic hexadecimal foot will be kind of large. One sixteenth of this won't correspond to the cube of any rational number of hexadecimal digits. An eighth of it will, of course, but are we not deviating from the spirit of hexadecimal? Area will, be no problem here, of course, for not only is sixteen the square of four but it is the square of the square of two.</p>
<p>"No, not only pilots and sailors, we all, hence, will know that the Earth circumference at the equator is – by definition – ... two thousand hexadecimal leagues." Yes, and this will be useful to all of us as and no less useful to the rest of us as it will be to the scientist. Glad you see the sense in having only one foot.</p>
<p>Anyhow, leaving aside powers of two for a moment. One of the drawbacks of using base ten is that you end up with a recurring decimal when you take the inverse of any prime number other to five or two. Hexadecimal, of course, does worse here. There is no solution to this: all bases are limited somehow. However, two and five, it may be argued are not optimal.</p>
<p>Not too long ago I had a bottle of beer. Guess how much beer was in the bottle: ... 333 millilitres. One might suggest that dividing things by three is more important than dividing things by five. In this way perhaps base six is better than either base ten or sixteen. If we're going for base six, then why not base twelve?</p>
<p>Dozenal counting is not all that alien to English speakers. The dozenal hundred and even the dozenal thousand have names in English viz. <i>a gross</i> and <i>a great gross</i>. I'm not to sure about how things are in other languages though except that a dozen is <i>ﾄﾞｰｽ</i> (<i>doosu</i>) in Japanese.</p>
<p>However, if we're going this far, why not get the good old base sixty system up and running again? I think the Babylonians were on the right track. Sixty divides evenly by two, three, four and five. Six sixties are three hundred and sixty the number of degrees in an arc and almost the number of days in a year. The division of the hour and the degree of arc is already in base sixty. We can also keep our nautical miles and knots. If 1852 metres is too wayward, then we've only got to redefine it.</p>
<p>P.S. Might it not be worthwhile splitting this Talk page up? We are discussing two quite different things.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reply from Paul</span></h2>
<p>I read your reply. I'll answer you as soon as possible. Have a good day. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Martin_ab83.html" title="User:Paul Martin">Paul Martin</a> 09:12, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>P.S. Only one quick answer to the volumes. This, I'll try you to show by means of mass:</i><br />
The central unit of mass, called hexadecimal pound, is deduced by the mass of water in the palm (= ¼ foot) cube. Like the <i><b>k</b></i>g makes exception in SI, also this pound – in the opposite to the six other basic units – is not called "hexa-<i>i</i>-gramme", but "hexa-<b>a</b>-gramme" <small>≤</small> 415.922&#160;g.<br />
Thousand (×4096) hexadecimal pounds (BQQQ&#160;hag) is the hexadecimal tonne <i>(cf. four-feet cube)</i> <small>≥</small> 1.7&#160;t. One thousandth of the hexadecimal pound (Q.qqb&#160;hag), a mass called "ace" is <small>≤</small> 0.102&#160;g. Half an ace (Q.qqqt&#160;hag) is the hexadecimal grain of about 50.771&#160;683&#160;5&#160;mg.<br />
An analogic high precision balance weighting for example two pounds maximum has exactly fifteen weights, also called "stones". Each stone has its popular name. <i>(But attention: one stone, as a specific weight unit, equals 16 pounds.)</i> The two last ones of this complete set of weights, the two grain-weights have, of course, an identical mass.<br />
But you are right, <b>the mass deduced from the <i>foot cube</i> equals <i>64</i>&#160;pounds.</b> That's the digital talent <small>≤</small> 26.619&#160;kg. Two aces equal – by the way – the hexadecimal carat.</p>
<p><i>Other point:</i><br />
One of the <i>advantages</i> of the hexadecimal system is that <i>"the inverse of any prime number other to [...] two"</i> gives often <i>simple</i> recurrent values.<br />
Just like all we know that 0.3333... means 1/3, we'll rapidly learn by heart the most important hexadecimal recurrent values.</p>

<p>Sure 16/ 7, 16/11, like 16/13 and 16/14 are more complicated. 16/ 9 is with B.<font style="text-decoration: overline">kdb</font> not too complex for retaining it.</p>
<p><i>Other point:</i><br />
You wrote: <i>"However, fingers are still quite useful for non-verbal signalling of numbers."</i> Yes, up to sixteen, this makes sens. <i>If you are sure</i> that your vis-à-vis knows that now you give a hexadecimal number, you can signalling him the number four <i>either</i> by the four fingers of one hand excepting the thumb <i>or</i> only by the thumb itself. Thus, the thumb <i>and</i> the index finger means five hexadecimal etc. It's easy to understand how to count up to sixteen hexadecimal on both hands. For all numbers above it seems me superfluous to toggle out any fancy and useless system; let alone to learn it.</p>
<p>Later more, <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Martin_ab83.html" title="User:Paul Martin">Paul Martin</a> 11:09, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<i>PS2.</i> All other bases – exept the base sixteen – are not modern, not at the "height of our times". Especially the duodecimal has been often proposed in the past, always unsuccessfully. <i><b>No any chance, that's certain.</b></i><br />
For the antiquated sexagesimal the same applies. Furthermore, do you dispose of 60 practicable digits? In the improbable affirmative case: Who would learn it by heart?<br />
Even the numerous proposers of the duodecimal, since several centuries, never have been able to present a convincing proposal for the two lacking digits.<br />
<i>Even if:</i> Let's not talk about the persistent ambiguity between par example: 100<sub>10</sub> and 100<sub>12</sub>.<br />
Excepting the problems of other binary bases rightly discerned by you, in the cases of hypothetical bases 32, 64 and – why not – 1024 the same representation problem is posed.</p>
<p><br />
An more exhaustive answer for the other topos however will come. Yes, we'll see how to split this page.<br />
I'm glad to have find an interesting, competent and constructive discussion partner like you are.</p>
