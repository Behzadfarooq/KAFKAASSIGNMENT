<p>This much simpler than that of its sister art, tragedy, though as to its origin and earlier development there is little exact information. All that <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristotle.html" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> can tell us is that it first took shape in <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megaris.html" title="Megaris">Megaris</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sicyon.html" title="Sicyon">Sicyon</a>, whose people were noted for their coarse humour and sense of the ludicrous, while <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susarion.html" title="Susarion">Susarion</a>, the earliest comic poet, was a native of a Megarian town. Add to this that it arose from the phallic processions of the Greeks, as did tragedy from the <a href="../../../d/i/t/Dithyramb.html" title="Dithyramb">dithyramb</a>, and we have about all that is known about the origins of comedy.</p>
<p>At country festivals held in celebration of the vintage it was the custom for people to pass from village to village, some in carts, uttering the crude jests and abuse unjustly attributed to the tragic choruses; others on foot, bearing aloft the phallic emblem and singing the praises of Phales, the comrade of <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bacchus.html" title="Bacchus">Bacchus</a>. In cities it was also the custom, after an evening <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banquet.html" title="Banquet">banquet</a>, for young men to roam around the streets with torches in their hands, headed by a <a href="../../../l/y/r/Lyre.html" title="Lyre">lyre</a> or <a href="../../../f/l/u/Flute.html" title="Flute">flute</a>-player. Such a group of revellers was called a <i><a href="../../../k/o/m/Komos.html" title="Komos">komos</a></i>, and a member of the band a komast or komos-singer, the song itself being termed a komoedia, or <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comedy.html" title="Comedy">comedy</a>, just as a song of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satyr.html" title="Satyr">satyrs</a> was named a tragoedia, or <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tragedy.html" title="Tragedy">tragedy</a>.</p>
<p>The Phallic processions were continued as late as the days of Aristotle (<a href="../../../3/8/4/384_BC_e722.html" title="384 BC">384</a> – <a href="../../../3/2/2/322_BC_12cf.html" title="322 BC">322 BC</a>), and we learn from one of the <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oration.html" title="Oration">orations</a> of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demosthenes.html" title="Demosthenes">Demosthenes</a> that the riotous youths who infested the streets of <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athens</a> delighted in their comic buffooneries. <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pasquinade.html" title="Pasquinade">Pasquinades</a> of the most obscene kind were part of the exhibitions. When formally established as part of the Dionysiac festivals, the Leneas and Dionysia, it had its chorus, though less numerous and costly than the dithyrambic choir, and the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor.html" title="Actor">actors</a>, at first without masks, disguised their features by smearing them with the <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lees.html" title="Lees">lees</a> of <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wine.html" title="Wine">wine</a>.</p>
<p>Comedy is defined by <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plato.html" title="Plato">Plato</a> as the generic name for all exhibitions which have a tendency to excite laughter. Though its development was mainly due to the political and social conditions of Athens, it finally held up the mirror to all that was characteristic of Athenian life.</p>

<p>By a consensus of authorities comedy has been arranged in three divisions, or rather should they be termed variations in form - the old, the middle and the new.</p>
<p><a name="Old_Comedy" id="Old_Comedy"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greek_comedy_b30f.html" title="Edit section: Old Comedy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Old Comedy</span></h3>
<p>The old comedy, dating from the establishment of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">democracy</a> by Kleisthenes, about <a href="../../../5/1/0/510_BC_ec3c.html" title="510 BC">510 BC</a>, arose, as we have seen, from the obscene jests of <a href="../../../d/i/o/Dionysus.html" title="Dionysus">Dionysian</a> revellers, to which was given a political application. In outward form these comedies were the most extravagant of <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burlesque.html" title="Burlesque">burlesque</a>, in essence they were the most virulent of abuse and personal vilification. In its license of word and gesture, on its audacious directness of invective, no restriction was placed by the dramatist, the audience or the authorities. The satire and abuse were directed against some object of popular dislike, to whom were not only applied such <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epithet.html" title="Epithet">epithets</a> as coward, fool and knave, but he was represented as saying and doing everything that was contemptible, as suffering everything that was ludicrous and degrading. But this alone would not have won for comedy such recognition as it received from the refined and cultured community of the age of Pericles. The comic dramatist who would gain a hearing in Athens must borrow from tragedy all its most attractive features, its choral dances, its masked actors, its metres, its scenery and stage mechanism, and above all the chastened elegance of the <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attic_Greek_d27d.html" title="Attic Greek">Attic language</a> - for this the audience required from the dramatist, as from the <a href="../../../l/y/r/Lyric_poetry.html" title="Lyric poetry">lyric</a> poet and the <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orator.html" title="Orator">orator</a>. Thus comedy became a recognized branch of the drama, often presenting a brilliant sparkle in dialogue and a poetic beauty in the choral parts not unworthy of the best efforts of the tragic muse. Thus, also, it became a powerful engine in the hands of a skillful and unscrupulous politician.</p>
<p>It was upon this stock that the mighty genius of <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristophanes.html" title="Aristophanes">Aristophanes</a> grafted the <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gargantua_and_Pantagruel_f3a9.html" title="Gargantua and Pantagruel">Pantagruelism</a>, which, ever since it was reproduced by <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabelais.html" title="Rabelais">Rabelais</a>, has had among European writers, as in <a href="../../../m/i/g/Miguel_de_Cervantes_9688.html" title="Miguel de Cervantes">Cervantes</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Swift_100b.html" title="Jonathan Swift">Swift</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/l/Voltaire.html" title="Voltaire">Voltaire</a> and others, some adequate representation. Though the word Pantagruelism is applied by Rabelais to the characters sustained by court fools, he made a free use both of the spirit and mechanical appliances of old Greek comedy, adopting the disguise of buffoonery to attack some prevailing form of cant and hypocrisy. And this is precisely what Aristophanes did, the term invented by the great French master accurately describing the chief characteristics of his prototype.</p>
<p>The main Old Comedians were <a href="../../../c/r/a/Cratinus.html" title="Cratinus">Cratinus</a>, <a href="../../../e/u/p/Eupolis.html" title="Eupolis">Eupolis</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristophanes.html" title="Aristophanes">Aristophanes</a>. Unfortunately, only Aristophanes' works survive intact.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greek_comedy_b30f.html" title="Edit section: Middle Comedy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Middle Comedy</span></h3>
<p>The line between old and middle comedy is not very clearly marked, Aristophanes and others of the latest writers of the one becoming the earliest writers of the other. The latter was indeed merely an offshoot of the former, but differed from it in three essential particulars:</p>
<ol>
<li>it had no chorus</li>
<li>public characters were not impersonated or personified on the stage</li>
<li>the objects of its ridicule were general rather than personal, literary rather than political.</li>
</ol>
<p>Where Old Comedy was caricature and lampoon, Middle Comedy was criticism and review.</p>
<p>The period of the middle comedy extended from the close of the <a href="../../../p/e/l/Peloponnesian_war.html" title="Peloponnesian war">Peloponnesian war</a> to the enthralment of Athens by <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_of_Macedon_69b0.html" title="Philip of Macedon">Philip of Macedon</a>; that is to say, from the closing years of the <a href="../../../5/t/h/5th_century_BC_f46f.html" title="5th century BC">fifth</a> to nearly the middle of the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_century_BC_fb99.html" title="Fourth century BC">fourth century BC</a>. It was extremely prolific in plays, but not especially so in genius. The favorite themes were the literary and social peculiarities of the day, which, together with the prominent systems of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_philosophy.html" title="Greek philosophy">philosophy</a>, were treated with light and not ill-natured ridicule. The grandest tragedies of <a href="../../../%C3%A6/s/c/%C3%86schylus.html" title="Æschylus">Æschylus</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophocles.html" title="Sophocles">Sophocles</a>, the noblest passages of <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homer.html" title="Homer">Homer</a>, and the most beautiful lyrics of <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pindar.html" title="Pindar">Pindar</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simonides_of_Ceos_3828.html" title="Simonides of Ceos">Simonides</a> were freely parodied, and in the same way were treated subjects taken directly from ancient mythology. In dealing with society, classes rather than individuals were attacked, as courtesans, parasites, revellers, and especially the self-conceited cook, who, with his parade of culinary science, was always a favorite target for the shafts of middle comedy.</p>
<p>We have no surviving works of Middle Comedy, except for Aristophanes' <a href="../../../p/l/u/Plutus_%28play%29.html" title="Plutus (play)">Plutus</a>.</p>
<p><a name="New_Comedy" id="New_Comedy"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greek_comedy_b30f.html" title="Edit section: New Comedy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">New Comedy</span></h3>
<p>The new comedy lasted throughout the reign of the Macedonian rulers, ending about <a href="../../../2/6/0/260_BCE_a808.html" title="260 BCE">260 BCE</a>. It may be studied to better advantage in the <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> adaptations by <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plautus.html" title="Plautus">Plautus</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terence.html" title="Terence">Terence</a> than in the few Greek fragments that have come down to us (though during the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twentieth_century.html" title="Twentieth century">twentieth century</a>, the complete text of <i><a href="../../../d/y/s/Dyskolos.html" title="Dyskolos">Dyskolos</a></i>, a play by <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menander.html" title="Menander">Menander</a>, the leading writer of New Comedy, has been rediscovered. It is the only example of New Comedy to have survived in its entirety. A few long fragments by Menander have survived as well from such plays as The Arbitration, The Girl from Samos, The Shorn Girl, and The Hero), nor did it differ essentially from the comic drama of <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakespeare.html" title="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Jonson_6db2.html" title="Ben Jonson">Ben Jonson</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Congreve_%28playwright%29_ed0f.html" title="William Congreve (playwright)">Congreve</a> and <a href="../../../w/y/c/Wycherley.html" title="Wycherley">Wycherley</a><sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. For the first time love became a principal element in the drama, but it was seldom an honest love. The stock characters of the "heavy father," the domineering parent who is all too often led into the vices and follies for which he has reproved his son, and the mercenary soldier newly returned from war with a noisy tongue, a full purse and an empty head also make their appearances. With these exceptions, the characters were very much the same as in the middle comedy. There can be little doubt that the new comedy faithfully represented the most salient features of Athenian society; but it made no attempt to improve it, presenting only in attractive colors the lax morality of the age.</p>
