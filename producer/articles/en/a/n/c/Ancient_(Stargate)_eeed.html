<p>Millions of years ago, the (presumably) first evolution of mankind lived in a distant galaxy along the evolutionary path to <a href="../../../a/s/c/Ascension_%28Stargate%29_3a10.html" title="Ascension (Stargate)">ascension</a>. At the time, the Ori and the Alterans were not distinguished from each other, and lived in one society. However, a philosophical division emerged. The Ori grew more and more fervent in their religious belief, while the Alterans (from <i>altera</i>, <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a>: <i>the other(s)</i>), adopted a more scientific/rational outlook. Ultimately, their viewpoints diverged so much that the two groups split apart and began to oppose each other, culminating in the Ori attempting to destroy the Alterans. Instead of going to war, the Alterans decided to leave their galaxy, and began searching for a new home.<sup id="_ref-The_Fourth_Horseman_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Fourth_Horseman" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>After much time, believed by <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Jackson_1278.html" title="Daniel Jackson">Daniel Jackson</a> to be thousands of years, the Alterans discovered the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milky_Way_7069.html" title="Milky Way">Milky Way</a>, where they eventually built an impressive empire. They apparently also settled on Earth, which they called <i>Terra</i>. The Ancients built <i>Astria Porta</i> (Stargates) across many planets, most of which were probably colonized by the race.<sup id="_ref-Avalon_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Avalon" title="">[3]</a></sup> The exact role of Earth in their empire remains unknown. However, as the planet's original Stargate, eventually discovered by <a href="../../../s/g/-/SG-1_f555.html" title="SG-1">SG-1</a> in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antarctica.html" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>, was the oldest gate ever encountered, Earth most likely was one of their most important worlds.<sup id="_ref-Frozen_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Frozen" title="">[4]</a></sup> It was also once the location of one of the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_City_Ship_e63a.html" title="Ancient City Ship">Ancient City Ships</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis_%28Stargate%29_4531.html" title="Atlantis (Stargate)">Atlantis</a>, before it moved to the <a href="../../../p/e/g/Pegasus_Galaxy_%28Stargate%29_dcaf.html" title="Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)">Pegasus Galaxy</a>.<sup id="_ref-Rising_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rising" title="">[5]</a></sup> Other important planets they have colonized were Proclarush Taonas<sup id="_ref-Lost_City_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lost_City" title="">[6]</a></sup>, <a href="../../../d/a/k/Dakara.html" title="Dakara">Dakara</a><sup id="_ref-Reckoning_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Reckoning" title="">[7]</a></sup> and Valos Cor.<sup id="_ref-The_Pegasus_Project_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Pegasus_Project" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although exiled to another galaxy, the Alterans still remained in contact with their distant cousins, the Ori, evidenced by the discovery of <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_technology_in_Stargate_76e6.html#Communication_Device" title="Ancient technology in Stargate">long-range communication devices</a> in both the Milky Way and the Ori home galaxy.<sup id="_ref-Origin_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Origin" title="">[9]</a></sup> Still, the two factions remained bitter enemies.

Holographic map of the Pegasus Galaxy.</div>

<p>Several million years ago, several Ancients departed Earth in their city-sized spaceship, <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis_%28Stargate%29_4531.html" title="Atlantis (Stargate)">Atlantis</a> which at that time was situated on Earth on the continent Antarctica. The exact reason for their departure is unknown, although <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Jackson_1278.html" title="Daniel Jackson">Daniel Jackson</a> has speculated that they might have left to escape the plague that was devastating their civilization of the time. <sup id="_ref-Rising_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rising" title="">[5]</a></sup> One known Ancient, later named <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_characters_in_Stargate_2cf5.html#Ayiana" title="Ancient characters in Stargate">Ayiana</a> by the researchers who discovered her perfectly preserved in Antarctica, was left behind. The fact that Ayiana was infected with the Ancient plague when she was defrosted would seem to confirm Jackson's speculations. <sup id="_ref-Frozen_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Frozen" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>After arriving in the <a href="../../../p/e/g/Pegasus_Galaxy_%28Stargate%29_dcaf.html" title="Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)">Pegasus Galaxy</a>, the Alterans settled on a planet they named Lantea, calling themselves Lanteans from that time on (they are sometimes called Atlanteans by the members of the Atlantis expedition, a name the peoples of Pegasus use to refer to the expedition members). Finding Pegasus devoid of sentient life, the Lanteans seeded humans and Stargates across their new home galaxy, also protecting and inhabiting them. The Humans seeded by the Alterans came to call them the Ancestors. <sup id="_ref-Rising_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rising" title="">[5]</a></sup> However, at some point they encountered a leech-like organism called the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iratus_bug.html" title="Iratus bug">Iratus bug</a>, which possessed immense healing and <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immunological.html" title="Immunological">immunological</a> capabilities. Somehow this organism absorbed genetic information from humans and eventually evolved into the vampire-like <a href="../../../w/r/a/Wraith_%28Stargate%29_240c.html" title="Wraith (Stargate)">Wraith</a>. <sup id="_ref-Instinct_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Instinct" title="">[13]</a></sup> Although it remains unknown exactly how this evolution occurred, the Ancients have confirmed that they were responsible for the species' emergence. <sup id="_ref-The_Return_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Return" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>As the Ancients had never encountered another species with technologies that could rival their own, they were caught off guard. The Lanteans sent a delegation protected by their most powerful warships to negotiate with the Wraith, without much success. The Lanteans and Wraith went to war, and despite the Ancients' technological superiority, the Wraith overwhelmed the Lanteans with their sheer numbers. During their war which lasted for centuries, the Wraith eventually conquered every planet in the Pegasus Galaxy until only Atlantis, the capital of their empire, remained protected by its powerful city shield.</p>

A typical Wraith.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Lanteans were able to hold the Wraith back with their superior weapons and submerged the city in the planet's ocean to protect it from their enemy's attacks. But no matter how many battles they won, the Lanteans were unable to win the war. <sup id="_ref-Rising_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rising" title="">[5]</a></sup> They started to make more desperate experiments, such as <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Arcturus_19e6.html" title="Project Arcturus">Project Arcturus</a>, a failed attempt to draw <a href="../../../z/e/r/Zero_Point_Energy_8110.html" title="Zero Point Energy">Zero Point Energy</a> from our own universe, instead of an artificial one like in <a href="../../../z/e/r/Zero_Point_Module_a8b0.html" title="Zero Point Module">Zero Point Modules</a>. However, containing zero point energy in our own space-time caused serious containment issues, killing the Ancients and the people of Doranda, the planet it was based on. <sup id="_ref-Trinity_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Trinity" title="">[15]</a></sup> They also developed a race known as the <a href="../../../a/s/u/Asuran.html" title="Asuran">Asurans</a>, nanites designed to fight the Wraith on a cellular level, giving them aggression codes surpassing that of the Wraith. However, their creation took human form, and demanded to have their aggressive tendencies removed so they can ascend. Deeming them flawed, the Asurans were subsequently exterminated by the Ancients. Not wanting anyone to find out their mistakes, the Ancients deleted all references to the Asurans in the Atlantis database, save for the gate address. However, a few of the nanites survived and brought up a second evolution, creating millions of themselves until they looked human. <sup id="_ref-Progeny_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Progeny" title="">[16]</a></sup> They even created a device which caused explosive tumors to form in the bodies of exposed individuals, but this too was abandoned, as it affected all in proximity.</p>
<p>Eventually, the Ancients realized that the war was lost, and decided to return to Earth, the planet that had been home to them for millions of years. They evacuated the city via the Stargate, hoping it would eventually be rediscovered by their descendants. <sup id="_ref-Before_I_Sleep_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Before_I_Sleep" title="">[17]</a></sup> The remaining Ancients in the Pegasus Galaxy returned to Earth by ship, or chose to stay behind and ascend. Some of them even created a time-dilation field powered by a <a href="../../../z/p/m/ZPM_3517.html" title="ZPM">ZPM</a> to speed up their path to ascension. <sup id="_ref-Epiphany_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Epiphany" title="">[18]</a></sup> Others had already ascended on Atlantis by using a specific type of <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_Resequencer_%28Stargate%29_229d.html" title="DNA Resequencer (Stargate)">DNA Resequencer</a>. <sup id="_ref-Tao_of_Rodney_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tao_of_Rodney" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>

<p>After the Lanteans return to Earth, they found only a harsh environment and <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tau%27ri.html" title="Tau'ri">primitive inhabitants</a>. It was believed that there was no hope of rebuilding their former civilization. So they spread out to distant lands and helped to populate them. Others would depart the planet through the Stargate located in Antarctica, possibly seeking to live out their days on distant worlds within the Milky Way. The remainder chose isolation in which to meditate and seek enlightenment.

<p>The story of Atlantis and the Lanteans' plight may have had some influence on <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plato.html" title="Plato">Plato</a>'s <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timaeus.html" title="Timaeus">Timaeus</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/i/Critias.html" title="Critias">Critias</a>. <sup id="_ref-Rising_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rising" title="">[5]</a></sup> They tell of events which transpired some 9,000 years before his time and were written around 360 BC. Atlantis is mentioned only briefly in Timaeus but is described in great detail in Critias as a city full of great wonders and beauty. The Atlantians observed their laws, and spread generosity and peace for many generations. However, its inhabitants would later become greedy, villainous and power hungry and sought to control or wipe out any civilization who opposed them. Rather than having been defeated by a vampire-like alien race, according to Plato's tale, the Atlantians were brought down at the hands of ancient Athenians. As a final punishment the gods destroyed Atlantis.</p>

Merlin became known as King Arthur's wizard in mythology, and the Anti-Ori weapon became known as the Sangraal or Holy Grail.

<p>After the Ancients' ascension, they continued to oppose their former nemesis, the Ori, who had also reached enlightnment. Although the two factions are deadlocked in strength, the Ori are still bent on destroying the Ancients once and for all, sapping power from the second evolution of humanity created in their own galaxy to gather enough strength to attack the Ancients. In response, the Ancients chose to hide their own second evolution created in the Milky Way from the Ori. <sup id="_ref-The_Fourth_Horseman_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Fourth_Horseman" title="">[2]</a></sup> They also probably influenced the associations of <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire.html" title="Fire">fire</a>, the central icon of the Ori religion, with demonic imagery. <sup id="_ref-Origin_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Origin" title="">[9]</a></sup> Still, they refused to take direct action. <sup id="_ref-The_Pegasus_Project_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Pegasus_Project" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>Three years later, an Alteran woman, <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_characters_in_Stargate_2cf5.html#Ayiana" title="Ancient characters in Stargate">Ayiana</a>, was found frozen in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antarctica.html" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> near the location of the Antarctica Stargate. She revived herself when thawed, but was still infected with the plague and died exhausted from healing SG-1 and others from the Plague. There is, as of yet, no explanation as to why she was left behind when the others left for the Pegasus galaxy. <sup id="_ref-Frozen_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Frozen" title="">[4]</a></sup> Apparently, she was left behind in the Ancient outpost in Antarctica after Atlantis left for the Pegasus Galaxy. <sup id="_ref-Rising_6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rising" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>When an <a href="../../../a/u/r/Aurora_class_battleship.html" title="Aurora class battleship">Aurora class battleship</a> was discovered by the <a href="../../../d/a/e/Daedalus_class_battlecruiser.html#Daedalus" title="Daedalus class battlecruiser">Daedalus</a>, adrift between the Pegasus and Milky Way galaxy, the crew was still alive. As the ship was traversing the universe close to <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light_speed.html" title="Light speed">light speed</a>, the crew had only experienced a handful of years since the evacuation of Atlantis, due to relativistic effects. After learning that Atlantis had survived the Wraith, they reclaimed the city. However, when the <a href="../../../a/s/u/Asuran.html" title="Asuran">Asurans</a> returned and captured the city, all the remaining Ancients were executed. <sup id="_ref-The_Return_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Return" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>After Daniel Jackson and <a href="../../../v/a/l/Vala_Mal_Doran_92bc.html" title="Vala Mal Doran">Vala Mal Doran</a> alerted the Ori to the existence of another galaxy filled with humans, starting the Ori invasion of the Milky Way <sup id="_ref-Origin_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Origin" title="">[9]</a></sup>, millions of humans were converted to the oppressive Ori religion, feeding them only more power. According to the Ori themselves, the entire conversion of the Milky Way would probably give them enough strength to destroy the Ancients once the crusade was over. Still, most of the Ancients refuse to intervene, even though their own existence is threatened. Exceptions include <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_characters_in_Stargate_2cf5.html#Morgan_le_Fay" title="Ancient characters in Stargate">Morgan le Fay</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_characters_in_Stargate_2cf5.html#Moros.2FMerlin.2FMyrddin" title="Ancient characters in Stargate">Merlin</a>. <sup id="_ref-The_Pegasus_Project_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Pegasus_Project" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The Ancients were human in both appearance and physiology. The main characteristic differentiating the Ancients from ordinary humans is the <a href="../../../a/t/a/ATA_gene_af9f.html" title="ATA gene">ATA gene</a>, which occurs naturally in all Ancients. However, due to crossbreeding between the Ancients who returned to Earth after they were forced to abandon Atlantis, several humans on Earth possess the gene. <sup id="_ref-Rising_7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rising" title="">[5]</a></sup> Also, the gene has been introduced in others through <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_therapy.html" title="Gene therapy">gene therapy</a>. <sup id="_ref-Hide_and_Seek_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hide_and_Seek" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>It has been suggested that the human Ancients that evolved in a galaxy far from the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milky_Way_7069.html" title="Milky Way">Milky Way</a>, those who would later become the Alterans and the Ori, were the <i>first</i> evolution of humanity. <sup id="_ref-Avalon_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Avalon" title="">[3]</a></sup> It is implied that the current human species evolved as such due to the actions of the Ancients, since two species progressing along identical evolutionary paths is extremely improbable. <sup id="_ref-Frozen_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Frozen" title="">[4]</a></sup> The Ancients later created the "second evolution" of their species, in both the Milky Way and Pegasus Galaxy. <sup id="_ref-Before_I_Sleep_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Before_I_Sleep" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>Towards the end of their evolutionary development, but still before they ascended, the Ancients developed advanced abilities, such as <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telekinesis.html" title="Telekinesis">telekinesis</a>, extraordinary sensory abilities, and the ability to heal others. <sup id="_ref-Frozen_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Frozen" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Ancients are well known for their fierce belief in <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_will.html" title="Free will">free will</a>. As such, they do not interfere on lower planes of existence at all, even not to save their own kind from being exterminated by the Ori.<sup id="_ref-The_Pegasus_Project_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Pegasus_Project" title="">[8]</a></sup> As punishment for breaking this law, the Ancients have been known to wipe out entire civilizations and abandon the one responsible to correct the grave mistakes caused by one of their people. <sup id="_ref-Ascension_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ascension" title="">[26]</a></sup> They have also forced (or tried to force) transgressors to descend back to corporeal form. <sup id="_ref-Fallen_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fallen" title="">[27]</a></sup> Ancients are, by every means, capable of drastically altering courses of events at will.</p>
<p>However, what exactly constitutes as breaking their laws is open to debate. Interfering "a little bit", as <a href="../../../v/a/l/Vala_Mal_Doran_92bc.html" title="Vala Mal Doran">Vala Mal Doran</a> described it, will be tolerated. <sup id="_ref-The_Pegasus_Project_6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Pegasus_Project" title="">[8]</a></sup> Examples of this include the killing of several Jaffa troops<sup id="_ref-Maternal_Instinct_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Maternal_Instinct" title="">[22]</a></sup> and giving the coordinates of Sahal and Castiana to <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Jackson_1278.html" title="Daniel Jackson">Daniel Jackson</a>. <sup id="_ref-The_Pegasus_Project_7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Pegasus_Project" title="">[8]</a></sup> Also, some Ancients, like <a href="../../../o/m/a/Oma_Desala_16b2.html" title="Oma Desala">Oma Desala</a>, repeatedly assists "those beneath" in ascending. Those who follow her are forced to walk a very fine line. <sup id="_ref-Full_Circle_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Full_Circle" title="">[28]</a></sup> Other Ancients who have had to pay the price for interfering in the mortal plaines include <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_characters_in_Stargate_2cf5.html#Orlin" title="Ancient characters in Stargate">Orlin</a> <sup id="_ref-Ascension_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ascension" title="">[26]</a></sup> and <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_characters_in_Stargate_2cf5.html#Chaya_Sar" title="Ancient characters in Stargate">Chaya Sar</a>. <sup id="_ref-Sanctuary_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sanctuary" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Ancients' viewpoints completely oppose those of their distant cousins, the Ori. For example, the Ori religion states that failure to share the secrets of the universe to those on the lower planes of existence is an evil act and that anyone not following it must be eliminated. They also have no rules against taking direct control of living beings or completely changing them to behave as they desire. <sup id="_ref-Origin_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Origin" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>This difference in beliefs is not without its reasons. According to a de-ascended Ancient, Orlin, ascended beings can be empowered by massive numbers of humans worshipping them. The Ori have fabricated an entire religion based on the false promise of <a href="../../../a/s/c/Ascension_%28Stargate%29_3a10.html" title="Ascension (Stargate)">ascension</a> to drain power from their followers. The Ancients firmly resent using their powers this way, and therefore refrain from interfering in the lower planes of existence as manipulating and aligning lower life forms in some order could result in exactly this type of abusive corruption.<sup id="_ref-The_Fourth_Horseman_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Fourth_Horseman" title="">[2]</a></sup> As Morgan le Fay said, if they were to interfere, they would be no better than the Ori.<sup id="_ref-The_Pegasus_Project_8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Pegasus_Project" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>As a result, the Ancients have shielded the second evolution of humans (i.e. current human culture) in the Milky Way from the Ori (and although it has never been stated, they most likely did the same for the seeded humans in the Pegasus Galaxy) and still prevent the Ori from taking direct action in the Milky Way. However, as the Ancients will not interfere in the lower planes of existence, the Ori are allowed to send their human followers to the Milky Way in order to convert it, and anyone who wishes to worship the Ori will be allowed to do so.<sup id="_ref-Origin_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Origin" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Even though the Ancients do not believe in interfering in mortal affairs, it is speculated that they are responsible for generating the associations of <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire.html" title="Fire">fire</a> with <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demonic.html" title="Demonic">Demonic</a> imagery in the Milky Way. This would be another method of shielding humans from the Ori, as the central symbols of Origin involve fire. As Daniel Jackson pointed out, there is no immediate illogicality with fire as a symbol of all that is good: it provides warmth, light, etc.<sup id="_ref-Origin_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Origin" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Also, even before their ascension, the Ancients had strict rules on time travel, although this rule has been broken as well. The Ancient scientist <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_characters_in_Stargate_2cf5.html#Janus" title="Ancient characters in Stargate">Janus</a> developed time travel technology, leading to <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Weir_%28Stargate%29_cf99.html" title="Elizabeth Weir (Stargate)">Elizabeth Weir</a> using it to travel back to Atlantis 10,000 years previously <sup id="_ref-Before_I_Sleep_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Before_I_Sleep" title="">[17]</a></sup>, and to a column containing a history of future events on the Milky Way planet ruled by <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Maybourne_10b2.html" title="Harry Maybourne">Harry Maybourne</a>. <sup id="_ref-It.27s_Good_to_Be_King_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-It.27s_Good_to_Be_King" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>

The Ancients' alphabet as it appears in the Stargate universe.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Ancients' language appears to be a precursor of <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a>, but it is still distinct. However, there are many similarities between the two, and someone with a decent knowledge of Latin may, given time and practice, be able to understand Ancient as well.<sup id="_ref-The_Fifth_Race_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Fifth_Race" title="">[1]</a></sup> The <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athosians.html" title="Athosians">Athosians</a>, and possibly other human civilizations in the <a href="../../../p/e/g/Pegasus_Galaxy_%28Stargate%29_dcaf.html" title="Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)">Pegasus Galaxy</a>, say their prayers in Ancient.<sup id="_ref-Hide_and_Seek_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hide_and_Seek" title="">[25]</a></sup> The Ancient language and writing system is also used by the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Ori_%28Stargate%29_ca32.html" title="Ori (Stargate)">Ori</a> and their followers, who share the same ancestry.<sup id="_ref-Avalon_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Avalon" title="">[3]</a></sup> Since the <a href="../../../w/r/a/Wraith.html" title="Wraith">Wraiths</a> were created by the fictional <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iratus_bug.html" title="Iratus bug">Iratus bug</a> using Ancients as hosts, the Wraith language seems to be a derivative of the Ancient language, and the two use the same writing system; the Wraith language is therefore relatively easy to translate by experienced Ancient speakers.<sup id="_ref-The_Gift_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Gift" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Ancient language has a unique writing system. Unlike the <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goa%27uld_language.html" title="Goa'uld language">Goa'uld</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/g/Asgard_%28Stargate%29_7edc.html" title="Asgard (Stargate)">Asgard</a> writing systems, which correspond to <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptian_hieroglyph.html" title="Egyptian hieroglyph">Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs</a> and <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runic_alphabet.html" title="Runic alphabet">Nordic runes</a> respectively, the Ancient writing system has no analogues with any known Earth alphabet. Generally speaking, Ancient characters are squarish, blocky, and dominated by right angles. There are 35 distinct characters in the Ancient-English conversion. Exactly how the characters were used by the Ancients is unknown. It has been mentioned that some Ancient characters have different meanings when read upside down.<sup id="_ref-Reckoning_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Reckoning" title="">[7]</a></sup> The Ancient writing system has been shown to be learnable with moderate difficulty by humans. However, the pronunciation of Ancient words has fluctuated during the millennia the language was used. <sup id="_ref-The_Pegasus_Project_9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Pegasus_Project" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Ancients also seem to have an <a href="../../../o/c/t/Octal.html" title="Octal">Octal</a> counting system, meaning based on 8, not like the <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decimal.html" title="Decimal">decimal</a> system of the <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tau%27ri.html" title="Tau'ri">Tau'ri</a>, based on 10.<sup id="_ref-The_Fifth_Race_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Fifth_Race" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>In <i>Stargate</i> episodes, main characters translate important written Ancient text for the audience aloud and assert that the rules about Ancient language and writing described above are true. However, the 35 characters of the Ancient writing roughly correspond to the <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_alphabet.html" title="Latin alphabet">Latin alphabet</a>, with 25 letters ('F' and 'U' are the same "backwards seven") and 10 numerals. There are no characters for punctuation marks.</p>

One of many Ancient writing occurrences on <i>Stargate SG-1</i>.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Notable moments/occurrences include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The writings on the stairs in the gate-room on Atlantis translate into a sort of greeting for travellers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Parts of the writings on Atlantis main screens include the beginning of the nursery rhyme <i>Where Oh Where Has My Little Dog Gone</i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The table legs of the control room consoles in Atlantis advise people to "disconnect power before moving".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../p/u/d/Puddle_Jumper_17c3.html" title="Puddle Jumper">Puddle Jumper</a> consoles include instructions on how to use this small ship.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In the episode "<a href="../../../a/f/f/Affinity_%28Stargate_SG-1%29_3267.html" title="Affinity (Stargate SG-1)">Affinity</a>", Daniel Jackson is blackmailed into translating a section of Ancient text. The text shown on Daniel's laptop can be transliterated into "Actual words are hard to deciph(er) so this(')ll work".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Ancient wall in "<a href="../../../r/e/c/Reckoning_%28Stargate_SG-1%29_e803.html" title="Reckoning (Stargate SG-1)">Reckoning</a>" describes the use of the Ancient object hidden behind, and the responsibilities coming with it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In "<a href="../../../a/v/a/Avalon_%28Stargate_SG-1%29_bcdf.html" title="Avalon (Stargate SG-1)">Avalon</a>", the Ancient underground complex belonging to Merlin contains several riddle objects with Ancient writings. <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel.html" title="Daniel">Daniel</a> translates/transliterates them correctly into "Reflect on the <a href="../../../e/i/g/Eightfold_Path_602a.html" title="Eightfold Path">Eightfold Path</a>", "The universe is infinite" and "The treasure is [not] in this pot".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The engraved <a href="../../../s/o/d/Sodan.html" title="Sodan">Sodan</a> flagstones in "<a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon_%28Stargate_SG-1%29_111b.html" title="Babylon (Stargate SG-1)">Babylon</a>" give instructions on how to behave in the Sodan society.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Ancient transportation device first seen in "<a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon_%28Stargate_SG-1%29_111b.html" title="Babylon (Stargate SG-1)">Babylon</a>" says "Gateway to Enlightenment" and has been used many times since.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Quest_%28Stargate_SG-1%29_078c.html" title="The Quest (Stargate SG-1)">The Quest</a>", the <i>Parchment of Virtues</i> discovered in the village library is written in Ancient. When transliterated, the paper is titled "parchment of virtues", and the first (and third) passages read, "the true man will look for prudence wisdom kindness charity and faith be the truest of hearts and ye shall find the answer". The second passage is cut off, but the visible portions read, "though i wal hrough the valley of death ... ehe no evil". The last passage reads "hail mary full of grace the lord is with I just ahve bigger bullet launcher than you dig it." The "a" and "h" in "have" are transposed, probably by accident, given the similar appearance of the characters. The first and second written puzzle can also be clearly seen transcribed on the wall, exactly as Daniel reads it aloud.</li>

<p>Although most of the Ancients had reached ascension long before the dawn of modern civilization on Earth, the <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tau%27ri.html" title="Tau'ri">Tau'ri</a> have come in contact with Ancients on several occasions, both in ascended and corporeal form.
