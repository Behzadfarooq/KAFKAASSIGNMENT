<p>Hi, On your user page I see "My dog submissive pees for lesbians, and HATES people in motorised wheelchairs" As this doesn't make sense as a sentance (at least to me) I'm drawing it to your attention. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllanHainey_d289.html" title="User:AllanHainey">AllanHainey</a> 15:27, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the heads-up. It's neither vandalism nor carelessness, but I'm sorry it doesn't make sense to you. Perhaps if I put 'submissive pees' in quotations, because it's a kind of dog behaviour lingo that is accurate even though it's not conventional conjugation for the context. If I remember I'll change it to make it more clear.--<a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 15:33, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"poke a fork in it" isn't exactly the tone I was hoping for, even on talkpages. My contribution consisted precislely in moving the unhappy section out of the way <i>because</i> it has no place on RD. Thus, apart from stylistic matters, we seem to be in agreement. I certainly won't mind if you remove the section altogether. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 06:24, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, well I guess we each disapprove of the other person's mode of self-expression? Because I thought your comments were completely unnecessary and hence inflammatory. I agree with your choice to move the section and your reasons, and I shall go ahead and delete the whole thing. --<a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 06:29, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BTW, just wanted to make sure you understand that 'poke a fork in it' is a completely non-offensive English metaphor comparing an issue to dinner? As in, 'Poke a fork in him, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greg_Norman_3d5b.html" title="Greg Norman">Greg Norman</a>'s done like dinner as far as this tournament is concerned.' It isn't pejorative, and it's not akin to saying 'put a sock in it'.<a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 06:35, 12 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'd have to agree here. Poke a fork in it is even a bit on the silly side of saying things, its not an insult in any way. I agree that removal was the best thing here. The comments didn't have anything to do with the reference desk, and hopefully their removal will allow the arguers to forgot about it. Hopefully. I'm really being hopeful since I see signs of tempers, but I'm assuming good faith until then. Good job both of you. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 06:57, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was trying very hard. Particularly sice from the noises you were making, you seemed reasonable and prepared to remove it. My mistake. I am trying (very) hard not to rant (honestly). But I find each of the following elements problematic (the first is the one I have most trouble with):</dd>

<dd>Hi Cherry blossom tree: I trust you've seen my post to the talk page? I hope it meets with your approval. I think it's best to go easy with this one since it seems good faith attempts to clean up the purple prose have been reverted before, and a revert war between four editors isn't any more pleasant than one between two.&#160;:-) I hope that the prior warning of impending trimming will preclude reverts (fingers crossed!). It is regrettable that Andrew is somewhat uncivil, but IMO there's no point in belabouring it at present since he doesn't seem to hold WP policies and guidelines in high regard (at present). Let's continue to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and keep our fingers crossed, and hopefully this article will clean up without too much agony.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 10:14, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>I don't agree that these are personal points of view. The discussion page is where we have been discussing this article. I don't appreciate all this work being wiped at your whim. I don't like the editing style adopted. I don't get where you are coming from in a historic literary context, which is what encyclopedic writing is based on. I will revert the text if you don't respond why you think you know better than me how to write. You did not add anything positive to the discussion while the work was in progress except your last claim about typos. You then just wiped out all that work that has been worked over repeatedly and for which there are perfectly good references provided in the discussion page. The other editors appear mollified.</p>
<p>To begin with, you seem to mistake PPOV with impersonal observations. That is why you presumably took out the "reportorial" observation about Walker's early recordings. This shows you don't understand literary or conventional styles of writing in this genre. A reporter does not necessarily provide a personal point of view when he reports an observation or a record of an event as it would strike any unbiased observer. That is his role, to convey clear information and impressions. This is both a neutral POV and the basis of western historical writing going back to Herodotus and Thucydides. This is a stylistic and philosphic manner(ism. Also, please don't fall into the trap of mistaking it for "original" material. It is impersonal observation that adds complexity to a report like this because it presents Walker in in another light from the general tone of the rest. It provides balance and depth. It also helps to avoid hagiography. If Karl Marx were once a devout little Jewish boy who sang regularly at Synagogue do you think that would not be a relevant fact to include in his bio?</p>
<p>What your edit is tending towards is reducing this report to a bland template. This is not the intent of encyclopedic writing, but one one for amateurs to hide behind.

<dd>Sorry to take so long to reply. I'm not able to put time into this right now, but a lot of your edits are just not in line with Wikipedia's editorial style. I'm sorry that you feel so negatively about my contributions to the article, I hope you can accept that I mean the best for the article, the subject and Wikipedia. Perhaps if you edited other articles, you would get a better feel for Wikipedia's editorial style and therefore for my (and other editors') editing priorities. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 02:02, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Anchoress -- this is a copy of my reply to your Help Desk question at <a href="../../../h/e/l/Wikipedia%7EHelp_desk_5342.html#Is_there_a_place_to_post_requested_moves.3F" title="Wikipedia:Help desk">Wikipedia:Help_desk#Is there a place to post requested moves?</a>. I don't believe a page move is needed; the specific issue with the redlink that you posted was that it needed to be a redirect to the actual article, which is at <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bend_It_Like_Beckham_8cd7.html" title="Bend It Like Beckham">Bend It Like Beckham</a>. I believe that is the correct capitalization. The film's own poster and web site are no help, since they both show the title in all-caps; however, IMDB, which we usually accept as canonical, shows the title as it presently is in the name of the article. I created a redirect with the redlined title you posted, so it will work as well. Best, --<a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 22:32, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK cool. I actually had as much of an issue with all the redirects from mis-spellings and different capitalisations, but someone said that's kopacetic, so I guess the deal's done like dinner.

<p>Hi Anchoress, I had a bit of a wikibreak (actually my activity on wikipedia really represents reality breaks) &amp; I just wanted to get back to you and say that I really enjoyed your posts. I sometimes drop off the planet when real life leaves no gaps nad I fear that my sudden "disappearances" my seem a bit snobby, or something. I pretty much figured thats what you were talking about when you mentioned infantilisation, not the weird &amp; slightly sick stuff that you linked to! Or at least I was relieved that what I thought you meant was correct. I realise that in many parts of the world women's rights are essentially null. In my post I was actually referring to the western world. If we worry about the whole world all at once, I think our heads will implode. But you're right - life sucks for an awful lot of women, and for no good reason. I pray it gets better. Cheerio then! <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattopaedia_a144.html" title="User:Mattopaedia">Mattopaedia</a> 12:26, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I noticed you added the BLP template <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Nadarajah_Raviraj&amp;diff=87247489&amp;oldid=87247345" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Nadarajah_Raviraj&amp;diff=87247489&amp;oldid=87247345" rel="nofollow">to this page</a>. You probably did this without thinking and you might realise now it was a mistake. But if not, just wanted to tell you it was unnecessary as he was already dead (indeed I believe the article was only created after his death) so obviously it was not a BLP. While we still have to observe BLP when it comes to other living people discussed on his page and we also should obviously try to avoid unsourced material as with all wikipedian articles we don't add the BLP unless the article is itself a BLP.

<p>Well thank you Anchoress. I've seen nothing but clarity from you at the 'RD in some of our contentious moments and if others have benefited from your perspectives as have I well then, the RD has been mightily enriched. You have been able to capture the essence of our discourse and have demonstrated an excellent sense of timing as to when to submit your thoughts and ideas. I don't know if it's cleverness or just natural wisdom on your part; you just seem to provide the right tone at the right time and I thank you for that ability to "calm the waters". <i>See</i> you 'round I'm sure, --<a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydnjo_a2ba.html" title="User:Hydnjo">hydnjo</a> <a href="../../../h/y/d/User_talk%7EHydnjo_4abf.html" title="User talk:Hydnjo">talk</a> 04:29, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In response to your comment on my talk page, I put New Zealander as ethnicity in the <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Hardcore_9bf0.html" title="Max Hardcore">Max Hardcore</a> article because it says he was born in New Zealand. If you don't consider New Zealander an ethnicity, then you can put <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_people.html" title="White people">White</a> or <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_American_9a10.html" title="White American">White American</a>, although technically those are just skin colours, not ethnicities. I tried to change the description to "skin color" but it wouldn't show up in the preview. In any case, <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasian.html" title="Caucasian">Caucasian</a> is a disambiguation page, and is a technically incorrect, out-of-date and USA-centric term when referring to all types of white people. The term Caucasian is only technically correct and universally understood when referring to <a href="../../../p/e/o/Peoples_of_the_Caucasus_77ef.html" title="Peoples of the Caucasus">Peoples of the Caucasus</a>, which is a very specific group of people. <a href="../../../s/p/y/User%7ESpylab_0801.html" title="User:Spylab">Spylab</a> 11:39, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't disagree with removing Caucasian, I have no opinion about that either way. But the article doesn't <b>just</b> say he's from New Zealand; in the very infobox you changed, it lists his birthplace as Wisconsin. Furthermore, on IMDb it lists his birthplace as Wisconsin. That's why I mentioned it, because I don't think it's clear that he's a New Zealander. I thought I made that clear enough in my original message to you, I guess you didn't understand. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 19:59, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think you probably deserve a a slightly expanded explanation for my grumpiness, to which you, unfortunately, have been subject. Some recent discussions by the 'schoolboy' or 'toilet wall' tendency have been annoying the hell out of me (I know you made some attempt to delete one thread before it got underway), but beyond posting a brief and acidy comment, there is not really an awful lot more I can do about this.

<p>Thank you for raising this, Anchoress. I felt that if I did it would almost certainly have been misconstrued. Besides, I might say that I have such a low opinion of both the intellect and the 'contribitions' of the user in question, that further comment would be superflous; if, that is, I was the kind of person inclined to such remarks. But, of course, I know this would be interpreted as a personal attack and a breach of 'assume good faith;' so I do not.

<dd>Hey, no probs. I think, on another note, that you should be cautious about personal comments directed towards (if not addressed to) other editors; they could be considered a personal attack, even though you're being quite mild.

<p>You said that bacterial infections are not contagious. I strongly disagree, having known <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strep_throat.html" title="Strep throat">strep throat</a> to be passed from person to person. Please revise or delete your answer about tonsillitis. Many sore throats are dangerous and the bacteria causing them are highly transmissable.

<dd>Well what I said is that to my knowledge most bacterial infections aren't communicable, at least not as much so as viruses. But I'm happy to remove the post, no problem. I also see though, that you suggested getting a doctor's opinion. I don't think, given the nature of the question (could the original poster get tonsilitis from his friend despite not having tonsils) is worth bothering (and possibly paying) a doctor for. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 17:50, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In another episode, a female <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mensa.html" title="Mensa">Mensa</a> member, when asked by Lisa what she made, said 'Synergy. And books on how to cheat at bridge.'

<p>The homework-related question clearly seemed like vandalism from first look through <a href="../../../v/p/r/WP%7EVPRF_2210.html" title="WP:VPRF">Vandal Proof</a> and far from every vandal-reverter investigates each revert he makes. The warning was made automaticly using templates and had nothing to do with not being gentle to newcomers. As for the discussions, they were not removed, but rather moved to a different subpage. It was an obligation of mine to notice other users of the move. I hope your can reconsider my editor review comment and be less quick to make negative judgment on other users. Thank you. <b><span style="background:#000"><a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelas10_bbb3.html" title="User:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">Michaelas10</span></a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelas10_7a56.html" title="User talk:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">(Talk)</span></a></span></b> 22:04, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I understand that it seemed like vandalism, but I gave you (on your talk page) a valid other interpretation, which IMO (and my experience both with this user previously and the general tenor of the ref desks) was more plausible than your interpretation. I don't know what other term besides 'removed' would work for our conversation, which was in progress. Whether or not it appeared elsewhere, it <i>was</i> removed from your talkpage. And if it <i>did</i> appear elsewhere, where? I think it is discourteous to make editors trying to work out an issue with you tool through your subpages looking for their thread. Which I did, by the way, and I didn't find it. And no, I'm sorry, I won't be reconsidering my editor review. Best wishes, though. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 22:11, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I see your point, and I've removed the warning from the talk page of the IP, but you may also read the header of the subpage. Moving messeges to subpages is a very common practice here on Wikipedia and discussions may be continued through there as I will keep it on my watchlist. <b><span style="background:#000"><a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelas10_bbb3.html" title="User:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">Michaelas10</span></a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelas10_7a56.html" title="User talk:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">(Talk)</span></a></span></b> 22:18, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well good for you for removing the warning. I think you should also restore the question you deleted. And as for the sub-page, perhaps it is common, but I have never seen it in practice, and more importantly, I would not have known where to go to find my thread, so how could I have continued to participate? I think moving a completed conversation is completely appropriate; I also think it is appropriate to move a conversation in progress with sufficient notification to participants; but I don't think the way you did it was OK. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 22:25, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You have accused me (or my IP address, actually) of "defacing the Coffee Pot" page of wikipedia. Honestly, lady, I have no fuckin idea what you're talking about. I'd never even SEEN that page, let alone changed or defaced it, before you challenged me about it. So don't threaten me with "blocking my access" or some other shit like that, because IT'S NOT ME. GET IT? So sod off. And I love coffee pots, anyway. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_216.164.199.206_3061.html" title="Special:Contributions/216.164.199.206">216.164.199.206</a> (<a href="../../../2/1/6/User_talk%7E216.164.199.206.html" title="User talk:216.164.199.206">talk</a>) 04:50, 23 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>OK I checked the "diff" file and saw that the picture of a coffee pot was replaced by a file named Vulva11.jpg . I can guess what that is, and I KNOW I didn't do that; so someone else must have used my computer and done that. Probably one of my kids. Sorry for my rude tone. I'll get an account, as you suggested. And thanks for all the editing work you've put into this user-powered encyclopedia.
<dl>
<dd>Thank you very much for the reply, the thank you and the apology. Re; the other edit, you should know that IP addresses can rotate, so don't be too quick to blame your kids until you <i>know</i> that your computer was using that IP at the time. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 16:10, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, SqueakBox. I agree that the template is not in my userspace, I'm sorry you misunderstood me. I was meaning to suggest that POV is allowed on the userpages of editors who wish to indicate that, not only do they not wish to be administrators, but that they do not ever wish to be one. I fully support your goals to have a userbox that indicates lack of interest in being an administrator without the qualifications. You have no need to be concerned about reversions, I would not dream of getting into a revert war with you. And you may be fully reassured that I do not think Wikipedia belongs to me. Happy editing! <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 21:37, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
