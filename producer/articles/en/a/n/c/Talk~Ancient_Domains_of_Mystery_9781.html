SIs are consider artifacts. They make excellent sacrafices to your deity.</p>
<p>-Z</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, that too... am I allowed to ask a question about this game here? Because if so, I need help getting my deity to like me again... any time I offer ANYTHING it just says the item disappears and "Nothing else happens." What do I do? -- Lychosis</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Okay, seriously, you need to keep sacraficing things. Try a live sacrafice, lure a creature over the alter then "O"ffer it. This really pleases deities, but be careful what creature you sacrafice (don't sacrafice a lawful creature to a lawful deity). Also, be careful not to get sacraficed BY the creature by hanging out on the alter. There is nothing worse than having a level 24 charictar with some really *awesome* items, and stepping on an alter only to be sacraficed by a giant rat. Hope that helps!</p>
<p>-Z</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Ahhhh... well, that's probably a good idea... but I find non-neutral monsters are kinda hard to come by for me... and I didn't think giant rats could sacrifice you. I thought it was only sentient monsters, like goblins and hags and imps and the many other things that have sacrificed me. -- Lychosis</dd>
</dl>
<p>It might have been a a non-rat. It was some stupid insignifigant creature. ADOM is very hard. How far have you gotten? What is with the new temple of bugs?</p>
<p>Onetime I fought a moloch, and I couldnt even hurt him. So I lead him up about 10 levels to the ONE alter of my deity. I lured him on it in hopes of sacraficing him and having my deity pleased. Then I got this message (summerized):</p>
<p>The molich steps on the alter, and it crumbles. &lt;Great, Im fucked&gt; .. .. You hear a booming voice "HOW DARE YOU DEFILE....", a Bolt of lightning strikes the molch <i>.. .. The molich shrugs of the bolt. &lt;Now Im fucked again&gt;</i></p>

<dd>Eh, not that far... I made a Gray Elven Wizard yesterday. I'm at the arena now. I'm invisible, can see invisible, I teleport at random times, have teleport control, am cursed and doomed, have 25 learning, 19 willpower, 21 mana (Starting stats.). I had encounters in the wilderness EVERY SECOND STEP.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, doesn't the Moloch laugh when it shrugs off the bolt?</p>
<p>I think so. I didn't see the humor in it though. I hate how one little mistake can cost a charictar you've had for months. Ive found a neat way to get mid level quickly. Get a drakling elementalist with rings of fire resistance. Drakings speed up in hot enviorments, so they are lightning quick in the fire temple. A level one elementalist can blast fire dragons with frost bolts so fast, he levels enough to keep from dying to heat.</p>
<p>I have also made it to the guy who makes steal golems. I wonder what his purpose is. I found a way to cheat, and ended up collecting all orbs except one, and the evil warlock gaurding it killed me with a death ray. HOW do you avoid DEATH rays!?</p>
<p>Oh, and Greater Karmic "W"urms are <b>not</b> friendly.</p>
<p>The game is really fun and unique</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I think the ancient mummy wrapping gives you resistance to death rays. Maybe I'm wrong.
<dl>
<dd>You're right, it does. There's also an amulet that grants death-ray resistance.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarksman45_03d0.html" title="User:Marksman45">Marksman45</a> 19:15, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I went to the cave with the steel golem... it killed me. Badly. And another question, how fast DO drakelings get? -- Lychosis</dd>
</dl>
<p>Steel Golems are weak against electricity. My level 1 drakelings get about 120-130 in the temple of fire. But everything burns up without a ring of fire (hard to get ring of fire &amp; ring of fire resistance early on). By eating quicklings I got him up to a really high speed later one, which I suspect would compound in the firey temple.</p>
<p>A note of caution: if you stay in the temple of fire too long, the draklings get dizzy and start to have problems.</p>
<p>So, have you found any use for the stone circle, the fortess village, or the gremlin cave? All this talk is going to make me start playing again. &lt;sigh&gt; <a href="../../../z/t/s/User%7EZtsmart_76f4.html" title="User:Ztsmart">Ztsmart</a> 20:01, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If I remember right, that crone in the fortress village (hidden in a room only accessible by teleportation) will tell you to talk to "the mutated one"; by that I think she means the demented ratling in the dwarf city, who is connected to the stone circle.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarksman45_03d0.html" title="User:Marksman45">Marksman45</a> 19:15, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Say, did you ever find that little girl's dog alive? That's a hard quest. <a href="../../../z/t/s/User%7EZtsmart_76f4.html" title="User:Ztsmart">Ztsmart</a> 20:03, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've heard you need to get to the dog within 4 days of game time for it to be alive. I've never seen it alive, myself.
<dl>
<dd>4 days is true. If you get the quest first thing at the start of the game, then go straight for the cave, then go straight to the bottom floor (carefully avoiding the lesser vault, since you'll be low on experience from descending as rapidly as possible). Although even when you find the dog alive, it has a knack for getting itself killed.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarksman45_03d0.html" title="User:Marksman45">Marksman45</a> 19:15, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As for the gremlin cave, it contains an almost worthless artifact called the "Phial of" something. All it does is take up all of your power points to generate light.</p>
<p>We should post a few of our screenshots from interesting places on here. If I get back to an intersting place, Ill take a screen shot and put it up. Maybe we can put some of the images in the article. The game does a great job of having a lot of mystery about several places, and I would like to learn more about the places I don't know much about</p>
<p>Did you figure out how to get by the banshee?&#160;:) 199.201.168.100 15:46, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To get past the banshee you need to plug your ears with bees wax. You get that by clearing out a bee hive (Really hard to do unless you have a strong melee, or strong magic, and high DV). After you clear out all the normal bees the queen comes out and you kill it. It drops bees wax and gelee royale.</dd>
<dd>And putting screenshots here isn't a bad idea... I could put one from the gremlin cave... that place is nasty. I've starved to death in there because I couldn't bash my way through the gremlins...</dd>
<dd>It's really hard to get in, get the phial, and get out without gremlins almost filling the entire dungeon. Also, you'd think you would get something for clearing out an ant nest, but you don't really get anything special. If there's a tension room on the dungeon level that you're on, earthquake is right funny to use. -- Lychosis</dd>
</dl>
<p>So have you actually cleared out the room of gremlins? They reproduce to quickly. I suppose if you killed all of them, the cave would be empty.</p>
<p>Ive always wanted to get to the cat lord and get his ring, but never have. Damn that game is hard. I did get the Baby dragon from Terenio back to his mommy. I got a really nice trident for doing so.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the Orcle &amp; Old crone, as well as Hawkslayer the adventurer (all in the fortress town)? Ive been told the Orcle is where you get one of the trinity, but have been unable to confirm this. I am also intriged by the temple of the bugs (added in a resent version).</p>
<p>199.201.168.100 16:30, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The cat lord's ring is easiest to obtain if you're a bard - just calm down all cats you meet with your music. If you're not a bard, there are certain food items that will calm down (or even tame) each kind of cat (several other creatures can be placated in this way as well; experiment!). As for Hawkslayer... have you ever played the Bard's Tale series? The old ones, that is, not the Xbox game. Hawkslayer is from one of those (either #2 or #3), as well as the password that he asks for if you're high enough level when you talk to him. Give him the password and he'll travel &amp; fight alongside you. The password is also available within ADOM from a cryptic message that sometimes results from drinking from magical pools.</dd>
<dd>Hope those hints help -- didn't want to spoil it for you right away&#160;:) <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarksman45_03d0.html" title="User:Marksman45">Marksman45</a> 19:15, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>As for the gremlins, do you know the Light spell? Start casting it over and over again. Every casting hurts every gremlin within range of the light burst. I went through and got it up to +40 on a High Elf Wizard and killed about 1200 gremlins. Fun times. Also, if you wear a wedding ring, the banshee's scream won't kill you. It's easier just to use beeswax, though. For extra awesomeness, lead the Banshee up to the Animated Forest. She instantly kills every tree within range of her scream, and they drop loot by the metric ton. Just watch out, because as she kills them she gains experience and she'll still be attacking you, so it's more than possible for her to simply beat your ass to death. I can't recommend the ADOM Guidebook highly enough, it's been invaluable for playing ADOM. Well, that and savescumming. I know I suck, but I don't want to continue getting whooped over. and over. and over again... I had enough of that in NetHack. PratzStrike 18:35, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Would it be possible to email saved game files? and play someone else's charictar?</p>
<p>199.201.168.100 17:35, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The ADOM Guidebook is also a good resource for almost every question asked on this page - and those that will be in the future. It contains almost everything you need to know from monsters, to weapons, to ULE Special info etc etc etc. It can be found on <a href="http://www.andywlms.com/adom/adomgb-toc.html" class="external free" title="http://www.andywlms.com/adom/adomgb-toc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.andywlms.com/adom/adomgb-toc.html</a> <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELochok_a9d7.html" title="User:Lochok">Lochok</a> 12:37, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am sick of this.ADOM is a computer game far outweighing every last roguelike RPG in difficulty.</p>
<p>Why in God's name can't be savescumming allowed except the only one way I found?(I am angry because it took too much of my time without it before.)I have finished as a gnome wizard,Rumtuggle,</p>
<p>As a troll healer,Hipokrat,born in candle month,it was the most difficult,i died in every encounter with a giant rat.</p>
<p>As a Orc Barbarian,Gork,was far the easiest.Ultimate ending.</p>
<p>Whatever,I now want to finish the game in ultimate mode in other alignments as well.The only time i managed it was the Ork Barbarian,and Lawful.</p>
<p>Thomas Biskup shows a major piece of German iron will for order,but fucks up humble gamers such as I.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Don't like it? Don't play it. The game is definitly beatable without save scumming - I have done so once. The game was meant to be hard, and that's where half the fun lies. <a href="../../../t/o/r/User%7ETorte_51d5.html" title="User:Torte">Torte</a> 20:23, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is it really necessary to have three different ADOM MobyGames links? <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELochok_a9d7.html" title="User:Lochok">Lochok</a> 23:11, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What do you think about add one more link - link to Polish ADoM's forum (<a href="http://adom.phx.pl/forum/" class="external free" title="http://adom.phx.pl/forum/" rel="nofollow">http://adom.phx.pl/forum/</a>? This forum exist over 2 years, have over 200 members (more than 30 is active) and over 30k posts. I think that this link should be add&#160;:P Therendil</p>

<p>Right now, the article doesn't seem very neutral to me, especially the "some significant features" section. It might also need some cleanup... <a href="../../../t/o/r/User%7ETorte_51d5.html" title="User:Torte">Torte</a> 12:34, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed the useless history section which was an exact copy from the ADOM's homepage. IMHO a link to the history page would suffice instead of copypasting the page here. <a href="../../../a/r/s/User%7EArsestar_1b74.html" title="User:Arsestar">Arsestar</a> 14:12, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
