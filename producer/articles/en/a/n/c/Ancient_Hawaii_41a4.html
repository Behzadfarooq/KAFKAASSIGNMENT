<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Hawaii_41a4.html" title="Edit section: Polynesian Triangle">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Polynesian Triangle</span></h2>
<p>To understand Hawaiian native history and culture, one must understand the greater Polynesian phenomenon. Hawai<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i is the apex of the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polynesian_Triangle_5767.html" title="Polynesian Triangle">Polynesian Triangle</a>, a region of the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Ocean_bdb7.html" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> anchored by three island groups: Hawai<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i, Rapa Nui (<a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter_Island_8966.html" title="Easter Island">Easter Island</a>) and Aotearoa (<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>). The many island cultures within the Polynesian Triangle share similar languages derived from a <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malayo-Polynesian_languages_206d.html" title="Malayo-Polynesian languages">proto-Malayo-Polynesian language</a> used in <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southeast_Asia_4c93.html" title="Southeast Asia">Southeast Asia</a> 5,000 years ago. Polynesians also share cultural traditions, such as religion, social organization, myths, and material culture. Anthropologists believe that all Polynesians have descended from a South Pacific proto-culture created by an Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian) people that had migrated from <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southeast_Asia_4c93.html" title="Southeast Asia">Southeast Asia</a>.</p>

<p>Polynesian seafarers were skilled ocean navigators and <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronomy.html" title="Astronomy">astronomers</a>. At a time when Western boats rarely went out of sight of land, they often traveled long distances on fleets of carefully crafted canoes that could withstand ocean winds and waves.</p>
<p>The early settlement history of Hawai<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i is still not completely resolved. Some believe that the first Polynesians arrived in Hawai<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i in the 3rd century from the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marquesas.html" title="Marquesas">Marquesas</a> and were followed by <a href="../../../t/a/h/Tahiti.html" title="Tahiti">Tahitian</a> settlers in 1300 AD who conquered the original inhabitants. Others believe that there was only a single, extended period of settlement. Patrick Kirch, in his 2001 <i>Hawaiiki</i>, argues for an extended period of contact but not necessarily for a Tahitian invasion:</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is substantial archaeological as well as paleoecological evidence confirming Hawaiian settlement no later than AD 800, and quite possibly as early as AD 300–500 (Kirch 1985; Athens 1997). The immediate source of the colonizing population in Hawai'i is likely to have been the Southern Marquesas, but continued contact between Hawai'i and islands in the core region is indicated by linguistic evidence (lexical borrowings from the Tahitic subgroup), abundant oral traditions (Cachola-Abad 1993), botanical indications, uniquely shared mtDNA sequences in populations of the Pacific Rat (Matisoo-Smith et al. 1998), and possibly some archaeological style changes as well. However, long-distance voyaging between Hawai'i and the central Eastern Polynesian core became less frequent after about AD 1200, and was little more than a memory encoded in Hawaiian oral traditions by the time of European contact. (Kirch 2001, p. 80)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The only evidence for a Tahitian conquest of the islands are the legends of <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaiiloa.html" title="Hawaiiloa">Hawai<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>iloa</a> and the navigator-priest <a href="../../../p/a/27/Pa%27ao.html" title="Pa'ao">Pa<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>ao</a>, who is said to have made a voyage between Hawai<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i and the island of "Kahiki" (Tahiti) and introduced many new customs. Some Hawaiians believe that there was a real historical Pa'ao. Early historians, such as Fornander and Beckwith, also subscribed to this Tahitian invasion theory, but later historians, such as Kirch, simply do not mention it.</p>
<p>Some writers believe that there were other settlers in Hawai'i, peoples who were forced back into remote valleys by newer arrivals. They claim that stories about <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menehune.html" title="Menehune">menehune</a>, little people who built heiaus and fishponds, prove the existence of ancient peoples who settled the islands before the Hawaiians. The best survey of these stories, all collected in the latter part of the 19th century, is found in Beckwith's <i>Hawaiian mythology</i>, pp. 321-336. Luomala, in her 1951 essay on the menehune, argues that these stories, like stories of "dog people" with tails living in deep forests, are folklore and not to be construed as evidence of an earlier race. Archaeologists have found no evidence suggesting earlier settlements and menehune legends are simply not mentioned or discussed in current archaeological literature.</p>
<p>However, there is one puzzling artifact on the island of <a href="../../../k/a/u/Kauai.html" title="Kauai">Kaua<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i</a>, one that has never been satisfactorily explained. Running alongside the Waimea River is an ancient aqueduct known as the "Menehune ditch." This channel once brought water from the Waimea River to irrigate <a href="../../../t/a/r/Taro.html" title="Taro">taro</a> fields. The rocks were shaped into rectangular bricks and carefully fitted together — a method of stonework requiring immense labor, and not typical of Hawaiian rockwork. This ditch is currently believed to have been constructed before Captain Cook's first visit.</p>

<p>The colonists brought along with them clothing, plants and livestock and established settlements along the coasts and larger valleys. They grew <i>kalo</i> (taro), <i>mai<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>a</i> (banana), <i>niu</i> (coconut), <i>ulu</i> (breadfruit) as soon as they arrived, and built <i>hale</i> (homes) and <i>heiau</i> (temples). Archaeologists currently believe that the first settlements were on the southern end of the Big Island of Hawai'i and that they quickly extended northwards, along the seacoasts and the easily accessible river valleys. As the population increased, settlements were made further inland.</p>
<p><a name="Village" id="Village"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Hawaii_41a4.html" title="Edit section: Village">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Village</span></h2>
<p>A traditional village of ancient Hawai<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i included several structures. Listed in order of importance:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Heiau</b>, temple to the gods. They were built on high-rising stone terraces and adorned with wood and stone carved idols. A source of great <i>mana</i> or divine power, the heiau was restricted to <i>ali<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i</i>, the king and <i>kahuna</i>, or priests.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Hale ali<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i</b>, the house of the chief. It was used as a residence for the high chief and meeting house of the lesser chiefs. It was always built on a raised stone foundation to represent high social standing. Kahili, or feather standards, were placed outside to signify royalty. Women and children were banned from entering.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Hale pahu</b>, the house of the sacred hula instruments. It held the pahu drums. It was treated as a religious space as hula was a religious activity in honor of the goddess <i>Laka</i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Hale papa<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>a</b>, the house of royal storage. It was built to store royal implements including fabrics, prized nets and lines, clubs, spears and other weapons.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Hale ulana</b>, the house of the weaver. It was the house where craftswomen would gather each day to manufacture the village baskets, fans, mats and other implements from dried pandanus leaves called <i>lauhala</i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Hale ,ua</b>, the men's eating house. It was considered a sacred place because it was used to carve stone idols of <i><font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>aumakua</i> or ancestral gods. Men and women could not eat with each other for fear that men were vulnerable while eating to have their mana, or divine spirit, stolen by women. Women ate at their own separate eating house called the <i>hale <font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>aina</i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Hale wa<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>a</b>, the house of the canoe. It was built along the beaches as a shelter for their fishing vessels. Hawaiians also stored koa or mahogany logs used to craft the canoes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Hale lawai<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>a</b>, the house of fishing. It was built along the beaches as a shelter for their fishing nets and lines. Nets and lines were made by a tough rope fashioned from woven coconut husks. Fish hooks were made of human, pig or dog bone. Implements found in the <i>hale lawai<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>a</i> were some of the most prized possessions of the entire village.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Hale noho</b>, the living house. It was built as sleeping and living quarters for the Hawaiian family unit.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Imu</b>, the communal earth oven. Dug in the ground, it was used to cook the entire village's food including <i>pua<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>a</i> or pork. Only men cooked using the <i>imu</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Caste_system" id="Caste_system"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Hawaii_41a4.html" title="Edit section: Caste system">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Caste system</span></h2>
<p>Ancient Hawai<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i was a <a href="../../../c/a/s/Caste.html" title="Caste">caste society</a>. People were born into specific social classes; social mobility was not unknown, but it was extremely rare. The main classes were:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ali<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i</b>, the royal class. This class consisted of the high and lesser chiefs of the realms. They governed with divine power called <i>mana</i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Kahuna</b>, the priestly and professional class. Priests conducted religious ceremonies, at the heiau and elsewhere. Professionals included master carpenters and boatbuilders, chanters, dancers, genealogists, and physicians and healers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Maka<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>āinana</b>, the commoner class. Commoners farmed, fished, and exercised the simpler crafts. They labored not only for themselves and their families, but to support the chiefs and kahuna.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Kauwa</b>, the outcast or slave class. They are believed to have been war captives, or the descendents of war captives. Marriage between higher castes and the kauwa was strictly forbidden. The kauwa worked for the chiefs and were often used as human sacrifices at the <i><a href="../../../l/u/a/Luakini.html" title="Luakini">luakini</a> heiau</i>. (They were not the only sacrifices; law-breakers of all castes or defeated political opponents were also acceptable as victims.)</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Land_tenure" id="Land_tenure"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Hawaii_41a4.html" title="Edit section: Land tenure">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Land tenure</span></h2>
<p>The great chiefs owned all the land in the areas which they controlled. They allocated control of portions of the land to their kinsmen and retainers, who then apportioned land to the commoners.</p>
<p>On the death of one chief and the accession of another, lands were re-apportioned -- some of the previous "owners" would lose their lands, and others would gain them. Lands were also re-apportioned when one chief defeated another, and re-distributed the conquered lands as rewards to his warriors.</p>
<p>In practice, commoners had some security against capricious re-possession of their houses and farms. They were usually left in place, to pay tribute and supply labor to a new chief, under the supervision of a new <i>konohiki</i>, or overseer.</p>
<p>This system of land tenure is similar to the <a href="../../../f/e/u/Feudalism.html" title="Feudalism">feudal system</a> prevalent in Europe during the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>.</p>
<p>The main landholding unit in Hawai'i was the <i>ahupua'a</i>, a triangular slice of land running from the mountains in the center of an island down to the seashore. An island would be cut like a pie into a number of ahupua'a, usually defined by river valleys. Most ahupua'a contained all the resources necessary for life: a seashore for fishing and perhaps gathering on the reef, a river for drinking, bathing, and irrigation, forested uplands for timber and wild foods. All inhabitants of the ahupua'a shared the right to fish in the commonly-held waters, or gather in the uplands. Outsiders could fish or gather only with the permission of the residents.</p>
<p>Some ahupua'a were larger than others and were sub-divided into smaller units. Some were incomplete. A fishing village on a rocky shore might form an ahupua'a rich in fish and lacking in everything else. These villagers had to barter fish for taro and sweet potato.</p>
<p>Most villages were built close to the shore, for easy access to fishing grounds. However, as the Hawaiian population increased over the centuries, inland villages sprang up as well. Like the fishing villages, they had to barter for the foods they could not get for themselves.</p>
<p>Every ahupua'a owed taxes, in the form of produce, crafts, and labor, to the chiefs who "owned" the land. These demands could be onerous. Ancient Hawaiian tales speak of the chiefs as ravenous land sharks, who devoured the work of the commoners.</p>
<p><a name="Kapu_system" id="Kapu_system"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Hawaii_41a4.html" title="Edit section: Kapu system">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Kapu system</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">Religion</a> held ancient Hawaiian society together, affecting habits, lifestyles, work methods, social policy and law. The legal system was based on religious <i>kapu</i>, or <a href="../../../t/a/b/Taboo.html" title="Taboo">taboos</a>. There was a correct way to live, to worship, to eat, even to have sex. Examples of <i>kapu</i> included the provision that men and women could not eat together. Fishing was limited to specified seasons of the year. The shadow of the <i>ali<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i</i> must not be touched as it was stealing his <i>mana</i>. Violating kapu even by accident was punishable by death.</p>
<p><i>Kapu</i> was derived from traditions and beliefs from Hawaiian worship of gods, demigods and ancestral <i>mana</i>. The forces of nature were personified as the main gods of Kū (God of War), <a href="../../../k/%C4%81/n/K%C4%81ne_Milohai_92b6.html" title="Kāne Milohai">Kāne</a> (God of Light and Life), and <a href="../../../l/o/n/Lono.html" title="Lono">Lono</a> (God of Harvest and Rebirth). Famous lesser gods include <a href="../../../p/e/l/Pele_%28mythology%29.html" title="Pele (mythology)">Pele</a> (Goddess of Fire) and her sister <a href="../../../h/i/27/Hi%27iaka.html" title="Hi'iaka">Hi<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>iaka</a> (Goddess of Water). In a famous creation story, the demigod <a href="../../../m/%C4%81/u/M%C4%81ui_%28Hawaiian_mythology%29_b1e7.html" title="Māui (Hawaiian mythology)">Māui</a> fished the islands of Hawai<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i from the sea after a little mistake he made on a fishing trip. From <a href="../../../h/a/l/Haleakala.html" title="Haleakala">Haleakalā</a>, Māui ensnared the sun in another story, forcing him to slow down so there was equal periods of darkness and light each day.</p>
<p><a name="Chiefs" id="Chiefs"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Hawaii_41a4.html" title="Edit section: Chiefs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Chiefs</span></h2>
<p>The four biggest islands, Hawai<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i proper, Maui, Kaua<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i and O<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>ahu were generally ruled by their own Ali<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i aimoku, high chiefs (also called king, local king). Under them, subordinate district ali<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i controlled their petty fiefs.</p>
<p>All these dynasties were interrelated. They all regarded native Hawaiian people (and possibly all humans) as descendants of legendary parents, <a href="../../../w/a/k/Wakea.html" title="Wakea">Wakea</a> (symbolizing the air) and his wife Papa (symbolizing the earth). Their legend is similar to other creation legends, such as Adam and Eve.</p>
<p>During the late 18th century, the kingdom of the island of <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaii_%28island%29.html" title="Hawaii (island)">Hawai<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i</a> is known to have fragmented into several independent chiefdoms. Internecine warfare between them became common. There apparently was no longer an ali<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i aimoku controlling the island.</p>
<p>In the beginning of 19th century, high chiefs of major islands were considered the "twenty-and-something" ali<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i aimoku to hold their positions, according to count of monarchs in each realm based on Hawaiian legends. One century averagely contains three to five biological generations. Allowing for successions of siblings and such, however any experiential dynastical research generally allows less than ten successive monarchs in one century in average. Concluded from this, the Ali<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i Aimoku dynasties were then (around 1800 CE) three to six centuries old. The Tahitian invasion of the Hawaiian islands, reportedly extinguishing all the previous population, is believed to have taken place in the 13th century CE. Ali<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i Aimoku lordships were presumably established rather soon after the invasion.</p>

<p>Ancient Hawaiian economy became complex over time. People began to specialize in specific skills. Generations of families became committed to certain careers: roof thatchers, house builders, stone grinders, bird catchers who would make the feather cloaks of the <i>ali<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i</i>, canoe builders. Soon, entire islands began to specialize in certain skilled trades. <a href="../../../o/a/h/Oahu.html" title="Oahu">O<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>ahu</a> became the chief <i>kapa</i> (tapa bark cloth) manufacturer. <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maui.html" title="Maui">Maui</a> became the chief canoe manufacturer. The island of <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaii_%28island%29.html" title="Hawaii (island)">Hawai<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i</a> exchanged bales of dried fish.</p>

<p>Discovery of the Hawaiian islands marked the official end of the ancient Hawai<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i period and beginning of Hawai<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i's modern era. In <a href="../../../1/7/7/1778.html" title="1778">1778</a>, British Captain <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Cook_83d3.html" title="James Cook">James Cook</a> landed first on <a href="../../../k/a/u/Kauai.html" title="Kauai">Kaua<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i</a>, then sailed southwards to observe and explore the other islands in the chain.</p>
<p>When he first arrived, some of the natives believed Cook was their god <a href="../../../l/o/n/Lono.html" title="Lono">Lono</a>. Cook's mast and sails coincidentally resembled the emblem (a mast and sheet of white tapa) that symbolized Lono in their religious rituals; the ships arrived during the <a href="../../../m/a/k/Makahiki.html" title="Makahiki">Makahiki</a> season dedicated to Lono.</p>
<p>Captain Cook was eventually killed during a violent confrontation between natives and British sailors. Cook's body was left behind on the beach by his retreating sailors. The British demanded that his body be returned, but the Hawaiians had already offered the body as a sacrifice at the heiau (temple). The flesh had then been stripped from the bones and the bones prepared for burial. The Hawaiian historian Kamakau says that the Hawaiians returned only some of the bones. (Kamakau 1961, pp. 103-104)</p>
