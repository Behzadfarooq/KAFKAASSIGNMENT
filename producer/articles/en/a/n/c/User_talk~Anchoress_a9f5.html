<p>Before you tag something as a copyvio, make sure you have a look at the page history. It's very clear from the page history that that article is the work of various editors spanning at least 5 years. In addition, the page you said it was copied from clearly credited Wikipedia (although not enough for <i>them</i> not to be in violation of the GFDL). Please be more careful when tagging articles - almost all our articles are mirrored <i>somewhere</i>. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 14:05, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I certainly will continue to make every effort to be careful about copyvio tags, and I ask that you take a generous, open-minded approach to your communication. I did look at the page history, quite carefully actually, and I did not see what you saw. Furthermore, I looked carefully at the site I cited as the copyvio source and I did not see a credit to Wikipedia. I thank you to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume goodwill</a> of your fellow editors, we are just doing our best. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 14:14, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you very much, anchoress. I'm particularly a newbie on wikipedia and found the pregnancy fetishism article, which is shocking. To know an actual pregnancy experience (I had 3 children, 2 sons and a daughter) will tell them striaght forward. I hope they got disgusted and rather not obsess over her hypersexually, but I truly feel pregnancy has a beauty attached to it by the greatness of god or whatever you believe in, it's all the same in the mystique and sanctity of women giving birth to new babies to the world. For starters, Pregnancy isn't to look "sexually abnormal", a major obnoxious theme in prego fetish web sites and chat forums. All right have a good day. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 63.3.14.1 (<a href="../../../6/3/2E/User_talk%7E63.3.14.1.html" title="User talk:63.3.14.1">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_63.3.14.1_4c71.html" title="Special:Contributions/63.3.14.1">contribs</a>) 00:09, 26 January 2007.</small></p>

<p>It was lots of fun! Thank you for asking. I have a particularly vivid memory of the start of Christmas Day. We had been for dinner and were outside trying to get a taxi-an impossible task. Anyway, no sooner did midnight arrive than people began to celebrate the arrival of Christmas by throwing fire-crackers from their balconies. And what crackers they were: it was as if the city had suddenly descended into a war! Talking of war, I managed to pick up basic tango steps with the help of some very nice Argentinian gentlemen. <i>Sigh</i>-it all seems so long ago now. Still, ever forward. I will be spending most of February in Mexico City, another new experience.

Per <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_adminship_ee2f.html#We_need_more_fucking_admins" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship">this discussion</a>, I'm dropping a friendly note to some of the recently-promoted admins requesting help with speedy deletions. I am <i>not</i> an administrator, so if you don't feel comfortable diving into deletions - or if you need more info - please <i>don't</i> come to me, but I'm sure that <a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde Weys</a> would be happy to guide you if you want to help. Any help is great, but I'm sure that Cyde and others would deeply appreciate it if you could put the page on your watchlist and do a bit of work there on a regular basis? Maybe weekly?

<p>I also appreciated the template message.

<p>I'm typically fairly active in WP:UCFD, and though I have been distracted lately from WP:CFD work by other Wikipedia things, I intend to be more active there as my next priority. However, I'd be glad to help in the apparent current "crisis", though I tend to stay away from Images... - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">jc37</a> 10:50, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, Anchoress. I stole your template from the top of this page and put it on my <a href="../../../s/l/u/User_talk%7ESluzzelin_ccce.html" title="User talk:Sluzzelin">talk page</a>, but left you an exact copy.

<dd>Right... I think you used the right word; you mean my notice at the top of the page v/v keeping convos together? I just didn't get what you meant by taking it and leaving a copy? Sorry, I put that thing up almost a year ago I think, and I don't even remember where I got it. Is it your template, and you changed your version and subst'd the old one on my page so it wouldn't change?

<p>I don't think that was a very good idea to write in a public place, FYI. This isn't a disagreement with the facts, per se, but an experienced user expecting backlash.

<dd>(ec) I was gunna say something about it too. The problem with making guesses about the cause of someone's behavior is that it's just way too easy for things to get ugly. And, <i>they are just guesses</i>, be they correct or not. We can't know what's in someone's head. Best to focus purely on observable behavior and keep speculations to ourselves. I realize you're just giving your opinions and trying to help, and I hope nobody jumps down your throat about it, but I'd seriously consider ammending that remark if I were you. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 18:47, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>EC. Well if you read my response to Hipocrite, I already removed it so I don't need to amend it. FWIW I absolutely don't mind backlash for giving my opinion, and I did say at the bottom of my post that I realised I was stepping into uncharted waters. I gave my opinion about something, I am happy to defend it or apologise for it. <s>And also FWIW I think there is ample evidence that Lc is OCD (his multiple minor adjustments of entries), paranoid (his reactions to criticism), narcissistic (his grandstanding, the way he talks 'to the masses' on his talkpage), and suffering from a persecution complex (see above).</s> But... bottom line is I had already removed it when you posted, so I guess unless a bunch of other people don't notice that or comment anyways, the matter is closed. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 18:52, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When I make a mistake, and I'm called on it, I never hesitate to admit my guilt. Yes, lowering myself to the level of others was wrong, and I admit that mistake.</p>
<p>Yet there's a serious injustice going on here at Wikipedia. Certain users are pretty much getting away with murder when it comes to incivility, yet the admins seem to be oblivious about it all. I actually got blocked today for calling someone a coward, which, admittedly, was wrong. Yet take a look at the shockingly disgusting exchange of insults on the RefDesk talk page in the discussion entitled "Not a soapbox". Why are certain users allowed to attack others as being "intellectually impoverished wankers", among dozens of other equally disgusting insults, without even getting so much as a warning, while, at the same time, my referring to someone as a "coward" (which, though admittedly insulting, is not the least bit vulgar) gets me blocked?</p>
<p>I hope you can understand how frustrating it can be to be forced to play on such an uneven playing field. Yes it was a mistake to call hipocrite a coward, I just lost my cool.</p>
<p>I just only wish that everyone were subject to the same rules. I honestly believe that if that were the case, much of this nonsensical hostility would disappear. The admins just don't seem to realize, but in ignoring Clio's insulting remarks, and given her young age, they're creating a monster. They're basically telling her that she can insult others to her heart's content and not get the slightest warning about it, because, as we all know, she's always right, and everyone else is always wrong.</p>
<p>These are the worst possible of messages to be sending a <s>obnoxious, arrogant</s> 24 year old girl. She's obviously intelligent, and one would hope, for her sake at least, that her intelligence be tempered with discipline and humility. If only an admin would send her a warning: "Look, Clio, you've got to tone it down, your insults of others are just as innapropriate as those directed at you. If you're criticized, that doesn't invariably mean that the world is out to get you in some sort "witch-hunt". You've got to learn to show some respect for others if you expect them to show respect for you". That's all.</p>
<p>Like I said, she's a very intelligent girl with a great deal of potential. And I wish her the best in achieving that potential. <s>Yet she's desperately lacking in social skills.</s> If someone doesn't finally put their foot down, put her in her place, and tell her when she's acting inappropriately, she'll never achieve that potential, and that would be a shame.</p>
<p>But there's only so much I can do. After all, I've done quite well for myself and live a happy and successful life. It's her life and happiness that are at stake here. I can try here and there, but without any support, and on top of that getting blocked for a silly mistake really doesn't help.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've gone on too long. I'd be really interested in your feedback, though.</p>
<p>Write back if you can.</p>

<dd>Hi, Loomis51:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks a lot for the reply, and your gracious actions. I know what you mean about 'taking the coaching'; it's been my operating philosophy at WP (and my compliance is <i>pretty</i> good, lol), and I think it's kept me sane.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As to your other concern, well, I don't have much to say because I haven't been following it closely enough for analysis. But since you've asked for my opinion, I'll at least say what is on my mind. To put it bluntly, I think you should drop it v/v Clio; as a wise person once told me, <i>"There's no cheese down that hole."</i> I'm not commenting on who's right, who's wrong, who started it, etc, but I implore you to be the one to finish it. Just drop it, file it under Written Off Debts, and continue editing constructively.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If Clio irritates you that much (and I have had similar experiences with editors), unless you are willing to pursue it formally, just, for your own sanity, gloss over her contributions, discipline yourself to ignore her talk page entries, and ignore her. I've done that with some editors and it saved my Wikilife. There are many editors whose intellect and experience are appropriate for WP but whose personalities are not. IMO <b>I</b> am not an appropriate judge of that distinction, and neither are you. If an editor can't hack the community, they will crash and burn in due time without your help. <i><b>Don't be that person.</b></i> (The one who crashes and burns). You are well on your way, IMO, to becoming the person other editors shake their heads about (as I did with two editors recently) and say to themselves, 'That editor is either going to flounce in a huff or be permablocked.' <i><b>Stay frosty.</b></i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To put it another way, I think one of the first rules of functioning happily on WP is to accept that WP is grossly unfair, manifestly so. I'm not commenting on the unfairness or perceived unfairness of your particular situation, I want to be very clear on that. I'm just saying in general. And the abiliy of an editor to accept that fact is IMO the greatest indicator of whether or not they'll be able to function on WP and contribute constructively.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I wish you well in your RL and WL, and I hope we intersect in happier circumstances. IMO that depends on you. You cannot ever control another's behaviour, only your own. Ruminating over this issue can do nothing but strangle your WP contributions and poison your RL. Don't let it do that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And finally, I feel that some of your comments regarding Clio are inappropriate; <i>"obnoxious, arrogant"</i>, <i>"desperately lacking in social skills"</i>. Whether they are accurate or not, they are unwelcome on my talkpage. Would you consider striking them? To comment on the general thrust, it's not WP's place to assist in social development; if you feel something is lacking, you will have to trust in life in general to deliver that message. But my personal advice to you is just to stop speculating, ruminating, drawing conclusions, etc, and move on. Best wishes. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 16:30, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Anchoress, I give you full credit for inspiring me to make a rather bold step. I'm sure if you check out Clio's talk page, you'll see what I'm talking about. I really don't care how she responds. Perhaps she'll accept my apologies with grace, or perhaps she'll do a little victory dance, believing that she "won" and I "lost" some sort of fictitious battle. The point is that I apologized. Her reaction to it will be irrelevant to me. All of this is not to say that I don't believe that she acted innapropriately in offending me, I've just come to realize that the two issue must be separated from each other. I'm only in control of my own words, not hers. As for her words, if she decides to apologize I'll certainly accept it with grace. If she doesn't, well, I guess there's nothing I can do about that.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the inspiration, Anchoress. I suppose it's only fitting that the one to finally inspire me to eat crow and offer peace whatever the result, would be a fellow Canadian. I'm not sure what part of the country you're from, but I'll end this message with the following most profound of words: GO HABS!!!!&#160;:--)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Congrats Loomis51 on being the better man. IMO there's no downside to rising above. I wish both of you well in turning over your two, completely separate, never-to-intersect leaves. Good luck contributing, and I am very happy to have inspired you. Go Canucks! <small>Habs are good too.</small> And BTW I don't look at it as eating crow; we are well-known for both politeness and picking our battles.

<dd>By the way, yes, you may have been my inspiration and you should of course feel great about that, but with it comes a down side. Now I'll naturally turn to you to bitch and moan every time I'm forced to bite my tongue and act polite! Just kidding, that's not your responsibility. Though I will likely have to get myself some sort of punching bag for every time I'm driven absolutely mad by yet another damned non-sequitur of a poem!</dd>
