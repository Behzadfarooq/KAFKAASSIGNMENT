It's intended to be a start of expanding the human sexuality coverage, keeping <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_sexuality.html" title="Human sexuality">human sexuality</a> as an overview of <i>all</i> of the forms of human sexuality, and using <a href="../../../f/e/m/Female_sexuality.html" title="Female sexuality">female sexuality</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/l/Male_sexuality.html" title="Male sexuality">male sexuality</a> to work on the aspects which are typically more specific to women and men respectively (but without, I hope, resorting to mere stereotyping). It's a huge topic, and the current version is rather poor -- please feel free to revise it as you see fit. A start on <a href="../../../m/a/l/Male_sexuality.html" title="Male sexuality">male sexuality</a> would be nice, too. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 02:56, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The following paragraph contains sentence fragments I can't decipher:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Justice and Islamic Affairs Minister of the United Arab Emirates, Mohammed Al Dhaheri, called it "cultural terrorism, not freedom of expression," according to the official WAM news agency. "The repercussions of such irresponsible acts will have adverse impact on international relations." In Tunisia, Abdulaziz Othman Altwaijri, president of the Islamic Organization for Education, Science and Culture (the Islamic world's counterpart to UNESCO) called the drawings "a form of racism and discrimination that one must counter by all available means." He said, <b>"It's regrettable to state today, as we are calling for dialogue, that other parties feed animosity and hate and attack sacred symbols of Muslims and of their prophet," said also Jordan's largest circulation daily, government-run Al-Rai, said the Danish government must apologize.</b> [53]</dd>

<p>Curious: Where did you hear that <i>In the Jewish annals of notable Jews, Jesus is referred to as 'He Who Must Not be Named'</i>? I've never heard this referred to before, and Google doesn't seem to corroborate much either.

<dd>It's actually a Judaic tradition that the name of God is "ineffable" and "not to be read aloud" (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahweh" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahweh" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahweh</a>)... Christianity is fond of adopting Jewish concepts and applying them to Jesus, as Christians believe that the expected Jewish Messiah was actually Jesus and therefore they have a right to culturally appropriate Judaic beliefs. By the way, thanks for the feedback on the robert pickton comment that I made... nice to not feel like I'm typing into a vacuum, and to hear from Vancouver editors...--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFennel_f531.html" title="User:Fennel">fennel</a>
<dl>
<dd>No that's not it at all, actually fennel. My friend who told me about this is an Orthodox Jew, she has no interest in Christianity. She says that in Jewish historical texts, there is a list of notable Jews going back thousands of years. It lists honourable and notorious people. The most notorious is Jesus, and he is so despicable that he is never named. He's just called 'he who must not be named'.--<a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 09:24, 22 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Interesting! I hadn't heard that before... It is also true that Christianity often attributes Judaic perspectives about God to Jesus... I've heard the term "Adonai" and other Jewish religious terminology used by Evangelical Christians in reference to Jesus, usually in songs in church... as well as the commonly heard Evangelical Christian teaching that the Jewish Messiah was in fact Jesus... I grew up in that context. It is also Judaic tradition that the name of God must not be spoken out loud, as described on the wikipedia page titled Yahweh that I referenced above. So there's a Jewish reason for Jesus to be referred to as "He Who Must Not Be Named", and a different Evangelical Christian reason for same. Complicated!--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFennel_f531.html" title="User:Fennel">fennel</a>
<dl>
<dd>Well we're all learning like sons of guns. I was already very familiar with the prescription in Judaism against saying G-d's name, but (despite knowing a lot of ECs as well) I have never heard of a prescription against using His name in Christianity.--<a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 06:28, 24 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's because there definately isn't one. I wouldn't be surprised if Jesus's name is a taboo in Jewish culture though. And Christians appropriate Jewish beliefs because Christian theology teaches that Christianity is really just Judaism that didn't refuse to accept Jesus as the accepted messiah. I never really "got" they Jewish side... they worship a God of love and when Jesus comes along preaching forgiveness and love rather than the draconian theocracy that the religious leaders of the time were pushing, and he claims the title of the messiah, and <i>doesn't</i> violently overthrow Rome, they crucify him!

<p>I think it's a myth.

<dd>My friend isn't talking about the Talmud. She says there's a list of notable Jews, thousands of years old, and Jesus is kind of the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timothy_McVey_2aff.html" title="Timothy McVey">Timothy McVey</a> of Jewish history. I mean, she lives in Israel and she's very, very religious, and she says nobody in the Orthodox community <i>ever</i> says Jesus' name, it's like if you hear his name you spit on the ground in disgust because of what a horrible seditionist he was.--<a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 12:13, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As Jesus was only born 2000 years ago, the list can't be that old and it must post-date (and be massively less notable than) the Talmud. I'm interested to know more; please ask your friend what the list is. Perhaps there's some confusion with "<a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ.html" title="Christ">Christ</a>" going on here... observant Jews won't refer to Jesus as "Christ", because the name means "annointed one", i.e. Messiah; Jews don't believe that Jesus was the Messiah. I frequently move in Orthodox (and very Orthodox) Jewish circles - the most radical expression of this that I've encountered is for people to insist on calling him by his Hebrew, Talmudic name. I've never heard of referring to Jesus in a <a href="../../../v/o/l/Voldemort.html" title="Voldemort">Voldemort</a>-type manner. Can I respectfully ask that you remove this comment from your user page? Even if it's true, it does come across as sneering and you seem like far too nice a person to be willfully indulging in sneering. --<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 12:26, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hey listen, I don't want to cause any stress here. If I remember to I'll ask her about it, we never went into details. I doubt there's been any 'confusion' over terms, but what do I know?

Every frustration that he encounters just makes him more determined that he's right and everyone else on Wikipedia is wrong, and that he should do something about it. I'm not saying don't comment on his page at all if you really have something to say, but try to keep it calm and civil.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<dd>As another third party—yeah, it really did look like you were snapping your fingers under Lou's nose. Don't kick him while he's down. If he's going to self-destruct on the wiki, allow him to do it without assistance. I'll be the first in line to block him if he steps over the line of his paroles, but I won't tolerate gratuitious incivility and taunting directed at him because he's vulnerable.

<dd>Opinion noted. FWIW I don't think I was being incivil, much less 'gratuitously incivil' (whatever that means), but I'll take the suggestions anyway. I just think it's great that he's spreading the word (literally) about cocksucking. I mean, especially since IMO no self-respecting 14 year old (even a gay one) would be caught dead reading a scholarly article on homosexuality, I think it's a real public service that Lou is making the word cocksucker available to so many more people through his repeated comments on the article in different locations on WP. But I certainly will take the suggestions of the posters here and lay off.&#160;:-)--<a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 21:07, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While it does need expansion, it doesn't need it so badly that it warrants the article being defaced for the indefinite future. Moreover, tagging it isn't likely to be very helpful, because it's unlikely to attract the sort of help this article is going to need to improve (essentially, someone with a PhD or above in gender studies). <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 04:58, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the reply. I disagree with your wording (defacement) and your reasoning, but as I said on the talk page of the article I won't get into a fight about it. I do think, however, that your attitude constitutes a dis-service to WP editors (assuming that the tag will attract more disruptive editors than helpful ones), and to visitors wanting to be informed about the topic as per WP's stated purpose for being.--<a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 05:05, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think it will attract more disruptive editors than helpful ones. It's more that it's not going to attract anyone at all with the capability of actually expanding this, and that in that case, it really isn't helpful at all to have an ugly banner that serves no purpose except to state the bleeding obvious. I'd love to see the article expanded, but short of doing a PhD on the subject, there isn't much I can do about that escept wait. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 09:42, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you're reverting vandalism, it's perfectly all right to mark a revert as minor; this is why admins' rollbacks are automatically marked as minor. If you're reverting a very minor edit, then it's good courtesy not to mark your revert as minor, but it's not that big a deal (though this latter part is just my opinion). All reverts regarding disputed content (e.g. not formatting/spelling/vandalism/etc.) should never be marked minor.

<p>Hi: you removed the merge tag from the Ann Furedi side. I'm sorry if I've used the wrong template for the tag, but I don't think it's such a good idea to just remove the tag, since then people reading that article won't know the merge is being proposed and therefore won't be able to contribute their views. If there's a better tag to use (I've seen the one I placed used on both sides of a merger), could you put it up? Or at least explain your actions on the talk page so people will know what's going on with the Merge talk?

<dd>I fear you have misunderstood my action. Both articles were tagged with the {{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMergefrom_0c79.html" title="Template:Mergefrom">mergefrom</a>}} template, thus implying that each article would be merged into the other, which is not an applicable option (incidentally if the {{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMerge_8f97.html" title="Template:Merge">merge</a>}} template had been used instead there would not have been this problem). I therefore checked the discussions and it seemed that they implied that the intended option was that the article for <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Furedi_54bf.html" title="Ann Furedi">Ann Furedi</a>, which is quite short, should be merged into that for <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Pregnancy_Advisory_Service_0582.html" title="British Pregnancy Advisory Service">BPAS</a> which is rather longer. Maybe if you read <b><a href="../../../m/e/r/Wikipedia%7EMerging_and_moving_pages_8b77.html#Proposing_a_merger" title="Wikipedia:Merging and moving pages">this</a></b> it will explain the situation better than I can.

<dd>No, I don't think I misunderstood your action; I didn't ascribe any ill-intent to it, I inferred from your edit summary that you thought - since the merge was proposed *from* Ann to BPAS - the merge template on Ann was wrong. I believe I said in my original post to you that I assumed I'd just put up the wrong template and I'm sorry for that, but I just thought it was inappropriate to leave the article with *no* merge template.

<p>Anchoress, I want to thank you for putting your two cents in on this ridiculous argument. I apologize for doing so on the discussion page of the article but for some reason, Tom feels as if I'm deleting his links and want my added. Which is not the case. I posted in discussion to see what many felt about including links for support forums and Tom took it as an attack. I was actually speaking on behalf of all support forums. Is there some way we can put this issue to vote among admins so that this issue is cleared up? At this point, I'm following policy by deleting support forum links, but I would like to know what everyone else thinks and hopefully we can add a section for these links in the future for people that want to learn more.</p>
<p>Tom's attacks are based on what is a long standing fued on his part and I apologize for it rearing it's ugly head on Wikipedia <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianZ_175b.html" title="User:BrianZ">BrianZ</a> 06:23, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi BrianZ. Well, here goes. First, unlike message boards, admins here don't have the ability to make or change policy, and they don't usually get involved in content disputes. I'm not an admin, but I've seen enough discussion about it in various places to know that it often comes up on certain pages. I think the best thing to do is to keep removing the links that contravene policy. We have to remember that this is an encyclopedia, not a place for people to get help, and no matter how much we'd like to give people useful outside links to help them, we may not be able to if they contravene policy. I believe that it might be worthwhile for you to post a request for comment or a request for mediation, and maybe some outside eyes can come in and comment; they might be able to find a way to give both you guys what you want, or they may just tell both of you to cool off and go edit something else. WP seems to have been built on a policy of de-escalation; it's common for people to be advised to back off from an issue they feel passionate/obstinate about. Hope this helps.--<a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 07:46, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
