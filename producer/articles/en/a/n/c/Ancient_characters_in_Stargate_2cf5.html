<p>Captain of the <a href="../../../a/u/r/Aurora_class_battleship.html" title="Aurora class battleship">Ancient warship</a> <i>Aurora</i> during the last days of the war with the <a href="../../../w/r/a/Wraith_%28Stargate%29_240c.html" title="Wraith (Stargate)">Wraith</a>. His ship left for the outer rim of the <a href="../../../p/e/g/Pegasus_Galaxy_%28Stargate%29_dcaf.html" title="Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)">Pegasus Galaxy</a> after <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis_%28Stargate%29_4531.html" title="Atlantis (Stargate)">Atlantis</a> had already been submerged during the first siege. He was ordered by the Atlantean Council to conduct reconnaissance on their enemy.</p>
<p>Ultimately his crew discovered a vital weakness in <a href="../../../w/r/a/Wraith_technology_in_Stargate_0add.html" title="Wraith technology in Stargate">Wraith technology</a>, information that could change the outcome of their war with the Wraith in the Ancients' favour. However, the information was not given to the Captain personally for fear of capture and coercion, and was instead stored in the ship's database. The Aurora was eventually attacked and severely damaged by the Wraith, and the crew were forced to enter <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stasis.html" title="Stasis">stasis</a> pods to save their lives.</p>
<p>Ten thousand years later, a Wraith scout ship discovered the vessel, and gained access to its systems. After killing first officer Trebal, a Wraith took her place inside her stasis pod, accessing the <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtual_reality.html" title="Virtual reality">virtual reality</a> the crew was experiencing. This Wraith's ultimate goal was to manipulate the crew of the Aurora into teaching him how to upgrade their hyperdrive technology. The captain was no longer aware that they were in fact experiencing an artificial environment, and did not realize that he was being fooled by the enemy.</p>
<p>When <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Sheppard_%28Stargate%29_0b63.html" title="John Sheppard (Stargate)">John Sheppard</a> entered the environment, the Captain suspected that he might have been telling the truth, but the Wraith impersonating Trebal convinced him Sheppard was lying. After Sheppard revealed that Trebal was a Wraith and eventually managed to explain the situation, the Aurora captain offered the information concerning the weakness in Wraith technology to Sheppard, but it had already been deleted from the database by the invading Wraith. With two Wraith cruisers approaching the Aurora and their bodies too aged to function on their own, the Captain activated the self destruct sequence. The Aurora and all hands on board were destroyed, taking two Wraith cruisers with them. The Captain's last wish was that Sheppard and his team would keep the memory of the Aurora and its valiant crew alive. <sup id="_ref-Aurora_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Aurora" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p><b>Ayiana</b> was the name given to an <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_%28Stargate%29_eeed.html" title="Ancient (Stargate)">Ancient</a> woman who lived on <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> between five and ten million years ago. When her people took the city of <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis_%28Stargate%29_4531.html" title="Atlantis (Stargate)">Atlantis</a> to the <a href="../../../p/e/g/Pegasus_Galaxy_%28Stargate%29_dcaf.html" title="Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)">Pegasus Galaxy</a>, she was the one Ancient left behind in the Ancient outpost in what would later be called <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antarctica.html" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>. <sup id="_ref-Rising_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rising" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Millions of years later, in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> (episode "<a href="../../../f/r/o/Frozen_%28Stargate_SG-1%29_3af6.html" title="Frozen (Stargate SG-1)">Frozen</a>"), she was unearthed in a block of ice not far from where the second <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stargate_%28device%29.html" title="Stargate (device)">Stargate</a> was discovered over four years before. Her name, which is the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherokee_language.html" title="Cherokee language">Cherokee</a> word for "eternal bloom", was given to her by Dr. Francine Michaels, one of the researchers who found her whose grandfather was one-quarter <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherokee.html" title="Cherokee">Cherokee</a>. (The character's true name was therefore never revealed). <a href="../../../s/g/-/SG-1_f555.html" title="SG-1">SG-1</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janet_Fraiser_36d6.html" title="Janet Fraiser">Dr. Janet Fraiser</a> were called in to study her. They were shocked to discover upon defrosting her that she was, in fact, alive in a state of cryogenic suspension.</p>
<p>She was the first indication that Ancients were advanced humans who evolved (not necessarily on Earth) millions of years ago. It was later surmised that they were the first evolution of humanity while the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humans.html" title="Humans">humans</a> currently living on Earth and throughout the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milky_Way_7069.html" title="Milky Way">Milky Way</a> are the second. After spending only a few hours with <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonas_Quinn_47f6.html" title="Jonas Quinn">Jonas Quinn</a>, she was able to fully understand every word of <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> that he said and could even speak some herself. This was another sign of how advanced she and her people were compared to present day humans. She also possessed the ability to heal almost any injury, though she was severely weakened in the process.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Ayiana carried the disease that had ravaged her people millions of years ago and infected all of the researchers, SG-1 and Fraiser. All except for <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teal%27c.html" title="Teal'c">Teal'c</a>, whose <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goa%27uld.html" title="Goa'uld">Goa'uld symbiote</a> protected him from many different types of diseases and infections, soon began to exhibit symptoms. Feeling enormously guilty for this, Ayiana used her abilities to heal them despite the huge risk to herself. She succeeded in completely healing all but <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_O%27Neill_%28Stargate%29_a913.html" title="Jack O'Neill (Stargate)">Jack O'Neill</a> before she collapsed. She was subsequently brought to the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stargate_Command_8ec6.html" title="Stargate Command">SGC</a> where she died soon afterwards from exhaustion. O'Neill, fortunately, was soon cured when he was blended with a <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tok%27ra.html" title="Tok'ra">Tok'ra symbiote</a>. <sup id="_ref-Frozen_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Frozen" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Three years later, it became known that the virus which wiped out most of the Ancients millions of years ago, the virus Ayiana carried, bears similarities to the biological weapon created by the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Ori_%28Stargate%29_ca32.html" title="Ori (Stargate)">Ori</a>. <sup id="_ref-The_Powers_That_Be_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Powers_That_Be" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p><b>Chaya Sar</b>, worshipped as <b>Athar</b> on Proculus, a planet in the <a href="../../../p/e/g/Pegasus_Galaxy_%28Stargate%29_dcaf.html" title="Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)">Pegasus Galaxy</a>, was an ascended Ancient encountered by the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis_%28Stargate%29_4531.html" title="Atlantis (Stargate)">Atlantis Expedition</a>. She was posing as the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">human</a> high priestess of Athar, living secluded from the rest of the people on Proculus. She entertained visitors from the city of Atlantis and expressed an interest in seeing the city. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Sheppard_%28Stargate%29_0b63.html" title="John Sheppard (Stargate)">Sheppard</a> allowed her to accompany them back to Atlantis in the hopes of using her planet as a sanctuary for refugees. There, she was allowed to access the human computers and learn a great deal about the spiritual beliefs of the peoples of Earth. Chaya found it disturbing that humans, even now, were at war on the Atlantis Expedition's home world. She also lit up the biometrics console, making them think she was the first human with the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Technology_Activation_gene_ba4b.html" title="Ancient Technology Activation gene">ATA gene</a> they had found in the Pegasus Galaxy.</p>
<p>She eventually took a liking to Major Sheppard and he, not knowing what she was at first, invited her to dinner and kissed her. <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodney_McKay_ea26.html" title="Rodney McKay">Rodney McKay</a> however was convinced Chaya posed a security risk, and it was McKay who, by doing some scans during an interview between Chaya and Dr. Weir, discovered her true identity. Soon after, Chaya felt ill as her planet was being attacked by the <a href="../../../w/r/a/Wraith_%28Stargate%29_240c.html" title="Wraith (Stargate)">Wraith</a>. Taking her Ascended form again, she returned to her planet through the Stargate.</p>
<p>Sheppard followed her with a <a href="../../../p/u/d/Puddle_jumper_%28Stargate%29_f2c0.html" title="Puddle jumper (Stargate)">Puddle Jumper</a>, and learned that she could not help them. When she ascended, she was unable to leave her people behind and used her powers to destroy the Wraith when they attacked Proculus. The other Ancients punished her by allowing her to protect her planet, but no one else. Over the millennia she had become lonely, and that was why she went to Atlantis. In the end, she shared herself with Sheppard by swirling her ascended energy around the both of them. <sup id="_ref-Sanctuary_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sanctuary" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>Chaya was the only encountered ascended (ANCIENT) being who could switch freely between corporeal and incorporeal form. When Orlin assumed corporeal form he was unable to become pure energy again without the help of the others, and Daniel's manifestations during his time as an ascended being were just insubstantial images. The other Ascended being who could switch freely was Shifu, the Harcesis child, he was corporeal, and Dr Fraser even took some blood from him. He ended that episode by becoming energy, and flying through the stargate.</li>

<p><b>Janus</b> was an <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_%28Stargate%29_eeed.html" title="Ancient (Stargate)">Ancient</a> scientist who lived during the first siege of <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis_%28Stargate%29_4531.html" title="Atlantis (Stargate)">Atlantis</a> by the <a href="../../../w/r/a/Wraith_%28Stargate%29_240c.html" title="Wraith (Stargate)">Wraith</a>.</p>
<p>10,000 years ago, Janus, against the orders of the Atlantean High Council, created a <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_travel.html" title="Time travel">time machine</a>, which was integrated into a <a href="../../../p/u/d/Puddle_Jumper_%28Stargate%29_d2f6.html" title="Puddle Jumper (Stargate)">Puddle Jumper</a>.</p>
<p>When Dr. <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Weir_%28Stargate%29_cf99.html" title="Elizabeth Weir (Stargate)">Elizabeth Weir</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Sheppard_%28Stargate%29_0b63.html" title="John Sheppard (Stargate)">John Sheppard</a>, and Dr. <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radek_Zelenka_e484.html" title="Radek Zelenka">Radek Zelenka</a> accidentally traveled back through time using Janus' time machine from an alternate version of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, where her expedition was stranded on a flooding Atlantis, Janus helped recover the crashed Jumper, and tended to the wounds of the only survivor, Dr. Weir.</p>
<p>Janus was receptive to Weir's story, and realised his time travel device could give Weir a chance to save the future Atlantis Expedition. However, the Atlantian Council, especially High Councilor Moros, was angered when they were confronted with a woman, 10,000 years from the future.</p>
<p>Both Weir and Janus pleaded to return her to the future, but the Council was unwilling to risk further damage to the timeline. Janus then disobeyed the orders of Moros and his fellow Councillors, and reconfigured Atlantis' <a href="../../../z/e/r/Zero_Point_Module_a8b0.html" title="Zero Point Module">Zero Point Modules</a> to enable them to last longer. He also programmed Atlantis' DHD to block all incoming wormholes except those coming from Earth. As a final fail safe he programmed the city to release itself from the ocean floor and rise to the surface in case of a catastrophic shield failure.</p>
<p>Janus betrayed his superiors again when the last Ancient survivors were leaving Atlantis for <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a>, and told Moros that Weir had already left the city. In truth, he had helped her to remain behind and put herself in <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stasis.html" title="Stasis">stasis</a>, so that she could aid her future self saving the city. <sup id="_ref-Before_I_Sleep_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Before_I_Sleep" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Janus had promised Weir that he would try to build another time machine, and it is believed that he did what he promised, despite the council's objections. Another Puddle Jumper capable of <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_travel.html" title="Time travel">time travel</a> was eventually found by <a href="../../../s/g/-/SG-1_f555.html" title="SG-1">SG-1</a> on Arkhan's planet, along with inscriptions describing the planet's history and future in Ancient, possibly written by Janus himself. <sup id="_ref-It.27s_Good_to_Be_King_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-It.27s_Good_to_Be_King" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p><b>Ganos Lal</b>, is an <a href="../../../a/s/c/Ascension_%28Stargate%29_3a10.html" title="Ascension (Stargate)">ascended</a> <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_%28Stargate%29_eeed.html" title="Ancient (Stargate)">Ancient</a> who gave rise to the legend of <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morgan_le_Fay_501e.html" title="Morgan le Fay">Morgan le Fay</a>, a character in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthurian_legend.html" title="Arthurian legend">Arthurian legend</a>.</p>
<p>Morgan le Fay, or Ganos Lal at the time, was originally an inhabitant of the Ancient city of <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis_%28Stargate%29_4531.html" title="Atlantis (Stargate)">Atlantis</a>, where she designed a holographic learning program based on her image to teach young Lantean children about Ancient technology, history and science. When it became clear that the Ancients had been defeated by the <a href="../../../w/r/a/Wraith_%28Stargate%29_240c.html" title="Wraith (Stargate)">Wraith</a>, she fled back to <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tau%27ri.html" title="Tau'ri">Earth</a> with the other surviving Ancients. There, she secluded herself in meditation, which eventually enabled her to ascend.</p>
<p>When fellow ascended Ancient <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moros_%28Stargate%29_1667.html" title="Moros (Stargate)">Myrddin</a> descended in order to construct a weapon to fight the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Ori_%28Stargate%29_ca32.html" title="Ori (Stargate)">Ori</a>, that could be used against the Ancients themselves, Morgan le Fay was assigned to watch him and, if necessary, prevent him from completing the weapon. For a time in Earth history, she was his rival. However, Myrddin conducted his research in another dimension, thus hiding it from the Ancients and Morgan le Fay.</p>
<p>Although originally a fierce opponent of the creation of an anti-Ori weapon, she eventually, like Myrddin, came to believe that the Ori could some day become a threat to the Ancients themselves. When <a href="../../../s/g/-/SG-1_f555.html" title="SG-1">SG-1</a> came to Atlantis to search for the weapon, she decided to covertly help <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Jackson_1278.html" title="Daniel Jackson">Daniel Jackson</a> locate the weapon by posing as a hologram in the learning program she designed ten millennia earlier.</p>
<p>However, Daniel Jackson recognised her as an ascended Ancient, and pushed her to reveal more information. Morgan le Fay, both believing that interfering with the lower planes of existence would make the Ancients no better then the Ori and fearing the punishment of the other Ancients, was hesitant to do so. Just when she was about to give more information about Myrddin's weapon, she was stopped by her peers. Her last words before being snatched away were "Merlin's weapon is not..." <sup id="_ref-The_Pegasus_Project_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Pegasus_Project" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>The fate of Morgan le Fay remains unknown, however, it is likely that she will be severely punished by the Ancients, or even be forced to take human form again.</p>
<p>Apparently, Morgan eventually found the Sangraal and hid it on a planet where it would be safe from both the Ori and the Ancients. The planet in question was undetectable from space, and an <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orici.html" title="Orici">Orici</a>'s powers were rendered useless on the surface. The Sangraal itself was protected by several Ancient riddles and challenges. <sup id="_ref-The_Quest_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Quest" title="">[10]</a></sup> However, in actuallity, she put Merlin in stasis to wait for the one day when he would rebuild after she was forced to destroy the original.<br clear="all" /></p>

<p><b>Orlin</b>, played by <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Patrick_Flanery_76a3.html" title="Sean Patrick Flanery">Sean Patrick Flanery</a>, was an outcast <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_%28Stargate%29_eeed.html" title="Ancient (Stargate)">Ancient</a>, forced to remain on the dead planet <a href="../../../v/e/l/Velona.html" title="Velona">Velona</a> following a terrible tragedy. Orlin came upon the world of Velona long ago, and took pity on the people's struggle against the <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goa%27uld.html" title="Goa'uld">Goa'uld</a>. Breaking the rules of the Ancients, Orlin gave the people Ancient technology, particularly weapon specifications to Velona materials (it is doubtful he revealed himself directly), from which they constructed an advanced Ancient space gun.</p>
<p>It was not long before the Goa'uld presence was destroyed, and the people celebrated. Unfortunately, this new-found <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technology.html" title="Technology">technology</a> birthed ideas of power and corruption, and they soon planned to exploit their enemies on other <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planet.html" title="Planet">planets</a>, using the weapon to conquer those worlds. The Ancients saw this possibility and killed the entire <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civilization.html" title="Civilization">civilization</a>, leaving their cities in rubble and Velona's people <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extinction.html" title="Extinction">extinct</a>. Orlin, for his disobedience, was banished for eternity amongst the wreckage he had instigated, to walk among the dead for all time.</p>
<p>Orlin's fate changed with the arrival of <a href="../../../s/g/-/SG-1_f555.html" title="SG-1">SG-1</a>. He was immediately taken with <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major.html" title="Major">Major</a> <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samantha_Carter_750d.html" title="Samantha Carter">Samantha Carter</a> and tried to merge with her thoughts. The unprepared scientist, however, blacked out. Be it secretly or known, Orlin was allowed to leave the planet with SG-1, concealed in an <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invisibility.html" title="Invisibility">invisible</a> form, to walk among the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">humans</a>, particularly Carter. He returned with her to her home and remained inside her residence, watching her while she slept. The next morning he showed himself to her, and almost immediately told her he had fallen in love. He proved he had come through the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stargate_%28device%29.html" title="Stargate (device)">Stargate</a> by crossing through a table.</p>
<p>Carter left the house and sent in a search team, but Orlin was not to be found. He only returned after Carter believed all of surveillance devices were gone, which was not the truth. Orlin revealed himself to be an ascended being. Carter told him of Oma Desala, but he had no knowledge of her because she had been an outcast.</p>

<p>For weeks Orlin seeped into Carter's confidence. They took walks together and discussed the future and his presence. Orlin eventually gave up his powers as an ascended being altogether, becoming fully human again, and planned to spend the rest of his life with her in that form. But <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Pentagon_612d.html" title="The Pentagon">the Pentagon</a> had been observing him and his very real presence with Carter, observing acquisition requests being sent to Carter's home. While she was on-base, he ordered parts and equipment from the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> and developed a miniature Stargate in her basement. When the N.I.D. finally moved in on the house, Orlin activated the Stargate and traveled back to Velona, Carter following. There he discovered the humans planned on studying the Ancient technology, and refused to accept that the same fate would fall upon Earth.</p>
<p>After a member of SG-16 shot Orlin, the Ancients believed he had redeemed himself. They re-ascended him as a reward for his great attempts to sacrifice himself for the <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tau%27ri.html" title="Tau'ri">Tau'ri</a>. Once ascended, he took the core of the <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_materials_in_the_Stargate_universe_eb3e.html#Naqahdah" title="Fictional materials in the Stargate universe">naqahdah</a> reactor powering the space gun, which could not be stopped from activating, into the atmosphere, where it detonated. Immediately he (or the Ancients) destroyed the Ancient space gun so that SG-16 could never replicate the technology. <sup id="_ref-Ascension_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ascension" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Later, Orlin returned in the form of a child (played by <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cameron_Bright_9fd6.html" title="Cameron Bright">Cameron Bright</a>). This time, he is permanently human, and his child form is intentional; he needs to be in that form in order to retain even a fraction of the knowledge of the Ancients. He tells the SGC that the feud between Alterans and Ori, false promises of ascension and how the Ori gain power. He does succeed in developing a line of research into a cure for the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Ori_%28Stargate%29_ca32.html" title="Ori (Stargate)">Ori</a> plague, but it requires a bit of material (namely, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prior_%28Stargate%29_7b81.html" title="Prior (Stargate)">Prior</a> <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_396c.html" title="DNA">DNA</a>) which the SGC has not yet obtained. In addition, his gambit with taking child form fails, and he quickly loses memory. Prior to this, he does tell the SGC that <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_%28Stargate%29_b340.html" title="Origin (Stargate)">Origin</a> and its promise of Ascension are lies. He is interned in a <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychiatric_hospital.html" title="Psychiatric hospital">mental institution</a>, having lost all of his memories from his time as an ascended, and suffering significant brain damage from holding on that long. <sup id="_ref-The_Fourth_Horseman_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Fourth_Horseman" title="">[12]</a></sup><br clear="all" /></p>

<p><b>Trebal</b> was the first officer of the <a href="../../../a/u/r/Aurora_class_battleship.html" title="Aurora class battleship">Ancient warship</a> <i>Aurora</i> during the last days of her people's war with the <a href="../../../w/r/a/Wraith_%28Stargate%29_240c.html" title="Wraith (Stargate)">Wraith</a>.</p>
<p>Trebal had served with the Aurora's Captain for many years, and was his trusted right hand. She, along with the rest of the crew, was sent on a mission by the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis_%28Stargate%29_4531.html" title="Atlantis (Stargate)">Atlantean</a> High Council to conduct reconnaissance on their enemy, the Wraith.

After the Aurora was attacked and severely damaged by the Wraith, Trebal, along with the rest of the crew, was forced to enter a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stasis.html" title="Stasis">stasis</a> pod to save her life.</p>
<p>After the Wraith discovered the Aurora ten thousand years later, Trebal was killed by an invading Wraith when she was forcibly removed from her stasis pod. The Wraith subsequently assumed her identity in the artificial environment that networked the minds of the Ancients in stasis, as part of an elaborate scheme to discover how to upgrade Wraith hyperdrive technology.
