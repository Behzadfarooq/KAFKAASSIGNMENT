	    <p>Wouldn't this list be more fair and logical, as well as <i>easier to read</i>, if women were listed by their birth names rather than their married ones? as it is, you can't really comprehend one generation without looking down at the next. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoops_385d.html" title="User:Doops">Doops</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoops_62fc.html" title="User talk:Doops">talk</a> 06:52, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with you very strongly. I can see that some might argue that at the time the child was born that the mother, being married, would be correctly addressed by her husbands name. However I think most genealogists would use the mother's maiden name in a list such as this. I think only people without experience of studying genealogies would using women's married names. However, I must say that I have also noticed in a number of place in Wikipedia that editors seem to like similar notation <i>e.g. John Smith was son of Jane Smith (nee Brown)</i>, whereas I would prefer <i>John Smith son of Jane Brown</i> if intent of the sentence was to give genealogical information. If there is a consensus on this I think we should edit accordingly <a href="../../../o/p/2E/User%7EOp._Deo_0aaf.html" title="User:Op. Deo">Op.

<p>OK, I made the change. Note that I had to guess at the maiden name of #29; and that the maiden names of #41, 47, 53, 55, &amp; 57 are not given. If anybody knows these, please put them in.

<p>"Ahnentafel" is not an English word, nor is there any need to use a pretentious and obscure (German?) expression for a perfectly straightforward concept such as a table showing someone's ancestors. I will revert any return to this title. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 13:41, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bring it to requested moves. Ahnentafel is a loanword and is used extensively in genealogy, which is what is presented in the article. If you don't like it, create another article on the Queen's ancestry. <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 19:20, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While the use of the word <i>Ahnentafel</i> in the title is not incorrect, I agree with <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a>, it is best not used in the title - what most people will be looking for is ancestry or something like that. <i>Ahnentafel</i> is linked at the opening of the page to explain the format. Surely that is sufficient? I see little point in creating another article on ancestry as suggested by <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a>. I vote for reverting to <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancestors_of_Queen_Elizabeth_II_5e79.html" title="Ancestors of Queen Elizabeth II">Ancestors of Queen Elizabeth II</a>. <a href="../../../o/p/2E/User%7EOp._Deo_0aaf.html" title="User:Op.

<dd>It is what it is, which is an ahnentafel. It is linked from the Queen's page and is available through redirects. <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 20:29, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The use of technical terms, particularly foreign ones, is only justified when there is no precise English equivalent. I have no objection to <a href="../../../w/e/l/Weltanschauung.html" title="Weltanschauung">weltanschauung</a> or <a href="../../../d/o/p/Doppelganger.html" title="Doppelganger">doppelganger</a> or <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schadenfreude.html" title="Schadenfreude">schadenfreude</a>. "Ahnentafel" however is just German for "genealogical table," which is all this article is. There is no more justification for using a German name for it than there would be for using a French or Chinese one. It is Wikipedia policy to use English wherever possible. I will wait a while for further comments, but my current intention is to redirect to the English title. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 00:30, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ahnentafel has become an English term, specifically because the name originated in German and migrated to English where it is used in genealogy.. <a href="../../../a/h/n/Ahnentafel.html" title="Ahnentafel">Read the article on it</a>. The justification in using a "German" name is that it, and not a French or Chinese name, became accepted and is now used. As far as I am concerned, genealogical table is no more a term than ghostly double is... Yet we have doppelgänger. <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 01:16, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Even if the use of the term as an English word is not incorrect, there is no need for it in the article title, unless we have articles displaying some other sort of list of ancestors. The article/list/table is about the ancestors of a certain person - the fact that it follows a certain format is of secondary importance and does not belong in the title. This would be true even if it were a well known term in English, and since it isn't, it definitely shouldn't be there. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 09:38, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is a concise term and is about as well-known as schadenfreude or any other comparable word. <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 15:07, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I apologise for coming back again, but it appears to me wrong to claim that that <i>ahnentafel</i> which does not appear in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concise_Oxford_English_Dictionary_050f.html" title="Concise Oxford English Dictionary">Concise Oxford English Dictionary</a> is about as well known as <i>schadenfreude</i> which does. I have heard of <i>schadenfreude</i> being used in general edcuated population, but I have never encountered <i>ahnentafel</i> outside a very narrow group of genealogy specialists talking amongst themselves or as an the name for a type of output produced by a genealogy software programme. I think <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> has expressed the case very well for reverting to the original title.<a href="../../../o/p/2E/User%7EOp._Deo_0aaf.html" title="User:Op.

<dd>The point of Wikipedia is to provide accessibility and to educate. Ahnentafel isn't as obscure as people are claiming, nor is it an "inaccessible" word. There is an article here about it! It is concise and describes the article perfectly. There are redirects from Ancestors of, etc. <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 20:51, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that having an article about it in this encyclopaedia makes the term "ahnentafel" legitimate.

<p>No-one disputes that the word exists and has a specialist usage among genealogists. But it has no currency outside such circles, and is totally unknown to the general educated public, even those with an amateur interest in genealogy, such as me (I wrote the original version of this article, by the way). It can be used in the text of the article but not in the title. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 00:59, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, Adam has a very legitimate point: almost <b>no one</b> knows what that word means! It's just common sense to say that "Ahnentafel" is nowhere near as commonly used as "Ancestry". If you don't like common sense, how about policy? The third paragraph of <i>the official policy</i>, <a href="../../../n/c/_/WP%7ENC_b5d6.html" title="WP:NC">WP:NC</a>, states:
<dl>
<dd><i>Generally, article naming should give priority to what the majority of English speakers would most easily recognize, with a reasonable minimum of ambiguity, while at the same time making linking to those articles easy and second nature.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>...and then a couple lines below that:
<dl>
<dd><i>Names of Wikipedia articles should be optimized for readers over editors; and for a general audience over specialists.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Please don't try to tell me that a general audience would recognize what Ahnentafel means. I've dabbled in personal genealogy and have only come across that word a few times. And your assertion that ancestry is less finite than Ahnentafel - Ahnentafel is simply a numbering system - did numbers become finite since my last advanced calculus class?</dd>
