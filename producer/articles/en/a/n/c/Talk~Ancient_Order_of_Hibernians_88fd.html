<p>I have been to several of the AOH halls in Derry and have shirts from the Hall in Derry. There are AOH halls in Derry, Belfast, Dublin and Galway that I know of. The AOH state chapter as it were is know as the Pride of Erin. They have votes at the National Convetion just like any other state. Contact information can be found by contacting the national office.</p>

<dd>Commentaries are opinions, not facts. AOH was not founded as an anti-Protestant organization. If some criticize AOH as being anti-Protestant, then the article should read "Its critics accuse it of anti-Protestantism." That was done for the article on the organization's alleged counterpart, the Orange Order <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Order" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Order" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. --Brianf 20:22:17, 2005-08-12 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If we don't have founding docs, better to make hedged assertions (a la, "some say," "critics say," or "it seems that" they are anti-Protestant, than to ascribe a definite founding purpose or guiding principle, willmcw. It's far worse to make a positive unfounded assertion--"they are anti-protestant," which thus far appears to be only commentary/opinion--than to fail to make an assertion which <em>may</em> be true.</dd>

<dd>One more change to illustrtate that the "mixture of religon and politics" and its similarity in that regard with the Orange Order leads to "critisized for being anti-protestant". Also, its better style (IMHO) that way around. 166.20.114.10 19:36, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fair enough. The point I was making was that "Its mixture of religion and politics" leads to the accusation of being anti-protestant (which is akin to the Orange Order being accused of being anti-catholic)" That is what I was saying. I'll change it thusly. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERoodog2k_ec1a.html" title="User:Roodog2k">Roodog2k</a> 10:32, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I these latest changes make the article even more NPOV and more accurate. 1) I removed a reference to the Orange Order, since the AOE is largest population is in the USA. 2) I added a statement that is the other side of the argument wrt anti-protestant. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERoodog2k_ec1a.html" title="User:Roodog2k">Roodog2k</a> 10:51, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since Will was looking for documentation supporting the anti-protestant thread (I saw what you deleted, it was a good question&#160;: ) ), this is from the AOH in America website:</p>
<p><b>The A.O.H. has been at the forefront on Irish issues such as: Immigration Reform, Peace with Justice in a United Ireland; ....</b></p>
<p>This statement can be arguably considered "anti-protestant" in that the AOH in America has taken a pro-Republican stance. Remeber, this is an AMERICAN organization, so with regards to the sectarian issues in Ireland, I beginning to think that we need to further qualify this "anti-protestant" statment. Now, in the United States, I seriously doubt that there is anything to indicate an "anti-protestant" outside the Anglo-Irish-American political arena.</p>
<p><br />
Further, according to the website, the AOH in America is a seperate but related organization to its Irish 'cousin'. I think we may need further clarification in that as well.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<dd>I'm not sure that the organization's own statements can be taken at face value, nor do they necessarily reflect their original purpose. But we can certainly write that that is what they say. As for the U.S. and Irish branches, I agree that treating them separately within the same article may be the best route. Though nominally the same organization, the branches have divergent histories.

<dd>Taking their statement at face value is perfectly fine, with certain qualifications if you want to be NPOV. When the organization says that they support a "United Ireland" there is a certain connotation there. No matter what, both sides of any issue should be presented, and its often best to have a 1st degree source. You can say "On one hand, the AOH says A. On the other hand, we have B." Despite my Catholic background, which I freely admit on my talk page, I am skeptical of the AOH in America and their political views on Ireland. As an American, I don't think its any of our business to get involved.<a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERoodog2k_ec1a.html" title="User:Roodog2k">Roodog2k</a> 18:59, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
The AOH is not anti-Protestant because of its association with <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_nationalist.html" title="Irish nationalist">Irish nationalist</a> politics, it is because of its conflation of Catholicism with Irish nationalism. This rules or attempts to rule out Protestant involvement in nationalist politics, which further deepens the already stark politico-religious divisions in <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. The <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange_Order_4694.html" title="Orange Order">Orange Order</a>'s conflation of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestantism.html" title="Protestantism">Protestantism</a> with <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unionists_%28Ireland%29_90f2.html" title="Unionists (Ireland)">unionism</a> has the same effect, if to a different degree. While technically they may be separate organisations, the AOH has cross-membership in the States and Ireland, and was established in Ireland by returned emigrants.</p>

<dd>You put that very well, although I was trying to draw a distinction between different flavors of being "anti-protestant". The AOH in America does not seem to have a broad anti-protestant agenda with regards to other protestant groups in the United States. With regards Ireland and Norther Ireland, this is a very arguable point. The claim of the AOH being "anti-protestant", as previously described in the article, however, implied very strongly that the AOH was against all protestant groups in general, including within the United States which is not accurate. The anti-protestant claim must be qualified in its proper context, which is why I said it was not NPOV. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERoodog2k_ec1a.html" title="User:Roodog2k">Roodog2k</a> 19:05, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is there any information suggesting there is membership outside both America and Ireland? If the membership stipulates one has to be of Irish descent, couldn't there be members/associations in other countries? i.e There are large Irish immigrant populations in Scotland, England, Australia etc 82.31.33.178 14:54, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have heard there are lodges in Glasgow ( which has a sectarian tradition in any case ). 145.253.108.22 09:44, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
