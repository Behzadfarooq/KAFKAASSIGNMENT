<p>While perusing the article, I noticed a fairly informative section on the Circus Maximus in the "Culture: Games and Activities" section. Imagine my horror as I scroll down to the "Great Roman Buildings" section only to find the exact same information worded in a different manner! I understand neither section can be completely removed while retaining the relativity of each topic. I would suggest a smaller reference to the Circus Maximus in the "Games and Activities" section, and leave the mass explanation for later. Thanks. -ExNoctem 22:00, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the detail on subjects like the Circus Maximus and other buildings is inappropriate for this article. I'd like to see them replaced with links to the appropriate article elsewhere.

<p>Forgive me for coming in and just editing but I could not help myself. The original file for the Temple of Iulius Caesar stated it was the temple of Sean Taylor; and the text goes on to talk about Taylor. This must be an act of vandalism or someone's joke, in either case I changed it to what is should read.</p>

<p>A heap of info was deleted by a vandal in this diff (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Rome&amp;diff=51351666&amp;oldid=51307108" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Rome&amp;diff=51351666&amp;oldid=51307108" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Rome&amp;diff=51351666&amp;oldid=51307108</a>) on the 3rd of May, about 150 edits back.

<p>Somebody correct me before I edt, but didn't Rome allow any religion to pertain in its civilization? There was no religious persecution, I believe, and I'm pretty sure military service was mandatory. <a href="../../../o/y/o/User%7EOyo321_e9c5.html" title="User:Oyo321">Oyo321</a> 22:06, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Depends when you mean. In the early republic, military service was more or less mandatory of you owned any property (although I imagine the sons of the very rich could find ways out of it - a trip to Rhodes to study under a master of rhetoric, perhaps). If you had no property at all you weren't eligible for military service. After Marius it became a professonal volunteer army, and by the late Empire virtually no Romans served - the army was largely made up of provincials and foreign federates.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for religion, in pre-Christian times observing the Roman state religion was a matter of allegiance to the Roman state, so as long as you were prepared to sacrifice to Jupiter and so on on official occasions I think they were more or less happy to let you do what you liked on your own time. Other pagans could fit in reasonably easily by identifying their gods with the Roman ones, and some foreign deities, like Isis, became popular in their own right. Jews and Christians were a problem, because they believed their god was the only one and worshipping any other was an affront to him, so they weren't prepared to sacrifice to Jupiter publicly and worship their own way in private. There were periods of persecution of both religions (and I believe of other foreign cults) from time to time, because they were effetively refusing to swear allegiance to Rome. Eventually the Empire made the mountain go to Mohammed by making Christianity their official religion, so by worshipping their own god in their own way the Christians were swearing allegiance to Rome as well. After that there were periods of persecution of paganism and of heretical versions of Christianity.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, mostly, you're wrong. There was religious presecution, and military service wasn't mandatory. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicknack009_6084.html" title="User:Nicknack009">Nicknack009</a> 00:02, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not sure. The Roman army was made up of many "disposable" armies of mercenary and only the legions were true Roman decendents. I'm pretty sure military service was mandatory in order to remain in the Roman Empire. I see you are right about religious persecution. I must have been misinformed. Before an ethnic group could enter Roman boundaries to serve under Rome for their protection. <a href="../../../o/y/o/User%7EOyo321_e9c5.html" title="User:Oyo321">Oyo321</a> 00:30, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Druidism in Gaul was another example of a religion that was officially banned by the Romans and whose adherents were persecuted. Ostensively because their worship involved human sacrifice. I believe I read that in Gibons' "Decline and Fall".</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Persecutions were not common, but they definitely existed. Essentially, the ancient Romans mostly left people free to practise whatever religion they wanted, as long as that did not involve human sacrifice, and as long as it did not represent a threat to Rome's political supremacy. Celtic druidism, for example, was actively persecuted for both reasons: it did involve human sacrifice, and druids, being not just "priests", but also intellectuals and to some extent judges, acted as an important focus to rally celtic opposition to Roman rule. So, they had to go. As for early Christianity, in the very early days they were heavily influenced by mysteric cults that were all the rage in the Roman Empire; they practised their rites in the privacy of people's homes, not in public temples, so they were always eyed with suspect by authorities. As with any "secretive" sect, at that point you can attribute to them pretty much any practice you despise, so they were accused of human sacrifices (no evidence of that ever emerged), and of infiltrating the political structure of the Empire (this was essentially true, as the religion spread among Roman patricians), and consequently perceived as a threat and persecuted. --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehwyn_e0df.html" title="User:Nehwyn">Nehwyn</a> 07:06, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was looking over this article, and something really important just wasn't there. the influence of rome on modern culture. Almost every section of modern Euro-American society takes at least a few things from rome. All I'm hoping for is a section header and a {{mainarticle}} template pointing to wherever that is discussed.

<p>This article has <b>failed</b> its good article review. There are a number of reasons, which are discussed below, but crucially it simply does not have enough references. It is a good read, and I realise that it is an "A" on the Wikiproject's scale, which is above GA. Wikiprojects can review to their own standards, whereas I obviously have to adhere to the <a href="../../../w/i/a/WP%7EWIAGA_4080.html" title="WP:WIAGA">good article criteria</a> in order to pass it as a <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">GA</a>. Numbers in brackets refer to the <a href="../../../w/i/a/WP%7EWIAGA_4080.html" title="WP:WIAGA">good article criteria</a> that assessment covers.</p>
<p><b>Well written</b>: <b>Pass</b>. The article is written in compelling prose (1a). Jargon is explained, and where necessary wikilinked (1d). It also follows a logical, hierarchical structure (1b). All Latin and other non-English words are <i>italicised</i>.</p>
<p><b>Factually accurate and verifiable</b>: <b>Fail</b>. This article has a staggering 8150 words, and only 16 references! Out of 42 total sections, 37 have <i>no references</i>, including major topics such as Military, Scholarly Studies, Class Structure and Government (2a). As a result, the article is almost totally unverifiable, and looks in many cases to have been <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">originally researched</a>(2, 2d). The references given had not been cited correctly, and as such make it difficult for anyone wanting verification to even check the statements which <i>have</i> been referenced. For <b>all</b> cited sources, you must give (preferably in this order):</p>
<ol>
<li>The author</li>
<li>The year published of the <b>version you are using</b></li>
<li><i>The title</i>, including any subtitles</li>
<li>The edition</li>
<li>the translator and/or editor if applicable</li>
<li>The city of publication</li>
<li>The publisher</li>
</ol>
<p>e.g. Plato (2003), <i>The Republic</i> Reissued 2nd edition, tr. Lee, Desmond (London:Penguin)</p>
<p>In this article, currently only the short forms are used for most of the sources, e.g. Plato (2003) p.34. You need to add full references for Livy, Tuomisto, Bagnall, Meier, Suetonius, Johnston and Frontinus. Wikipedia has templates to make this easy. Go to <a href="../../../c/t/t/WP%7ECTT_ba6c.html" title="WP:CTT">WP:CTT</a> and click on "Citations of generic sources" in the ToC to get templates for books and scholarly journals.</p>
<p><b>Broad in its coverage</b>: <b>Pass</b> - but is not without its problems. Mostly this article is brilliantly broad, but one section is woefully small for such a massive subject: scholarly studies. Every major university in Europe and most of the major ones in the States have classics departments. They churn out tonnes of literature and have done since their inception. This section deserves to be better written, researched ("The interest in studying ancient Rome arose <b>presumably</b> during the Age of Enlightenment in France" - this is not acceptable in a good article) and expanded.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a></b>: <b>Fail</b>. Examples of <a href="../../../a/w/w/WP%7EAWW_3219.html" title="WP:AWW">weasel words</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a> are to be found throughout the article(4). e.g. "The Roman army was a marvel of discipline, which arguably made it one of the best armies of its time" Who argued that? If you, that is both lack of NPOV and original research. "Roman legionaries had comparatively less skill at fighting than most of their opponents" - again, your point of view, and possibly original research.</p>
<p><b>Stable</b>: <b>Pass</b>. The article does not change substantially from day to day, save vandalism which does not count and is always rapidly dealt with in any case (5).</p>
<p><b>Pictures</b>: <b>Fail</b>. The pictures you have are good. Their captions are not. The word "garb", for example, is unencyclopedic. Captions include NPOV problems: "Roman sculpture was at its most original...", and OR problems: "The Roman abacus, the first portable calculating device...". They make unsubstantiated comments: "It is one of France's top tourist attractions" which are also arguably non-notable trivia (6a, 3b)</p>
<p>So, a lot of work to be done, but it is achievable. The article is a great read, and if the statements made in it can be substatiated then that is half the battle won. I suggest that this is made one of the Wikiproject's "collaboration of the month" to bring it up to the required standard. Well done for all your good work so far, and I hope to see this reapplying for (and passing) GA in the next couple of months. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisfow_9c03.html" title="User:Chrisfow">Chrisfow</a> 15:52, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The idea that Caesar "sought to restore the monarchy" probably comes more from Shakespeare than history, but the Roman Republic (or at least its establishment) was implacably opposed to anyone holding absolute power. I also think Caesar's "siding with the lower classes" was no more than populism. There are a lot of ways Caesar's rise and assassination can be interpreted, and this article can't go into individual episodes in too much detail, but I've reworded the passage slightly. Hopefully that should be a bit more accurate. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicknack009_6084.html" title="User:Nicknack009">Nicknack009</a> 11:40, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cicero claimed that if he had succeeded in opposing Caesar, the Republic would still be standing. <i>Quae si valuissent, res publica staret, tu tuis flagitiis, egestate, infamia concidisses.</i> Phillipics 2.24. One should realize that the interests of the oligarchs and the interests of the senate were one and the same because the senate was composed entirely of patricians. The plebs had their own council and were the sole electors of the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribune.html" title="Tribune">tribune</a>. It is not difficult to characterize his plebian popularity as a direct threat to the senate. Caesar's heir officially ended the Republic when he was granted tribunician power for life in 23 BCE. At the time Caesar was assassinated, he was consul with Mark Anthony, possessed military imperium, was pontifex maximus, and most importantly he was granted the powers of the censor. Throughout much of history, Caesar's assassins have been characterized as restorers of the Republic. In the 18th century, "Brutus" the author of several of the Anti-Federalist Papers wrote against the creation of a Federal government more powerful than the states. He wrote that a Federal Army would be "abhorrent to the spirit of a free republic", and more typical of a "monarchy". But the best argument against <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Parenti_ada2.html" title="Michael Parenti">Michael Parenti</a>'s views is that they reflect a modern Marxist ideology projected on history. Certainly a Marxist would characterize the struggle as one between classes, and we can expect that Dr. Parenti would be no friend to the patrician class in Rome. From a Marxist perspective, Caesar would be a usurper of the proletariat and this would fit the contention that Communism is part of a historical progression as <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Marx_3bcc.html" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> wrote. If this theory came from a classicist, I would find in more plausible, but Parenti is no classicist and he has some very radical views. <a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegis_Nuntius_5533.html" title="User:Legis Nuntius">Legis Nuntius</a> 00:38, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This section is misleading and at least partially inaccurate. While lead was used for plumbing, it was not used exclusively and was apparently known to be harmful, according to Vitruvius. Terracotta was preferred (also according to Vitruvius), though lead was easier to work with. The other issue is a chemical one. In order to cause lead poisoning, the water flowing through the pipe must be corrosive, causing lead to leach into the water. Evidence suggests that much of the water used by the Romans was actually scale-forming, which protected the water from the lead pipes. This is discussed by Frontius, when he mentions that older pipes would become crusted with deposits, reducing the flow. Other causes of lead poisoning have been debated, but lack sufficient evidence, especially regarding the possible magnitude of such a problem. (Yicpa2 22:59, 15 March 2007 (UTC))</p>

<p>This section is well-written prose but very general and completely unsourced as of today. I will undertake to provide sources for portions of this section from Adrian Goldsworthy, <i>The Roman Army at War</i>, and related works. The personal judgments noted under the GA Review section remain and must be reworked. The section attempts to provide a sense of developments over time but could be improved in this regard. The section should perhaps point out that the Roman army did not win every battle (e.g., major defeats inflicted by Hannibal at Cannae, by the Parthians at Carrhae, by Arminius (Hermann) at the Teutoberger Wald). The relationship between this section and the cited main articles needs consideration, although the level of detail in this section strikes me as about right. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimmaren_bfcc.html" title="User:Simmaren">Simmaren</a> 22:44, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've done about half of what I plan to do in terms of editing. I want to add a short paragraph on "leadership" and a paragraph or two on developments under the Principate and subsequently, including the increasing role of the army in choosing the Emperor. I also want to add a paragraph on naval forces since the Romans did not have discrete services, and information on specialties such as engineering, sappers, artillery, etc. I want to incorporate or replace the remaining text. If I can find a source that evaluates the Roman army vis a vis its opponents as the fifth paragraph from the end now does, I'll rewrite and source it. Comments or suggestions are of course welcome. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimmaren_bfcc.html" title="User:Simmaren">Simmaren</a> 22:45, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
