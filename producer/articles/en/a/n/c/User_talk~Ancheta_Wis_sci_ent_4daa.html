	    <p><b>Scientific enterprise</b> is a term that refers to <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">science</a>-based <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project.html" title="Project">projects</a>, developed by private <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entrepreneur.html" title="Entrepreneur">entrepreneurs</a>. Often such projects are innovative and daring, and represent a <a href="../../../r/i/s/Risk.html" title="Risk">risk</a> of money and resources. A <i>scientific enterprise</i> undertakes research in some <a href="../../../p/r/o/Process.html" title="Process">process</a> known to <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">science</a>, in addition to the usual risks which are handled by <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_management.html" title="Project management">project management</a>. Thus the risks in a scientific enterprise are primarily intellectual, although the history of science records that the lives of some researchers have been lost, even as they were performing their experiments. <a href="#Examples_of_enterprising_scientific_organizations" title="">A <i>scientific enterprise</i> does <i>science</i></a>. In the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> language, <i><a href="#Examples_of_enterprise" title="">enterprise</a></i> has a connotation, that obstacles are being overcome, and that successes are being won: <i>enterprising</i> being an adjective like <i>can-do</i>.</p>
<p>See <a href="#protective_agency" title="">protective agency</a>, below, for a discussion of the factors which a protected enterprise does not have to deal with, and without which a scientific enterprise could not exist. For example, overwhelming <a href="../../../f/e/a/Fear.html" title="Fear">fear</a> or <a href="../../../r/a/g/Rage_%28emotion%29.html" title="Rage (emotion)">rage</a> are not conducive to <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rational.html" title="Rational">rational</a> <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thought.html" title="Thought">thought</a>.</p>
<p>Universities historically have provided the protections afforded above, but <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academia.html" title="Academia">academia</a> is not necessarily entrepreneurial.</p>

<dd>Enterprises in the form of small and large businesses appear all over the world; not everyone can be an entrepreneur; but with motivation, an entrepreneur can "grow the business" and employ those who do not have that talent within them.See <a href="#the_role_of_risk" title="">the role of risk</a> in an enterprise, below, for a discussion of the unknowns which naturally beset enterprises, businesses and other organizations. There is intimate connection between risk and reward; namely, one cannot have a reward without also assuming a risk.</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/c/User_talk%7EAncheta_Wis_sci_ent_4daa.html" title="Edit section: Science">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>Science</b></span></h2>
<p>A <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">science</a> is a body of <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knowledge.html" title="Knowledge">knowledge</a> whose scope is defined by a smaller set of knowledge, its <i>defining principles</i> (much like <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>, which might be seen as being defined by a set of given <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axiom.html" title="Axiom">axioms</a>, upon which a mathematical structure rests).</p>
<dl>
<dd>These <i>defining principles</i> serve to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compress.html" title="Compress">compress</a> the subsequent knowledge, which is important in its own right, but which can be seen as subsidiary to more fundamental knowledge. These principles tend to be more stable over time, changing little in form as people use them, not subject to fashion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another name for these <i>defining principles</i> is <i>scientific laws</i>, which are produced by scientists using the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_method.html" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a>, which is a repeating <a href="../../../c/y/c/Cycle.html" title="Cycle">cycle</a> of <a href="../../../o/b/s/Observation.html" title="Observation">observation</a>, <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypothesis.html" title="Hypothesis">hypothesis</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prediction.html" title="Prediction">prediction</a>, and <a href="../../../t/e/s/Test.html" title="Test">corroboration</a>; this is an <a href="../../../i/t/e/Iterative.html" title="Iterative">iterative</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recursive.html" title="Recursive">recursive</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/p/Reproducibility.html" title="Reproducibility">reproducible</a> process.</dd>
</dl>
<p>But since we have limited cognitive capacity, the practice of <i><a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">science</a></i> is limited to <i>new knowledge</i>, with existing knowledge relegated to the education of others; thus there is a demand for <i>original findings</i> by the researchers, first of all, in conversation with their peers, then in meetings, then in publications, and then, perhaps, in applications.</p>
<p><a name="Real-world_issues" id="Real-world_issues"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/c/User_talk%7EAncheta_Wis_sci_ent_4daa.html" title="Edit section: Real-world issues">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Real-world issues</span></h3>
<p>When a subject is <i>in the air</i>, say in a meeting, it is tentative and possibly ill-formed; the researcher who utters it is at some risk of being labelled; but if the subject is well-received by peers, the success of the idea can feed on itself. Free discussion is perhaps the best method of learning a subject, as stated by <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanislaw_Ulam_ec08.html" title="Stanislaw Ulam">Stanislaw Ulam</a>, with articles and textbooks less effective.</p>
<p>Free access to new scientific research world-wide could be a <i>disruptive technology</i> for science. This may affect some constraints of the scientific method, meaning <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer-review.html" title="Peer-review">peer-reviewed</a> articles and <a href="../../../r/e/p/Reproducibility.html" title="Reproducibility">reproducibility</a> of <a href="../../../e/x/p/Experiment.html" title="Experiment">experiments</a>, and may very well affect scientific enterprise in the years to come. Thus an e-mail address together with a protected venue may, in time, become an effective mechanism for the progress of a scientific idea. No researcher would fail to note an e-mail from a distinguished name; just as in business and commerce, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brand_name.html" title="Brand name">brand name</a> merits <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attention.html" title="Attention">attention</a>.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Publication - the move toward open-content: Established scientific journals are print-based, with an attendant cost of distribution to the research libraries. Journal prices have risen 215 percent from <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a> to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, as opposed to a rise of 63 percent in the consumer price index. One publisher of science journals, Elsevier, enjoys gross profit margins of 30 to 34 percent, a number which is not unusual for today's large businesses, and which reflects good management.
<dl>
<dd>This bottleneck in publication is being directly addressed by the nascent practice of putting peer-reviewed articles on the Web, for example in <a href="http://www.plosonline.org" class="external text" title="http://www.plosonline.org" rel="nofollow">PLoS Biology</a> and in <a href="../../../a/r/x/ArXiv.org_e-print_archive_f2a7.html" title="ArXiv.org e-print archive">physics e-prints</a>. Nonetheless, the less-prestigious articles tend to be put on-line, and the highest prestige articles tend to be put in print, such as in <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physical_Review_6dcf.html" title="Physical Review">Physical Review</a>, although this is changing, as in the case of <i>PLoS Biology</i> and <i><a href="../../../a/c/m/ACM_0d8f.html" title="ACM">ACM</a> Transactions on Algorithms</i>. Publishers such as Elsevier are now offering royalty-free publication of two-month-old articles on the web sites of their authors' respective enterprises, in a nod toward the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open-content.html" title="Open-content">open-content</a> model. Other journals, like <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">Science</a> are speculating that an author fee of $10,000 might be necessary to fund such a model, as <i>PLoS Biology</i> is currently subsidized by grants.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Funding costs for the laboratories of a scientific enterprise need not be large, and in fact may be unrelated to the successes of the enterprise. <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Feynman_1f56.html" title="Richard Feynman">Richard Feynman</a> spoke of the disparity between some laboratories which had first-class equipment, but results which have lagged those from some more poorly equipped, but better-utilized laboratories.
<dl>
<dd>Lew Kowarski, a former director of <a href="../../../c/e/r/CERN_350a.html" title="CERN">CERN</a> mentioned the rise of <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_science.html" title="Big science">big science</a>, especially in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Particle_physics.html" title="Particle physics">particle physics</a>, which uses hundreds of Ph.D. -level researchers, and for which a Nobel Prize for the entrepreneur was at stake. Other sciences for which this concept is growing include <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronomy.html" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a>, with big <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telescope.html" title="Telescope">telescopes</a> using adaptive optics with deformable mirrors.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Funding costs, for the salaries of scientific researchers tend to be sufficient for a middle-class lifestyle, although a <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graduate_student.html" title="Graduate student">graduate student</a>, for example, has basically taken a vow of (financial) poverty, as a conscious choice (in favor of intellectual wealth).</dd>
<dd>The way out, for the lower-paid researchers, is to produce some good ideas, and place them in publications, which makes them known to the larger community of scientists.</dd>
<dd>It should be noted that <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professor.html" title="Professor">professors</a> at the larger/higher-prestige universities can enjoy salary parity with the vice presidents of a Fortune 500 company, but that the priorities of a professor can vary radically from the priorities of a vice president.
<dl>
<dd>For example, when <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Feynman_1f56.html" title="Richard Feynman">Richard Feynman</a> was invited to a conference on <a href="../../../p/a/t/Path_integral.html" title="Path integral">path integrals</a>, a subject that he invented, he refused: <i>"I didn't want to be the old guy in the back who knows less than everyone else."</i>, which bespeaks his intellectual motivation.</dd>
<dd>Both Richard Feynman and <a href="../../../e/n/r/Enrico_Fermi_bd69.html" title="Enrico Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a> drove tiny cars or rode bicycles to work, in a lifestyle which is directly emulated by others in their field. In the end, it is their ideas which gain them scientific reknown, and not the size of their paycheck, which tends to be a lagging financial indicator.</dd>

<p>Today, many scientific laws have been formulated; the risk behind them is low (but non-zero), because of the requirement for <a href="../../../r/e/p/Reproducibility.html" title="Reproducibility">reproducibility</a> at every conceivable level of knowledge, whether phenomenological or theoretical; even the limitations of the laws are known, in some cases, such as <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newton%27s_laws.html" title="Newton's laws">Newton's laws</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maxwell%27s_equations.html" title="Maxwell's equations">Maxwell's equations</a>. In our times, risk can even be limited to some intellectual topic, and what is at stake is relatively small compared to the risk involved in past times. Thus, from today's point of view, there is a progression of knowledge:</p>
<ol>
<li>A progression of knowledge from high risk to lower risk

<li>Unknown</li>
<li>Undefined</li>
<li>Defined with bias - see <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognitive_bias.html" title="Cognitive bias">cognitive bias</a></li>

<li>Evaluated
<ol>
<li>False with condition (observables), error is lessening.</li>
<li>True with condition (observables), critical regions are becoming known.</li>
</ol>

<li>Tautology, therefore reliable.

<dd>We start with <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cogency.html" title="Cogency">cogency</a>, a probabilistic concept, and with <a href="../../../r/i/s/Risk.html" title="Risk">risk</a>, which is how the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory_of_probability.html" title="Theory of probability">theory of probability</a> started: betting. Researchers take a risk by associating themselves with a hypothesis, which if not disproven, leaves them in the game. The bystanders, who have no risk, can merely take the syllogism and add it to their armamentarium; but in so doing, the researcher gains reward, namely intellectual credit. <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayesian.html" title="Bayesian">Bayesians</a> would feel at home with this, as Bayesians use an estimate of their degree of belief in a hypothesis: for example, during Franklin's researches in electricity, he used the similarity in the shapes of lightning with the shapes of electric sparks, and in the effect of an electric shock to his body, as his heuristic; he was building a <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cogency.html" title="Cogency">cogent</a> argument for his view of electricity. <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cogency.html" title="Cogency">Cogent</a> argument in <a href="../../../i/n/d/Inductive_reasoning.html" title="Inductive reasoning">inductive reasoning</a> is the same type of reasoning (based on <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypothetical.html" title="Hypothetical">hypotheticals</a>) as that used in the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_method.html" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The long-term value of Franklin's researches was his clear result: <i>Lightning is electricity</i>. Others actually published his result, with credit to him; but his insight was key for the science of electricity.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Before these scientific laws were known, the risk was high. Men embarking on enterprises did so with the knowledge that they could even lose their lives in those enterprises, as discussed below.</p>
<p>The <b>scientific enterprise</b> began in the <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Exploration_7d8c.html" title="Age of Exploration">Age of Exploration</a>, first in monarchies like Portugal, in which leaders like <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_the_Navigator_a1f5.html" title="Henry the Navigator">Henry the Navigator</a> founded schools of navigation, from which stemmed voyages of exploration. Other civilizations, like <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> also funded voyages of exploration. These monarchs had <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profit.html" title="Profit">profit</a> or perhaps direct plunder in mind, as part of their program of direct expansion of <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power.html" title="Power">power</a>. Portugal later had succession problems, and lost their overseas empire as that nation was subsumed temporarily by Spain. Other monarchs, from Spain, the Netherlands, England, and many of the other monarchies embarked on a race to colonize the rest of the world.</p>
<p>During the voyages, no expense was spared; gunners, <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrologer.html" title="Astrologer">astrologers</a>, navigators, mariners, and supernumeraries were signed on, in exchange for the privilege of embarking on an enterprise with an unknown result, but with the promise of reward for the participants.</p>
<p>How did these enterprises differ from simple conquests?</p>
<dl>
<dd>One obvious difference was the technology; the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Ship.html" title="Ship">ship</a>, made of wood, sail, and rigging; the mariners, who had to ensure that the ship could sail and not sink; and the captains, who were responsible for the safety of all, and who ultimately held the power of life or death for any man on the ship. Of course, once they returned to port, the captains were responsible to those who funded the voyage, and remained ultimately subject to the laws of their nation.</dd>
<dd>Because of this technological base, the ruling states were <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thalassocracy.html" title="Thalassocracy">thalassocracies</a>: Venice, Dubrovnnik, Portugal, and Britain. Spain added soldiers with small guns and horses to the enterprise; together with their religion, these empires managed to funnel huge amounts of wealth to the entrepreneurs, to the investors, in this case, the monarchs, to the merchants who wished for trade goods, and to also to those who funded the technology, such as the small (in modern eyes) bankers. What did they get? In Spain's case, <a href="../../../p/i/z/Pizarro.html" title="Pizarro">rooms full of</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold.html" title="Gold">gold</a>. Other monarchs desired such wealth; they too started funding enterprises.</dd>
</dl>
<p>What risks did they take?</p>
<dl>

<dd>Today, the risks to an enterprise may not necessarily be to life and limb, but to reputation: for example, <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gartner.html" title="Gartner">Gartner</a>, Inc.'s researchers were called into question when they published results which were favorable to <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>'s products, but which in fact were funded by Microsoft itself. Thus the impact to <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_Laboratories_f492.html" title="Bell Laboratories">Bell Laboratories</a>' reputation, when a dishonest researcher is discovered and dismissed. The requirement for <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objective.html" title="Objective">objective</a> results has resulted in policy changes for many consulting groups, in order to retain their reputation for objective thought, without the risk of being perceived as self-serving. But generally, people leave a poorly-run organization when they can, which gives the entrepreneur a motivation for ethical behavior.</dd>

<p>The <i>scientific method</i> is a <a href="../../../c/y/c/Cycle.html" title="Cycle">cycle</a> of the following <a href="../../../p/r/o/Process.html" title="Process">processes</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../o/b/s/Observation.html" title="Observation">Observation</a> O: some phenomenon arouses a constructive question by the researcher- <i>What, where, when, how, why, etc.</i></li>
<li><a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypothesis.html" title="Hypothesis">Hypothesis</a> H: <i>Perhaps ... H ..., I wonder whether ...</i>. The researcher formulates some explanation for the observation.</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/r/e/Prediction.html" title="Prediction">Prediction</a> P: <i>If H then P</i>. The researcher deduces some logical consequence (P) of the hypothesis, and designs an <a href="../../../e/x/p/Experiment.html" title="Experiment">experiment</a> to look for P.</li>
<li><a href="../../../t/e/s/Test.html" title="Test">Test</a> T: A carefully designed experiment uses the prediction to corroborate the hypothesis and allows the researcher to rule out possibilities:
<ol>
<li>Result: P is not seen. Therefore H is disproven. Review H to see what was wrong with it. Fix H and repeat H, P, T in a <i>new iteration of the scientific method</i>.</li>
<li>Result: P is seen. Therefore H is not disproven. (It does not follow that H is proven. That would be the fallacy of <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affirming_the_consequent.html" title="Affirming the consequent">affirming the consequent</a>.) If deemed necessary for reliability, design a sampling program which monitors the truth of P. Eventually, H will get subsumed into the body of <i>reliable knowledge</i>, as applications for O, H, P, T become known, in a <i>recursive use of the scientific method</i>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One technique for proving the truth of <i>If H then P</i> is to disprove its <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contrapositive.html" title="Contrapositive">contrapositive</a> <i>If Not P then Not H</i>. Thus, when <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> was trying to disprove the basis of <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_mechanics.html" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>, he developed the <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_paradox_d05d.html" title="Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox">Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox</a>, which is the theoretical basis for <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_teleportation.html" title="Quantum teleportation">quantum teleportation</a>.</p>
<p>Some notable scientific advances occur when a scientist intuitively links observations form different fields to discover underlying relationships. For example cosmology and thermodynamics were usefullly combined in deloping thiinking about singularities, black holes etc.. See the work of <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Hawking_e11c.html" title="Stephen Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a>, for example, when <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_entanglement.html" title="Quantum entanglement">quantum entanglement</a> was a disreputable concept, some researchers were willing to design experiments to test it, and did so. After the experiments, quantum entanglement then became fashionable in physics. (Note the role of non-risk to the bystanders.)</p>
<p>There is a role for fashion in this social activity; <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chen_Ning_Yang_406a.html" title="Chen Ning Yang">Chen Ning Yang</a> has stated that all the physics he needed, he had already learned from his education in <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>, but that it took going to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Chicago_7f0f.html" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a>, which had <a href="../../../e/n/r/Enrico_Fermi_bd69.html" title="Enrico Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a>, to learn what the good problems in physics were, to be worked on.

<p>Note that the work of a scientific enterprise is a link in an ecology of ideas; for example, in the list below, if <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_information_processing.html" title="Quantum information processing">quantum information processing</a> were at step 6, the phenomenon of <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_entanglement.html" title="Quantum entanglement">quantum entanglement</a> would correspond to an item within step 3, and the <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_paradox_d05d.html" title="Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox">Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox</a> an item within step 1.</p>

<ol>
<li>Blackboard model - a working theory</li>
<li>Simulation on a computer or other model</li>

<li>Engineered prototype, which is a typical high-tech organization's product.</li>
<li>Industrial application, which is part of a business process.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Change or progress in science is effectively the result of several of the above recursive cycles intersecting and grinding along together smoothly, perhaps for a limited period.</p>
<p>For example, a scientist discovers a new chemical process after hypothsising and testing: he publishes his work; the principle or theory is further refined and popularised through criticism, comment, confirmation or amendment through attempts at replication; then the social implementation through commercial development can begin (as in this section's illustration).</p>
<p>'Scientific method' probably can be used in a loosely descriptive, sociological sense to include the above empirical and <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quasi-empirical_methods.html" title="Quasi-empirical methods">quasi-empirical methods</a>. The term can also be used didactically or prescriptively. In one of the above recursions for example it could be said that the author has not acted in accord with scientific method, and this would be held to undermine the validity of some of the tests. This dual sense of the term is proabably the cause of the controversial nature of this topic.</p>

<p>Historically, the protection afforded by a protective agency (such as a monarch) allowed an enterprise to concentrate its energies on its own mission and vision without having to worry about other factors. These factors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Legal status - recourse to protection under a body of statutory law.</li>
<li>Ethical status - a well-managed organization will also provide a structure which oversees the ethical issues which affect that organization.

In the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_7516.html" title="US">US</a> today, some ethical considerations are currently being enforced by federal funding restrictions, on stem cell research, for example. In the end, the ethical status of some scientific enterprise is a direct reflection on the entrepreneur himself/herself.</li>
<li>Military or police protection - a sense of phyical safety, without which abstract thought, over an extended period, does not occur.</li>
<li>Tax status - favorable treatment, such as that extended to non-profit organizations, as in the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_7516.html" title="US">US</a>.</li>

<p>An <i>iteration</i> of the scientific method occurs when some phenomenon is not well understood. But by patient examination of the issues, that phenomenon can become understood, and eventually subsumed under existing scientific laws or perhaps creating new scientific knowledge.</p>

<p>A <i>recursion</i> of the scientific method occurs when some issue itself becomes the topic of investigation; the previous theory and its data become the phenomena under investigation; in this sense, the scientific method becomes even more powerful, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Bootstrapping.html" title="Bootstrapping">bootstrapping</a> a science with a new, more compressed section of established knowledge, to become part of a more general science.</p>
