<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_warfare.html" title="Edit section: Overview">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Overview</span></h2>
<p>The difference between <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prehistoric_warfare.html" title="Prehistoric warfare">prehistoric</a> and ancient warfare is less one of technology than of organization. The development of first <a href="../../../c/i/t/City-state.html" title="City-state">city-states</a>, and then <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire.html" title="Empire">empires</a>, allowed warfare to change dramatically. Beginning in <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesopotamia.html" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, states produced sufficient agricultural surplus that full-time ruling elites and military commanders could emerge. While the bulk of military forces were still farmers, the society could support having them campaigning rather than working the land for a portion of each year. Thus, organized armies developed for the first time.</p>
<p>These new armies could help states grow in size and became increasingly centralized, and the first empire, that of the <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumerians.html" title="Sumerians">Sumerians</a>, formed in Mesopotamia. Early ancient armies continued to primarily use <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bow_and_arrow.html" title="Bow and arrow">bows</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spear.html" title="Spear">spears</a>, the same weapons that had been developed in prehistoric times for hunting. Early armies in <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> followed a similar pattern of using massed infantry armed with bows and spears.</p>
<p><a name="Chariots" id="Chariots"></a></p>

<p>As states grew in size, speed of movement became crucial because central power could not hold if rebellions could not be suppressed rapidly. The first solution to this was the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chariot.html" title="Chariot">chariot</a> which became used in the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> around <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000_BC_0a8f.html" title="2000 BC">2000 BC</a>. First pulled by <a href="../../../o/n/a/Onager.html" title="Onager">onager</a>, <a href="../../../o/x/e/Oxen.html" title="Oxen">oxen</a>, and <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donkey.html" title="Donkey">donkeys</a>, they allowed rapid traversing of the relatively flat lands of the Middle East. The chariots were light enough that they could easily be floated across rivers. The breeding of more powerful <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse.html" title="Horse">horses</a> soon allowed them to be used to pull chariots, and their greater speed made chariots even more efficient.</p>
<p>The power of the chariot as a device both of transportation and of battle became the central weapon of the peoples of the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Near_East_2ea3.html" title="Ancient Near East">Ancient Near East</a> in the <a href="../../../2/n/d/2nd_millennium_BC_b088.html" title="2nd millennium BC">2nd millennium BC</a>. The typical chariot was worked by two men: one would be a bowman and fire at the enemy forces, while the other would control the vehicle. Over time, chariots carrying up to five warriors were developed. The effectiveness of these vehicles is still somewhat in doubt. In <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>, chariots became the central weapon of the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shang_dynasty.html" title="Shang dynasty">Shang dynasty</a>, allowing them to unify a great area.</p>
<p>Although chariots have been compared to modern-day <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanks.html" title="Tanks">tanks</a> in the role they played on the battlefield, i.e., shock attacks, the chief advantage of the chariot was the tactical mobility they provided to bowmen. Because tightly packed infantry were the formation of choice, in order for ancient generals to maintain <a href="../../../c/o/m/Command_and_Control_%28Military%29_ab02.html" title="Command and Control (Military)">command and control</a> during the battle as well as for mutual protection, a force of chariots could stand off at long range and rain arrows down on the infantrymen's heads. Because of their speed, any attempts to charge the chariots could be easily evaded. If, on the other hand, an infantry unit spread out to minimize the damage from arrows, they would lose the benefit of mutual protection and the charioteers could easily overrun them.</p>
<p>From a tactical standpoint this put any force facing chariots on the horns of dilemma, making chariots indispensable to armies of the day. Chariots, however, were complicated pieces of hardware that required specialized craftsman to maintain them. Such services, therefore, made chariots expensive to own. When chariots were owned by individuals within a society, it tended to give rise to a warrior class of specialists and a <a href="../../../f/e/u/Feudal_system.html" title="Feudal system">feudal system</a> (an example of which can be seen in <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homer.html" title="Homer">Homer</a>'s <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Iliad_e781.html" title="The Iliad">The Iliad</a>). Where chariots were publicly owned, they helped in the maintenance and establishment of a strong central government, e.g., the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Kingdom_e70d.html" title="New Kingdom">New Egyptian Kingdom</a>.</p>

<p>Chariots were also all but useless on the rugged terrain of much of the northern coast of the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediterranean.html" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>, in <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenia.html" title="Armenia">Armenia</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anatolia.html" title="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a>, and <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>. The <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greece_e4c9.html" title="Ancient Greece">Greeks</a> thus were forced to rely on infantry tactics. Unlike isolated Egypt, Greece was frequently menaced by external forces. The rugged terrain also made unity unlikely, leading to constant local conflicts between city-states. In this high-pressure environment, infantry arms and tactics developed rapidly. The <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phalanx_formation.html" title="Phalanx formation">phalanx</a> form was created, in which a solid wall of men could be far more damaging in unison than as individuals. The Greeks used longer spears than had been seen before and wore more armour than others. When confronted with the massed infantry tactics of the Persians in the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Wars_76fa.html" title="Persian Wars">Persian Wars</a>, the Greeks emerged victorious despite far smaller numbers. However, when the Romans confronted the Macedonians the tactical flexibility of the Roman Legionaries allowed the outflanking and defeat of the traditional Phalanx formation. The Phalanx had dominated Greek warfare but was ultimately too inflexible to defeat a more mobile opponent. In the Middle East, which was then dominated by the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian Empire</a>, chariots had faded from importance. The evolution of the horse had continued and they were now strong enough to easily carry a fully armed man. Thus the chariot archers were replaced with horse-mounted archers and spearmen.</p>
<p>This development proved a severe disadvantage for the people of the settled lowlands. In a pure infantry conflict, the greater manpower of the agricultural regions would prevail. The infrastructure and training for chariot warfare was also only available in the cities. Lone mounted warriors were far more at home in the steppe region than the agricultural ones. Once the new stronger horses, and technologies such as the <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddle.html" title="Saddle">saddle</a> became widespread, they were quickly adopted by the nomads living in areas where farming was impossible but a good living could be made by nomadic raising of livestock. These nomads would spend much of their lives on horseback and were thus far more effective at using the animals in warfare. For many centuries, the states in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>, and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Asia_cf77.html" title="South Asia">South Asia</a> were threatened by riders from the Eurasian <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steppe.html" title="Steppe">steppes</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_warfare.html" title="Edit section: Cavalry">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cavalry</span></h3>
<p>In the <a href="../../../4/t/h/4th_century_BC_4d91.html" title="4th century BC">4th century BC</a>, the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Macedonians_5139.html" title="Ancient Macedonians">Macedonians</a> under <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_II_of_Macedon_e643.html" title="Philip II of Macedon">Philip II of Macedon</a> and his son <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> successfully integrated horse-borne warriors and the traditional Greek infantry, creating a military force of unmatched power. After conquering Southern Greece, Alexander turned his attention to the mighty Persian Empire.</p>
<p>At this point the Persians had largely abandoned the chariot, although they were present at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Gaugamela_75ea.html" title="Battle of Gaugamela">battle of Gaugamela</a> in 331 BC against Alexander. Though it remained the emperor's ceremonial vehicle, their army was a mix of infantry and cavalry, as well as some more exotic forces such as <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_elephant.html" title="War elephant">war elephants</a>. This proved unable to withstand the force of the Macedonian assault, and the Persian army was routed in a series of three battles.</p>
<p>In China, the valley empires were being increasingly menaced by the northern peoples from <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mongolia.html" title="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchuria.html" title="Manchuria">Manchuria</a>, and <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Asia_5707.html" title="Central Asia">Central Asia</a>. To safeguard their kingdoms, the Chinese rulers made extensive use of their superiority in organization and manpower, most notably in the massive task of erecting the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Wall_of_China_a878.html" title="Great Wall of China">Great Wall of China</a>, specifically designed to block cavalry forces. The wall was not enough, however, and the Chinese rulers were forced to integrate cavalry units into their armies, mostly recruited from the same northern barbarians they were trying to guard against.</p>
<p>Although in most of Eurasia the mixture of cavalry and infantry became the norm, in Europe and North Africa a very different method of warfare was developing. The Mediterranean region is ringed by mountains, which make even horses difficult to use. Moreover, infantry is always far easier to transport onward by ship, so any society that could develop infantry capable of matching a cavalry force could dominate the region.</p>
<p>This was developed in the city of <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Rome_6564.html" title="Ancient Rome">Rome</a>, which soon began an unprecedented expansion throughout the Mediterranean world. Roman armies had little in the way of technology that was new; rather, they were successful through intensive organization and training. The Roman armies became a professional force of men who were committed for life and who, through their discipline, skill, fortifications, and sheer numbers, could defeat any other force in the region. To solve the problem of infantry's slow speed, they linked their empire by a network of high quality and well-maintained roads that allowed for rapid movement of considerable forces. Cavalry were only used as scouts or auxiliaries.</p>
<p>However, the Romans' success depended on an extensive organization and structure of their empire. Once this began to fray, the army also soon began to collapse. The horse peoples of the steppe had not ceased advancing, either, as horses became stronger, bows became more deadly, and riding equipment more effective. By the 4th century onwards cavalry rapidly began to take over from heavy infantry as the mainstay in the Roman army, the long transition from infantry to cavalry was by then well underway, to the point were it was the infantry that was supporting the cavalry not the cavalry supporting the infantry as it had been for centuries.</p>

<p>The first dateable recorded sea battle occurred about <a href="../../../1/2/1/1210_BC_ec53.html" title="1210 BC">1210 BC</a>: <a href="../../../s/u/p/Suppiluliuma_II_4918.html" title="Suppiluliuma II">Suppiluliuma II</a>, king of the <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hittites.html" title="Hittites">Hittites</a>, defeated a fleet from <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus.html" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, and burned their ships at sea.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Wars_76fa.html" title="Persian Wars">Persian Wars</a> were the first to feature large-scale naval operations: not just sophisticated fleet engagements with dozens of <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trireme.html" title="Trireme">triremes</a> on each side, but combined land–sea operations. Ships in the ancient world could operate only on the relatively quiet waters of seas and rivers; the oceans were off limits. Navies were almost always used as auxiliaries to land forces, often essential to bringing them supplies. They would rarely strike out on their own. With only limited-range weapons, naval warfare was fought in a manner similar to land warfare, with boarding parties doing most of the fighting.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punic_Wars_59c4.html" title="Punic Wars">Punic Wars</a> led to innovation on the high seas. Rome previously had hardly touched naval warfare, being only concerned with the Italian peninsula, while Carthage was a trading civilization, and so had developed a large fleet. Only by examining the ruins of Carthaginian ships did the Romans come to build an effective navy. Moreover, they developed an implement called the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corvus_%28weapon%29.html" title="Corvus (weapon)">corvus</a> which was a way of dropping a gangplank onto an enemy ship, this gave the Romans an enormous advantage as their superiority in close-quarters combat could come into play as legionaries boarded the Carthaginian ships and slaughtered the crews with ease.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_warfare.html" title="Edit section: Strategy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Strategy</span></h3>
<p>Ancient strategy focused broadly on the twin goals of convincing the enemy that continued war was more costly than submitting, and of making the most gain from war as possible.</p>
<p>Forcing the enemy to submit generally consisted of defeating their army in the field. Once the enemy force was routed, the threat of siege, civilian deaths, and the like often forced the enemy to the bargaining table. However, this goal could be accomplished by other means. Burning enemy fields would force the choice of surrendering or fighting a pitched battle. Waiting an enemy out until their army had to disband due to the beginning of the harvest season or running out of payment for mercenaries presented an enemy with a similar choice. The exceptional conflicts of the ancient world were when these rules of warfare were violated. The Spartan and Athenian refusal to accept surrender after many years of war and near bankruptcy in the <a href="../../../p/e/l/Peloponnesian_War_fd52.html" title="Peloponnesian War">Peloponnesian War</a> is one such exceptional example, as is the Roman refusal to surrender after <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannae.html" title="Cannae">Cannae</a>.</p>
<p>A more personal goal in war was simple profit. This profit was often monetary, as was the case with the raiding culture of the Gallic tribes. But the profit could be political, as great leaders in war were often rewarded with government office after their success. These "strategies" often contradict modern common sense as they conflict with what would be best for the states involved in the war.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_warfare.html" title="Edit section: Tactics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Tactics</span></h3>
<p>Effective tactics varied greatly, depending on:</p>
<ol>
<li>The size of the force the general was commanding</li>
<li>The size of the opposing force</li>
<li>The terrain involved</li>
<li>The weather</li>
<li>The skill of the force the general was commanding</li>
<li>The skill of the opposing force</li>
<li>The unit types of the force the general was commanding</li>
<li>The unit types of the opposing force</li>
</ol>
<p>Often, if a general knew that he had an overwhelming strength advantage, he would attempt to attack the enemy's front with his infantry while keeping his cavalry on his sides, or flanks. This maneuver would be done after the archers and siege equipment (which were kept safely behind the infantry) had fired several volleys of arrows or boulders at the opposition. After these volleys had softened up the enemy, the infantry would then advance and charge the opposing front line. When the infantry had engaged them and their attention was focused on their infantry attackers, the cavalry would then flank in from the right and the left, decimating the enemy and leaving no room for them to rout (retreat).</p>
<p>In the case that the general's advantage was more slight, he might try to rout the enemy, as fleeing troops are far less organized and easier to kill than their steadfast brethren. This can be accomplished by attacking the weak troops (skirmishers) of the enemy with strong infantry, slaughtering many of them, and thus causing them to rout. Once one unit sees another unit routing, it is much more inclined to flee in the panic. An even greater achievement would be to break the will of the enemy general himself, (or kill him) causing him and his bodyguard to flee, leaving his army with little choice but to follow suit. This tactic attempts to start the domino effect, resulting in the entire opposing force fleeing the field of battle. Once the entire opposing force had been routed, it was not uncommon to use <a href="#Cavalry" title="">cavalry</a> to destroy as much of the routing force as possible, weakening the enemy further.</p>

<p>For most parts of its long history, <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Egypt_c49a.html" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient Egypt</a> was unified under one government. The main military concern for the nation was to keep enemies out. The arid plains and deserts surrounding Egypt were inhabited by nomadic tribes who occasionally tried to raid or settle in the fertile <a href="../../../n/i/l/Nile.html" title="Nile">Nile</a> river valley. The <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptians.html" title="Egyptians">Egyptians</a> built fortresses and outposts along the borders east and west of the Nile Delta, in the Eastern Desert, and in <a href="../../../n/u/b/Nubia.html" title="Nubia">Nubia</a> to the south. Small garrisons could prevent minor incursions, but if a large force was detected message was sent for the main army corps. Most Egyptian cities lacked city walls and other defenses.</p>
<p>The first Egyptian soldiers carried a simple armament consisting of a spear with a copper spearhead and a large wooden shield covered by leather hides. A stone mace was also carried in the Archaic period, though later this weapon was probably only in ceremonial use, and was replaced with the bronze battle axe. The spearmen were supported by archers carrying a composite bow and arrows with arrowheads made of flint or copper. No armour was used during the 3rd and early 2nd Millennium BC. The major advance in weapons technology and warfare began around 1600 BC when the Egyptians fought and finally defeated the <a href="../../../h/y/k/Hyksos.html" title="Hyksos">Hyksos</a> people who had made themselves lords of Lower Egypt. It was during this period the horse and chariot were introduced into Egypt. Other new technologies included the sickle sword, body armour and improved bronze casting. The next leap forwards came in the Late Period (712-332 BC), when mounted troops and weapons made of iron came into use. After the conquest by <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>, Egypt was heavily Hellenized and the main military force became the infantry <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phalanx_formation.html" title="Phalanx formation">phalanx</a>. The ancient Egyptians were not great innovators in weapons technology, and most weapons technology innovation came from Western Asia and the Greek world.</p>
<p>In the 2nd Millennium BC, the Egyptian military changed from levy troops into a firm organization of professional soldiers. Conquests of foreign territories, like Nubia, required a permanent force to be garrisoned abroad. The encounter with other powerful Near Eastern kingdoms like <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitanni.html" title="Mitanni">Mitanni</a>, the <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hittites.html" title="Hittites">Hittites</a>, and later the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyria.html" title="Assyria">Assyrians</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylonians.html" title="Babylonians">Babylonians</a>, made it necessary for the Egyptians to conduct campaigns far from home.</p>
<p>These soldiers were paid with a plot of land for the provision of their families. After fulfilment of their service the veterans were allowed retirement to these estates. Generals could become quite influential at the court, but unlike other feudal states the Egyptian military was completely controlled by the king. Foreign mercenaries were also recruited; first Nubians (<a href="../../../m/e/d/Medjay.html" title="Medjay">Medjay</a>), and later also Libyans and Sherdens in the New Kingdom. By the Persian period Greek mercenaries entered service into the armies of the rebellious pharaohs. The Jewish mercenaries at <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elephantine.html" title="Elephantine">Elephantine</a> served the Persian overlords of Egypt in the 5th century BC. Although, they might also have served the Egyptian Pharaohs of the 6th century BC.</p>
<p>As far as had been seen from the royal propaganda of the time, the king or the crown prince personally headed the Egyptian troops into battle. The army could number tens of thousands of soldiers, so the smaller battalions consisting of 250 men, led by an officer, may have been the key of command. The tactics involved a massive strike by archery followed by an infantry and/or chariotry attacking the broken enemy lines. The enemies could, however, try to surprise the large Egyptian force with ambushes and by blocking the road as the Egyptian campaign records informs us.</p>
<p>Within the <a href="../../../n/i/l/Nile.html" title="Nile">Nile</a> valley itself, ships and barges were important military elements. Ships were vital for providing supplies for the troops. The Nile river had no fords so barges had to be used for river crossings. Dominating the river often proved necessary for prosecuting sieges, like the Egyptian conquest of the <a href="../../../h/y/k/Hyksos.html" title="Hyksos">Hyksos</a> capital <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avaris.html" title="Avaris">Avaris</a>. Egypt had no navy to fight naval battles at sea before the Late Period. However, a battle involving ships took place at the Egyptian coast in the 12th century BC between <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramesses_III_7dce.html" title="Ramesses III">Ramesses III</a> and the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea_people.html" title="Sea people">Sea people</a>.</p>

<p>Warfare became more intense, ruthless and much more decisive during the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warring_States_Period_54ef.html" title="Warring States Period">Warring States Period</a>, in which great social and political change was accompanied by the end of the system of chariot warfare and the adoption of mass infantry armies. Cavalry was also introduced from the northern frontier, despite the cultural challenge it posed for robe-wearing Chinese men. Military strategy shifted toward an emphasis on deception, intelligence and stratagems as codified in Sun Tzu's <i><a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_of_War_382b.html" title="Art of War">Art of War</a></i>.</p>

Chanakya wrote the <i><a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthashastra.html" title="Arthashastra">Arthashastra</a></i>, which covered various topics on ancient Indian warfare in great detail, including various techniques and strategies relating to war. These included the earliest uses of <a href="../../../e/s/p/Espionage.html" title="Espionage">espionage</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassination.html" title="Assassination">assassinations</a>.

<p>Chandragupta Maurya conquered the Magadha Empire and expanded to all of northern India, establishing the Maurya Empire, which extended from the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabian_Sea_c3a2.html" title="Arabian Sea">Arabian Sea</a> to the <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bay_of_Bengal_8229.html" title="Bay of Bengal">Bay of Bengal</a>.

Seleucus eventually lost his territories in Southern Asia, including southern <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, to Chandragupta. Seleucus exchanged territory west of the Indus for 500 war elephants and offered his daughter to Chandragupta.

According to Megasthenes, Chandragupta Maurya built an army consisting of 30,000 cavalry, 9000 war elephants, and 600,000 infantry, which was the largest army known in the ancient world.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_warfare.html" title="Edit section: Persian">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Persian</span></h3>
<p>Ancient Persia first emerged as a major military power under <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrus_the_Great_bb5e.html" title="Cyrus the Great">Cyrus the Great</a>. Its form of warfare was based on massed infantry in light armor to pin the enemy force whilst cavalry dealt the killing blow. Cavalry was used in huge numbers but it is not known whether they were heavily armored or not. Most Greek sources claim the Persians wore no armor, but we do have an example from Herodotus which claims that an unhorsed cavalryman wore a gold cuirass under his red robes. Chariots were used in the early days but during the later days of the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian Empire</a> they were surpassed by horsemen. During the Persian Empire's height, they even possessed <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_elephants.html" title="War elephants">War elephants</a> from North Africa and distant India. The elite of the Persian Army were the famous <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Immortals_9b85.html" title="Persian Immortals">Persian Immortals</a>, a 10,000 strong unit of professional soldiers armed with a spear, a sword and a bow. Archers also formed a major component of the Persian Army.</p>
<p>Tactics were simple: Persian commanders simply overran the enemy with massive amounts of infantry and cavalry, while from the rear they would rain arrows down upon the foes in massive volleys. It was said that a Persian arrow volley would blot out the sun. The reason for these massive numbers, were to inspire 'shock and awe'. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers would discourage an enemy and make their surrender almost guaranteed. If the enemy did not surrender, the Persian commander would send in the first wave, which was almost always enough in number to overwhelm any force. If that failed, they sent in the second wave, more troops of higher quality. If that too was unsuccessful, the final wave was sent, spearheaded by the infamous Immortals. These tactics were generally successful in the Middle East, but when the Persians started to push into the west, against the Greeks, they were slaughtered by the better trained and more heavily armored Hoplites.</p>

<p>Very little is known about <b>Illyrian</b> military tactics. The Illyrian king <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bardyllis.html" title="Bardyllis">Bardyllis</a> turned <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illyria.html" title="Illyria">Illyria</a> into a formidable local power in the <a href="../../../4/t/h/4th_century_BC_4d91.html" title="4th century BC">4th century BC</a>. The main cities of the Illyrian <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom.html" title="Kingdom">kingdom</a> were <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lissus.html" title="Lissus">Lissus</a> and <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epidamnus.html" title="Epidamnus">Epidamnus</a>. However their power was weakened by bitter rivalries and jealousy.</p>
<p>They were known as war-like <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribe.html" title="Tribe">tribes</a> who were never really united, and fought without any real coordination. Their fighting technique seemed to rely heavily on individual accomplishment rather than a coordinating unit. In <a href="../../../3/5/9/359_BC_973d.html" title="359 BC">359 BC</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarch.html" title="Monarch">King</a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perdiccas_III_of_Macedon_5dfc.html" title="Perdiccas III of Macedon">Perdiccas III of Macedon</a> was killed by attacking <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illyrians.html" title="Illyrians">Illyrians</a>. In <a href="../../../3/5/8/358_BC_2737.html" title="358 BC">358 BC</a>, however, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_II_of_Macedon_e643.html" title="Philip II of Macedon">Philip II of Macedon</a>, the father of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>, utterly crushed the Illyrians and assumed control of their territory as far as <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Ohrid_6776.html" title="Lake Ohrid">Lake Ohrid</a>.</p>

<p>The general trend of Greek military technology and tactics was dominated by reliance on citizen farmers who could only go to war when they were not needed in the fields. These soldiers organized themselves in to a <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phalanx_formation.html" title="Phalanx formation">phalanx</a>, a dense body of armoured men armed with spears and protected by interlocking shields.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that most Greek cities were well fortified and Greek technology was not up to the task of breaching these fortifications by force, most land battles were pitched ones fought on open ground. This was because of the limited period of service Greek soldiers could offer before they needed to return to their farms. To draw out a city's defenders, its fields would be threatened with destruction, threatening the defenders with starvation in the winter if they did not surrender or accept battle.</p>
<p>This pattern of warfare was broken during the <a href="../../../p/e/l/Peloponnesian_War_fd52.html" title="Peloponnesian War">Peloponnesian War</a>, when <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athens</a>'s command of the sea allowed the city to ignore the destruction of the Athenian crops by <a href="../../../s/p/a/Sparta.html" title="Sparta">Sparta</a> and her allies by shipping grain into the city from the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crimea.html" title="Crimea">Crimea</a>. This led to a warfare style in which both sides were forced to engage in repeated raids over several years without reaching a settlement. It also made sea battle a vital part of warfare. Greek naval battles were fought between <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triremes.html" title="Triremes">triremes</a> -- long and speedy rowing ships which engaged the enemy by ramming and boarding actions.</p>

<p>During their time, the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Macedonians_5139.html" title="Ancient Macedonians">Macedonians</a> were the most complete well coordinated <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military.html" title="Military">military</a> force on <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">earth</a>. Although they are best known for the achievements of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>, it was not he who created and designed the excellent fighting force he used in his <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conquest.html" title="Conquest">conquests</a>, but rather his father, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_II_of_Macedon_e643.html" title="Philip II of Macedon">Philip II of Macedon</a>. Without this <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army.html" title="Army">army</a> having been already prepared, his <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conquest.html" title="Conquest">conquests</a> would never have taken place.</p>
<p>Philip provided his <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedon.html" title="Macedon">Macedonian</a> soldiers in the <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phalanx_formation.html" title="Phalanx formation">phalanx</a> with <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarissa.html" title="Sarissa">sarissa</a>, a <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spear.html" title="Spear">spear</a> which was 6 meters in length, about 18 feet. The sarissa, when held upright by the rear rows of the phalanx (there were usually eight rows), helped hide maneuvers behind the phalanx from the view of the enemy. When held horizontal by the front rows of the phalanx, it was a brutal weapon for people could be run through from far away.</p>
<p>In 358 BC he met the <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illyrians.html" title="Illyrians">Illyrians</a> in battle with his reorganized Macedonian phalanx, and utterly defeated them. The Illyrians fled in panic, leaving 7,000 dead (3/4 of their whole force) on the battleground. The <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedon.html" title="Macedon">Macedonian</a> army must have appeared to have grown in size overnight and invaded <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illyria.html" title="Illyria">Illyria</a> itself, conquering all <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illyrian.html" title="Illyrian">Illyrian</a> tribes deep into the country, stopping short near the <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adriatic.html" title="Adriatic">Adriatic</a> coast.</p>
<p>After the defeat of the <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illyrians.html" title="Illyrians">Illyrians</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedon.html" title="Macedon">Macedon</a>'s policy became increasingly aggressive. <a href="../../../p/a/i/Paionia.html" title="Paionia">Paeonia</a> was already forcefully integrated into <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedon.html" title="Macedon">Macedon</a> under <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip.html" title="Philip">Philip</a>'s rule. In 357 BC <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip.html" title="Philip">Philip</a> broke the treaty with <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athens</a> and attacked <a href="../../../a/m/p/Amphipolis.html" title="Amphipolis">Amphipolis</a> which he surrendered to the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greeks.html" title="Greeks">Greeks</a> when he came to power. The city fell back in the hands of <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedon.html" title="Macedon">Macedonia</a> after an intense <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege.html" title="Siege">siege</a>. Then he secured possession over the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold_mining.html" title="Gold mining">gold mines</a> of nearby Mount Pangaeus, which would enable him to finance his future wars.</p>
<p>In 356 the Macedonian army advanced further eastward and captured the town of <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crenides.html" title="Crenides">Crenides</a> (near modern <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drama%2C_Greece_13d1.html" title="Drama, Greece">Drama</a>) which was in the hands of the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thracians.html" title="Thracians">Thracians</a>, and which <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip.html" title="Philip">Philip</a> renamed after himself to <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippi.html" title="Philippi">Philippi</a>. The Macedonian eastern border with <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrace.html" title="Thrace">Thrace</a> was now secured at the river <a href="../../../n/e/s/Nestus.html" title="Nestus">Nestus</a> (Mesta).</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip.html" title="Philip">Philip</a> next marched into northern <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a>. In <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thessaly.html" title="Thessaly">Thessaly</a> he defeated his enemies and by 352, he was firmly in control of this northern <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greek</a> region. The Macedonian <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army.html" title="Army">army</a> advanced as far as the pass of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thermopylae.html" title="Thermopylae">Thermopylae</a> which divides <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a> in two parts, but it did not attempt to take it because it was strongly guarded by a joint <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greek</a> force of <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athenians.html" title="Athenians">Athenians</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Sparta.html" title="Sparta">Spartans</a>, and <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achaean.html" title="Achaean">Achaeans</a>.</p>
<p>Having secured the bordering regions of <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedon.html" title="Macedon">Macedon</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip.html" title="Philip">Philip</a> assembled a large Macedonian army and marched deep into Thrace for a long conquering campaign. By 339 after defeating the Thracians in series of battles, most of <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrace.html" title="Thrace">Thrace</a> was firmly in Macedonian hands save the most eastern <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greek</a> coastal cities of <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantium.html" title="Byzantium">Byzantium</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perinthus.html" title="Perinthus">Perinthus</a> who successfully withstood the long and difficult sieges. But both <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantium.html" title="Byzantium">Byzantium</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perinthus.html" title="Perinthus">Perinthus</a> would have surely fell had it not been for the help they received from the various Greek city-states, and the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> king himself, who now viewed the rise of <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedon.html" title="Macedon">Macedonia</a> and its eastern expansion with concern. Ironically, the Greeks invited and sided with the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persians.html" title="Persians">Persians</a> against the Macedonians, although the Persians had been the most hated nation in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a> for more than a century. The memory of the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> invasion of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a> some 150 years ago was still alive but the Greek hatred for the Macedonians had put it aside.</p>
<p>Much later would be the conquests of his son, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>, who would go on to create a style of <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavalry.html" title="Cavalry">cavalry</a> warfare in which he advanced a <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greek</a> style of combat, in which he was able to muster large bodies of men for long periods of time for his campaigns against <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persia</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavalry.html" title="Cavalry">Cavalry</a> also played an important role in Alexander's style of warfare, especially his <a href="../../../c/o/m/Companion_Cavalry_1337.html" title="Companion Cavalry">Companions</a>, an elite formation.</p>

<p>The Roman army was the world's first professional army. It had its origins in the citizen army of the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Republic_9497.html" title="Roman Republic">Republic</a>, which was staffed by citizens serving mandatory duty for Rome. The reforms of <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaius_Marius_ec9e.html" title="Gaius Marius">Marius</a> around <a href="../../../1/0/0/100_BC_ff7d.html" title="100 BC">100 BC</a> turned the army into a professional structure, still largely filled by citizens, but citizens who served continuously for 25 years before being discharged.</p>
<p>The Romans were also noted for making use of auxiliary troops, non-Romans who served with the legions and filled roles that the traditional Roman military could not fill effectively, such as light skirmish troops and heavy cavalry. Later in the Empire, these auxiliary troops, along with foreign mercenaries, became the core of the Roman military. By the late Empire, tribes such as the <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visigoths.html" title="Visigoths">Visigoths</a> were bribed to serve as mercenaries.</p>
<p>The Roman navy was traditionally considered less important, although it remained vital for the transportation of supplies and troops, also during the great purge of pirates from the Mediterranean sea by Pompey the Great in the 1st century BC. Most of Rome's battles occurred on land, especially when the Empire was at its height and all the land around the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediterranean.html" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> was controlled by Rome.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../d/a/c/Dacian.html" title="Dacian">Dacian</a> tribes, located on modern-day <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romania.html" title="Romania">Romania</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/l/Moldova.html" title="Moldova">Moldova</a> were part of the greater <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thracian.html" title="Thracian">Thracian</a> family of peoples. They established a highly <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militarized.html" title="Militarized">militarized</a> society and, during the periods when the tribes were united under one <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarch.html" title="Monarch">king</a> (82-44 BC, 86-106) posed a major threat to the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_province.html" title="Roman province">Roman provinces</a> of Lower <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danube.html" title="Danube">Danube</a>. Dacia was conquered and transformed into a Roman province in 106 after a long, hard <a href="../../../w/a/r/War.html" title="War">war</a>.</p>
<p>The most important <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weapon.html" title="Weapon">weapon</a> of the Dacian <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arsenal.html" title="Arsenal">arsenal</a> was the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falx.html" title="Falx">falx</a>. This dreaded weapon, similar to a <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sickle.html" title="Sickle">sickle</a> came in two variants: a shorter, one-handed falx, and a longer two-handed version. The shorter falx was called sica (sickle) in the <a href="../../../d/a/c/Dacian_language.html" title="Dacian language">Dacian language</a>. The two-handed falx was a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polearm.html" title="Polearm">polearm</a>. It consisted of a three-feet long wooden <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaft.html" title="Shaft">shaft</a> with a long curved iron <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blade.html" title="Blade">blade</a> of nearly-equal length attached to the end. The blade was sharpened only on the inside, and was reputed to be devastatingly effective. However, it left its user vulnerable because, being a two-handed weapon, the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warrior.html" title="Warrior">warrior</a> could not also make use of a <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shield.html" title="Shield">shield</a>. Alternatively, it might used as a <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hook.html" title="Hook">hook</a>, pulling away shields and cutting at vulnerable limbs.</p>
<p>Using the falx, the Dacian warriors were able to counter the power of the compact, massed Roman formations. During the time of the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_conquest_of_Dacia_ada2.html" title="Roman conquest of Dacia">Roman conquest of Dacia</a> (101-102, 105-106), <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legionaries.html" title="Legionaries">legionaries</a> had reinforcing iron straps applied to their <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helmets.html" title="Helmets">helmets</a>. The Romans also introduced the use of leg and arm protectors (<a href="../../../g/r/e/Greaves.html" title="Greaves">greaves</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manica.html" title="Manica">manica</a>) as further protection against the falxes.</p>
<p>The Dacians also constructed stone strongholds, davas, in the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carpathian_Mountains_b96e.html" title="Carpathian Mountains">Carpathian Mountains</a> in order to protect their capital <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarmizegetusa.html" title="Sarmizegetusa">Sarmizegetusa</a>. The <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortifications.html" title="Fortifications">fortifications</a> were built on a system of circular belts. This allowed the defenders, after a stronghold was lost, to retreat to the next one using hidden escape gates.</p>
<p>The Dacians were adepts of surprise attacks and skilful, tactical withdrawals using the fortification system. During the wars with the Romans, fought by their last king <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decebal.html" title="Decebal">Decebal</a> (87-106 ), the Dacians almost crushed the Roman <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garrison.html" title="Garrison">garrisons</a> South of the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danube.html" title="Danube">Danube</a> in a surprise attack launched over the frozen river ( winter of 101-102 ). Only the intervention of Emperor <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trajan.html" title="Trajan">Trajan</a> with the main army saved the Romans from a major defeat. But, by 106 the Dacians were <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrounded.html" title="Surrounded">surrounded</a> in their capital Sarmizegetusa. The city was taken only through treason: a <a href="../../../d/e/s/Deserter.html" title="Deserter">deserter</a> told the Romans the location of the capital's <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_supply.html" title="Water supply">water supply</a> line.</p>
<p>As a result, the king committed <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">suicide</a> and Dacia became a Roman province until 271.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_warfare.html" title="Edit section: Germanic">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Germanic</span></h3>
<p>Historical records of the <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic_peoples.html" title="Germanic peoples">Germanic</a> <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribe.html" title="Tribe">tribes</a> east of the <a href="../../../r/h/i/Rhine.html" title="Rhine">Rhine</a> and west of the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danube.html" title="Danube">Danube</a> do not begin until quite late in the ancient period, so only the period after <a href="../../../1/0/0/100_BC_ff7d.html" title="100 BC">100 BC</a> can be examined. What is clear is that the Germanic idea of warfare was quite different from the pitched battles fought by <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a>. Instead the Germanic tribes focused on small or large raids.</p>
<p>The purpose of these was generally not to gain territory, but rather to capture resources and secure prestige. These raids were conducted by <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irregular_military.html" title="Irregular military">irregular troops</a>, often formed along family or village lines, in groups of 10 to about 1,000. Leaders of unusual personal magnetism could gather more soldiers for longer periods, but there was no systematic method of gathering and training men, so the death of a charismatic leader could mean the destruction of an army. <b>Armies</b> also often consisted of more than 50 percent noncombatants, as displaced people would travel with large groups of soldiers, the elderly, women, and children.</p>
<p>Large bodies of troops, while figuring prominently in the history books, were the exception rather than the rule of ancient warfare. Thus a typical <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic_peoples.html" title="Germanic peoples">Germanic</a> force might consist of 100 men with the sole goal of raiding a nearby Germanic or foreign village. According to <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Rome_6564.html" title="Ancient Rome">Roman</a> sources, when the <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic_Tribes_e4d4.html" title="Germanic Tribes">Germanic Tribes</a> did fight pitched battles, the infantry often adopted wedge formations, each wedge being lead by a clan head.</p>
<p>Though often defeated by the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Romans</a>, the <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic_Tribes_e4d4.html" title="Germanic Tribes">Germanic Tribes</a> were remembered in Roman records as fierce combatants, whose main downfall was that they failed to unite successfully into one fighting force, under one <a href="../../../c/o/m/Command.html" title="Command">command</a>. Their successors would eventually overwhelm and conquer the ancient world, giving rise to modern Europe and medieval warfare.
