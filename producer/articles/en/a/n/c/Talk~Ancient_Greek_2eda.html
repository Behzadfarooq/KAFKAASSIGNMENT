I really think that the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_alphabet.html" title="Greek alphabet">Greek alphabet</a> should be used; any thoughts on this?

<p>Does Ancient Greek not have an ablative case like Latin? If not, how would they use prepositions such as "in," "for," "by," and "with?" <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherWillis_fb02.html" title="User:ChristopherWillis">Christopher</a> 04:51, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, the ablative case uses get put in different cases. Prepositions take the accusative, dative, or genitive depending on the preposition. Instead of an ablative absolute like in Latin, there's a genitive absolute. Etc. 69.5.132.235 03:50, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Wouldn't 'of' be used with the genitive, 'to/for' with the dative, and no preposition with the accusative, since it denotes the object of the sentence? Where do 'in' and 'by' and 'with' fit in? Also, out of curiosity, how is a genitve absolute translated? <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherWillis_fb02.html" title="User:ChristopherWillis">Christopher</a> 03:41, 9 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is a very rough approximation. But in fact most ancient Greek prepositions can be used with all three cases, and have a different array of meanings with each case. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 04:02, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are fragments of the IE locative case in AG, and that is also one of the sources of the Latin ablative; but not in any other sense of "ablative". <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 04:02, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>And such fragments of cases like θεν, φι, δε, etc? In Mycenaen -φι was almost a regular feature of the language<a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBruno_Gripp_4bd7.html" title="User:Bruno Gripp">Bruno Gripp</a> 23:28, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll have to confirm with my copy of Smyth, however -φι- is a non-productive <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instrumental_case.html" title="Instrumental case">instrumental</a> ending (compare <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> plural dative/plural ablative 3rd declension noun ending <i>-ibus</i>.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It should be noted that Ancient Greek <a href="../../../a/b/l/Ablative.html" title="Ablative">ablative</a> merged with the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genitive.html" title="Genitive">genitive</a>, and so did the prepositional functions (so when you express an idea such as motion away from, you use the genitive--a notion of motion generally reserved for the ablative in other IE languages). <a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEchternacht_bb59.html" title="User:Echternacht">Echternacht</a> 12:54, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, φι seems to be a regular feature of mycaenaean greek and is quite present in Homeric, Lesbian and "hard" doric of Alcman, egg. σὺν ὄχεσφι, Μῶσα ὠρανόφι. Its an important feature of the Greek language, not, for sure, from attic, and I don't know wheater this article should mention this suffixes or not.</dd>

<p>Lexical details: a discussion (with examples) of loanwords into ancient Greek (such as from Persian, etc.); and a discussion with examples of the (presumably) pre-Indo-European/non-Indo-European words in the lexicon, etc. Zipped through the article and didn't notice these topics mentioned. Alexander 007 09:37, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The non-IE, pre-Hellenic vocabulary is present in a great part of the Attic vocabulary (including most toponyms) and it's consider part of the Greek language. It should be mentioned in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Greek_3541.html" title="Proto-Greek">Proto-Greek</a> in order to point out the transition to <a href="../../../m/y/c/Mycenaean_Greek_5153.html" title="Mycenaean Greek">Mycenaean Greek</a>. As for the loan words into Ancient Greek from Persian, I've never heard about it. Do you have any examples? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 19:00, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I disagree. Proto-Greek is unattested, so lexical items (e.g., the actual words themselves) cannot be listed there except in a totally hypothetical sense. And if a given word is not <i>attested</i> in Mycenean, again that would not be the right place for such a lexical item. Many non-IE Greek words are not attested in Mycenean yet. As for loanwords---I said <i>such as from Persian</i>, not only from Persian, though there are several from Persian also. From Persian: <i>magos</i>, which after borrowed became a part of regular vocabulary and came to have the general meaning of "wizard" or "enchanter" (see Perseus); from Egyptian: <i>baris</i>, a flat-bottomed boat. From some Semitic language: <i>kamēlos</i>, "camel". Many more. Alexander 007 19:16, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't want anyone to write up an exhaustive list, but a discussion with a number of examples given seems fine. Alexander 007 19:41, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The pre-Hellenic vocabulary that was assimilated by Mycenaean and Ancient Greek is not considered by anyone as a "loan". However I agree that it should be mentioned in both Mycenaean and Ancient Greek articles as an important transition factor from Proto-Greek. Proto-Greek doesn't really have an attested vocabulary but in most cases linguists are able to distinguish the Ancient or Mycenaean vocabulary that does not derive from it. "Mag-os" has a PIE root and I don't know whether it can safely be assumed as a Persian loanword. The case of "kamelos" and the various Semitic loanwords should be at some point explicitely mentioned, but I wouldn't give them the highest priority. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 13:18, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>True. Magos is traced back to a PIE root. But it is traced back to PIE <i>*magh-</i>, "to have power". According to my table of sound-changes from PIE to Proto-Greek, PIE <i>gh</i> became the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chi_%28letter%29.html" title="Chi (letter)">chi</a> sound in Greek. And sure enough, Doric <i>machos</i> ("a device, a remedy, a means") and Attic <i>mechos</i> (id.) are traced back to PIE <i>*magh-os</i> &lt;PIE <i>*magh-</i>. <i>Magos</i> is from the same root, but unanimously considered to be from Persian <i>magush</i>. Another anc. Gk. Persian loan is <i>angaros</i>, which came to have the general meaning of "courier". The Greek cognate is <i>angelos</i>. Alexander 007 13:32, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Caragounis and other linguists and classicists say that the fricatives theta, fi and hi were always fricatives since the time of the first Greek inscrptions. Caragounis has presented plenty of evidence to show that the fricatives were fricatives in both Greek and Latin when the Greeks colonised Italy in the 8th century BC therefore you cannot claim that the Erasmian pronouncation is either Classical or Ancient Greek pronunciation nor can you fix a date to it as 5th century. --Thrax 16:10, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>A section on subordination rules and aspect represents a bit of a challenge for a relatively short encyclopaedia article. Nevertheless, I suggest a treatment in three sub-sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>A general overview of greek tenses and moods where the tenses and moods are enumerated and a satisfactory definition of aspect is given.</li>
<li>A treatment of the main uses of tenses and moods in principal clauses with examples. These examples will clarify what we mean by aspect.</li>
<li>A treatment of the use of tense and mood in subordinate clauses where the main verb is in a
<ul>
<li>primary tense, or a</li>
<li>secondary tense (This is where all the funny stuff happen).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I am puzzled about the word <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">Ελληνικός</span>. Is this supposed to be how Ancient Greeks were naming their language? This seems to be an adjective to me, and why masculine? Would it not be better to say <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">ʽΕλληνική γλώττα</span>? In any case, this is the name of the Greek language as a whole, not just <i>the stage in the history of the Greek language corresponding to Classical Antiquity</i>. A source would be needed. <a href="../../../%CE%B1/%CE%BD/%CE%B4/User%7E%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%AD%CE%B1%CF%82_58b5.html" title="User:Ανδρέας">Andreas</a> 22:15, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Herodotus, writing in the New Ionic dialect, consistently refers to the Greek language as <i>Hellēnōn glōssan</i> or less often <i>Hellada glōssan</i> or <i>Hellada</i>. What's the intention by the way, to transcribe how ancient Greeks referred to their language? That would probably be a list of terms.Alexander 007 00:27, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I thought it was blatant to everybody that we've been using <a href="../../../e/x/o/Exonyms.html" title="Exonyms">exonyms</a> to describe the stages of the Greek language (and any language for that matter). If we had wanted to call the articles by the original language names, then we wouldn't have much of a choice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ancient and Koine Greek: Ελληνική</li>
<li>Byzantine and Modern Greek: Ρωμαϊκή</li>
</ul>
<p>And obviously that would be inaccurrate. As Andreas said, 'Ελληνικός' is completely wrong because it's in masculin adjective form, and the noun that it refers to is of feminin gender (γλώσσα=language). "Ελληνική γλώττα" (Greek language) is also inaccurrate because it's a very general term written in <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attic_Greek_d27d.html" title="Attic Greek">Attic</a>. Plain "Ελληνική" is already in use by the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek language</a> article, and it can also be confused with <a href="../../../k/o/i/Koine_Greek_17ca.html" title="Koine Greek">Koine Greek</a>. <i>Hellēnōn glōssan</i>, is simply the noun <i>Hellēn</i> put into <a href="../../../p/l/u/Plural.html" title="Plural">plural</a> <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genitive.html" title="Genitive">genitive</a>, followed by Ionic glossa in <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singular.html" title="Singular">singular</a> <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accusative.html" title="Accusative">accusative</a>, signifying "Greeks' language". <i>Hellada glossan</i> (Greece language) means nothing on its own, it probably ties up with a <a href="../../../d/a/t/Dative.html" title="Dative">dative</a> in the rest of the sentence. I think the best thing would be the use of a capitalized 'ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΗ' or the post-classic Greek term "Αρχαία Ελληνική" (Ancient Greek), or better yet nothing. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 19:54, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

In other words, it would not be against Wiki practice to list an autonym or autonyms for "Ancient Greek" if we find authoritative sources, but that may not add much to the article.

<p>It's the same way with Attic-Ionic. Attic is not a subdivision of Ionic. Not only that but big northwest Greek needs to be West Greek. I'm going to change it as soon as I get a minute. What the author was shooting at is the Encyclopedia Britannica's formulation; hence "most standard."

<p>Such terminology implies an author skilled enough in the subject to know what the most standard is or whether there is one. That would have to be a published professor of some years standing in the field. No offense intended but I doubt you are that, author. I would say, this sort of language would require a reference, even more than one. The article on <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_dialects.html" title="Greek dialects">Greek dialects</a> is a bit more sophisticated and does not have this problem. If you have a reference I for one would love to see it, as Attic is not usually stated to be a dialect of Ionic. If not, perhaps you could make the language a little less like a red flag and more suitable to the Greek Dialects article? Thank you so much.

<p>I'm trying to get confirmation on the definition of the word "pros" (pi, rho, omikron, sigma, I think). I am told by one source I consider to be very reliable that the word means to, toward or going toward. Nearly every other translation has it as "with". I don't believe "pros" can ever be used as "with" as accusative or genitive and I'm fairly certain it has not other declention. Most people translate "pros" as "with" because of the biblical passage "In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God..." If anyone with no theological imperative to defend could shed light on this problem I would be very appreciative.</p>

<p>I almost changed this article just now but I noticed it seemed to be a team effort so I thought I would bring this to your attention first. Let me say first of all how pleased I am to be among you momentarily. Now to business.</p>
<p>Mycenaean Greek is being excluded as ancient Greek. This is wrong.</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, it does not reflect general usage. The classification of Mycenaean Greek as a dialect of ancient Greek certainly bears this out.</li>
<li>Second, splitting the supposed "ancient Greek" from Mycenaean Greek is an original proposal. No one else that I ever knew does that. It seems like a quick but wrong solutuon to a Wiki space problem or someone's over-hasty innovation. Usually scholars try to place the Mycenaean among the subsequent dialects and local cultures.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>And, there are no events to warrant such a split. The mythology depicts a cultural continuation and the literature of the classical period asserts a continuation. There is nothing at all like the Slavic invasions and culture mixing that ended ancient Greek and started the language that was to become modern. That's right. The Slavs settled in the Peloponnesus. There was some population replacement after 1200 BC but it was of Greeks speaking one dialect of ancient Greek by Greeks speaking another.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Third, lumping of Mycenaean greek with Proto-Greek is not logical. Proto-Greek is entirely reconstructive, its provenience is not known, and there has to be a large time lapse between Proto-Greek and Mycenaean Greek.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Lastly, there is a naming problem. If Mycenaean is not ancient, just what would it be? You see, you are treading on the waters of rewriting Hellenic language history and this is not the place to do it. Mycenaean is a dialect of ancient Greek. Moreover, the rest of Wikipedia treats it that way.</li>
</ul>
<p>This situation can be fixed with just a few sentence changes, which I was about to do. We need to drop the idea that Mycenaean is anything substantially different and put it back among ancient Greek. So, there will be a Mycenaean historical period, ca. 1400-1200 and Linear B counts as written Greek, even though only business records. This isn't going to lengthen the article because Mycenaean Greek has its own article and so does Linear B.</p>

<dd>I took the liberty of moving these comments to a separate section according to their importance. The question whether the term "Ancient Greek" includes Mycenaean has to be discussed. Some sources should be quoted here. If there is consensus, this cannot be "fixed with just a few sentence changes". This article would have been renamed "Classical Greek", "Ancient Greek" would have to be a disanbiguation page, and the template "History of the Greek language" has to be amended accordingly. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasJS_121f.html" title="User:AndreasJS"><span style="color:white;background:#227">&#160;<span style="background:#338">&#160;<span style="background:#449">A<span style="background:#55a">n<span style="background:#66b">d<span style="background:#77c">r</span>e</span>a</span>s</span>&#160;</span>&#160;</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndreasJS_db1e.html" title="User talk:AndreasJS"><font size="-2">(T)</font></a></sup> 00:07, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is a simplistic generalization, but a typical Greek sentence (if there is such a beast), like Latin, puts the verb or verbal phrase at the end. If it were that simple, though. It's not just SOV though, for instance, the beginning of the Apol. 17a, OSV - Whatever impression, men of Athens, has been made on you by my accusers, I do not know. The literal order: That by you had been felt/impressed by my accusers, not I know. This is easy syntax compared to the rest of the dialogue, particularly given the interruptions and returns in Socrate's arguments. As a highly inflected language, the subject is often within the verb (in this case "I know" is one word, oida). Like Latin, the declinations and conjugations determine the syntax rather than word order. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 16:32, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Ancient Greek</b> is that name. <b>Homeric/Epic</b>, <b>Classical/Classical Attic</b>, and <b>Koine/Biblical</b> are dialectical divisions of it.</p>
<p>Mycenaean, and Medieval-Modern Greek, are separate languages in the Hellenic language family which are not mutually comprehensible with Ancient Greek. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 75.7.2.42 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_75.7.2.42_4db7.html" title="Special:Contributions/75.7.2.42">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Well, the matter is somewhat controversial. In many respects, Koine is closer to modern Greek—and <i>definitely</i> to Byzantine Greek—than it is to classical Greek, so it's usually considered its own period. But I agree that the phrase "Ancient Greek" is ambiguous. Perhaps this article should be renamed to something like "classical Greek" instead, although it's really about both Homeric-era and classical-era Greek, but <i>not</i> about <a href="../../../k/o/i/Koine_Greek_17ca.html" title="Koine Greek">Koine Greek</a>, which has its own extensive article. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 09:14, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Allegedly Ancient Greek had no <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interword_separation.html" title="Interword separation">interword separation</a>? This is not mentioned in the article, and if true the existing transliterations are misleading.

<dd>Quite right. Ancient Greek was written without punctuation, spaces, accents, breathing marks, or a capital/small distinction until much later (same is true of most languages until the Middle Ages, by the way). A 4th-century BCE text of the sample would have looked like:</dd>
