<p>An expert needs to check out the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greece_e4c9.html" title="Ancient Greece">Ancient Greece</a> article which has a VERY different date for when Ancient Greece came to an end. (Just call me a stirrer&#160;:-)).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yikes...that should have been redirected here before Gerald started working on it. I see Adam Carr has brought up some problems on the Ancient Greece talk page, so you could check there for the answer, but basically, although there may be many ways to determine the end date of "ancient Greece," 1453 is definitely not the right one. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 14:49, 22 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it's safe to say that "ancient Greece" also didn't end with the rise of Christianity, especially if were going to discriminate between "ancient" and "Hellenistic", as is done in the table on the main page. It should be something more like the death of Alexander.<a href="../../../r/m/a/User%7ERmagill_f1d6.html" title="User:Rmagill">rmagill</a> 14:07, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This section needs a major rewrite.</p>
<p>"After several years of inconclusive campaigning, the moderate Athenian leader Nicias concluded the Peace of Nicias (421)."</p>
<p>- The death of Cleon might have had something to do with this...</p>
<p>"Nicias was captured and Alcibiades went into exile."</p>
<p>- First problem: this makes it look like Nicias was captured, paraded through Sparta, given a nice farm in the western Peloponnese and died peacefully in his bed. Actually, the Syracusans put him to death (albeit against the wishes of Gylippus).</p>
<p>- Second problem: this makes it look like Alcibiades went into exile because of the failure of the expedition. No note is taken of the events of the night before the expedition set out (the mutilation of the Herms), the politicking surrounding those events, that Alcibiades was recalled to face trial before he ever reached Sicily, and that he went into exile, first in Sparta, then in Persian Asia Minor, to avoid death at the hands of his political enemies back in Athens.</p>
<p>- Third problem: no mention of the other general, Demosthenes.</p>
<p>- Another issue (which doesn't fit anywhere): no mention is made that the Sicilian Expedition lasted until 413 - reading the article makes it seem like it took place quickly over the Summer of 415.</p>
<p>"This was the turning point of the war."</p>
<p>- No it wasn't. Thucydides wants it to be (just look at how he structures his history), but it simply does not fit with historical evidence. Firstly, the war goes on for the best part of a decade after the failure of the Sicilian Expedition. Secondly, the Spartans failed to capitalise on the victory, allowing Athens vital time to rebuild her navy. Thirdly, Athens had the upper hand once Alcibiades had returned. Fourthly, that however badly the war was going, Athens could not lose unless she lost the ability to ship in grain, an ability not lost until the Battle of Aegospotami (where Alcibiades pops up again, telling them not to put their ships there...).</p>
<p><br />
-<b>Bold text</b>Actually, <b>Bold text</b>the Sicilian Expedition is regarded by most historians as the turning point in the 27-year long Peloponesian War. In response to your points, it is quite obvious that had Athens not lost such an amount of man power (possibly 100000 men) or as many ships (possibly 250) or even the city's greatest general, Alkibiades, she would have won the war. Athens would have been guartenteed a quick victory over the rest of Sicily as well, seeing that Syracuse was the only formidable opponent on the whole island. The treasures in Sicily would have amounted to interminable grain amounts and the riches and man power of almost a whole country. For the tedious Pelopenesian War, this would have been quite a grab. You mention that the Spartans did not capitalise on the victory they did receive in Sicily. (It should be noted that the Spartans only sent one man-Gyllipus-to Syracuse. The victory was the Syracusans.)The Spartans are not a capitalising society. They do not possess the necessary mindset to win a victory and the reap the benefits of it. And to your third point, the Athenians never held the complete advantage ever again. She ended up scrounging for ships and was put to the mercy of Sparta's only effective general, Lysander. P.S. Don't undermine the histories of Thucydides.</p>
<p><br />
"The loss of her fleet threatened Athens with bankruptcy."</p>
<p>- This is a rather anchronistic point of view.</p>
<p>"Within a few years the democratic party regained power in Athens and other cities."</p>
<p>- Nice gloss over the Thirty. Perhaps some more detail is due.</p>
<p>- More seriously, the division of Greek history between the 5th and 4th Centuries at 404 BC is rather outdated. The gap between the second and third parts of the Peloponnesian War* in 423 (or 421 if we're going on formalities) - 418 (or 415 if we're going on formalities) demonstrates that there were indeed gaps of several years in open hostilities. The gap between the third Peloponnesian War (418-404) and the Corinthian War (396-387/6) was arguably merely one of those lulls. The Athens-Sparta struggle was the major issue until the King's Peace of 387/6. Perhaps the section should be on the Peloponnesian Wars (including the Cornthian War).</p>

<p>Two comments:</p>
<p>1. Pederasty in ancient Greece. Obviously this is a controversial point (or will become one eventually), &amp; while I'm aware of enough scholarly rumors that this (like homosexuality) was practiced far more openly in Classical times than now, I'm requesting that someone document the known facts about this. (All mentions of pederasty in pre-Medieval times that I can recall off the top of my head date much later than this period.)</p>
<p>And I'm <b>very</b> sceptical that pederasty was practiced to limit population growth. On the one hand, infant mortality, disease, warfare, &amp; food insecurity were more than sufficient to keep population growth low (&amp; I remember reading that when a city was overpopulated, the citizens would choose a number of colonists by lot, &amp; send them off to found a new city). On the other hand, I doubt that the number of adults sexually attracted to children in ancient times was larger than it is now, &amp; also doubt that the ancients practiced birth control to consciously limit population on a significant scale. I would need to see some evidence of that motivation.</p>
<p>2. Isn't the subject of Alexander's exploits irrelevant to this article? A brief account showing how it brought the Greece of the city states to an end, though, is relevant, but as the section now stands, it would be better moved to the article on Hellenistic Greece. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 18:37, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree regarding pederasty, it is a disputed and speculative subject which is based on twisted interpretations taken out of context. Links from here to homosexual discussion pages are irrelevant and inappropriate.</p>

<p>Isn't the punic war part of Greece? Or is it part of rome?</p>
<p>The Punic Wars were 3 battles fought between Rome and Carthage [in 500's AD??] over control of trade in the Mediterranean. The third war was the one between Hannibal, using elephants to cross the Alps and gain advantage of Rome, and Scipio, a great Roman general.</p>
<dl>
<dd>They were in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, actually, and Hannibal was involved in the Second war. Anyway, Hannibal did flee to the Greek world, and Rome was involved in a war against the people shelering him, but this is after the period of "Ancient Greece". <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 15:57, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Afrocentric bias</b></dd>
<dd>I notice that you systematically promote typically Afrocentric views about ancient Egypt and other civilizations that are believed to have been "Africoid" in Afrocentric circles (Olmec, Sumer, Indus Valley, and even Greece). Your citing of a widely discredited study by Antonio Arnaiz-Villena that claims Greeks are genetically related to Ethiopians is a particularly egregious example of your bias, as the study contradicts all other genetic research on Greeks and has been heavily criticized by other population geneticists (see <a href="http://racialreality.blogspot.com/2004/09/study-clarification-ii.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://racialreality.blogspot.com/2004/09/study-clarification-ii.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>). Yet you dishonestly cited the article as if it were the only and last word. This is not an isolated occurence; to prop up your self-serving opinions you scour the entire corpus of literature to find a single source that might support your point, and proceed to cite it without mentioning that the views presented therein are not in the mainstream. - Dave Lowen ([62.121.100.26])</dd>
</dl>
<p>That is a hoax you're reading. The actual Spanish research mentions nothing about any "Macedonians", and simply detects that ancient Greeks arrived in the Balkans by 2000 BC. The part about "Macedonians" and "Ethiopians" was added by <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonian_Slavs_39ee.html" title="Macedonian Slavs">Macedonian Slavic</a> propagandists who made their own version of the research and spread it on the internet. So it's not an afro-centric view, it's a political propaganda. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 09:36, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Regarding comments on the study by Spanish geneticist Antonio Arnaiz-Villena, which showed that <i>a large number of Greek HLA alleles -- <b>those genes which are known to determine resistance to disease</b> -- cluster with Ethiopians and sub-Saharan Africans,</i> it is important to note that the Arnaiz paper which deals with Macedonia and Greece is called <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=11260506&amp;dopt=Abstract" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=11260506&amp;dopt=Abstract" rel="nofollow">"HLA genes in Macedonians and the sub-Saharan origin of the Greeks" and published in the magazine Tissue Antigens February 2001, vol. 57, no. 2, pp. 118-127</a>, while the article from which Pontikos has extracted his quote refers to a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=11543891&amp;query_hl=2" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=11543891&amp;query_hl=2" rel="nofollow">completely separate article which appeared in Nature magazine, dealing with a debate about how Jews and Palestinians are closely related</a>. The quote Pontikos is using does not even refer to the Greek-Macedonian study, but instead another one dealing with genetic differences between Palestinians and Jews. <b>It is therefore nothing less than a deliberate misrepresentation to project personal criticism of a report comparing Jews and Palestinians onto a separate report comparing Greeks and Macedonians, even if some of the data is cross-referenced.</b> As a matter of fact:</dd>

<dd><i>The limitations are made evident by the authors' extraordinary observations that Greeks are very similar to Ethiopians and east Africans but very distant from other south Europeans; and that the Japanese are nearly identical to west and south Africans.

<p>could some one expand on this "The distinguishing features of Ancient Greek society were the division between free and slave, the differing roles of men and women, the relative lack of status distinctions based on birth, and the importance of religion. The way of life of the Athenians was common in the Greek world compared to Sparta's special system." especially the part about woman and importance of religion. P.S. Religion is mentioned one time in this article in the above sentence and "women" or "woman" is only mentioned once or twice more Thanks. (69.139.32.33 04:00, 20 December 2006 (UTC))</p>

<p>Before the Arab conquests in the 7th century AD (or as the Arabs prefer to call it The Arab-Islamic Liberation) Arabia was the Arab peninsula only.

<p>Could you explain how obviate is correct? The word <i>obviate</i> is a verb, meaning to avoid or go around. <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/obviate" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/obviate" rel="nofollow">Wikt. def.</a> In that sentence, (The obviate cause was the growing resentment of Sparta and its allies at the dominance of Athens over Greek affairs.) it is used as an adjective modifying cause and <i>obvious</i> (an adjective) makes much more grammatical sense. Just a friendly question. <small><a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp"><font color="green">psch</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp"><font color="green">mp</font></a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp"><font color="green">talk</font></a></small> 17:31, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I noticed that as well, I guess obviate is not the right word...but whatever the word is, it is supposed to contrast with "immediate", and "obvious" is also not the right word. The immediate cause is one thing, the specific event of Corinth and its colonies, but there is a deeper cause in the background. What's the word for that? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 18:43, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>While ancient Greece may be loosely termed Classical Greece, the phrase “Classical Greece” or “Classical period” (in Greece) has the very specific meaning of c. 480 to 323 BCE in the fields of Archaeology and Art History. I have noted that there are small articles on the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archaic_period_in_Greece_f7ad.html" title="Archaic period in Greece">Archaic period in Greece</a> or <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hellenistic.html" title="Hellenistic">Hellenistic</a> (period), but that the link <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_period_in_Greece_e486.html" title="Classical period in Greece">Classical period in Greece</a> is redirected to this article. This is a most unfortunate circumstance as the concept of this period as a precise timeframe is in wide use in professional discussions of the art, architecture, and history of Greece. I would strongly urge that this be rectified and that all of the periods be standardized under the format (X period in Greece), including: Orientalizing, Geometric, Archaic, Classical, and (perhaps) Hellenistic. Each of these articles should contain a discussion of the relevant architectural developments, pottery techniques, and brief historical overview - with reference to major archaeological sites and finds.
