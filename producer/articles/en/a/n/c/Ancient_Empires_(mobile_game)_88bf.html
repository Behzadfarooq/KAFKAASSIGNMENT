<p>The games are played on a 2D landscape filled with grass, trees, mountains, rivers, etc. The player(s) and the computer control armies separated into squads. All squads have the same number of "hitpoints" (10 in first game, 100 in second). Most units can only attack targets in adjacent cells in main <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compass.html" title="Compass">compass</a> directions (north, south, east, and west). Several are able to attack at range and diagonally. Combat consists of one unit attacks another, then the target retaliates (adjacent main directions only). If the player has a <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castle.html" title="Castle">castle</a> on the level, he/she may purchase additional units from it. The first game requires the player's king to be in the castle for this to happen. This restriction has been removed in the sequel. Standard victory condition for the first game is to kill the enemy king, who is usually found at the castle, making him doubly difficult to kill. In the second game, the kings (called commanders) take a more active role in the gameplay, as they are not required to stay at the castle. Commanders are now able to be purchased at the castle after they are killed (their price depends on their current level). Units gain experience for attacking enemies. Units with low HP may be placed in a castle or a town to heal (20% of full HP is restored per turn).</p>
<p>Different types of terrain give different defense bonuses to units in them. For example, roads give no bonus, as they are good places to be ambushed, while a mountanous area gives a lot of defense bonus as the enemy has to fight uphill.</p>

<p>The game takes place in a fantasy <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">medieval</a> kingdom ruled by the benevolent King Galamar. The game begins with Galamar barely escaping a bloody <a href="../../../c/o/u/Coup.html" title="Coup">coup</a> by his younger brother Valadorn, who has taken control of the kingdom and declared a hunt on his brother. Galamar has few troops with him, and he is constantly being attacked by Valadorn's Red Legion. In the first part of the campaign, Galamar has to gather allies in order to strike back at his brother. These allies include the Lizard King, the Wizards of the Grey Tower, the Wyverns captured by Valadorn's forces, etc. Once Galamar defeats Valadorn for the last time, he realizes that his brother was under demonic control. The game ends with a <a href="../../../c/l/i/Cliffhanger.html" title="Cliffhanger">cliffhanger</a>.</p>

<p>The sequel begins almost immediately after the first game ends, as Galamar and Valadorn (free from spell) must now fight off a demonic invasion headed by the demon Saeth. The brothers split up in their attempt to defend their land. They find out that the demons focus their attacks on several temples and are stealing mystical crystals. They finally arrive to face Saeth himself, only to find that he has used the crystals to activate an ancient weapon of great power - Heaven's Fury. Now the brothers must use whatever forces they have with them to defeat Saeth's army and the great demon himself before he is able to destroy the kingdom with the weapon.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Soldier</b> - standard melee unit. Game description: hardworking and brave, soldiers form the backbone of any army. They are also the only unit that can capture towns to earn gold.</li>
<li><b>Archer</b> - ranged unit capable of firing within a 2-square radius. Game description: with their powerful bows archers can attack from a distance and are especially powerful against airborne enemies.</li>
<li><b>Lizard</b> - melee unit especially strong in water. Game description: descendants of the ancient amphibian empires spanning the marshlands in the east, lizards are proud warriors. They are immensely mobile and stronger in defence when in water.</li>
<li><b>Wizard</b> - weak melee unit, capable of making skeletons from tombstones. Game description: the ancient guild of wizards are weak at close combat, but immensely useful as they can summon fighting skeletons from dead troops.
<ul>
<li><b>Skeleton</b> - weak melee unit, its only advantage is that it costs no money to create and does not take up unit support.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Wisp</b> - weak melee unit, increases attack of friendly units closeby. Game description: these mystical beings of pure Light radiate an aura which adds attack points to nearby friendly units. In close combat they are especially deadly against skeletons.</li>
<li><b>Spider</b> - fast poisonous melee unit. Game description: spiders are dangerous creatures whose natural habitat spans the unforgiving dark forests of the west. In adition to being highly mobile, spiders use a poisoned attack to weaken their opponents for one turn.</li>
<li><b>Golem</b> - strong melee unit. Game description: forged out of living rock by the dwarf tribes of the Lost Mountains, golems are slow but immensely strong in defense. A golem stationed in a building or a well defended mountain is very difficult to defeat.</li>
<li><b>Catapult</b> - strong ranged unit, unable to perform melee attacks. Game description: catapults bring devastation wherever they go with their enormous attack range. However their relative immobility and inability to attack up close make them vulnerable, so guard them well. Catapults can either move or attack during a turn, but not do both.</li>
<li><b>Wyvern</b> - powerful aerial melee unit. Game description: these majestic flying beasts have ruled over the mountains of mist since ancient times. They are extremely mobile as well as deadly in attack on land, air and sea.</li>
<li><b>King</b> - the most important unit of the game; if he dies, the player loses. Game descrition: the heartbeat of the army, a King is very strong in attack and defense. Kings do not usually take part in battles, are they are the only units capable to buy new troops when stationed in a castle.</li>
