<p>find me a ancient macedonian word with a non-hellenic etymology.

<p>...ooooh....a challenge....sort of like arm-wrestling. very macho. Actually, there apparently are a number of Macedonian words that don't have clear "hellenic etymologies", but these can be viewed as loanwords from another people, so your challenge is irrelevant, and would not prove anything pro or con. good luck finding another earth-shattering challenge.

<p>How typical from our northern neigbours. When you refer to yourselves, you demand that everybody calls you Macedonian because that's what you call yourselves. But when you refer to the Ancient Macedonians, who SELF IDENTIFIED as Greeks, we have to sit and listen to what you (or some propaganda sources of yours) say about them. There is a Greek saying (from the Greek shadow puppet theater of <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karagiozis.html" title="Karagiozis">Karagiozis</a>) that goes: "Mine is mine and yours is mine". -- <a href="../../../a/v/g/User_talk%7EAvg_99c3.html" title="User talk:Avg"><span style="color:#9090f0;background:#ccf">&#160;<span style="background:#99f">&#160;<span style="background:#66f">&#160;<span style="background:#11f"><b>Avg</b></span>&#160;</span>&#160;</span>&#160;</span></a> 02:46, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Ancient Macedonans that self identified as Greeks?? Where did you get that idea from? I have never heard it. --<a href="../../../b/j/a/User%7EBjankuloski06en_b36a.html" title="User:Bjankuloski06en">B. Jankuloski</a> 23:21, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>uhmmm, mr Jankuloski, do you really think that a person with your last name is related in any way to ancient Macedonians?? In fact the name Macedonia is Greek, related to the adjective makednos and to the root mak- still existing in the greek word mak-ros, you can find it yourself in greek-origined english modern words such as macro-economics. Educate yourself before trying to bias history for your own nationalistic purposes. And if you can not find any ancient macedonians self identifying themselves as ancient Greeks look for Alexander the 1st in the early 5th century BC. Why dont you look up the names of ancient Macedonians: Krateros, Philippos, Amyntas, Olympias, Alexandros, Gorgias, Aristoteles, Protagoras, Parmenion, Hephaistion etc etc etc. ALL GREEK. You could not find one single name of an Ancient Macedonian that does not have a purely greek name. And i could tell you this. I am a greek but i do not care at all if Ancient Macedonians were Greeks or just a neighbour nation to Greeks like the ancient Thracians. Since they decided to embrace the greek culture and to be assimilated by Greeks, whats your problem? that still makes them Greeks. Blood doesnt count. What counts is culture, civilization, language and what you really want to be. I recognize your right to have as part of your national name the term "Macedonian", you could call your country either Northern Macedonia, Slavomacedonia or FYR Macedonia. Why dont you recognize our right to not let you Slavomacedonians monopolize this name and its history? At least my name is Dionysios, related to the god Dionysos, worshipped by ancient Macedonians and Alexander the Great (Alexandros o Megas). What is your name really mister -ski?

<p>The following paragraph makes absolutely no sense:</p>
<p><i>"Historians generally agree that the ancient Macedonians - whether they spoke a <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greek_c878.html" title="Ancient Greek">Greek dialect</a> or a distinct language - were absorbed into the <a href="../../../k/o/i/Koine_Greek_17ca.html" title="Koine Greek">Koine Greek</a>-speaking population in <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hellenistic.html" title="Hellenistic">Hellenistic</a> times."</i></p>

<dl>
<dd>The assimilation of XMK as a language/ethnicity is generally thought to have taken place in Hellenistic times, not before Alexander III's death. In the lead paragraph things are usually kept brief, but you can add info about the process beginning in pre-Hellenistic times. 69.106.104.144 17:56, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That doesn't match up with the other aspects that have so far been found, which point that XMK as a language/ethnicity was at least starting taken place since the <a href="../../../5/t/h/5th_century_BC_f46f.html" title="5th century BC">5th century BC</a>, such as: aside from <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thucydides.html" title="Thucydides">Thucydides</a>, who lived in the 5th century bc, proclaiming them as part of the ancient "Hellenic" tribes branch, we also have <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_I_of_Macedon_ea0c.html" title="Alexander I of Macedon">Alexander I of Macedon</a>, who modeled his court after <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athens</a> and was a patron of the poet <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pindar.html" title="Pindar">Pindar</a>; <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strattis.html" title="Strattis">Strattis</a> Athenian comedy which presents <b>Macedonian speech</b> as a form of Greek; the <a href="../../../h/e/s/Hesychius_of_Alexandria_3d8a.html" title="Hesychius of Alexandria">Hesychius of Alexandria</a> glosses where the majority of these words can be confidently identified as Greek; Persians who had no stake in calling them Greek, such as King <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darius_I_of_Persia_d556.html" title="Darius I of Persia">Darius Hystaspes</a>, who ruled over the Macedon kingdom during the 5th century bc, would call them <b>Yaunâ Takabarâ</b> ("Greeks with sunhats"), Yaunâ=Persian word when referring to Greeks and Takabarâ=Persian world in reference to the Macedonian headwear. The Persians must have seem some sort of Hellenic influence to call their Macedonian subjects "Yauna"; the Persians dealt with the ancient people back then, they didn't call the Thracians, Libyans, Carians etc as such, but they did with Macedonians. Plus the Persians had Greeks living in their back yards all over Asia Minor, I'm sure they could have told the difference between the people they ruled over; King <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archelaus_I_of_Macedon_3681.html" title="Archelaus I of Macedon">Archelaus</a> establishing the new capital at <a href="../../../p/e/l/Pella.html" title="Pella">Pella</a>, and holding annual festivals in honor of <a href="../../../z/e/u/Zeus.html" title="Zeus">Zeus</a> at <a href="../../../d/i/o/Dion%2C_Greece_9b5c.html" title="Dion, Greece">Dion</a> (a city right next to <a href="../../../m/t/2E/Mt._Olympus_00f7.html" title="Mt.

Which is why I questioned the "absorbance", if one has that view, of Macedon during the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hellenistic.html" title="Hellenistic">Hellenistic</a> ages, when there is some evidence to suggested it might have started earlier then that. ~<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallaccaos_16f5.html" title="User:Mallaccaos">Mallaccaos</a>, 25 May 2006

<li>The political acts of Alexander I tell us something about the political orientation of that king, but hardly about the ethnic background of his subjects - nobody doubts Macedonia started <i>importing</i> Attic culture from the south around that time. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 08:01, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>And how many sentences '<i>have been preserved</i> to tells us that this <i>single sentence</i> proves other wise?

(Not that I'd exclude they might, but who here is competent to judge this?)

<dd>The minute it is pointed to us of the linguistic articles which gives "proof" Borza's "linguistic" evidence disproves ancient Macedonian falling under the Greek dialects. As to the source of the Strattis comedy, it was taken from an article by Alfred Korte quoting Athenaios VII,323b which Sakellariou translated into English. ~<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallaccaos_16f5.html" title="User:Mallaccaos">Mallaccaos</a>, 27 May 2006

<dd>Ah, that's something. Could you provide a full citation of the source so we can include it in the article? As for the linguistic discussion about the pros and cons of the Greek-dialect hypothesis, see the language article, it quotes a few things. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 18:02, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

Let me make a suggestion: We should all get down from our respective soapboxes and spend a bit more time in libraries instead of on the web arguing and edit-warring. I'm still planning to rewrite the article, but not before I have read both Borza and Sakellariou <b>in the original</b>, and I very much recommend everybody else do the same.

<dd>Ofcourse, and as it was stated above, there <i>so</i> much evidence which points to it <i>not</i> falling within the Greek dialects.

<li>The Doric material (both Pella and Strattis) do not contradict the claim above about integration into the Koiné Greek-speaking population in hellenistic times, but support it. Whatever the relation between those Doric fragments and the elusive "Macedonian" proper - neither of them was <i>Koiné</i>. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 08:01, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>What people seem to not understand when making claims such as that is that the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hellenistic.html" title="Hellenistic">Hellenistic</a> Koiné Greek dialect, which was btw was based on the Attic dialect with numerious regional influences from local dialects, was not a phenomenon particular to Macedonia. Throught out the Greek world the Attic koine replaced the local dialects. So if you are basing the suppose "hellenization" of Macedonian on the integration of Koine Greek, then you might as well base that theory through out the ancient Greek world and say that Attica, Sparta and Thebes became "hellenized" at that same period too. ~<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallaccaos_16f5.html" title="User:Mallaccaos">Mallaccaos</a>, 25 May 2006
<dl>
<dd>I know what Koine was, thank you very much. The original sentence expressed the development quite precisely: Before the Hellenistic age, there was something that may or may not have been a Greek dialect; after the Hellenistic age, there was something else that was Koine. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 23:53, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The original sentence, gave one the assumption that Macedon became a "Hellenic" culture after the entire world had been conquered and Hellenized by the Macedonian Empire, when for the Macedonians to be "supposedly" so "Hellenized" by the time of Alexander the Great, their "Hellinization" would have started much earlier then Koine Hellenic age. Couplet with that all the other material written in this article, it gave the article a different feel to it...which I tried to balance with some of the material I added. This current version which you cleaned up, is much better, IMO, and more balanced to what we do know so far. ~<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallaccaos_16f5.html" title="User:Mallaccaos">Mallaccaos</a>, 25 May 2006

<dd>This article was created by Alexander 007 following a discussion held at <a href="../../../m/a/c/Talk%7EMacedon_117e.html" title="Talk:Macedon">Talk:Macedon</a>; and I hadn't been informed that we were vicious pov-pushers attempting to assure the victory for x side.

<dd>I guess the original idea was okay, but the article has spun a bit out of control and has become POV-forkish in large parts through some recent additions. I wouldn't mind refactoring it back into the two other articles, but I think the most pressing task is to put the discussion on a decent basis in the literature, and not that cheap rehashed stuff from the usual nationalist websites (see above). <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 20:38, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, you've all edit-warred enough for today.</p>
<ul>
<li>I agree with Pmanderson that Herodot's origin stories need to be put into some context, as there certainly are scholars who regard them as (a) mythical and/or (b) applying only to the royal house, not to the people in general. Both can easily be referenced. I think the text he proposed was not quite optimal though, I'd try to make it shorter.</li>
<li>As for the language formulation ("the language spoken..."), to my mind that formulation is so neutral it does not, in itself, entail a claim to <i>separate</i>-language status. Therefore, the addition ("... or Greek dialect") is unnecessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>What else were you quarrelling about? <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 00:34, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Of course contributions should be edited. If I had been edited, rather than having the text blanked, I would have let reasonable alternatives stand.</li>
<li>"Language" is incidental damage, although it is used in this context even by those who consider Macedonian a Greek variant; it is fairly widely considered to be further from the (other) Greek dialects than they are from each other.</li>
<li>Miskin has blanked all reference to Herodotus's account of the Argead descent; this unquestionably belongs in this article. I will quote it in full if necessary, although it should not be.</li>
<li>He has also left the impression that, if accepted, it would imply the same descent for the Macedonian generals, which does not follow. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 15:16, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As I said before this is a very controversial topic and edits must be very elegant. Pmanderson's were not at all, so I rewrote what I could and removed what seemed to be out of context. Nothing is conclusive and no view must be favoured over the other. All views must be given equal emphasis, and the order of presentation will depend on how many sources support each view (and not on the priority Alexander_007 decided to give). The article's sections must also be re-organised. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 01:39, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have yet to come across a scholar who questions or refutes Herodotus' citation in the article, i.e. that Macedonians were Dorian settlers. The Achaean and Heraclid origin of the Argead dynasty is a different story, and whether factual or not, it was accepted in antiquity even by Thucydides. However historian today do question its validity. Pmanderson's edits on the other hand were implying that scholars who doubt the mythical origin of the Argead dynasty would also doubt the Herodotian account on the Doric origin of Macedonians, which is not at all the case. One is about the Macedonians in general and the other is about its Royal family. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 15:43, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>By the way pmanderson, there is a school of scholars which regards Macedonian speech to be a Hellenic language sister to the known Greek dialects, and there's another school which regards it simply a Greek dialect with Thraco-Illyrian admixtures. The view on Macedonian being completely distinct to Greek is held by a minority. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 15:48, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oh and pmanderson try to look at other people's edits before accusing them. I didn't blank the reference on Herodotus' accounts on the Argead dynasty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Macedonians&amp;diff=55823428&amp;oldid=55823187" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Macedonians&amp;diff=55823428&amp;oldid=55823187" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (eventhough it's mentioned later in the article). I removed a small paragraph which was making POV conclusions on the ethnicity of the Hellenistic rulers, who were in reality not even Macedonians, therefore largely irrelevant to the section and the article in general. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 15:52, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I removed the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Both Philip II and Alexander the Great used this claim of kinship to secure recognition as Greeks, including an invitation to the Olympic Games."</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventhough this is probably sourced, within a such controversian topic you cannot present it as factual, let alone stick it in the "origins" section. As I said before, in my opinion pmanderson's purpose was to mislead the reader into believing that Herodotus' acount on the Dorian invasion is as mythical as his record on the Argead dynasty. I repeat: They are two distinct records. If you find a criticism on the former theory, then by all means stick it in, but don't try to generalise the criticism on the latter in order to refute all of Herodotus' mentions on Macedon.</p>
<ul>
<li>"This claim of kinship applies to the Macedonian royal house, which was extinguished shortly after Alexander's death. The Macedonian generals who thereafter made themselves kings over Syria, Egypt, and Macedonia itself were not members of that house; although Ptolemy I sometimes claimed to be an illegitimate son of Philip II"</li>
</ul>
<p>What does that have to do in the section "origins"? Later Hellenistic rulers were not even Macedonian, they were simply Greeks from all over the world. Therefore I don't see the need to point out the obvious, i.e. that they did not inherit Macedon's royal line. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 16:04, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

Come back when you can say: <i>"Author X has argued that, because even Greeks from other cities were treated as metics, we may conclude that the claim that Macedonians were "barbaroi" does not entail they were non-Greeks."</i> - I very much doubt you will find such an idea in reliable printed sources by reputed historians or linguists. Hint: the difference between "citizen" and "metic" is different from that between "Hellene" and "barbarian". - No partisan websites please (<a href="http://www.helleniclife.net/Refuting%20Anti%20Greek%20Propoganda.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.helleniclife.net/Refuting%20Anti%20Greek%20Propoganda.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>).
