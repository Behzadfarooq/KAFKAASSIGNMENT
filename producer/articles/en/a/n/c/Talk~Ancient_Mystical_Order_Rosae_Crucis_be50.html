<p>Is Rosicrucianism really a 'new religious' movement? AMORC began in the United States in 1915, but its charter(s)/ideas came from much older groups in Europe. Also, the AMORC specifically distances itself from religion. I am just wondering how this article ended up in this category? Obviously every group can't self-define, but I think it is a stretch to put AMORC here when it follows traditions at least 400 years old. Also the group doesn't seem seem to me to have anything religious in nature about it?? Interested in thoughts of others. 64.186.246.122 00:03, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Rosicrucian Park in San Jose is in itself a tourist attraction and curio. I think it justifies a page all its own, especially since there is no mention of it on this page. So I created the page called <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rosicrucian_Park_fcbb.html" title="The Rosicrucian Park">The Rosicrucian Park</a> because the page <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosicrucian_Park_3cbd.html" title="Rosicrucian Park">Rosicrucian Park</a> simply directs back to the <a href="../../../a/m/o/AMORC_32bf.html" title="AMORC">AMORC</a> page. Hopefully, someone can straighten this out and we can eventually drop the "The" in "The Rosicrucian Park," and "Rosicrucian Park" can be granted the page I made. But it is my sincere belief that Rosicrucian Park in itself deserves its own page. The <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptian_Museum_74e1.html" title="Egyptian Museum">Egyptian Museum</a> received its own page. Newager 06:28, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>FYI: A major update to this article is scheduled for January 2004. The Positio Fraternitatis Rosae Crucis will be summarized, presenting the main goals and ideas of the Rosicrucian Order, AMORC, regarding the current world situation. Some info may be written regarding the Radio Station, the Rosicrucian Park, the 2004 Peace Conference, and more. Also a more complete History section will be written, and information will be added for the Rose Croix University. Some other sections may be rewritten too.

<p>I realize 'secret' is the common translation of this word, but I think the meaning as in AAORRAC is really intended more as 'hidden' or 'esoteric.' Secret in modern parlance really has a different connotation. Should this be addressed somehow in the translation of AAORRAC? 64.186.246.122 23:47, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am afraid that the major update may be postponed for February. Now I wrote some <b>exclusive information</b> on the Radio Station. As far as I know, this information is not published on the Web. I will summarise the Positio manifesto in the future; Now I just added the Rosicrucian Utopia info. More information on Rosicrucian Park, the Order's history, the Rosicrucian University and the Rose+Croix journal will be added some time. I need suggestions on whether <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julie_Scott_4274.html" title="Julie Scott">Julie Scott</a> (S.R.C.) should be merged with <a href="../../../a/m/o/AMORC_32bf.html" title="AMORC">AMORC</a>.

<p>It's a fair beginning for an article, but there is definitely some work needed. Based on the call for editing for NPOV, I will guess that you are personally involved with the group. This is something that comes across in the writing style - somewhat. I would suggest that you look to combine sections together, giving the article less of a bulleted, "brochure-ish" feel, which may be of use to a potential adherent (particularly the "Teachings" section, which could be lost completely), and instead construct paragraphs with some "weight" to the more casual reader, who is interested in the facts without needing to know the more involved details; my guess would be that many of these single-sentence paragraphs could be dropped without changing the fundamental meaning of the article for the latter type of reader. The Critiques section could stand to quote from sources outside of AMORC - as is, it is really only serving the purpose of being a "<a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a>". There are a few places where word choice is questionable; for example, reference to the World Peace Conference as an "important conference" with no further description smacks of a touch of salesmanship. An alternative way to phrase it may be that the Conference will feature this important person delivering an address on peace in Ireland, or some such. In other words, show, rather than tell. By all means, though, stick with it. - <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScooter_ac1d.html" title="User:Scooter">Scooter</a> 04:34, 21 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you very much for checking the article. The article is not finished and I plan to double (at least) its size. The teachings part will probably moved to another article, because these teachings (Rosicrucian Monographs) are not exclusive to AMORC (although written by AMORC's founder <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvey_Spencer_Lewis_5139.html" title="Harvey Spencer Lewis">Harvey Spencer Lewis</a>, they are used by other organisations too, such as CR+C, which is one of the many "forks" after the 1990's corporate reorganisation of AMORC and some lawsuits regarding financial matters, which should also be mentioned with more details). I will add crititiques by the <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_L._Stewart_c18e.html" title="Gary L. Stewart">Gary L. Stewart</a> of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confraternity_of_the_Rose_Cross_8886.html" title="Confraternity of the Rose Cross">Confraternity of the Rose Cross</a> (also written by me), <a href="../../../f/u/d/FUDOFSI_727d.html" title="FUDOFSI">FUDOFSI</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constant_Chevillon_704b.html" title="Constant Chevillon">Constant Chevillon</a> (in FUDOFSI article, also written by me, I have included some criticisms I think).

<p>To me, the article looks more like a web portal site for the AMORC organization than an encyclopedic entry. That's not so much a problem of size, but mostly a problem of coherence and redundancy. For example, in the article it is stated at least three times which publications AMORC publishes, which of these are public and which are members-online. One <i>sentence</i> about the AMORC publications should be enough, something like: <i>AMORC publishes a number of magazines and newsletters: the public Rosicrucian Digest [see here], the members-only Secret Bavarian Rosicrucian [see there] and the highest levels top secret A.A.O.O. brevis, called O.O.A.A. breve for the French lodges.</i> -- <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETillwe_4049.html" title="User:Tillwe">till we *)</a> 01:20, 1 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the comments. In the past some parts of the current article were individual articles. Then, I merged them. Hence the redundancy. The "web portal" problem will be solved together with the redundancy after the rewrite I have scheduled to do this month. Currently there are too many external links in the article but I will get rid of them after I summarise their contents in the article. For example the links to the "Positio" will be deleted after I summarise the whole document here in WP. <a href="../../../o/p/t/User%7EOptim_ff75.html" title="User:Optim">Optim</a> 10:20, 1 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that the article is partial and sometimes redundant. It needs a major rewriting, but it is still possible to remove some blatant partiality and rewrite it under a more balanced approach, e.g. I removed and rearranged text in the <i>Mastery of Life</i> and <i>Positio</i> subsections for a more NPOV writing, but the relevance of these subsections in a WP article is still questionable. --<a href="../../../j/d/e/User%7EJdemarcos_a961.html" title="User:Jdemarcos">Jdemarcos</a> 10:18, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can not believe it! I was working on an essay and somebody has totally replaced this article with another one. Very sad to see, how people can abuse Wikipedia.

<p>To the writer:</p>
<p>You have completely failed to address the most important criticism from both <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScooter_ac1d.html" title="User:Scooter">Scooter</a> and <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETillwe_4049.html" title="User:Tillwe">till we *)</a>, namely, that this entire article is basically an apologetic for AMORC and in no way reflective of the Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> policy. I'm strongly inclined to delete the whole thing. It really is that bad.</p>

<p>till we *) was right, this article was a blaspheme upon Wikipedia. Hopefully I've done it some good. While I know almost nothing about the AMORC, I was able to condense the article drastically and remove small insignificant pieces of information regarding every specific publication they produce with no other information than the fact that it was produced. Also, I took out the obscene bolding. There are some areas where I am not inclined (I've already spent an hour fixing this one crap article) to research at the moment, specifically Criticism which in the form I found it was literally TAKEN FROM THEIR WEBPAGE! So, if anyone knows more about them than I, please look over the article and make sure I didn't take out anything important and if I did please replace it with MORE INFORMATION! Finally, I took out the largest block of web links I have ever seen on a page. Most of the deletions occured because they were multiples of the same website or because they were individual Rosicruician members. If there was an important website I took down, please replace it but don't go overboard. There are already too many for such a small group.<br />

<p><b>The background</b></p>
<ul>
<li>This article is related to a specific organization, among others which exist nowadays, created in 1915 (XXth century), AMORC: which <b>claims</b> - as other current-day organizations also do - historical-traditional inheritance to the original <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosicrucian.html" title="Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian Order</a>. Yet there is no public evidence, which one, from a common social point of view or historic perspective, may verify that connection (at the same time it <b>does not mean</b> that there is none).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The image Â«"The Temple of the Rosy Cross," Teophilus Schweighardt Constantiens, 1618Â» is believed or generally accepted to be a symbolical representation of the original <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosicrucian.html" title="Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian Order</a> as presented in Legend related to its possible founder <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Rosenkreuz_b804.html" title="Christian Rosenkreuz">Christian Rosenkreuz</a> (presented in the 3 initial manifestos (the <i>Fama</i> in 1614; the <i>Confessio</i> in 1615 and the <i>Chymical Wedding</i> in 1616) and which presents also the "Temple of the Holy Spirit" (the Temple of the Order).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>the image vs. the article</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The image as it is in the article <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosicrucian.html" title="Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a> it is fine since the article talks about known facts and legend surrounding this movement as a whole (since its historic evidences); but it is not Ok if attributed to one particular modern organization (AMORC or other), because on one hand, it is <i>modern</i> (so not the same, even if there is any connection) and, on the other hand, it is not the only modern organization to claim its (not yet verifiable) inheritance.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The action</b></p>
<ul>
<li>I ask for your benevolence towards my act of removing the referred historical image from this article; but if anyone is interested in introducing an image to this article should use for example one of the emblems, logo or trademark images of this current-day Organization (which may be found at its web sites).</li>
</ul>

<p>Is it appropiate to refer to conspiracy theories without providing evidence or bibliography in a Wikipedia article, as it is done in this article referring to possible links to financial arrangements related to the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_Solar_Temple_e7ba.html" title="Order of the Solar Temple">Order of the Solar Temple</a> and implication in activities such as <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Gladio_6040.html" title="Operation Gladio">Operation Gladio</a>? I don't think so for an encyclopaedia that wants to be a credible resource for students. --<a href="../../../j/d/e/User%7EJdemarcos_a961.html" title="User:Jdemarcos">Jdemarcos</a> 10:22, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I haven't been able to find ANY remotely credible evidence for this theory AT ALL--even in the refered articles. In my opinion this paragraph should be either supported or removed. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosicrucianinitiate_f317.html" title="User:Rosicrucianinitiate">Rosicrucianinitiate</a> 21:23, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
