<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/c/Talk%7EAncient_%28Stargate%29_c38b.html" title="Edit section: 2004">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">2004</span></h2>
<p>Major problems with this page:</p>
<p>1. "And, in fact had evolved originally on Earth several million years ahead of Humans."</p>
<p>The ancients MAY have evolved on Earth, but it's very unlikely. According to the first episode of Star Gate: Atlantis, the ancients whole purpose in life was to reseed the galaxy with humanoid life after a plague had wiped most of it from the universe. In this means, the ancients would have seeded the Milky Way, as well as the Asgard galaxy, and probably any other race that has since developed, including us humans.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yet SG: Atlantis episode "Before I sleep" (think it's S1E15) has some Ancient implicitly tell Dr. Weir that they were the first evolution of Humans on Earth. I'm starting to think that a) the plot is broken there b) the Alterans had a collective loss of memory regarding where they came from during their time residing in the Milky Way c) there was another race on Earth that actually evolved there but merged with the Alterans (who did come from outside the Milky Way).</dd>
</dl>
<p>2. "However, there came a time that many of the Ancients "ascended" to a higher plane of existence (spatial) to escape a plague that was destroying their population. Around this time, one of the ancient's cities on Earth, Atlantis, left Earth and went to the Pegasus galaxy, where it settled on the huge ocean of a planet with barely any land."</p>
<p>The "plague" happened long before the ancients left to go to the Pagasus galaxy. The entire reason for them going was to reseed that galaxy with humanoid life. Why would they go there if the plague would just wipe out the life they seeded eventually?</p>
<p>3. "When the Atlantean Ancients returned, the plague was spreading."</p>
<p>Where are you getting this information? Are you creating it like fan-fic, or are do you actually have show references?</p>
<p>The Plague happened WAY before the ancients seeded ANY galaxies. It was their job to reseed the galaxy after the Plague had already killed off all living beings except the ancients (they were carriers).</p>
<p>4. "After breeding with the humans who had the same physical appearance, some ascended, and became god-like beings"</p>
<p>What?!? See, now I know you're making this up. There is not one single reference for this in the show at all. The reason why some humans (1/16,000) can use ancient technology is due to the fact that we're evolving into ancients, or rather we're evolving the neccessary biology that will allow us to be like the ancients (regeneration abilities, healing others, empathic abilities, so on). The ancients seeded planets with their DNA, and the life that evolved from that DNA will eventually have the same abilities as the ancients once had. They're repopulating their race, not having sex with cavemen.</p>
<p>5. "The Ancients are a member of the alliance of four great races."</p>
<p>The ancients WERE (past tense) part of the alliance of four great races. They're ascended now, and their rules prohibit them from interfering in lesser races advancement. They no longer contribute to the alliance, thus they're no longer members.</p>
<p><br />
I'm going to put together some real references from some real sources, and then rewrite this article, because as it stands now, it's mostly fan-fic inspired, not actually factual pertaining to the series.</p>

<p>I think its getting pretty obvious that ancients are just humans, on the episode where they find the ancient girl in antarctica it said something about the humans being another cycle with the ancients haven previously chosen to return. I don't know, check it out. I'm not a anorak and I saw that episode eons ago --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosquius_a7b7.html" title="User:Josquius">Josquius</a> 22:33, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>In the ending of this season, they state that the wraith are evolved from the parasite and the humans. I'm not updating the page directly because I don't have detailed references and it's messed up otherwise anyway. DÅ‚ugosz</p>
<p>Actually, IIRC it's only speculated at by the human main characters on account of the similarities between Wraith DNA and both humans and the tick-like bugs. They could well be wrong about it, they've been wrong about other stuff before as well (their original speculation on why Teyla could sense Wraith, for example). I don't have the detailed references handy either, but I'll continue tinkering with the article as I come across them. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:38, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ascention happened AFTER they left for Pegasus! They were still researching it on Atlantis!! (See Hide And Seek) This will require a pretty big rewrite.</p>
<p>Also, two other ways the Ancients combatted the Plague were the failed Time Machine from Window of Opprotunity and the Dakara Superweapon. I'm not as good a writer as some other people, so its probably best if someone else fixed the myriad of errors.</p>

<p>There are many things wrong with the history of the Ancients.</p>
<ul>
<li>1. If the ori wanted the atlantiens to worship them wouldn’t they have been protected by the ascended beings that that thought is was wrong to interfere in lower technologically advanced beings.</li>
<li>2. I thought that there were two groups of ascended beings the ori and ascended beings that that thought is was wrong to interfere in lower technologically advanced beings.</li>
<li>3. If the atlantiens were the ascended beings that that thought is was wrong to interfere in lower technologically advanced beings why didn’t the ori enslave them to worship before they ascended.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>4. If the wraith evolved by sucking the blood of the ancients than in order for the wraith to be 100 times more numerous they would have had too suck the blood of 99% of the ancients.</li>
<li>5. It would take decades at best for the wraith to evolve to the point of space travel capable of destroying the ancients.</li>
<li>6. The wraith can not survive without human food.</li>
<li>7. Why would the ancients allow there people to be killed off for decades allowing the wraith population to grow and evolve to the point of space travel capable of destroying the ancients.</li>

<dd>You mean Ascended? The answer is neither, their isn't really anything to discuss on that issue.

<p>Since I don't want anyone reverting this, I'll refer you to Anubis' research log in "Prototype", episode 909. <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELockesdonkey_1c7d.html" title="User:Lockesdonkey">LD</a> 03:20, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I disagree, for a few reasons. Just because the text was aligned to the right doesn't mean that it is read from right to left. There was some text on the top left that was aligned to the left, and not the right. In addition, Anubis was using the language as code. He could have done anything to it to make it more difficult to decypher. What Anubis used isn't necessarily pure ancient. Also, we've seen Ancient text scroll in both directions. (But mostly from right to left, showing that the text would be read from left to right.) And I was watching 'The Siege', and some text written in Ancient is aligned in either direction, so we can't really assume that to mean anything at all. Also, when they are looking at a screen in the satellite's interior, and Grodin is pointing out the location of a circuit, the text scrolls in from left to right. If a civilization read their text from right to left, they wouldn't have their computers doing that. MioTheGreat 05:27, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, you have me on some of those (for the moment), but as for your Grodin argument, I'll refer you to the <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Jazeera_a71d.html" title="Al-Jazeera">Al-Jazeera</a> <a href="../../../n/e/w/News_crawl.html" title="News crawl">news crawl</a>, which, despite being written in the right-to-left Arabic script, moves from the left side of the screen to the right.

<p>Just thought I would mention that in Atlantis (the city), the central staircase's writing on certain steps is upside down. This can also be seen in the Season 8 episode where Jacob/Selmak and Carter are trying to decipher the writing on the wall in the temple on Dakara and must rotate the sections of the wall 90 degrees in order to get the correct translation. There is first the question on whether or not we should go ahead and "translate" the text according to each symbol's Latin Alphabet equivalent. If that is indeed part of the process of determining which way the text is written, then it seems that when the symbols are right-side-up the text is written left to right and when the symbols are upside-down they are read right-to-left. It is possible that the creators of the show are attempting to establish that the Romans and Greeks (and whatever others) based their system of writing in both directions on this.</p>

<p>I know this is probably a few months too late but here's my take on it.</p>
<p>The Lanteans are a different sect/faction of Ancients than the Ancients. I mean, the Ancients were only called the Ancients when they came to the Milky Way, back in the Ori galaxy they were the Alterans and when they moved to Pegasus they renamed themselves the Lanteans. It's basically like different states or countries of them to distinguish their different societies and such.</p>

<dd>I agree with the "it's like different namings", so Ancient = <i>English</i> ie. Milky Way name for <i>any</i> individual of the FIRST evolution of mankind, (At)Lanteans = Pegasus name after "Atlantis",</dd>
<dd>but then: Alteran = (is Latin for "the others" - and Latin was influenced by Merlin&amp;Co-returners to Milky Way) all Ancients that left the Home Galaxy (now:OriGalaxy) for the Milky Way (explains the Alteran Communication Device MilkyWay&lt;-&gt;OriGalaxy); Ori = group of people disagreeing with the technological ideology, preferring religion and staying home. cf.<a href="http://www.gateworld.net/omnipedia/races/links/ori.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gateworld.net/omnipedia/races/links/ori.shtml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<li>No, it rather is <i>being</i> changed: I do not know what they call themselves, until now i only heard they refer to individuals of their (first) evolution as those "of our kind". But they are given different names according to circumstances: Ancients who live in Atlantis=Lantians, Atlanteans etc. And people who distinguish themselves (like an Opposition)= Others, or same in Latin <i>altera</i>.--<a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlammingo_0f6f.html" title="User:Flammingo">Flammingo</a><sup><a href="../../../f/l/a/User_talk%7EFlammingo_7d70.html" title="User talk:Flammingo">Parliament</a></sup> 11:46, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I guess that you might have something in that the Ori don't call themselves Alterans. When Daniel asked the Ori possessed Doci if he knew who the Alterans were, the Ori seemed to get <i>really pissed</i>—of course, I might have imagined hearing him sound pissed, as someone whose eyes were on fire just comes across as angry—but I digrees. Are we absolutely sure that Alteran just refers to those that believed in science, or is it a play on words, a nod to the "Others". -- <a href="../../../s/f/h/User%7ESFH_3da7.html" title="User:SFH">SFH</a> 22:43, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Please excuse me if I'm being obtuse or have missed something, but is there actually anywhere in the show where a Lantean identifies him or herself as being an Alteran or an Ancient? The reason I ask is that both Ayiana, and O'Neill when given Ancient knowledge/brain alterations, were able to perform incredible mental tasks (such as telekinesis) that has been identified as a state on the way to biological ascension. Ayiana was 5-10 million years behind the Lanteans seen in the Atlantis episodes "Before I Sleep" and "Aurora", yet none of the Lanteans seemed even vaguely capable of such tasks, nor did they seem capable of the extraordinary perception demonstrated by the Anubis clone in the SG-1 episode "Prototype". Thus, it would seem that the Ancients were on their way to biological ascension several million years before the Lanteans managed it, and even before the research into Ascension based on the energy being in (I think) "Hide and Seek".</p>
<p>While I grant that this is all original research, given the evidence I have presented, it seems to be no more unsubstantiated than the claim that the Ancients of Ayiana's time are the same people as the Lanteans when considering the vast differences between them. Can anyone shed light on this? --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDespair_b0fe.html" title="User:Despair">Despair</a> 17:34, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Perhaps I missed something here but I know the name Ancients was given to the Alterans by early Romans. Ori is a name later associated with the ascended being who demand worship. It's been explained that the Ancients were once called the Alterans. Unless I missed something it was never explained whether this was the original name for their race (assuming the Ancients and Ori were once one race and not two living in the same galaxy or on the same planet), or a name that they took later after separating themselves from those later known as the Ori. It seems that someone is putting a whole lot of assumptions and pressumptions into this entire article.

<p>This article makes it sound as if all the ancients left for the peagasus. they didn't. Many were left behind. There has been technology found in the milky way from the time period that they were in the peagasus. Also, thor stated that the asgard elevloved about 30,000 years ago. It makes sense that if the great alliance came after that, but before the Goa'uld, it was between 25000 to 10,000 years ago, when the Ancients were in the peagasus. Reading the article it seems like Ayana was the only one left behind. She wasn't. The are other subtle inacuracies in this article. Depite them, I have to say that this article is improving. When I put the cleanup tag on, it was herendous, but its a little better now. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobyk777_9e17.html" title="User:Tobyk777">Tobyk777</a> 06:09, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>How many and who exactly? Technology found in the Milky Way either predates them leaving or was left when the returned (repository of the Ancients). Ayiana was the only non-ascended Ancient left behind. Orlin wasn't left behind. He was banished. No real timeline is given to his original ascension.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Asgard evolved 30,000 years ago? I'm not entirely sure but which episode was this? I need to verify if he was referring to there current state (the used to look more human). However, as you state "evolved" not "came into being" so the alliance could have existed before the Alterans left for the Pegasus galaxy. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAarlin81_16e3.html" title="User:Aarlin81">Aarlin81</a> 04:05, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In the episode, <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revelations_%28Stargate_SG-1%29_7eb1.html" title="Revelations (Stargate SG-1)">Revelations (Stargate SG-1)</a> it was explicitly stated that the Asgard were building thier first ships 30,000 years ago. This was about the time that they became super advanced. The Ancients are called the Ancients, even by the asgard, because they are Ancient. they came millions of years before the asgard. The alliance took place at about the time that the Ancients wer in the peagasus. It couldn't have been after they came back because in that time the Goa'uld had risen to power. Also, saying that only 1 Ancient was left behind, is also saying that all Ancient tech found by SG-1 is from over 5 million years ago. that just doesn't seem right. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobyk777_9e17.html" title="User:Tobyk777">Tobyk777</a> 04:21, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just checked out the episode. The 30,000 year reference points to when the ship (that was lost an drifted through space) was launched. Now given that timeline it does appear that the Asgard atleast joined the alliance during the time when the Ancients were in the Pegasus galaxy. However, when you consider that the Nox are Milky Way residents they would have been wiped out when the Ancients wiped out all life in the MW. However, the exact timelines of when the races joined (not always an alliance of 4) is unknown.</dd>

<dd>Now the Asgard do not call the Ancients the Ancients because they are Ancient. The name Ancients was given to them by the Romans.

<dd>Now the technology. You assume, incorrectly, that all technology found is from before they left. Not true. The repository/library of the Ancients would have likely been left after their return. The Ancients were still trekking around while the Goa'uld were playing around in the Milky Way (how many Goa'uld were in power at the time is not known exactly). Since all life was wiped out (except for Ayiana who was in the chamber at Dakara) any others left behind would have been wiped out. There has been no evidence to even suggest that any others were left behind (atleast not alive). So, Ancient outpost = 5 million years, repository/library = sometime after their return. Now wrap your heads around this. Because the alliance met in the Milky Way, it's likely that some Alterans were poking around and left some stuff, not people left behind. The others were doing some poking too (Furling Utopia). <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAarlin81_16e3.html" title="User:Aarlin81">Aarlin81</a> 02:41, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Somebody decided to put a whoe lot of "incorrections" and assumptions in the section titled Milky Way (first time). It seems that the speculation that Aiayana, already infected, was left to "restart" life in the Milky Way was not right according to their assumptions.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Some fans,believe that the Dakara Device wiped out all life, it has the power certainly, to reseed life, for this to be true the Nox would not exist. The Device simply replenished life in the Milkyway.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This supposed assumption that the Nox wouldn't exist is apparently based on the alliance of the four great races. It has been stated that the Ancients restarted life in the Milky Way. The assumption that the Nox wouldn't be around is simply WRONG. There is NO timeline given as to when the alliance was formed. Beyond the Asgard's statements that it took many millenia (a millenium is 1000 years), there is no definitive time frame present in the show. It has never been established as to how old the Nox race is either. Given that the Alterans left Earth 5 million years ago (according to the SG:A pilot "Rising") it is perfefctly safe to theorize that the Nox would have had this time to come into being. That is of course if they are even from the Milky Way originally or settled there some time later. Given that all four races have had some type of purpose for being in the Milky Way which may be how the races came into contact with each other. It is also safe to assume that after life was restarted in the Milky Way, that the Lanteans would have possibly made treks to Earth from the Pegasus galaxy (possibly to meet with other alliance members. Given that any stargate could dial Earth (until they were locked out before they evacuated to Earth which is explained in the episode "Before I Sleep") it's pretty much a given that some might have made these treks. This could also have been how they met the other races given that all members have had some reason for being in the Milky Way (Lanteans - well duh, Nox - they live their, Asgard - study/exploration, Furlings - Utopia). <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAarlin81_16e3.html" title="User:Aarlin81">Aarlin81</a> 20:19, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It isnt perfectly safe to therorize that the alliance was formed 5 million years ago. That is wrong. The Asgard were stated in the season 5 finale to have evolved to their current state 30,000 years ago and only had primitive spaceships at that time, thus the alliance was more recent than that. Since the Ancients came back from Atlantis 10,000 years ago, the Ancients had to be in the alliance after they came back. The first time they were in the milky way was too early for the asgard to be in the alliance. Plus, they wouldn't be called the Anceints by the asgard unless they were older than the other races. The Ancients had to have been in the alliance the second time they were in the milky way, making it 10,000 years ago, which was the time the asgard became super-advanced. No time frame was given for the nox, but they were in the alliance, and with the "Ancients" so like the asgard, they are probably more recent. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobyk777_9e17.html" title="User:Tobyk777">Tobyk777</a> 03:26, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

That was simply to suggest that is where they would have likely met each other (or atleast the Nox and Asgard). I was refering to the where not when.</dd>
<dd>The Ancients aren't called the Ancients because they are older than any other race. They are called that because thhis is how the Romans knew them. The Ancients then adopted the term (We are the Ancients). It's more likely that the Asgard later adopted this term or that they joined the alliance after the Ancients began referring to themselves as the Ancients. Of course it could be that the writers had simply introduced them this way and didn't want to have 50 names for them from day one. It is quite possible that the Asgard were the last or second to last as well. We haven't seen the technological level of the Nox or the Furlings either. The 3 races might have been kicking around the alliance with the Asgard joining up later. The Asgard did mention that the alliance took many millenia to create. However, this does not make it clear if they mean as a whole or from when they joined up.</dd>

<p>Too much of this article makes the assumption that Alterans = Ancients and has nothing to do with the Ori. In Avalon part 2 Merlin's book reads</p>
<dl>
<dd>'Once upon a time, there was a race of people that went on a great journey through space, across the universe. They were called the Altera. After much time [thousands of years] they found a great belt of stars.' The Alterans named their new home Avalon and built many 'astria porta'</dd>
</dl>
<p>While there has been a lot of reference to the Alterans and the Ancients, it has yet to be established that the Ori were are also not (or were once) Altera. If time allows I will start determining how to separate these two. It seems that there is enough evidence to support the original species being called Altera while Alterans being some type of off-shoot or yet another name they gave themselves is pure speculation.

<p>Where did that alphabet come from? The existence of 10 seperate digits contradicts The Fifth Race, in which it is shown (or at least heavily implied) that the Ancients used the Octal, and not the Decimal number system. (DrZarkov 08:04, 26 July 2006 (UTC))</p>
<dl>
<dd>With the airing of Atlantis the producers decided to come up with a real and standard Ancient language as apposed to the random symbols used in the previous seasons (aka The Fifth Race). The new alphabet was designed so the actually text shown in the episodes would mean what it was supposed to mean. There is an ancient symbol for each letter of the alphabet and a symbol for the numbers 0-9 as well. If you want to justify it, just call it a different dialect or something. --<a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPaddyffrench_9b37.html" title="User:Paddyffrench">Paddyffrench</a> 12:36, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The Repository/Library of the Ancients works by downloading compressed data into the brain (likely subconcious which is believed to be able to store massive amounts of data). The information later unspools and writing itself into the persons concious mind (yet in no exact sequence). It's likely that as an advanced race the Ancients (Alterans) had developed quite a few numbering and mathematical systems.

<p>It was inserted into the known ancients section that Melia and Ganos Lal are one in the same. Melia is given as the name of the Atlantian/Alteran counsel member. She is also shown to be in agreement with Moros at the counsel (regarding Janus' time travel experiment). Ganos Lal is the Alteran name of ANOTHER Lantian/Alteran whose rival is Moros. Both had avatars in Atlantis. One served to greet the expedition team while the other is a teaching and search tool. "Melia and Ganos Lal are one in the same. The former is the ascended form of the latter" is just plain wrong as both are names for PRE-ASCENDED Alterans. To claim that Melia (who was in two episodes of SG:A (Rising and Before I sleep), and Ganos Lal created the educational query tool as well as the avatar in her image. Only Ganos Lal (le Fay) is known to have taken on another persona.</p>

<p>The article, particularly the history section, continues to make many unwarranted, unsourced assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was it ever stated that the Alterans "fled" from the Ori? I don't recall there being any mention of actual violence or attempted genocide when the two parted ways. Gateworld and other Wikipedia pages make no mention of this.</li>
<li>It was never actually confirmed that Ayiana's illness was <i>the</i> plague that brought down the Ancients' Milky Way civilization (although, I believe it is safe to assume that the writers wish us to believe that is true).</li>
<li>Nothing has ever indicated that Ayiana was the only one to remain behind when Atlantis departed. Other Ancient cities in the Milky Way could still have been active and populated. The timeline seems to problematically assume that all of the Ancients were always together in the same galaxy.</li>
<li>The Ancients did not <i>cure</i> the plague, they hit a big reset button on life in the Milky Way as a last-ditch means of stopping it from spreading! And, if Ayiana was infected by it, that means that the plague occurred concurrently with (or following) the departure of Atlantis, <i>not before</i>. We do know, however, that this event was a few million years ago.</li>
<li>The tablet Daniel reads in <a href="../../../f/u/l/Full_Circle_%28Stargate_SG-1%29_fc7e.html" title="Full Circle (Stargate SG-1)">Full Circle</a> says that many Ancients ascended as a means of avoiding death from the plague: Ancients were ascending long before the war with the Wraith.</li>
<li>The article assumes that all (or most) of the (non-Ori) Ascended are Ancients. Several sections discussing Ascended beings would be more appropriate in <a href="../../../a/s/c/Ascension_%28Stargate%29_3a10.html" title="Ascension (Stargate)">Ascension (Stargate)</a>. In particular, most of the "Philosophy" section should be moved to <a href="../../../a/s/c/Ascension_%28Stargate%29_3a10.html#Rules" title="Ascension (Stargate)">Ascension (Stargate)#Rules</a>, since it's more accurate than what's currently there, and somewhat distracting here. Instead, the Philosophy section should focus on what is known of the Ancients' beliefs <i>before</i> they ascended.</li>
<li>The placement of the creation of the Alliance of four great races as strictly after the fall of Atlantis is unproven. IIRC, certain comments here and there make it hard to believe that it could be as recent as 10,000 years ago. Is it not possible that some other Ancients from returned from Atlantis before the war with the Wraith?</li>
</ul>
<p>There's probably other factual errors here, too, but those are the ones that jumped out at me. Westacular 08:07, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>With regards to the departure from the Alteran-Ori home galaxy, Orlin specifically said that it was the <b>Ori</b> who tried to wipe them out. They fled to avoid a war.

<p>according to "the fourth horseman", they once lived in the same society, were a single species, etc, all living happily together on the road to ascension... until two groups began to form, one believing in science (alterans), and one in religion (the ori). then the alterans left. wouldn't that make them an offshoot of the ori?</p>
<p>the situation is somewhat similar to the first pilgrims settling in america, wouldn't you say? persecuted in england, they fled to america. doesn't that make the americans (or at least some) an offshoot of the english as well? <a href="../../../m/a/a/User%7EMaartentje_fff3.html" title="User:Maartentje">Maartentje</a> 22:31, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I suppose, but the wording seems to imply that the Ori are the "main" race of humans, and that the Ancients are rogues or deviants, instead of the otherway around. Maybe that's just me. -- <a href="../../../s/f/h/User%7ESFH_3da7.html" title="User:SFH">SFH</a> 23:29, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>well, they did call themselves "altera", which is Latin for "the others". so apparently, they consider themselves rogues as well. but you're right, "the same race" does sound a bit more neutral... <a href="../../../m/a/a/User%7EMaartentje_fff3.html" title="User:Maartentje">Maartentje</a> 15:31, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The way the show sounded to me, it is the Ori who are the minority though neither is really an 'offshot' since both divided at the same time. One could I suppose say they are both offshots of one base philosophy that splintered post ascension. In fact since the Ori can't actually take on and defeat the Ancient/Alterans I think that to some extent at least implies they are the inferior power as well (since if they could just defeat them, they would have just ruled over our galaxy from long ago) and even though the Alterans fled it wasn't because they couldn't take on the Ori, it was philosophically they couldn't bring themselves too. I think the show is trying to say or at least we can logically deduce the Ori are very much the minority not the other way around, and much of what they do is because they wish to reverse that position. Neither is an offshot of the other though, they formed at the same time from what was one people. Neither really has anymore claim to being the 'true' people then the other, though I'm sure the Ori would make that claim just as I'm sure the Alterans would never make it. [Thursday, 2007-01-11 T 16:39 UTC]</p>
<p>why couldn't the ancients take on the ori? their policy of non-interference (not to be confused with pacifism) only prevents ascended beings from interfering with the mortal world. As the ancients/alterans were not ascended at the time, they had no philosofical reservations against fighting the ori. but as they were forced to flee from their galaxy, they were probably confident they didn't have a chance against them. and also, just because the ancients' population grew over the millennia and eventually outnumbered the ori's doesn't mean they can't be considered an ofshoot. to continue the analogy of the english and and american people, they're a lot more americans then english too now. but technically you're right, it's more like a schism. <a href="../../../m/a/a/User%7EMaartentje_fff3.html" title="User:Maartentje">Maartentje</a> 18:39, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
