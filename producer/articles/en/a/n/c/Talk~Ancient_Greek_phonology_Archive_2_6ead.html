<li>The accepted view is documented in not only Allen quoted above, but also (for example, quoting only those books which I happen to have to hand):

<li>E H Sturtevant, The pronunciation of Greek and Latin, Aries Publishers Inc, 1940.
<ul>
<li>All of the above works support (with minor variations) the "Erasmian and English pronunciation". Sturtevant in particular considers an alternative pronunciation like that proposed by Caragounis, only to reject it as not cogent. His reasons interestingly include the testimony of the ancient grammarian Dionysius Thrax (part of <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoss_Burgess_d0d4.html" title="User:Ross Burgess">rossb</a>'s comment 19:52, 19 November 2005 (UTC))</li>

My suggestions are to improve the article instead of renaming it, engaging edit wars and splitting it. Let's get this article into a higher quality level with the help of all interested parties.

<p>I'm not in the mood of editing the article right now. Perhaps <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Greek_phonology&amp;diff=29688584&amp;oldid=29617407" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Greek_phonology&amp;diff=29688584&amp;oldid=29617407" rel="nofollow">this should be checked</a> by people who are involved in the last edits, so when (or if) user Thrax comes back, he'll find a much better article than the previous (let's say 2 days ago) one. (note I don't want to satisfy Thrax and I disagree with Caragounis POV, I'm interested in NPOV and I think all of us are). <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">☎</a></small> 13:21, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've taken the freedom of continuing along the lines I started this morning, which has led to another rather big additon to the history section. I now see the section has involuntarily become rather large. If the whole topic-drift is not to the liking of other editors or if you feel it's too long, please feel free to shorten or restructure or move somewhere else. It might need intermediate headings too. I hope it's not too bad from the NPOV perspective. I might not again have that much time to go on contributing over the next few days. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> 14:01, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hebrew scholarship is against the reconstructed pronunciation</span></h2>
<p>According to Hebrew scholarship the Proto-Semitic letters b, p, d, t, g, k all became fricatives (like in modern Greek) after vowels in Hebrew and Aramaic based on evidence from Ancient Greek translations (ie. The Septuagint's translation of the Hebrew bible and the Josephus Greek translation of his original writings from Aramaic into Greek). Futhermore Proto-Semitic also had a fricative g (like Gamma) as well a fricative h which both survive in Arabic and which are known to have existed in spoken Biblical Hebrew. The Proto-Semitic fricative g did not survive in the written Hebrew language but was still used in the spoken language in Hellenistic times and this resulted in the Septuagint transcribing the Hebrew name 'Amorah (aMRH) as the correct Proto-Semitic name Gomorra. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Hebrew#Historical_sound_changes" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Hebrew#Historical_sound_changes" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/10.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bartleby.com/61/10.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/JPG/proto.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bartleby.com/61/JPG/proto.jpg" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Now since the Septuagint was translated by 72 Hebrew scholars not Greeks it is clear that if Gamma was pronounced as a hard G in 280 BC when the translation was made these 72 Hebrew scholars would have never identified it with Proto-Semitic fricative g which was no longer written as anything more than an aspiration mark (if such things existed in Hellenistic Hebrew). If Gamma was not a pure fricative in 280 BC these 72 Hebrew scholars would not have learned it as such and they would have not written Gomorra but would have used an aspiration mark or nothing at all. From Herodotus it is clear that these 72 Hebrew scholars would have learned Greek as children rather than as adults thus assuming that their average age was 60 (they are described as elders after all) the Greek that they learned would have dated from the time that Alexander conquered Palestine in 330 BC which means that modern Greek gamma must have been fully developed in this time in order for all of these 72 Hebrew scholars to have recognised it as such in their transcription. Furthermore as has already been stated Hebrew b, p, d, t, g, k were all fricatives in Hellenistic times corresponding to the modern pronunciation of β, φ, δ, θ, γ, χ in Biblical Greek. If gamma was a fully developed ficative in this time then β, φ, δ, θ, γ, χ must be as well. Since German scholars claim that it took at least 400 years for the first phase of the changes of proto-Germanic p, t, k into f, th, h to have been completed it is natural to assume that if any changes in the sound of these Greek consonants took place it must have taken an equal amount of time or longer since we are not only talking about p, t, k but b, d, g as well. This places the beginning of any change in 730 BC or earlier and it is obvious that by 530 BC at the time of Piseistratus reforms more than half the Greek population would have been using modern pronouncation, and this and more is shown by Caragounis. Since this is the case it is clear that the reconstructed pronunciation has ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE from inscriptions on which to found its claims on, since all the inscriptions which are significant to this issue MUST be interpreted as referring to modern Greek pronunciation which was by 530 or earlier the majority pronunciation, or as inconclusive. Latin the only other guide clearly shows that the dasea were fricatives. On top of this since we know know that 100% of the Greek population and the Hebrews must have pronounced delta as a fricative since 330 BC it is clear that the account of Dionysius Thorax referring to the pronouncation of Zeta referrs to an s superposed with fricative modern Greek delta which is Z and nothing else. Since this is the ONLY evidence on which the claim of the reconstructed pronunciation of zeta as zd or dz comes from the reconstructed pronunciation of zeta is clearly a lie. It is an academic fraud created for ethno-political ends in the face of overwhelming evidence which shows that proto-Semitic and Hebrew zayin was always z and that this must also have been so when the Greeks adopted the same script the Hebrews used and was clearly the case in Hellenistic times. In fact since there is no evidence whatsoever to show that β, φ, δ, θ, γ, χ were anything but fricatives, and that ζ was anything but z during the whole period of recorded Greek why should the teaching of the reconstructed pronunciation be perused any further. It is a fraud and everybody that has any sense outside of the bigoted linguistics community knows it. --Thrax 17:01, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">How to go on</span></h2>
<p>I'm glad my recent stab at the history-of-reconstruction section has met with some approval. It definitely needs some consolidation and streamlining later. Now, before we go on dealing with the rest of the article, I suggest we consider again the position of this article within the whole complex of the Greek-related articles. At the moment, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Language_8795.html" title="Greek Language">Greek Language</a>, which contains a sketch of the phonology of Modern Greek, and cross-references to this article and to:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Greek_abe9.html" title="History of Greek">History of Greek</a>. This, in turn, points towards the period-specific pages:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greek_c878.html" title="Ancient Greek">Ancient Greek</a>,</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/t/t/Attic_Greek_d27d.html" title="Attic Greek">Attic Greek</a>,</li>
<li><a href="../../../k/o/i/Koine_Greek_17ca.html" title="Koine Greek">Koine Greek</a>,</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/e/d/Medieval_Greek_8ef4.html" title="Medieval Greek">Medieval Greek</a>,</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_Greek_1ff0.html" title="Modern Greek">Modern Greek</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the latter, both <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greek_c878.html" title="Ancient Greek">Ancient Greek</a> and <a href="../../../k/o/i/Koine_Greek_17ca.html" title="Koine Greek">Koine Greek</a> contain very decent phonological sketches of the respective systems. The one on <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greek_c878.html" title="Ancient Greek">Ancient Greek</a> refers to Allen as its main source, and contains a well-placed note in the text saying (roughly) that this is a reconstruction which has been debated but is now consensus among linguists. The one on <a href="../../../k/o/i/Koine_Greek_17ca.html" title="Koine Greek">Koine Greek</a> contains a subsection summing up the sound changes linking the classical to the post-classical system. Neither of the two articles currently contains a link to ours, as far as I see. Both phonological sketches are well written and linguistically sound. The only addition that one might want to make is to be more explicit about which letters correspond to which of the sounds (that might not be obvious to the non-expert reader.)</p>
<p>Now, what exactly do we want to achieve with our article here? I tend to think the whole first half is going to be pretty much superfluous once the various articles are properly linked up among each other. What I think we could do here is twofold: (a) for the reader who has seen the note about reconstruction consensus at <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greek_c878.html" title="Ancient Greek">Ancient Greek</a> and is skeptical about that, or wants to know more, we can provide a list of the <i>types</i> of arguments and evidence (not every single argument itself) that have been used in the reconstruction debate, on both sides. We could synthesise much of that from the "arguments" lists already present and from the present history section (helping to streamline that down a bit too). (b) we can provide the history of how the reconstruction consensus emerged, as it's now attempted.</p>

<p>I would suggest that we could do worse than change the title of the present article back to "Ancient Greek pronunciation" given that it mainly covers the <i>pronunciation</i>, ie the sounds that correspond to the various letters (which is clearly an important matter, particularly for ancient languages) rather than the <i>phonology</i> (the repertoire of sounds in the language) which is indeed covered in the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greek_c878.html" title="Ancient Greek">Ancient Greek</a> article. --<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoss_Burgess_d0d4.html" title="User:Ross Burgess">rossb</a> 18:56, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Systematicity of sound-symbol relationships</span></h2>
<p>The systematicity of sound-symbol relationships seems like a logical assumption to make but I do not believe that it actually occurred to the largest degree possible in the case of Greek. Indeed, the older the alphabet, the greater the systematicity and the better the chances to find a one to one correspondence between letter and sound, one would think. But, the attic alphabet is older than the ionic alphabet by which it was replaced. Yet in the Attic alphabet, the letter E represented the sounds later represented by E, H and spurious EI (epsilon, eta and EI resulting from contraction or compensatory lengthening). These were three distinct sounds at all relevant times and not even allophones of each other in attic Greek, differing in both length and height. Their only similarity is the fact that they are all front vowels. Similarly, in the attic alphabet, O stood for Omicron, Omega and spurious OY. So the relation was one to many. Finally, the fact that there are letters like ksi and psi (and zeta?) representing two consonants in succession shows that the relation was also many to one. Therefore, I do not see any huge systematicity here.<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannos_b558.html" title="User:Yannos">Yannos</a> 06:36, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're right, as it stands it's oversimplifying. Needs some re-formulation to avoid misunderstandings. The point to make is that almost everybody since Erasmus seems to have agreed that things like the multiplicity of [i]-letters on the one hand, and the multiplicity of phonetically <i>widely dissimilar</i> functions of &lt;υ&gt; on the other, would have been dysfunctional and could not easily have emerged in spelling on the basis of the Modern Greek phonological system alone. I think it's clear that the rule "1 sound&#160;: 1 symbol" is the idealised principle behind the creation of the alphabet, but we need a better formulation for what kinds of deviations from that principle are historically plausible and which aren't. The point is about the "systematicity", not about being exceptionless. --<a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> 07:57, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Could it be that Attic was defective because Phoenician was not the ideal alphabet for Greek, with the vowel letters developing from consonants that would have been dropped in Greek pronunciation (much as Arabic <i>h</i>, hamza, and 'ayn are in RP), but that it was made more systematic through a guiding principal of a one-to-one correspondance? Any evidence that something like this occurred? <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 11:01, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, definitely, they started out with a minimal vowel-symbol inventory. The later introduction of &lt;Ω&gt; and vocalic &lt;Η&gt; can certainly be seen as a move in that direction. It's a bit more tricky for the innovation of the bi-phonemic signs &lt;Ξ&gt; and &lt;Ψ&gt;, because they wouldn't have been needed on purely phonological grounds. I think one hypothesis is that they were introduced for phonotactic reasons. /ks/ and /ps/ were the only consonant clusters that could occur at the ends of words (as in the name of our friend, Θραξ), so perhaps that's why Greeks felt they were somehow a unit. But that's just my speculation. As for the "double" value of &lt;Z&gt;, that really seems to be one of the unsolved problems. --<a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> 11:14, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When the Athenians switched from the Attic to the Ionian script several new letters such as eta, omega were added. Eta and Omega were not originally vowels but were compensatory marks associated with the letters epsilon and omicron. Finally when aspiration became redundant in Ionia they became associated with long vowels. Thus, in Attic inscriptions from the early 5th century B.C. on (long) Ε occurs as ΕΙ and later as Η, while (long) Ο occurs as OU and later as Ω. The Greek letter ksi derives directly from the Phoenician symbol for Samesh, the letter psi is the same shape as the Proto-Sinaitic symbol for tsade (whereas san derives from the shape of the Phoenician symbol for tsade and this s sound is what tsade is transcribed into Greek as from Biblical Hebrew), and the letter zeta was always a single sound since its symbol derives from the Phoenician and Proto-Sinaitic symbol for Zayin and this is the only Hebrew symbol that is transcribed as z in Greek (and never as sd, zd, ds or dz or anything similar). --Thrax 17:02, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, but Thrax has got it wrong yet again.

<dd>Absolute nonsense. The stuff about E and O is what the inscriptional record proves actually happened (see Caragounis), and there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever to show that zeta was anything but a pure fricative z. It was represented by a single symbol for Z (and only z) in Linear-B and not two symbols or an allophone. It was z in proto-Semitic which is the symbol zayin in all Semitic scripts which transliterates into zeta in Greek. Stop dissembling ancient Greek texts and grammarians accounts to perpetuate an academic fraud. The entire notion of zeta being anything but z is based on the deliberate fraudulent misinterpretation of Dionysios Thrax who says that the sound of zeta could be approximated by sigma superposed with delta which from what has says about the mediae and comparisons with Hebrew, Aramaic and proto-Semitic was pronounced "the" like in modern Greek when he wrote his acocunt and zeta was therefore pronounced z. The z sound in Hebrew comes from two sources, the first z sound derives from pure proto-Semitic z which underwent no change at all in all Semitic languages and the second derives from proto-semtic delta which is the same fricative sound as modern Greek delta and became corrupted into z in Hebrew, Akkadian and Ethiopic and has remained as fricative delta in Arabic (as the letter "da" ie. δα).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">On zeta</span></h2>
<p>The case of zeta is very complicated (in my humble opinion at least). i don't believe that the linguists have it figured out yet. This is one case where everyone has his own pet theory: Some say dz, some say zd and some say plain z and there is a lot of unwarranted dogmatism. Personally, I think that zeta might have represented any of these sounds, with one pronunciation in one word and another in another: (to be continued)--204.244.64.254 01:32, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>For example in a word like παίζω it stands to reason that ζ could have a voiced africate pronunciation like dz, since the etymology of the word is from a probable proto-greek *paid-jo. Same thing for a word like πεζός from the putative indoeuropean word for foot (*ped). But in a case like Αθήναζε the zd pronunciation is more likely. Finally, the plain [z] sound probably did exist in attic as an allophone of [s] in words like κόσμος, Λέσβος. Now, the fact that the non-standard spelling κόζμος can be found suggests that ζ can stand for plain z (in this word at least). Something else comes to mind: On the basis of Greek Ζευς πάτερ, Latin Jupiter and Sanskrit Dyaus Pitar what kind of sound is more likely for that ζ? Something funny is happening there. I don't think there are any easy answers for this sound.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannos_b558.html" title="User:Yannos">Yannos</a> 05:47, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>And Caragounis makes it perfectly clear that all of these examples constitute evidence for a fricative Delta since Greek language first began therefore zeta has always been z. This is proven by the fact that one of the Hebrew z's evolved from the fricative delta sound in proto-Semitic. When the Phoenician script which was pronounced the same way as Hebrew was adopted by the Greeks it already had a modern Greek delta sound and a z sound as did Linear B so why would the ancient Greeks have pronounced these letters any differently from the Hebrews. If z was zd or dz then there would have been no symbol for z in Linear B and zayin would not have been used in the Greek alphabet. All of the evidence for inscriptions and form Hebrew shows that the dasea, mediae and zeta were always fricatives with one sound. --Thrax 15:46, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What about Arabic? Arabic was also written in a script descended from the Phoenicians, just like Greek and the Hebrew alphabets. In Arabic, waw (or uau in Greek) is pronounced similar to English while in Hebrew it has become vav. Biblical hebrew pronunciation differs from the modern pronunciation, moreover, there are many different dialects of Hebrew with different pronunciations, just like in most languages. Aleph or alif wasn't used as a vowel originally except to mark long "a" sometimes. The Greek alphabet split off the Phoenicians for much longer than Hebrew or Arabic, it must have undergone some changes through that time.</dd>

<p>The fact that biblical Hebrew was pronounced just like modern Greek with mainly fricative consonants and that these fricatives also existed in proto-Semitic according to Hebrew scholars proves that ancient Greek pronunciation and the ancient Greek alphabet did not change, since at the time that the proto-Sinaitic alphabet was adopted by the Greeks it already had fricatives in its Phoenician and Hebrew forms where all the Greek fricatives are today. The consonants in question have to be allophones in Hebrew and Aramaic and all languages that use this script since in 2000 BC when the proto-Sinaitic script was devised the fricatives were present in all Semitic languages so had to be represent by allophones. This means that inscriptional evidence cannot be called on to offer any form of valid support for the reconstructed pronunciation since the Phoenician alphabet was already pronounced like modern Greek by the Phoenicians themselves and the Hebrews when the Greeks adopted. It is clearly obvious that the main reason why the Greeks adopted this script is because it was already being used to represent fricative gamma, delta, beta, hi, theta and fi in Semitic languages as well. --Thrax 05:30, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>is the only reference on the web. As this is a hexameter, as far as I can make out, the <i>a</i> would seem to be short, while accented. Or do the first <i><span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">δῖ Ἐ-</span></i> get contracted to one metrical syllable? Then the <i>a</i> should be long. Maybe that's the reason for confusion?

<p>(I've added the polytonic template to the Greek above, for the benefit of those using Internet Explorer.) Yes I think it's a short α here. I wouldn't expect the <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">δῖ Ἐ-</span> to get contracted here, given that the iota is long, but others might know better. It certainly looks to me like the nominative, being the subject of the verb <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">ἔτεκεν</span> ("gave birth to").</p>

<p>A couple of points for those who might still be confused:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Greek form <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">Ἐλάρη</span> is literally <i>Elarē</i>. As would be expected in an epic poem, this is the Ionic (or Epic) form, corresponding to the Attic <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">Ἐλάρα</span> (<i>Elara</i>).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(pedant-mode: on) Wouldn't Attic have had -η too, like Ionic, after ρ?
<dl>
<dd>I seem to think that after ρ Attic normally has α, with some exceptions such as <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">κόρη</span>, which is generally explained on the grounds that it was originally <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">κόρϜα</span>. --<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoss_Burgess_d0d4.html" title="User:Ross Burgess">rossb</a> 16:32, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>(pedant-mode: off) She obviously got her name because "έλα, ρεεε!" were her first words on encountering Zeus. Both Thrax (<i>maior</i> and <i>minor</i>) will confirm that the final sound is an [e], and that it's long, especially in the pronunciation of Greek popular music (both ancient and modern) of the genre known as <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">κυνῳδία</span>, of which our Thrax <i>minor</i> is an expert.&#160;;-þ <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> 14:39, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<ul>
<li>The traditional pronunciation in English of the names of Greek deities etc does not follow either the Modern Greek pronunciation or the reconstructed Ancient Greek pronunciation, but ignores the written accent, and uses the Latin method of accentuation, in other words put stress on the penultimate syllable if this syllable is heavy (roughly speaking if it contains a long vowel or is followed by two consonants) otherwise on the antepenult. Thus if the α in the second syllable in <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">Ἐλάρη</span> is short, as would appear from the above, the stress in English is on the first syllable, otherwise it would have been on the second syllable. --<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoss_Burgess_d0d4.html" title="User:Ross Burgess">rossb</a></li>

<dd>Why should I read nonsense&#160;? You said the stress was on the first syllable and that this was the penultimate syllable, therefore you were implying that Elara only had two syllables. If the English stress in on the penultimate syllable then is should be on the "la" not on the E, since the last syllable is ra. Now stop this nonsense. --Thrax 18:53, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thrax, <i>please</i> read what has been written before responding. No-one has said that the word has only two syllables. The question was about the pronunciation of Elara as an English word, and very clearly the stress hass to be on the first syllable, following the accepted principles for pronuncing classical names in English, even though the accented syllable is clearly the second syllable in both Ancient and Modern Greek. You may not like this, and it may be illogical, but it's the way the English language works. --<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoss_Burgess_d0d4.html" title="User:Ross Burgess">rossb</a> 12:51, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks, everyone. Looks like I brought this question to the right page!</p>
<p>So the expectation is that the stress should be on the <i>e</i> in English. Is anyone aware of a Latin citation, which might verify the length of that <i>a</i>? I know this is a lot of bother, but I've verified scores of Greek astronomical names, and this is the last problematic one - at least among the moons. (There may be others among the asteroids.)</p>
<p>BTW, if any of you are interested in making sure that people get their Greek right in astronomy, the articles <a href="../../../j/u/p/Jupiter%27s_natural_satellites.html" title="Jupiter's natural satellites">Jupiter's natural satellites</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturn%27s_natural_satellites.html" title="Saturn's natural satellites">Saturn's natural satellites</a>, and <a href="../../../n/e/p/Neptune%27s_natural_satellites.html" title="Neptune's natural satellites">Neptune's natural satellites</a> link to the individual moon articles, where the Greek names are given. Most of these have been confirmed; a few are missing the tonos; and a couple like <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megaclite_%28moon%29.html" title="Megaclite (moon)">Megaclite</a> are only attested through Latin. I think that Elara was the last one where the unattested Greek vowel length would affect the English pronunciation. Then there's <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pronunciation_of_asteroid_names.html" title="Pronunciation of asteroid names">Pronunciation of asteroid names</a>, which puts the first 1000 asteroids and the original Greek on one page, where they're easy to review, and links to similar pages for the Trojans, Centaurs, and trans-Neptunians. I'm sure that someone who actually knows what they're doing would do a better job than I, if you have the interest.</p>

<dd>Get their Greek right. You must be joking. More like get their Greek wrong. In Greek the stress is on e and a. Where on earth did you get this "ee'-lur-a" nonsense from&#160;? Epsilon in Greek is NEVER pronounced long ee and Alpha is NEVER pronounced u. Elara is pronounced E-la-ra, e as in egg and a as in cat. Where did you get the idea that the second syllable is lur&#160;? Greek syllables never end in consonants unless the next syllable starts with a consonant. --Thrax 21:42, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Diphthongs</span></h2>
<p>I was going to put in some reference to the distinction between the true diphtongs &lt;ει,ου&gt; [ei,oυ] and the - what's the term? - pseudo-diphthongs &lt;ει,ου&gt; [e:,o:] (those that arose from lengthening of [e,o]). But I currently have no reference work with me here except Babiniotis (whom I don't trust too much) and am otherwise working from memory. Three questions to anybody who happens to have Allen, Horrocks or some other reference handy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it commonly accepted that these two classes of sounds were still distinguished up into the classical period?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Most likely classic &lt;ει&gt; was [e:] no matter its origin, although I like to believe that you would be able to hear a j glide when a genuine (but not a spurious) diphthong stood before a vowel in the same phonological unit (see below where I explain the terms and give further examples). Notice that I am not a published scholar but my guess is an educated one. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannos_b558.html" title="User:Yannos">Yannos</a> 00:29, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Is it commonly accepted that the diphthongs merged with the corresponding pure long vowels <i>before</i> they were raised to [i:] and [u:] respectively, or did they raise first and merge then?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Merged first, then raised. This is the commonly accepted view (Allen and others) <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannos_b558.html" title="User:Yannos">Yannos</a> 00:29, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Attic orthography before the introduction of &lt;η,ω&gt; around 400 BCE commonly used &lt;ε&gt; both for later standard &lt;ει&gt; and &lt;η&gt;, and &lt;ο&gt; for later standard &lt;ου&gt; and &lt;ω&gt;. Was this done only for the pseudo-diphthongs [e:,o:], as one might perhaps expect, or did they also spell the true diphthongs as simple &lt;ε&gt;,&lt;ο&gt; in this way?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>spurious diphthongs only (see rossb's comment) and the definition of the term in my comment below <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannos_b558.html" title="User:Yannos">Yannos</a> 00:29, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your comments. But two points: If the two sounds had already merged, as you write above, how could spelling have distinguished them, as you write here? Power of historical spelling conventions, at such an early date? -- But anyway, I now found some data: Words with genuine diphthongs, like your example <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">βουλή</span>, were also spelled with simple &lt;ο&gt;, as in the formula &lt;ΕΔΟΧΣΕΝ ΤΕΙ ΒΟΛΕΙ ΚΑΙ ΤΟΙ ΔΕΜΟΙ&gt; (<span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">ἔδοξεν τῇ βουλῇ καὶ τῷ δήμῳ</span>) in Attic decrees (examples here: [<a href="http://erga.packhum.org/inscriptions" class="external autonumber" title="http://erga.packhum.org/inscriptions" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>]). So maybe the distinction would be rather between pre-vocalic positions, where a bridge consonant [j] might have been preserved, and pre-consonantal positions where all instances were merged to [e:]? By the way, I seem to remember that Teodorsson states that the raising to [i:] also failed to affect pre-vocalic &lt;ει&gt;, which might support this. To round off the question we need only to determine whether spurious dipthongs in pre-vocalic position might have introduced that [j]-glide too analogically - but could spurious diphthongs actually ever stand in pre-vocalic positions, word-internally? If not, the matter might be settled. --<a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> 10:04, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You ask the most difficult questions Lukas. First on the issue of the power of historical spelling conventions in the ancient world, then on the subject of the environments where spurious and genuine diphthongs can occur and finally on the exact timing of the merging of the two sounds and what kind of evidence must be considered compelling, knowing that while these phenomena were taking place there was an alphabet change, even though the older alphabet remained in use for epigraphy for quite a while afterwards. The literacy extent of the athenian society at all relevant times becomes important in assessing the weight of the evidence. I would like to give adequate answers but I cannot do it here, so I'll take it to my talk page. Notice that I will be writing my own views, reaching my own conclusions that sometimes do and sometimes do not coincide with the widely held views (original research). <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannos_b558.html" title="User:Yannos">Yannos</a> 22:31, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Allen uses the term 'long' diphthongs (his quotation marks - he accepts that there is a difficulty with this term, since all diphthongs were long for accentual purposes). He suggests that <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">ῃ</span> was tending to become ει in certain words from the 4th century BC, but a similar change in inflectional endings was reversed from about 200 BC, by which time a new change was starting whereby the iota was lost, so that <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">ᾳ ῃ ῳ</span> became α η ω. This is reflected in the earlier Latin loanwords <i>tragoedus</i>, <i>comoedus</i>, compared with the later loans, <i>rhapsōdus</i>, <i>melōdus</i>, hence English <i>tragedy</i> and <i>comedy</i> compared to <i>rhapsody</i> and <i>melody</i>. Apparently Dionysius Thrax (<span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">Θρᾷξ</span>!) and Quintilian both say that the iota subscript was not pronounced in their times. It seems that these changes happened before η merged with ει and ι.

<dd>On the pseudo-diphthongs, Allen says that the earlier orthography distinguished between Ε for the long close e and ΕΙ for what was originally a true diphthong, for instance <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">εἰπεῖν</span> was written ΕΙΠΕΝ. The ΕΙ spelling gradually came to be used for both cases, implying that the pronunciation had merged. Similarly with Ο and ΟΥ. --<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoss_Burgess_d0d4.html" title="User:Ross Burgess">rossb</a> 21:49, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The terminology commonly used is genuine versus spurious diphthongue. The genuine were the ones which represented true diphtongues before they monophothongized (as in <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">λείπω</span>). The spurious ones are the result of two phenomena: contraction <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">ποιέετε&gt;ποιεῑτε</span> and compensatory lengthening as in <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">*λυθένς&gt;λυθείς</span>. Same thing for the spurious ou: <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">πλόος&gt;πλοῦς, ἐδήλοε&gt;ἐδήλου and ποιέομεν&gt;ποιοῦμεν</span> (contractions) and <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">*pods&gt;ποῦς, *donts&gt;*dons&gt;δοῦς</span> (compensatory lengthenings). The genuine one is the one you can find in words like <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">βουλή</span>. One needs to know a lot about Greek in order to be sure a genuine one is identified. For example even the ou in -mousa- is spurious from an earlier *monsa. Even though the spurious and corresponding genuine diphtongues merged in the same sounds, they do leave a trace of different origin in attic since η+ει(gen)contracts to eta with iota subscript but η+ει (sp.) contracts to eta without iota subscript!

<dd>What another load of nonsense. Dionysios Thax clearly states that there were only 6 diphthongs in ancient Greek any they were made up of combustions of what he calls prefix vowels (a, e, h, o, w) and suffix vowels (i, u) such that the diphthongs must contain only u, and i as sufixes and only a, e and o as prefixes. U only becomes a prefix in front of i but that is not regarded by Dionysius Thrax as a diphthong nor is ae, io, ia, or anything that does not use i or u as suffixes and a, e or o as prefixes. As usual you are dissembling the facts to suit you own point of view and deliberately ignoring or twisting the accounts of ancient Greek grammarians that contradict you. Dionysios Thrax definition of a diphthong clearly means one thing and one thing alone and that is a combination of two vowels that is pronounced as one sound and that is why only ai, au, ei, eu, oi, ou are called diphthongs in Greek and nothing else. --Thrax 02:26, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">On mesa and dasea</span></h2>
<p>I support the new edit on this one. I think it must be added that the "mesa" fricativized earlier than the "dasea" and that the first occurences of fricativization were in intervocalic positions. Furthermore, I would add that delta preserves a trace of its classical pronunciation in modern Greek renderings of the words: <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">ἄνδρας, δένδρον, ἔνδεκα, χονδρός</span> and maybe others. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannos_b558.html" title="User:Yannos">Yannos</a> 00:43, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wrong, Wrong and Wrong again. The Dasea were clearly always fricatives since Greek became a written language since they were also fricatives in Latin and Dionysios Thrax description of the mediae and the very name mediae is only workable if the Dasea and Mediae are fricatives. The modern pronunciations of Andras, dendron etc. are all corruptions of the original fricative delta since they are easier to say using hard d and are thus proof that the mediae began as fricatives. The fact that the first d in dendron stays fricative proves that delta was always a fricative since if the middle delta was originally a hard d then the front delta would have stayed hard d as well. The evidence that you claim substantiates the reconstructed pronunciation subtantiates the historical Greek pronouncation even better. Anyone with an open mind reading this discussion knows perfectly well that you are dissembling the facts to fit your own point of view and are refusing to consider the alternative interpretations because you are bent on perpetuating an academic fraud. --Thrax 02:11, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

If so, you have a really rare archaeological find in your hands! Really, such statements do not look very good on you, my friend, and you make a bad reputation for the rest of us Greeks participating in this effort.

Homer spoke like a Greek not an Englishman and since the oldest continuous tradition of ancient Greek being spoken is the Orthodox Church which still uses ancient Greek as its standard language for services today he would have spoken and sung his poems the way a Greek priest speaks or pretty close to that since Homer lived only 800 years before Christ.

This would partly take us back to a situation that prevailed quite a time ago, when both sets of tables of vowels and consonants were in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek language</a>, but the ancient tables were removed by those who maintaned (with perhaps some justification) that they are more speculative than the modern ones, and should therefore not be exhibited side by side with the modern ones as if htey had the ame status. Given that the present article is pretty big and has attracted a certain amount of debate, I think it would be a mistake to merge the ancient and modern in one article, and I would therefore vote against the merger. --<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoss_Burgess_d0d4.html" title="User:Ross Burgess">rossb</a> 12:52, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>However the table of vowels could well be imported from the Chronographos article to replace the existing stuff on vowels, which is organised by letters not by sounds. It would then I think be helpful to add a separate table by letter, referring back to the sounds. --<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoss_Burgess_d0d4.html" title="User:Ross Burgess">rossb</a> 12:59, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please avoid merging the Ancient Greek and Modern Greek phonologies. I'm not at all fond of this obsession with identifying just "Greek" with the ancient, long-dead language instead of the modern living language (and the two are bound to be split up again soon). Modern Greek deserves just as much attention and is a lot easier to write about since you don't get these frighteningly complicated and bitter debates about which scholars have made the best guesstimates of ancient pronunciation.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Substantiate the following claims else I will delete them</span></h2>
<p>1. The claim that the dasea in ancient Greek were aspirated labial plosives. Either prove that the dasea in Latin were originally aspirated labial plosives as well or else withdraw the claim, label it as impossible to prove or include the counter argument that the dasea evolved directly into fricatives like they did in Latin.</p>
<p>2. The claim that the mediae in ancient Greek were plosives. Dionysios Thrax makes it clear in his account dating to 100 BC that they could not have been anything but fricatives. Either prove Dionysios Thrax is wrong or else withdraw the claim or include the opposing evidence.</p>
<p>3. The claims relating to major fifths attributed Dionysios of Halicarnaus. Cite the full text of this quote in ancient Greek (a translation is not acceptable) in full context or else remove the claim.</p>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>4. The claim that the alleged changes in ancient Greek took place in Hellenistic times and not before. This claim is unsustainable based on the inscriptional record and given that the Phoenician alphabet renders the mediae and dasea as allophones of both fricatives and plosives and that the Greek translation of the Hebrew bible made in 280 BC indicates that in almost all instances the mediae and dasea of the original Hebrew were already pronounced as fricatives at the time in question according to Hebrew scholars. Substantiate this claim or else remove it or state clearly that inscriptional evidence and comparisons with Semitic languages and scripts and Proto-Semitic phonology indicate that the dasea and mediae could have always been fricatives since the time the proto-Sinaitic script (Phoenician/Hebrew) was adopted by the Greeks .</p>
<p>5. Show that reconstructed pronunciation is still viable when taking into account modern evidence that argues against it such as that cited above or else make it perfectly clear that it is a 19th century theory that is over 200 years old and is therefore out of date and in the same category of dogma as the Earth cantered universe and accept that other theories which work better also exist. --Thrax 18:54, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You have NOT provided any EVIDENCE to substantiate any of these claims period. Repetition of the claims does NOT constitute evidence nor does it constitute proof. Now answer my questions and provide incontrovertible evidence or I will delete the unsubstantiated passages. Hatzidakis has never said that he agrees with the reconstructed pronunciation nor has he provided any evidence or done any research in favour of it. The reconstructed pronunciation is a point of view based on OUT OF DATE 19th Century Germanic linguistics that ignores modern Greek pronunciation, the origins of the Semtic alphabet that the Greeks adopted, the inscriptional record and ancient grammarians accounts that contradict it and is therefore NOT a valid scientific theory. The reconstructed pronunciation is the linguistic equivalent of the flat Earth theory. Modern research shows that it is invalid and unworkable. I have provided the evidence and the quotes that prove that. Now you do the same or I will delete your unsubstantiated claims with more justification than you had when you deleted my substantiated counter arguments.--Thrax 20:38, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

When I upload Hatzidakis' study I'll let you all know. Since you like linguistics, perhaps you should check Hatzidakis at a library (the book is named Academic Studies Ακαδημαϊκαί Μελέται, if I remember correctly) and it has a couple of hundred pages on Ancient Greek pronunciation. When you are saying "19th century German linguistics" you are talking about who?

<dl>
<dd>Apart for the fact that it's virtually illegible what you have attributed to Hatzidakis is NOT a scientific thesis nor a scientific paper. Repetition of the claims reconstructed pronunciation without substantiating evidence and a through evaluation of the counter evidence and arguments of its opponents is NOT proof of the reconstructed pronunciation. The fact is that there is NO evidence whatsoever for the reconstructed pronunciation and that is precisely why you cannot cite any. The reconstructed pronunciation is an academic fraud that was shown to be a fraud by Thanos Papadimitrakopoulos in 1889 and is contradicted by all Semitic scholars who have shown that Hebrew and Aramaic pronounced the dasea and mediae as fricatives in 280 BC using comparison with Greek transcriptions of the time. Since the Hebrew dasea and mediae were fricatives then so are the Greek of the same period and that is what Semitic linguists are saying and this means that they must have already been fricatives in Greek long before the Hellenistic period, ie. in pre-Classical Archaic times for the Hebrews to transcribed Hebrew into Greek as such. The reconstructed pronunciation is therefore scientifically UNTENABLE and UNPROVABLE&#160;! It is a Germanic point of view which is WRONG. --Thrax 21:49, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Preserving the quality of the article</span></h2>
<p>Thanks to Lukas and many other editors, the article is becoming very good. But Thrax is back to pushing his POV. I really don't like reverting without discussing, but at this point, Thrax has repeated the same arguments many times, and doesn't seem to have any new ones. So there doesn't seem to be much point to discussing on Talk or even in the edit comments. I consulted admin Kwamikagami on this, and here is his advice (also on his Talk page):</p>
<dl>
<dd>If [Thrax] starts playing the 3RR game (violating the spirit of the rule by reverting 3x a day), I may block him for that. But if it's merely an annoyance factor of him making contributions no one else agrees with, then it's easy enough for the rest of you as a group to revert him. There's no need to defend the article - you've discussed it ad nauseum, and Thrax has shown himself immune to evidence. In other articles where I've seen this happen (one editor repeatedly but sincerely reverting to an unsubstantiated POV, and either unable or unwilling to understand standards of research), after a while the other editors didn't defend what they're doing, didn't answer his attacks, didn't interact with him at all, they just automatically reverted anything he did. Yes, it's annoying, but it doesn't take more than a minute or two. After a while he gave up. (Okay, it was after a long while. *sigh*)</dd>
<dd>The alternative, as I see it, is to ask for dispute resolution. That requires that you formally prepare your case. It's up to you to decide whether it's worth your time to do that, rather than each of you spending a minute a day restoring the article.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So let's just restore the article to the consensus position when Thrax damages it, and ignore his comments. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 21:42, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The primary subject matter of this article is the pronunciation, not the history of the study of the pronunciation. After all, in the article on <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravity</a>, we don't start with a discussion of the history of theories of gravity -- though it is an interesting and rich history. There are in fact three different subjects here:</p>
<p>1. How Attic Greek was pronounced.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Like modern Greek unless you can prove otherwise which is something you have not done and cannot do since there is no evidence to support anything to the contrary. --Thrax 01:51, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>2. The historical and dialectal changes in the pronunciation (which are mostly covered in other articles);</p>
<dl>
<dd>Greek has always been pronounced the same way. The whole idea of dialect is totally meaningless unless it is accepted that the Greek alphabet was pronounced in exactly the same by Homer, Plato, Cleopatra, Constantine and Saferis. If this were not so how can you say that dialects existed based on spelling. They could have been spelled differently but still pronounced the same if the pronunciation of the alphabet was not the same for everybody. You can't have it both ways. Either the alphabet never changed its sound or different Greek dialects did not exist. --Thrax 01:51, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>3. The history of the study of pronunciation, essentially the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historiography.html" title="Historiography">historiography</a>. In academic research papers in some fields, it is traditional to start with the historiography: Jones said this in 1755; Le Duc revised it in 1805; Papadopoulos reformulated it in 1923; and now I am revisiting the issue. But I don't think this is a good idea in an <i>encyclopedia</i> like Wikipedia. First, we should present the current state of the field, and only afterwards discuss the historiography. There does not seem to be any consistent style, and indeed many articles don't discuss the history of their fields at all -- which is a pity. But I still think the historiography should come at the end, not the beginning. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 21:10, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Back from a two-weeks Wiki break, I'm pleased to see that a lot of nice work has gone into the article while I was away.</p>
<p>I'm now looking for a way to better integrate the material taken over from the old Chronographos article in the introduction. It certainly contains useful ideas, but I'm not quite happy with its wording in some details:</p>

That does imply an awareness that orthographic norms are to some degree arbitrary social conventions, doesn't it?</dd>

<p>ηυ does not belong to any of the two 'sets' of diphthongs mentioned in the article. So the section on diphthongs has to be rewritten. Does it belong to the second set? If so, is there also a diphthong αυ with a long α? My knowledge is not good enough to edit the article on this one. <a href="../../../%CE%B1/%CE%BD/%CE%B4/User%7E%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%AD%CE%B1%CF%82_58b5.html" title="User:Ανδρέας">Andreas</a> 03:16, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks to you both for pointing out my oversight. I'll give it another try later. What it seems to boil down to is a 2-by-2 way classification of diphthongs then, right? long vs. short first element on the one hand, and back vs. front second element on the other. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> 09:47, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The only interpretation I can see for your actions is to falsify history and deceive people into thinking that the reconstructed pronunciation is the actual pronunciation of ancient Greek and not just a theory that was created in the 19th century which does not even stand up to modern scientific scrutiny even according to its own advocates such as Allen and is contradicted by the entire filed of Semitic linguistics which does not support its claims. That is why you removed all of my references to opposing theories and the evidence for them including the Erasmian theory and that is also why you relegated all of the history of the reconstructed pronunciation and methodology to the bottom of the article. To prove your bad faith you even edited out 90% of the original discussion and as I predicted you then removed the link to it so that people can't read the opposing evidence and see the proof that you are turning the article into a POV rant. Even thought the is no consensus you removed the NOPV label from the article to deceive people that you one sided editing was unopposed.</p>

<dd>"The historical pronunciation of ancient Greek" is not a POV fork. Its a seperate theory with its own advocates in academia which you want to suppress. I propose merging the contents of "The historical pronunciation of ancient Greek" with that of "Ancient Greek phonology" as a compromise. A redirect would be totally misleading since "Ancient Greek phonology" as its stands is a one sided POV rant on the reconstructed pronouncation. Otherwise rename "Ancient Greek phonology" to "The reconstructed pronunciation of Ancient Greek" and leave "The historical pronunciation of ancient Greek" where it is as a separate article and create an article on Erasmian pronunciation as well so that all theories are represented. And people ganging up again someone else with an opposing view and who has provided evidenced from academics who support it is not a consenssus but an attempt at academic fraud. --Thrax 23:20, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The opposing theories</span></h2>
<p>The majority of native born Greeks and an increasing number of academics including linguists and classicists contend that throughout its recorded history the pronunciation of the Greek language and the Greek alphabet has remained relatively constant and that ancient Greek since archaic times obeys to a high degree the same rules as the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek language</a> of today. This is not to say that changes did not take place but those that did take place were minor and insignificant in relation to the living historical continuity of the Greek language.</p>

<ul>
<li>Evidence from different spellings of the same words in ancient Greek inscriptions shows that modern pronunciation was already beginning to take hold in the late Archaic period and that by the time of Christ all of the Greek vowels and diphthongs except for eta (η) were pronounced the same way as in modern Greek. Eta only adopted its modern pronunciation in Byzantine times.</li>
<li>The digraphs ΤΗ, ΠΗ, ΚΗ represented the sounds θ, φ, χ in Greek and in Latin were depicted as TH, PH, KH. Later the symbols for θ, φ, χ were added to the Greek alphabet to denote these fricative sounds but not to the Latin alphabet which took a different course. The letter Η in these ancient Greek digraphs acted in the same way as the h does in the English sound /th/. The letter Η was not pronounced separately but denoted that the consonant it followed should be pronounced as a fricative.</li>
<li>The symbol F (digamma) was substituted for PH by the Romans later on.</li>
<li>Latin F is usually transcribed with Φ</li>
<li>The letter Φ is confused with the f sound of diphthongs αυ and ευ but not with Π showing it to be fricative and the υ sound in these diphthongs to be v or f.</li>
<li>The spelling εκ stays the same in front of κ, τ, π, but often becomes εχ in front of θ, φ, χ which indicates that θ, φ, χ must be fricatives.</li>
<li>The κ of εκ before Β, Γ, Δ as well as Λ, Μ and Ν regularly changed to Γ indicating that Gamma could not have been pronounced as G but as /GH/.</li>
<li>The letter β is confused with υ of diphthongs αυ, ευ, ηυ indicating that beta is a /v/ sound and that the υ in these diphthongs was pronounced with the same /v/ sound.</li>
<li>The letter β also replaces F (digamma) thus must have sounded as /v/.</li>
<li>Latin U or V are often transliterated with β in Greek thus beta must be /v/.</li>
<li>The letter δ interchanges with θ for a time and then goes back to δ.</li>
<li>That the letter δ does not become τ shows it was closer to θ but never sounded as d.</li>
<li>The fact that the letter δ interchanges with β in inscriptions precludes d.</li>
<li>The δ also interchanges with γ precluding d again.</li>
<li>The ζ frequently replaces σ before Β, Γ, Δ shows it had a voiced σ sound.</li>
<li>Misspelling using σ for ζ and σ before ζ shows that zeta is /z/.</li>
<li>The letter δ is often substituted by ζ in Elis and Athens and shows that delta must be /dh/ and not d and also shows that zeta must be /z/.</li>
<li>The doubling of ζ impossible to pronounce as zdzd. <a href="http://www.bsw.org/?l=72081&amp;a=Art06.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bsw.org/?l=72081&amp;a=Art06.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></li>

<li>When the Athenians switched from the Attic to the Ionian script several new letters such as eta, omega were added.

Dionysios Thrax states that the sound of the "mediae" which is what he calls the letters β, δ, γ was the sound in-between the "psila" π, τ, κ and the "dasea" φ, θ, χ respectively, thus "β is in-between π and φ", "δ is is in-between τ and θ" and "γ is is in-between of κ and χ".

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Historical background to the reconstruction of Greek pronouncation</span></h2>
<p>Up until the 15th century (during the time of the Byzantine Greek Empire) ancient Greek texts were pronounced exactly like modern Greek when they were read aloud both by Greeks and non-Greeks using received pronunciation, until the Dutch classicist Desiderious <a href="../../../e/r/a/Erasmus.html" title="Erasmus">Erasmus</a> Roterdamus (1494-1553) questioned weather ancient Greek might have been pronounced differently as a result of a trick that was played on him by the Swiss scholar Henricus Glareanus who lied to Erasmus that he heard certain Greek scholars pronouncing Greek in a different manner to everyone else. This brought Erasmus attention to the fact that the Greeks gave several letters to the sound i, whereas for example Latin transliterated eta with the letter e and not i. Thus in 1528 Erasmus wrote a dialogue between a bear and a lion in which he concocted a new system of pronouncing ancient Greek, but on finding out that he had been tricked he quickly disowned the pronunciation he had concocted and continued to use the received pronunciation instead. <a href="http://www.bsw.org/?l=72081&amp;a=Art06.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bsw.org/?l=72081&amp;a=Art06.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></p>
<p>The system Erasmus concocted gave the Greek consonants β, γ, δ, θ and χ the un-Greek sounds of /b/, /g/, /d/, dz (or zd), /t/ and /k/, and the vowels η, υ, ω the sounds of /e/ (as in Germ), u or y, and o (as in for) and pronounced the diphthongs as separate letters. <a href="http://www.bsw.org/?l=72081&amp;a=Art06.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bsw.org/?l=72081&amp;a=Art06.html" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></p>
<p>Advocates of the Greek system of pronunciation agree that there was a simplification in the <a href="../../../v/o/w/Vowel.html" title="Vowel">vowel</a> system but they do not agree that the consonants have ever been pronounced differently in ancient Greek. <a href="http://www.bsw.org/?l=72081&amp;a=Art06.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bsw.org/?l=72081&amp;a=Art06.html" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> Koine had seven vowels, two of which η and ω were long, two ε and ο were short and three α, ι, υ were either long or short. Alongside the individual vowels there were <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diphthong.html" title="Diphthong">diphthongs</a> αι, αυ, ει, ευ, οι and ου, <a href="http://www.fh-augsburg.de/~harsch/graeca/Chronologia/S_ante02/DionysiosThrax/dio_tech.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fh-augsburg.de/~harsch/graeca/Chronologia/S_ante02/DionysiosThrax/dio_tech.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> and several rarer ones. Most noticeably, the vowels i, ē, y, and diphthongs ei, oi (ι, η, υ, ει, οι) have all become i in modern Greek.</p>
<p>Several hundred years after Erasmus the English resurrected the system that he had abandoned, and sought to put it on a scientific footing using Germanic linguistic theory and comparisons with reconstructed Latin pronunciation and other indo-European languages, but took no notice of modern Greek pronunciation and the evidence found in inscriptions when they created their theroy. Therefore the reconstructed pronunciation was challenged by linguists in the 19th century after Greece became independent and the arguments of both sides resulted in stalemate with neither side being able to prove their view conclusively. By sheer force of numbers the reconstructed pronunciation has become the system most commonly used for ancient Greek pronunciation among linguists the English speaking world but not among classicists who prefer to pronounce ancient Greek in the same way their pronounce their own native language. <a href="http://www.bsw.org/?l=72081&amp;a=Art06.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bsw.org/?l=72081&amp;a=Art06.html" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> --Thrax 02:52, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
