<p>According to <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/writefp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/writefp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> this article contains copyright infringements. 82.135.91.95 08:06, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're right. The majority of this Anchorage article seems to be copyrighted material plagiarized from other websites, such as the Anchorage Chamber of Commerce site? Quite disturbing... The following text is from that website... --<a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlask_fa21.html" title="User:Flask">Flask</a> 09:21, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>The final serious example was Anchorage, Alaska, which appeared to have been written by JeffreyAllen1975. Here the contributions seemed quite genuine; JeffreyAllen1975 made tons of edits each contributing a paragraph at a time. The work seemed to take quite a toll on him; at his user page he noted "I just got burned-out and tired of the online encyclopedia. My time is being taken away from me by being with Wikipedia." He lasted about four months.</i></p>
<p><i>Still, something seemed fishy about JeffreyAllen1975, so I decided to investigate further. Currently, the Anchorage page has a tag noting that "The current version of the article or section reads like an advertisement." A bit of Googling revealed why: JeffreyAllen1975's contributions had been copied-and-pasted from other websites, like the Anchorage Chamber of Commerce ("Anchorage's public school system is ranked among the best in the nation. ... The district's average SAT and ACT College entrance exam scores are consistently above the national average and Advanced Placement courses are offered at each of the district's larger high schools.").</i></p>
<p><i>I suspect JeffreyAllen1975 didn't know what he was doing; his writing style suggests he's just a kid: "In my free time, I am very proud of my-self by how much I've learned by making good edits on Wikipedia articles." I'm pretty sure he just thought he was helping the project: "Wikipedia is like the real encyclopedia books (A thru Z) that you see in the library, but better." But his plagiarism will still have to be removed.</i></p>
<p><i>When I started, just looking at the numbers these seemed to be several cases that strongly contradicted my theory. And had I just stuck to looking at the numbers, I would have believed that to be the case as well. But, once again, investigation shows the picture to be far more interesting: translation, reorganization, and plagiarism.</i></p>

(See here: <a href="http://www.adn.com/news/alaska/anchorage/story/7659802p-7571417c.html" class="external free" title="http://www.adn.com/news/alaska/anchorage/story/7659802p-7571417c.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.adn.com/news/alaska/anchorage/story/7659802p-7571417c.html</a>) It's sort of been swapped around over the years. "City of Lights" is something the city promotes in the winter to get folks to light their houses and yards up, it's not official. I've never heard it as "lights and flowers," and that's one among many names.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilja_8fb4.html" title="User:Silja">Silja</a> 05:11, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know this is a nitpick, but the tone of the following sentence seemed wrong for Wikipedia: "Anchoragites exemplify many of the qualities to be found among Alaskans generally...".

<p>Is Anchorage's supposed independent city status any different from the status of municipalities in the various other census areas of Alaska that are not in boroughs? That is to say, some parts of Alaska are divided into boroughs, while others are not. Anchorage appears to be in the part that is not. There are other municipalities that are in a similar situation. The US Census Bureau divides up those parts of Alaska which are not in boroughs into census areas. Because Anchorage is so large, it gets its own, while the other cities just become part of whatever census area is drawn up around them. But in terms of their relationship to the government of Alaska, is, say, <a href="../../../n/o/m/Nome%2C_Alaska_4eff.html" title="Nome, Alaska">Nome</a> actually any different from Anchorage? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 05:41, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sort of. The state of Alaska is formally divided into sections called <b>boroughs</b>, with unboroughfied areas considered to be <b>census area</b>. These areas may elect state senators and representatives but have no areal government; or there may be separate senate and representative electoral districts which are not coterminous with the census area. There are <i>also</i> incorporated cities within boroughs which have internal governments, and in any borough one must serve as the borough seat. (Alaska also has incorporated villages, which are smaller than cities and have less government and services.) An example of the census area is the <a href="../../../w/r/a/Wrangell-Petersburg_Census_Area%2C_Alaska_d692.html" title="Wrangell-Petersburg Census Area, Alaska">Wrangell-Petersburg Census Area, Alaska</a> which covers two incorporated cities. These cities are of nearly equal size and neither wishes to lose its equal status to the other for one of them to become a borough seat of government, so they stay separate but grouped in a census area. (Note that Wrangell and <a href="../../../k/e/t/Ketchikan%2C_Alaska_d28c.html" title="Ketchikan, Alaska">Ketchikan, Alaska</a> together form a senate district, not including Petersburg. Yes, this <i>is</i> insanely confusing, a hallmark of Alaskan politics which is our primary indoor sport. Wrangell and Petersburg have a strong rivalry, btw.) If you see <a href="../../../j/u/n/Juneau%2C_Alaska_49c2.html" title="Juneau, Alaska">Juneau, Alaska</a> or <a href="../../../s/i/t/Sitka%2C_Alaska_8e20.html" title="Sitka, Alaska">Sitka, Alaska</a> you will find that they are a single borough with a municipality whose boundaries happen to be coterminous with the borough's.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anchorage is apart from all of this, a special case. Its municipality is on an equal status with the other boroughs, and no borough exists to encompass the municipality. This was done because previously Anchorage had both a borough and several cities (Spenard, Indian, Portage), with the City of Anchorage holding only the area of downtown Anchorage and the former extending to the rest of the Anchorage area. These two levels of government competed with each other, and since the city had basically grown to swallow most of the separate city-areas a decision was made to bring the two groups together. The entire thing was called a municipality so that it would reflect the fact that it is a city government, not a rural borough government with a particular city seat. This made Anchorage the only municipality in the state without a surrounding borough, as well as the second largest (in area) city and the largest municipality in the US. Other boroughs in the state compete with the governments of incorporated cities, but not to the extent that the conflict has encouraged people to do away with the borough as Anchorage has done. In the case of places like Juneau and Sitka the borough and city governments have AFAIK simply been declared to be identical, which solves a lot of problems. The difference between them and Anchorage is that Anchorage changed its name to a <i>municipality</i>, the others simply keep the name <i>borough and city</i>. Further details of government differences are fairly low level and immaterial from an encyclopedic perspective. Does that make sense?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I should note that Spenard still occasionally claims independent status as a city, although this is legally and politically not true, and is mostly done as a joke or for political posturing. The <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Postal_Service_9c23.html" title="US Postal Service">US Postal Service</a> will however accept mail sent to <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spenard%2C_Alaska_51e6.html" title="Spenard, Alaska">Spenard, Alaska</a>, even without zip code. The Spenard Community Council also sometimes refers to Spenard as The City of Spenard unofficially. It's one of a few parts of Anchorage that maintain a separate sense of identity, others are Girdwood, Indian, Bird Creek, Eagle River, Muldoon, and so forth. All of those used to be separate communities in the borough. They also elect their own state senators and representatives. — <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Crippen_b05d.html" title="User:James Crippen">Ts'éiyoosh</a> 00:22, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Suggested modifications to the Anchorage history Secion.</p>
<p>Russia was well-established in North America by the 1800s. True but irrelevant to Anchorage, which essentially has no trace of Russian influence, having been founded in 1915. Should be deleted.</p>
<pre>
In 1867, U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward brokered a deal to purchase Alaska from debt-ridden Russia for $7.2 million, about two cents an acre. 
</pre>
<p>True to a point, but belongs in an Alaskan History article as it long predates the founding of Anchorage. In fact, the Russians sold Alaska because it was indefensible if the a war broke out with the UK, which was feared on a number of occasions following the Crimean War. Should be deleted.</p>
<p><br />
Alaska's value was not appreciated by the American press at that time, calling it "Seward's folly", "Seward's icebox", and "Walrussia". This statement is false. Most of the American papers and public supported the purchase. There were some noted exceptions that used those appelations, but the value of the purchase was instantly obvious to anyone who looked as the income from the lease of the Pribilof Islands fur seal operation alone paid the entire purchase price of Alaska back to the Federal government within a decade of 1867! Unfortunately I'm at work and don't have any cites handy, but I did my senior project as a history major under Dr. Stephen Haycox at University of Alaska Anchorage on the fur seal operation and purchase and the numbers are obvious. It is irrelevant in any case, and Should be deleted.</p>
<p>Otherwise seems fine.</p>

<p>I added a small discussion of Anchorage wildlife, citing the recent urban brown bear study and BBC film crew's interest in the matter. I don't have reliable figures on how many moose or bear are in Anchorage, as everyone has a different number. So I left off any attempt to make a calculation. It also depends on what you include in your definition of Anchorage, since the Muni includes a great deal of true wilderness</p>

<p>Ignoring the blatant lack of citations in nearly every paragraph, this article is marred by poetic adjectives and biased descriptions which are unencyclopedic and devoid of sources. This is a mere sample of numerous sentences which read like a tourist brochure --</p>
<pre>
"baskets of bright gold triploid marigold <i><b>drenched</b></i> with <i><b>trailing</b></i> sapphire lobelia."
</pre>
<pre>
"The city of Anchorage <i><b>blooms</b></i> with <i><b>vibrant color</b></i> during the late spring and summer."
</pre>
<pre>
"particularly attractive to nature lovers <i><b>to say nothing of the attractions</b> available just a short distance</i> outside the city"
</pre>
<pre>
"Anchorageites <i><b>exemplify</b></i> <i>many of the qualities [...] found among Alaskans</i> [...]: <b>independence</b>, <i><b>friendliness</b></i>, <i><b>practical-mindedness</b></i>"
</pre>
<pre>
"gives Anchorage a relatively casual, relaxed atmosphere compared to some other American cities"
</pre>
<pre>
"Anchorage has an <i><b>abundance</b></i> of nightlife"
</pre>
<p>Again, those are just a few examples.</p>
<p>Now, I am not contending that any of this information is untrue; however, the lack of citations and the flowery, laudatory wording needs to be amended.</p>

<p>I was looking at a topo map of the area, &amp; it appears that Anchorage is running of room to grow, since it is surronded by the Chugach State Park. Also, why is there no settlement across the Knik Arm from Anchorage, or no bridge across the Knik Arm? I also noticed that the ave income for women is much higher than men ($63k to $41K). Is that the biggest gap in men to women's income of any US city? <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngry_Aspie_0c29.html" title="User:Angry Aspie">Angry Aspie</a> 00:11, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There’s no expansion of the city across the Knik Arm from Anchorage because it’s too hard to get there by road from Anchorage. It takes up to an hour just to drive to Wasilla, and from there the Knik–Goose Bay Road isn’t exactly a great thoroughfare. Although a water crossing would be viable during the summer months, it isn’t feasible during the winter when the strong tides push sea ice vigorously through the narrow channel. A bridge across the Knik Arm to Point Mackenzie is supposedly “on the way”, and was the subject of much congressional debate when funding for it was part of a US transportation bill this last session. This was one of the two so-called “Bridge to Nowhere” projects, the other being a bridge (actually two bridges) from Revillagigedo Island (the town) to Gravina Island (the airport) in the city of <a href="../../../k/e/t/Ketchikan%2C_Alaska_d28c.html" title="Ketchikan, Alaska">Ketchikan, Alaska</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are some political problems with expansion of Anchorage across the Arm. For one, the Municipality of Anchorage has no sales tax, whereas the Matanuska-Susitna Borough on the other side has one as its main source of income. Conversely, the Borough has no property tax, whereas the Municipality has a property tax which is <i>its</i> main source of income. Easy travel from one location to the other would encourage people to own property in the Borough and spend money in the Municipality, depriving both governments of tax income. Another issue is that most of the land immediately accessible on the other side of the Arm from Anchorage is already owned, primarily by prominent local politicians. Any bridge construction would drive prices quite high, lining the pockets of the politicians at the expense of the locals. — <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Crippen_b05d.html" title="User:James Crippen">Jéioosh</a> 09:52, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>I re-added the venues section as a sub section for the purpose of a link to the new pages for the Egan Center and the new Dena'ina Center. There has been a bit of a revision war on this page but I would like to point out that these city pages are best suited for the reader who is not familiar with the area. Thousands of these people will visit Anchorage as part of a convention or national meeting and information on these facilites should be provided. A large asset of wikipedia is the ability to link between wiki pages, while some info may be provided on another page, it is not redundant to use a small piece of that page as a link between. I wrote this to valide the venues sub section which someone saw fit to delete without explanation, I hope the reason for this section is clear and that it will not be deleted again.

<p>36 Crazyfists is listed under "Notable Residents" as Alaska's only signed musical act. What about Jewel?

Maybe it could be changed to <i>Anchorage's</i> only signed musical act.--Caline 00:09, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>- Neither 36 Crazyfists nor Jewel hail from Alaska anymore. Both acts relocated to other states before signing to labels.</p>
