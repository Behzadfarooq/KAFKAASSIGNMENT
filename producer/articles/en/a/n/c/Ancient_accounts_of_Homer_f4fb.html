<p>The <b>ancient accounts of Homer</b> include many passages in archaic and classical Greek poets and prose authors that mention or allude to Homer, and ten biographies of Homer, often referred to as <i>Lives</i>.</p>
<p>Establishing an accurate date for Homer's life presents significant difficulties. It is unlikely that any actual record of the man's life ever existed, and that all accounts are based on tradition. <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herodotus.html" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> (2.53) maintains that <a href="../../../h/e/s/Hesiod.html" title="Hesiod">Hesiod</a> and Homer lived not more than 400 years before his own time, consequently not much before <a href="../../../8/5/0/850_BC_ef9f.html" title="850 BC">850 BC</a>.From the controversial tone in which he expresses himself it is evident that others had made Homer more ancient; and accordingly the dates given by later authorities, though very various, generally fall within the 10th and 11th centuries BC, but none of these statements has any claim to the character of external evidence.</p>
<p>The extant lives of Homer (most of which are edited in Westermann's <i>Vitarum Scriptores Graeci minores</i>) are ten in number, including a piece called the <i>Contest of Hesiod and Homer</i>. The longest <i><a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_of_Homer_%28Pseudo-Herodotus%29_51a7.html" title="Life of Homer (Pseudo-Herodotus)">Life of Homer</a></i> is written in the <a href="../../../i/o/n/Ionic_dialect.html" title="Ionic dialect">Ionic</a> dialect, and claims to be the work of Herodotus, but is certainly spurious. In all probability it belongs to the time which was fruitful beyond all others in literary forgeries, viz, the <a href="../../../2/n/d/2nd_century.html" title="2nd century">2nd century</a> of our era. The other lives are certainly not more ancient. Their chief value consists in the curious short poems or fragments of verse which they have preserved, the so-called <i>Epigrams</i>, which used to be printed at the end of editions of Homer. These are easily recognized as Popular Rhymes, a form of folklore to be met with in most countries, treasured by the people as a kind of proverbs. In the Homeric epigrams the interest turns sometimes on the characteristics of particular localities <a href="../../../s/m/y/Smyrna.html" title="Smyrna">Smyrna</a> and <a href="../../../c/y/m/Cyme.html" title="Cyme">Cyme</a> (Epigr. 4), <a href="../../../e/r/y/Erythrae.html" title="Erythrae">Erythrae</a> (Epigr. 6, 7), <a href="../../../m/t/_/Mt_Ida_0ced.html" title="Mt Ida">Mt Ida</a> (Epigr. 10), Neon Teichos (Epigr. 1); others relate to certain trades or occupations: potters (Epigr. 14), sailors, fishermen, goat herds, etc. Some may be fragments of longer poems, but evidently they are not the work of any one poet. The fact that they were all ascribed to Homer merely means that they belong to a period in the history of the Ionian and Aeolian colonies when Homer was a name which drew to itself all ancient and popular verse.</p>
<p>Again, comparing the epigrams with the legends and anecdotes told in the Lives of Homer, we can hardly doubt that they were the chief source from which these Lives were derived. Thus in Epigr. 4 we find a blind poet, a native of Aeolian <a href="../../../s/m/y/Smyrna.html" title="Smyrna">Smyrna</a>, through which flows the water of the sacred <a href="../../../m/e/l/Meles.html" title="Meles">Meles</a>. Here is doubtless the source of the chief incident of the Herodotean Life, the birth of Homer Son of the Meles. The epithet <i>Aeolian</i> implies high antiquity, inasmuch as according to Herodotus Smyrna became Ionian about <a href="../../../6/8/8/688_BC_d194.html" title="688 BC">688 BC</a>. Naturally the Ionians had their own version of the story, a version which made Homer come out with the first Athenian colonists.</p>
<p>The same line of argument may be extended to the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeric_Hymns_6659.html" title="Homeric Hymns">Hymns</a>, and even to the works of the so-called <a href="../../../c/y/c/Cyclic_poets.html" title="Cyclic poets">Cyclic poets</a>, the lost early epics some of which formed the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epic_Cycle_d85e.html" title="Epic Cycle">Epic Cycle</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theban_Cycle_0949.html" title="Theban Cycle">Theban Cycle</a>. Thus:</p>
<ol>
<li>The hymn to the Delian <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo.html" title="Apollo">Apollo</a> ends with an address of the poet to his audience. When any stranger comes and asks who is the sweetest singer, they are to answer with one voice, "the blind man that dwells in rocky <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chios.html" title="Chios">Chios</a>; his songs deserve the prize for all time to come." <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thucydides.html" title="Thucydides">Thucydides</a>, who quotes this passage to show the ancient character of the Delian festival, seems to have no doubt of the Homeric authorship of the hymn. Hence we may most naturally account for the belief that Homer was a Chian.</li>
<li>The <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Margites.html" title="Margites">Margites</a></i>, a humorous poem which kept its ground as the reputed work of Homer down to the time of <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristotle.html" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, began with the words, "There came to Colophon an old man, a divine singer, servant of the Muses and Apollo." Hence doubtless the claim of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colophon.html" title="Colophon">Colophon</a> to be the native city of Homer, a claim supported in the early times of Homeric learning by the Colophonian poet and grammarian <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antimachus.html" title="Antimachus">Antimachus</a>.</li>
<li>The poem called the <i><a href="../../../c/y/p/Cypria.html" title="Cypria">Cypria</a></i> was said to have been given by Homer to his son-in-law <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stasinus_of_Cyprus_34c4.html" title="Stasinus of Cyprus">Stasinus of Cyprus</a> as dowry. The connection with <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus.html" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> appears further in the predominance given in the poem to <a href="../../../a/p/h/Aphrodite.html" title="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a>.</li>
<li>The <i><a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Iliad_187f.html" title="Little Iliad">Little Iliad</a></i> and the <i>Phocais</i>, according to the <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_of_Homer_%28Pseudo-Herodotus%29_51a7.html" title="Life of Homer (Pseudo-Herodotus)">pseudo-Herodotean life</a>, were composed by Homer when he lived at <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phocaea.html" title="Phocaea">Phocaea</a> with a certain <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thestorides_of_Phocaea_4033.html" title="Thestorides of Phocaea">Thestorides</a>, who carried them off to Chios and there gained fame by reciting them as his own. The name Thestorides occurs in Epigr.5.</li>
<li>A similar story was told about the poem called the <i>Capture of Oechalia</i>, the subject of which was one of the exploits of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heracles.html" title="Heracles">Heracles</a>. It passed under the name of <a href="../../../k/r/e/Kreophylos_of_Samos_6fe7.html" title="Kreophylos of Samos">Creophylus of Samos</a>, a friend or (as some said) a son-in-law of Homer, and was sometimes said to have been given to Creophylus by Homer in return for hospitality.</li>
<li>Finally, the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Thebaid_%28poem%29.html" title="Thebaid (poem)">Thebaid</a></i> was confidently counted as the work of Homer. As to the <i><a href="../../../e/p/i/Epigoni_%28epic%29.html" title="Epigoni (epic)">Epigoni</a></i>, which carried on the Theban story, there was less certainty.</li>
</ol>
<p>These indications render it probable that the stories connecting Homer with different cities and islands grew up after his poems had become known and famous, especially in the new and flourishing colonies of Aeolis and Ionia. The contention for Homer, in short, began at a time when his real history was lost, and he had become a sort of mythical figure, an eponymous hero, or personification of a great school of poetry.</p>
<p>An interesting confirmation of this view from the negative side is furnished by the city which ranked as chief among the Asiatic colonies of Greece, viz. <a href="../../../m/i/l/Miletus.html" title="Miletus">Miletus</a>. No legend claims for Miletus even a visit from Homer, or a share in the authorship of any Homeric poem. Yet <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arctinus_of_Miletus_8f50.html" title="Arctinus of Miletus">Arctinus of Miletus</a> was said to have been a disciple of Homer, and was certainly one of the earliest and most considerable of the Cyclic poets. His <i>Aethiopis</i> was composed as a sequel to the Iliad; and the structure and general character of his poems show that he took the Iliad as his model. Yet in his case we find no trace of the disputed authorship which is so common with other Cyclic poems. How has this come about? Why have the works of Arctinus escaped the attraction which drew to the name of Homer such epics as the Cypria, the Little Iliad, the Thebaid, the Epigoni, the Taking of Oechalia and the Phocais. The most obvious account of the matter is that Arctinus was never so far forgotten that his poems became the subject of dispute. We seem through him to obtain a glimpse of an early post-Homeric age in Ionia, when the immediate disciples and successors of Homer were distinct figures in a trustworthy tradition when they had not yet merged their individuality in the legendary Homer of the Epic Cycle.</p>
