<p>How should this article treat the Byzantine empire. Arguably, it was the same country or state as the ancient Rome. Also, we shouldn't forget other countries/states that claimed to be the "new Rome", i.e. Holy Roman Empire, Russia, possibly others. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 13:44, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My suggestion would be to treat them in a paragraph titled "Successor states" or something along those lines.

<p>I think all the descriptions of buildings in the "Great Roman Buildings" and "Forum Romanum" section have no place in this article. This article is already far too wide-ranging and bloated, and there are already separate articles on Roman architecture and the Roman Forum, where these items are all covered far better. I recommend deleting those sections entirely. At most, perhaps have a bare list of the items, with links to the full articles on each. Any objections? <a href="../../../m/l/o/User%7EMlouns_fbae.html" title="User:Mlouns">Mlouns</a> 20:13, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed the chapter about Weddings. If we were to discuss all similar matters, such as funerals, religious rituals, triumphal processions etc, in such detail, the article would grow beyong all proportion.

However, as the information originally in the "Weddings" paragraph was relevant and usefull, I created the page <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Roman_marriage_0c17.html" title="Ancient Roman marriage">Ancient Roman marriage</a> and move the material there. --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChino_6b6b.html" title="User:Chino">Chino</a> 09:34, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Could I suggest that a small footer be included titled 'The Legacy of Rome', or something like that.

<p>I think we should have a section discussing how Roman culture and history is being used today. There have been a lot of tv shows, HBO's 'ROME', for example; as well as video games (Rome: Total War) that are heavilyt based off of Roman history. Does anybody think that a "Roman History In Popular Culture" section would be a good idea? Perhaps only a few sentences, but it seems worth mentioning. --<a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronchef8000_f3a4.html" title="User:Ironchef8000">Ironchef8000</a> 03:24, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Rise</span></h2>
<p>The section on monarchy contains a bad misconception, which I propose to correct. If no one has anything to add or does it first I will do it within a few days.</p>
<p>The misconception concerns the founding of Rome. The facts have been twisted to support the story given in Vergil's Aeneid, which, because the poem is so good, seems to collect unthinking afficionados of its literal truth. It is in fact probably NOT literally true.</p>
<p>Specifically, an early settlement by the Latins and Sabines followed by an Etruscan takeover is certainly not supported by any archaeology. This is the traditional story. There isn't much archaeology on the initial communities mainly because most of Rome is inaccessible to archaeologists. There's a little space in the forum, but they aren't going to remove any buildings there looking for prehistoric sites. The author of our article is just trying to give the credence of archaeology to the traditional story. If it doesn't fit, get rid of it. Any doubt, throw it out.</p>
<p>Whatever small documentary evidence we have and the general similarity of Roman architecture and customs to Etruscan indicate the Etruscans were in on the founding, perhaps even the only founders. In other words, the article begs the question. The whole point of the investigation concering the origin of Rome is to try and find evidence settling such questions. They aren't settled yet. We shouldn't mislead the public. Let's present the question, not the prejudice that led to it.</p>
<p>But I must say, the issue is even more general. The earliest "Etruscologists" invented a whole migration of the Etruscan civilization from Anatolia to support the Aeneas myth. Archaeology battered down that tower long ago. The Etruscans were there before the Italics. Certainly, there were there long before the founding of Rome. Their presence in the Aegean is related to their having been a maritime empire, as they were equally present widespread over the Med. The Italics moved in on this coastal civilization from over the mountains.</p>
<p>Was there an Aeneas? Did he come from Troy? Who knows. The archaeology supports a flourishing Etruscan maritime civilization before the founding of Rome, with settlements as far south as the Naples region and all the way north to the Alps. Let's not get too carried away by third year high school Latin courses.

<dd>while gibbons is the canon here the brevity with which he is dealt give somewhat false impression of the state of affairs here. the decline of rural lands was as much a force of taxation rules on cultivated land as all the other stated issues here, c.f. N.J.G.Pounds, which caused degredation of the status of colonii to that of near slave. would also be nice to see a section on roman influence in the fuedal manse.</dd>

<p>I changed the bit about the majority of English words having Latin roots, since there are plenty of words that have Germanic/Saxon/Celtic/Proto-Indo-European roots. But I freely acknowledge the importance of Latin or successor language roots (lots of French, for one).</p>
<p>I'm also not entirely comfortable with the assertion that the reason that Latin is no longer widely spoken is because it relies more on inflection than syntax - that would mean that German is also no longer widely spoken... 100 Million German speakers would probably disagree... but I'll leave the rewrite to someone else for now... <a href="../../../y/g/g/User%7EYggdrasilsroot_c159.html" title="User:Yggdrasilsroot">YggdrasilsRoot</a> 20:42, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have a concern which I'll also take up with the poster who made the following alteration <i>"thus most modern English words directly derived from Roman Latin are religious, legal, or scientific terms <b>consciously borrowed from their use by Roman authors</b>."</i> In my understanding, modern English words derived directly from Latin are not from <i>Roman</i> Latin per se but from ecclesiastical Latin, or from medieval Latin (both of which were distinct from Latin as spoken during Roman times), or in some instances made up out of Latin roots by mid- to high-Renaissance English authors. I'd like to request comments on this, especially from Rick Norwood. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthewDBA_a659.html" title="User:MatthewDBA">MatthewDBA</a> 01:43, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Scope of the treatment of Roman history</span></h2>
<p>I'm planning to make significant changes to the chapter about Roman republic. About half of the text in the current revision deals with the personal history of just two men, Julius Caesar and Augustus. While the two men where extremely important in the history of Rome, there are definitely too much details about them concidering the long history of the Republic. Also the chapter is quite long when it should essentially be a summary of the main article, <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Republic_9497.html" title="Roman Republic">Roman Republic</a>. Therefore I'm goingt to significantly shorten the part about late republic, while adding modest quantities of material to the part about the earlier period. --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChino_6b6b.html" title="User:Chino">Chino</a> 07:39, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Should there be a "Roman" portal?</span></h2>
<p>Hi folks, I'm contemplating the possibility of creating a portal for Ancient Rome, to replace <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman.html" title="Roman">Roman</a>, which is a disambiguation page and has nearly 400 links pointing to it from articles (not counting the ones from Talk or Wikipedia pages).</p>
<p>If I was to go ahead with this, I would need help from other people on the content, as I don't know too much about the subject matter - my motivation for doing this is because it seems to be needed, and I believe I can figure out the technical aspects of making it happen.</p>
<p>Some possible issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>It needs a suitable name. I'm thinking "Ancient Rome", but there may be other options. My intention would be to redirect <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romans.html" title="Romans">Romans</a> to the portal so that every vague reference and accidental linkage to "the Romans" would end up in a suitable place.</li>
<li>I think it would be appropriate to include Byzantium, and maybe Ancient Greece if it doesn't already have a "home".</li>
<li>Other uses of the word <i>Roman</i> currently listed on <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman.html" title="Roman">Roman</a> would probably be moved to <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Roman (disambiguation)">Roman (disambiguation)</a>, which is currently a redirect.</li>
<li>I would not like to become the sole maintainer. I would be willing to continue doing technical stuff, but selection of featured articles and suchlike should be done by somebody who can tell whether or not the content is accurate.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Roman Law and US Senate</span></h2>
<p>what is the basis for the 2nd half of the following statement regarding the relationship of Roman Law and the US Senate?</p>
<p>"The Roman law formed the basis of most of the legal systems of Europe and her colonies for hundreds of years and has been the direct inspiration for the Senate of the United States and other modern nations"</p>
<p>The name Senate came from Roman government, not Roman Law. See the main article on Roman Law. Nothing there providing support for a relationship between Roman Law and the US Senate.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Legacy</span></h2>
<p>I have to say that I'm not in total agreement over the lack of cultural legacy that Rome gave us. To say that these have had little to no effect on the future generations is a fallacy, Roman literature had a strong effect on Victorian England which cannot be understated. It also looks really stupid saying that the cultural legacy was small when there is an entire subsection on it later.</p>

<p>Roman history had a strong influence, but as the article notes, the only new artistic form that Rome developed was the satire or slapstick play (unless you count extreme sports). Victorians read Virgil because they knew Latin but not Greek, but Virgil imitated and actually copied from Greek epics. "Roman" architecture is just Greek with small modifictions, similarly with Roman sculpture. Roman painting is a combination of Greek and Etruscan. In short, Rome was a tremendous influence -- but only by passing on forms developed in other cultures. Rome was not an innovator in art or literature. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Norwood_6566.html" title="User:Rick Norwood">Rick Norwood</a> 13:42, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Images</span></h2>
<p>Hi wikipedians! Thanks to the Improvement Drive (and due to that Ancient Rome is one of my great interests), I will try to contribute to this article. One thing I immediately noticed was that I think there are too few images - in my opinion every major section should have a suitable image. This makes it far more appealing to the average reader. I will try to go about it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Maps</span></h2>
<p>Does anyone else think it's a huge mistake to have <b>four maps</b> on this page? This article is called "Ancient Rome", not "Geography of Ancient Rome"; there's vastly more to know about Rome than where its boundaries happened to be at certain moments in time. Having more than one or two maps seems excessive when there are so many other aspects of Roman history, art, society, etc. that are going unillustrated, and when there are already dozens of maps on this page's subarticles. Wouldn't an image of Romulus and Remus or something under the "Monarchy" history section be more useful and appealing to readers than a generic map? -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 05:55, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Organization</span></h2>
<p>I feel this article needs a major reorganization. There are currently 41 entries in the Table of Contents (more like 50 before I removed the "Legacy" section, which should be merged into the appropriate sections on culture, language, etc., leaving only possibly a short subsection of "History" for the general historical followings after the end of the Roman Empire); we should be able to easily cut this number in half with judicious trimming and summarizing, moving information to subarticles, and merging sections together where subsectioning is unnecessary. As I see it, the sections should eventually look a little more like this: -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a></p>

<p>I agree there are too many sections.

<dd>Not a bad idea (and I'd considered it simply because currently both sections have subdivisions according to the Kingdom/Republic/Empire trichotomy, though the history subdivisions are vastly longer and more useful than the government ones), though finding a way to incorporate descriptions of the government systems with descriptions of the historical periods could be tricky, and might bloat the sections unnecessarily. On the other hand, it could be just what that section needs to give a fuller understanding of the changes in Roman society; I don't know. So, should we rename "History" to "History and government"? Or leave it as "History", or what? Hmmm. Well, couldn't hurt to try. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 09:19, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the problem is that Ancient Rome is too big a subject. This introductory article should be just that -- an introduction -- with the details in subsidiary articles such as Roman literature, the Roman Empire, Roman religion, and so on. But it would be a huge job to move details to the appropriate sub-article (or make sure they were already there) and it would take a judicious hand to evaluate what is introductory and what is detail. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Norwood_6566.html" title="User:Rick Norwood">Rick Norwood</a> 15:09, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

Plus I think there's a huge amount of information left on this topic that's not yet on Wikipedia, such as information on the <i>lowest</i> of low classes in Rome, who are dramatically underrepresented in the history books.

<dd>Not a good idea if we want this to have a shot at Featured article some months down the line; a comprehensive, lengthy list of footnotes isn't an absolute requirement, but it is certainly a <i>boon</i> on nominations. An article like this should (<i>ideally</i>, not necessarily a short-term goal) have the same sort of citations any other article has: at least one cite every couple of paragraps, and another citation wherever a disputable or unusual statement occurs (e.g., the claims that the Julio-Claudians after Augustus were seen as largely corrupt and depraved needs a cite). What about them doesn't work? Maybe we could try <i>fixing</i> them rather than expunging them from the article; footnotes are remarkably useful in historical topics, not only for references, but also for providing external links and relevant sidenotes. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 10:54, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you click on the note number in the text, it doesn't take you to the reference, and the order the references are organised in at the end makes it impossible to tell which reference refers to which. It's probably because there isn't a one-to-one relationship - several notes refer to Livy, for example. They need to be reorganised so that each reference has one footnote, and the footnotes are in the same order as the references in the text. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicknack009_6084.html" title="User:Nicknack009">Nicknack009</a> 11:01, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pruning of "References" section, Feb 06</span></h2>
<p>This is a general article on ancient Rome for an English encyclopedia: so I&#160;removed anything that was on some detailed facet of ancient Rome, or in a foreign language. Some of these smelled of sales boosting — translations of German biographies of Caesar, a Finnish book on consuls, etc. The Trojan Origin was one of literally many tens of thousands of similar small papers. Etc.</p>
<p>I&#160;removed the ancient references altogether, since there are many hundreds of books that might plausibly be put here. Absolutely major sources, for example, would include Appian, Dio, Dionysius, Polybius, the Historia Augusta, the works of Cicero.

<dd>You did well to check. No such thing.... Doubtless some modern historian said that the phrase was appropriate, which it is, to Rome's expansion.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Transition to Byzantine Empire</span></h2>
<p>"The eastern empire, governed from Constantinople, is referred to as the Byzantine empire after 476 AD." Admittedly the phrase Byzantine Empire is one of modern day historiographical convenience, but it is worth noting that significant contemprary opinion regarding this label initiates its use after the reign of Heraclius and the rise of Islam, instead preferring 'Eastern Roman Empire' for the sixth century. Clearly there is a division between this view held by the likes of Mark Whittow and contrasting views like those of Ostrogorsky, but perhaps this should be relected.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This technicality seems more suited to the article <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_empire.html" title="Byzantine empire">Byzantine empire</a> than to this article. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Norwood_6566.html" title="User:Rick Norwood">Rick Norwood</a> 16:07, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Its also worth noting that its a completely artificial term; the "Byzantines" still referred to themselves as Romans even as the Turks were banging down the gates to Constantinople. <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPookster11_83f2.html" title="User:Pookster11">pookster11</a> 05:24, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't see any reason to say that the Roman Empire stopped existing in 476 unless you consider the Roman Empire to have ceased to exist in the East in 395, so I don't think the passage quoted up top is appropriate. Since most people think otherwise, I'm changing it to "...Constantinople, is usually referred to..." Is this appropriate? It just seems somewhat POV to me, especially on a topic often discussed by historians and not really "resolved" at all. <a href="../../../n/y/t/User%7ENyttend_9f62.html" title="User:Nyttend">Nyttend</a> 20:14, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Contrary opinion (see my user page): it is better in the long run not to revert any vandalism. The immense waste of time involved in reverting constant vandalism is far better used working on new material or significant edits. Reverting vandalism endlessly solves nothing: what needs to be done is pressure the powers that be to force traceable registration in order to edit; at which point most of the vandalism will dry up pretty permanently. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 20:56, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Annoying it may be, Bill, but we still need to revert -- otherwise we may as well not have any articles.

<dd>That's my whole point. If enough of us refuse to revert, the articles will liquefy, and the boss of this outfit (Mr.&#160;Wales, whose word is law) will change the rules and make traceable registration required. 95%&#160;of all vandalism is from unregistered editors. But by reverting vandalism, we are perpetuating the system that allows it: in sum, the system currently relies on peons to keep the articles clean, rather than on intelligence, and if you are reverting vandalism, you are being used. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 10:48, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Roman welfare system</span></h2>
<p>I undid the well-intentioned addition, because it is so one-dimensional (and in part, wrong) as to be very tendentious and, overall ,meaningless. Children had a special welfare system, for example, instituted by Trajan and expanded on by later emperors; the quantities varied a great deal in various periods; there were cash subsidies; there were special subsidies to parents of more than 3&#160;children (apart from the Trajanic dole to children); etc., etc. It seems to have been more or less enough for the recipients and their dependents, but it's very hard to tie that down as was done in this edit. Such an addition needs to be written by an expert. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 20:56, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yours truly --Marduk</p>
<dl>
<dd>Even "fixed", it's very poor and confused; plus isn't there an article on Roman religion, where this would belong rather than burden a quick synopsis of ancient Rome with these (somewhat prurient) details? From a Wikipedia policy standpoint, that last sentence certainly has a whiff of "original research" to it. The error on <i>Feriae Latinae</i> (I&#160;fixed that), persisted in despite editing, suggests that the rest ain't so great either. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 23:12, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bill I commend you, your view is that because it doesent belong there as the article is a quick synopsis is in fact very good citing. Could I direct your attention here then <a href="../../../c/a/r/Talk%7ECarthage_c7c3.html" title="Talk:Carthage">Talk:Carthage</a> there is a vote taking place perhaps you would like to contribute of course I would like to think your view will be the same here and there but then again, who knows... -signed Marduk the hero XD</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd removed this garbage and put it on the narrower article <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_in_ancient_Rome_f50e.html" title="Religion in ancient Rome">Religion in ancient Rome</a> for others to judge; I'm not fighting the reversion — I&#160;guess I&#160;don't really care if Wikipedia looks amateurish, thank God it's not my site — but at least the corrections of spelling (<i>Feriae Latinae</i>, not <i>*Latinatae</i>; <i>Pons Sublicius</i>, not <i>*Suplicius</i>), slight copyedits, and commented-out alerts should be allowed to stand. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 17:27, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Changed my mind. I&#160;<i>am</i> fighting the reversion. Aside from the merits of the addition (which is looking worse every minute, see the Talk page of <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_in_ancient_Rome_f50e.html" title="Religion in ancient Rome">Religion in ancient Rome</a>), why have this relatively detailed treatment appear twice, identically, in two different articles? The importance of human sacrifice to the ancient Roman civilization, in the general scheme of things, was much less than that of many other facets of the civilization which get no such treatment in this article here; for example, <i>slavery</i>, which gets the barest passing mention. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 22:48, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>Again wether you have your own theories or Pesudo=Historical inquiry in the matter that best to leave it to yourself, Human Sacrifice an important aspect of early Roman Religion needs mention therefor, Again an important subject in Roman history which needs to be mentioned, just like its teck,eng, and base out military Human Sacrifice and its religious practise needs to mention</p>
<p>If you would like to input a different prespective into the matter then do so but do not make deletions without a clear Reason cited why and that reason cant just be any old reason of I dont like it so iam going to boot it...-Signed Marduk</p>
<dl>
<dd>The reasons are clear; you obviously are not reading them, so I'll list them here, one by one, so you can't avoid seeing them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1. No objection to reporting on Roman human sacrifice. It did exist, if in historical times rare, and in prehistoric times (by definition) is hard to prove.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. I objected so little to the general principle, that I moved the section to <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_in_ancient_Rome_f50e.html" title="Religion in ancient Rome">Religion in ancient Rome</a> despite disagreeing with the detail.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3. Identical text should not be in two different related articles; pick one and stick with it. The narrower article seems better to me.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>4. Why does human sacrifice deserve detailed exposition here, but fundamental topics such as slavery — far, far more important to Roman society thru the end of Antiquity — not? This is a summary article: balance is what is required. (And "The Romans did have...": Why "did have"? "had" is standard writing.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>5. Now for the matters of fact:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>5a. <i>Suplicius</i> is a typo. It should be <i>Sublicius</i>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>5b. <i>Latinatae</i> is a typo. It should be <i>Latinae</i>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>5c. Some Vestal Virgins were put to death, yes. It was by no means human sacrifice, but judicial execution for a religious crime. They were, for example, handed over not to a priest (priests performed sacrifices), but to the common executioner. Though these executions may look to some of us today like human sacrifice, this is an example of ahistorical bias: the ancients themselves did not consider them sacrifices. "To placate the Goddess" is false.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>5d. After Cannae, 2 Greek and 2 Gauls were sacrificed, but not 2 Vestals.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>5e. "(binding and drowning human victims being another ancient Indo-European practice)" — Why "another"? no IE practice has yet been mentioned.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>5f. "apparently in memory of an earlier practice where young boys were sacrificed in this way — "apparently", etc.: unsubstantiated speculation.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>5g. "In this way the Romans also had a tradition of Child Sacrifice." Completely unattested.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>5h. "When the sixth king of Rome, Servius Tullius, expanded the walls of the city, four human victims were buried alive" — Four bodies have been found (I think, didn't check); but there is no indication they were buried alive, nor even that they were "victims" of anything.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>5i. "Bad omens led the College of Priests to consult the Sybilline Books why the Manes might be displeased." — Four separate mistakes in this single sentence: (1) There was no such thing as "<i>the</i> College of Priests". There were many colleges of priests. "College of Pontiffs" is meant. (2) bad omens occurred very frequently, most did not lead to the consulting of the Sibylline Books. (3) <i>Sibylline</i>, not <i>Sybilline</i>. (4)&#160;the SB were consulted not to see why the Manes might be displeased, but which god(s) might be displeased. It was usually not the Manes.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>5j."And it didn't take much for a Vestal to be accused of betraying her vows." Completely false; on the contrary, very few cases of such an accusation are attested, and it was a striking, unusual occurrence.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>5k."Livy tells the story of a Vestal called Postumia who was put on trial" True <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/livy/liv.4.shtml#44" class="external text" title="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/livy/liv.4.shtml#44" rel="nofollow">(iv.44, toward the end of the section)</a>. "because she dressed well and talked rather more freely and wittily than a young girl should." False: Livy specifically says she was put on trial for unchastity, although it was suggested by her dressing, etc. "She got off with a warning from the Pontifex Maximus": True. On balance the statement of this story is true, but it is simplistically and thus tendentiously written.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>5l. "but if a Vestal being slightly too fashionably dressed and witty led to her being tried, it's pretty clear that 'finding' a Vestal to sacrifice if the omens were bad or a major battle was lost wouldn't have been too hard." Speculation.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Conclusion: A pared down, tightened up version of this, with the typos and errors of fact and English corrected or removed, is fine. In which article is a judgment call. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 15:29, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Those are all good points, as much as Id like to debate and discuss historical inquiry's I only have about 10 more minutes, so iam going to say this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>I dont care wether this information is being challenged or not, the fact that there are two view points to this makes it important to have those two view points. Now I have just written a well informal section of Sacrifice, if you would like to add to it the second view of historians then do so, if you would like to cite in there that there inaccuracy's BE MY GUEST. However if your here to censor information and cover up little doo dits you dont like then we call that Vandalisim and clearly a historical agenda and thats why iam reverting--Marduk</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Good, then we are in agreement.
