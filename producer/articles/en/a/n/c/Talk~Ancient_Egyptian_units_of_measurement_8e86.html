<dd>The Virgate - "An old English unit of area" is actually Roman in origin</dd>
<dd>equal to one quarter of a hide = 1.25 yerdis = 17.5 acres</dd>
<dd>The amount of land needed to support a person.</dd>
<dd>The hide is at its root a German word for household, but</dd>
<dd>the hide is a Roman derived unit</dd>
<dd>We are told that in the Saxon counties of southern England,</dd>
<dd>it referred to the land sufficient to support one family,</dd>
<dd>which equaled what the family plowed in a year.</dd>
<dd>We are told that depending on the fertility of the land, the hide varied</dd>
<dd>from as little as 60 to as many as 240 acres, half a knights fee</dd>
<dd>but it was typically between 80 and 120 acres, 1/4 knights fee</dd>
<dd>Its actually 60 modern English, and 70 old Roman acres</dd>
<dd>We are told that the bovate is 1/8 of a carucate,</dd>
<dd>which also appears in the Domesday Book originated as a Danish measure</dd>
<dd>and it is found in the northeastern English counties</dd>
<dd>constituting the Danelaw.</dd>
<dd>Lets allow a carucata or carucate, like</dd>
<dd>1 hide, is approximately 120 acres and</dd>
<dd>like the bovate was found in the Danish counties.</dd>
<dd>Lets allow A Plowland or plowgate is equal to a carucate or</dd>
<dd>an area eight oxen can plow</dd>
<dd>sufficient for a free family to support itself;</dd>
<dd>its origins precede 1100. (see definitions of Sumerian areas)</dd>
<dd>We are told the plowland compares with the knight’s fee</dd>
<dd>which we have established originates with the Milos</dd>
<dd>which was a larger area sufficient to support a knight’s family</dd>
<dd>(perhaps to allow pasture for animal husbandry).</dd>
<dd>Sulung is a Kentish term for two hides.</dd>
<dd>Its 120 modern English, 140 Roman acres</dd>
<dd>A yoke in Kent is 1/4 of a sulung.</dd>
<dd>A virgate is a rod in linear measure and 1/4 of a hide</dd>
<dd>(or 30 acres) used as a measure of area in Saxon counties.</dd>
<dd>30 acres is 1/4 sulong</dd>
<dd>We have the Arpent AS a unit of length =~ 191.8 feet and</dd>
<dd>the (square) arpent used as a unit of area, area</dd>
<dd>(180 old French 'pied', or foot) used in France, Louisiana, and Canada.</dd>
<dd>approximately .845 acres, or 36,802 SF</dd>
<dd>Clearly derived from 1000 square orguia = 36,850 SF</dd>
<dd>which is itself derived from 1 sos = 10,000 square orguia.</dd>
<dd>We have the Morgen a unit of area =~ .6309 acres. or 27, 482 SF</dd>
<dd>used in Germany, Holland and South Africa, as 3/4 the Arpent</dd>
<dd>derived from the German word Morgen ("morning").</dd>
<dd>It represented the amount of land that could be plowed in a morning.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Ancient stadia measures were always divisions of the degree</dd>
<dd>Systemized standards of measure derived from this common standard</dd>
<dd>Mesopotamia used 600 sos of 180 m = 108 km</dd>
<dd>Egypt used 10 itrw = 700 "3ht or fields" (of 3 kht of 100 royal cubits) = 110.25 km</dd>
<dd>Persia used 20 parasangs of 30(furlongs = 185 m) = 111 km</dd>
<dd>Phoenicia used 500 stadions (of 750 feet = 185 m) = 111 km</dd>
<dd>Ptolomy and Marinus of Tyre measured in the Persian/Phoenician stadia</dd>
<dd>Eratosthenes measured in the 700 3ht of Egypt.</dd>
<dd>The Greeks used 600 stadions (of 600 pous of 308.4 mm) = 111 km</dd>
<dd>The Romans used 600 stadiums of 625 pes (of 296 mm = 111 km</dd>
<dd>All of those are accurate divisions of a degree as defined by Ptolomy</dd>
<dd>Ancient Europe used the same standards because it did business with the same people</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The credit for the first systemized collection and standardization</dd>
<dd>probably goes to the empire builders of Mesopotamia and Egypt</dd>
<dd>but the international commerce of the people who benefited</dd>
<dd>by those great empires, the Greeks and Persians and the Romans</dd>
<dd>who followed them is what really required the system</dd>
<dd>be standardized over such vast areas.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The important thing to recognize is that you can identify the original source</dd>
<dd>as Mesopotamian or Egyptian depending on whether the system is sexigesimal</dd>
<dd>or septenary and whether the divisions are by palms or feet or both.</dd>

<dd>The Egyptian system in its turn formed the basis of the later Greek and Roman systems</dd>
<dd>while they in turn influenced European Systems.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Egyptians took a sexigesimal Mesopotamian system and converted it to a septenary Egyptian system by taking an ordinary cubit of five gat measuring 30 sheshi 25 uban(500 mm) and a great cubit of 6 gat measuring 30 uban (600 mm)and making the first 6 Šsp (6 palms with 24 db&lt;= 450 mm) and the second 7 Šsp (palms with 28 db&lt; = 525 mm).</dd>

<dd>The Mesopotamians measured their arable land in garden plots or sar and combined them into fields or iku of 100 cubits to a side. The Egyptians measured out the irrigation ditches that bounded their 3ht or fields as strips a cubit wide and 100 cubits long known as kht. Their st3t which was a field 100 cubits to a side is said to have become the Greek Aroura or thousand but when you run the numbers the Aroura seems more likely to have derived from the iku.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Its probable that farmers measured out the land their community allowed them to plow in return for digging the ditch by pacing it off and built up an enclosure for it with the stones they found in their furrows.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The community would give the fields out in pairs, one to be plowed and one to remain fallow which were planted in rotation. As beasts of burden were domesticated and yoked to the plow the amount of land under cultivation increased, and a third field was added to be planted in hay or fodder for the plow animal. The side of this cluster of fields became standardized at 350 cubits or one minute of march.</dd>

<dd>In 1670 Abbe Mouton suggested a primary length standard</dd>

<dd>For this basic length Mouton offered the name milliare.</dd>
<dd>This was to be subdivided by seven sub units with each one</dd>
<dd>to be 1/10 the length of the one preceeding or</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Milliare = 1 minute of arc = 36524 English feet = 1.11 km</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Abbe Mouton may or may not have known that</dd>
<dd>The Milos was based on a stadion equivalent to the Egyptian minute of march.</dd>
<dd>Sir Issac Newton who attempted to restablish the measures of the ancient world</dd>
<dd>from the math problems in Kings 1 may not have known that</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But its certain that Jomard, one of the French savants accompanying Napoleon</dd>
<dd>to Egypt entrusted with the measurement of ancient architecture to attempt</dd>
<dd>to restablish the correct value of ancient measures by measurement</dd>
<dd>knew that because he cites the Greeks who knew that</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"In 1798, Edme-Francois Jomard visited the Great Pyramid</dd>
<dd>as a young savant on Napoleon's expedition.</dd>
<dd>The French had the debris cleared away from</dd>
<dd>the two northern corners of the Pyramid and discovered the corner sockets</dd>
<dd>where the corner casing stones had apparently originally been placed.</dd>
<dd>These were ten by twelve foot mortises, perfectly level,</dd>
<dd>and perfectly level with each other, cut twenty inches into the limestone bedrock.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Although, there were still piles of rubble between them,</dd>
<dd>Jomard was able to measure the north side of the base to be 230.902 meters (757.5 feet).</dd>
<dd>For the height, he measured each step. They added up to a total of 144 meters (481 feet).</dd>
<dd>By means of trigonometry Jomard calculated a slope of 51* 19' 14", and</dd>
<dd>an apothem of 184.722 meters. Because the casing stones were missing,</dd>
<dd>these figures were both estimates, but the length of the apothem</dd>
<dd>looked virtually perfect in light of various ancient classical texts</dd>
<dd>which Jomard was familiar with."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Diodorus Siculus and Strabo both claimed that the apothem of the Great Pyramid</dd>
<dd>was one stadium long. The Olympic stadium was 600 Greek feet, and</dd>
<dd>was supposed to be related to the size of the earth.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Jomard found the stadium of Eratosthenes and Hipparchus to be 185.5 meters,</dd>
<dd>and thus within one meter of his figure for the apothem. He also found that</dd>
<dd>distances quoted by the ancients in stadia matched the distances found by</dd>
<dd>Napoleon's surveyors, if a stadium was taken to be 185 meters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The ancient stadium was also reported to have been 1/600 of a degree.</dd>
<dd>When Jomard took the length of a degree at what he believed to be</dd>
<dd>the mean latitude of Egypt, 110,827.68 meters, and divided it by 600,</dd>
<dd>he arrived at a stadium of 184.712 meters, which was</dd>
<dd>within ten centimeters of his figure for the length of the apothem!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In addition, several Greek authors had reported that the perimeter</dd>
<dd>of the base was equal to half a minute of a degree.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This would mean that a degree of latitude divided by 480 should</dd>
<dd>equal the length of one side of the base.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Again Jomard used the length of a degree at his mean latitude of Egypt,</dd>
<dd>110,827 meters, and dividing by 480 arrived at 230.8 meters,</dd>
<dd>again within 10 centimeters of his measured base.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>In Egypt the minute of march was 350 royal cubits long and</dd>
<dd>an hour of march or itrw was 21,000 royal cubits long.</dd>
<dd>The Greeks tell us they noted their measures of 6 plethrons and 8 stadions,</dd>
<dd>were both the equivalent of the Apothem or slant side of the Great Pyramid.</dd>
<dd>The modern pre Euro nautical mile was ten times the length of that Apothem.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Using unit measures like the Stadion, Stadium and Furlong, which</dd>
<dd>were originally used to lay out fields and only gradually became defined as areas</dd>
<dd>like the Aroura or thousand square royal cubits, the empire builders</dd>
<dd>measured out their roads.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Greek Milos was originally 8 stadions or 600 Greek pous x 8 = 4800 pous</dd>
<dd>The Pous came in long short and median variations so depending on which one</dd>
<dd>you used the number of pous would vary even as the length of the stadion and</dd>
<dd>Milos remained the same.</dd>
<dd>600 Attic pous were equal to 625 Ionian pous but</dd>
<dd>both stadions were 185 meters long</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Romans standard pes was the Ionian pous of 296 mm so</dd>
<dd>they made their stadium of 185 meters egual to 625 pes or 1000 passus and</dd>
<dd>that made their Milliare 5000 pes</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What makes that a great system for empire builders is that</dd>
<dd>the passus is now a measure of the pace at which the army moves.</dd>
<dd>If such standards of measure are well suited to</dd>
<dd>controlling the movements of armies with milestones</dd>
<dd>related to how much distance can be covered in a set period of time</dd>
<dd>they are equally servicable to the needs of commerce.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Just as the farmer can use the stone walls that border his field</dd>
<dd>to help him restablish its boundaries after a flood,</dd>
<dd>the community can establish its bounds in terms of</dd>
<dd>how much land it needs to irrigate to sustain its population and</dd>
<dd>the lugal or narmr (chief farmer)can determine</dd>
<dd>how many men he needs to dig the irrigation system and</dd>
<dd>how much land to alot to each oinkos, gene and phratre</dd>
<dd>in return for their service. Its all very feudal.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The city state is based on a market or agora that</dd>
<dd>serves a number of communities which are</dd>
<dd>spaced about as far apart as a man can walk in a day</dd>
<dd>driving a team of oxen pulling a cart.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When it takes more days to get the goods to market</dd>
<dd>than it takes for the crops to spoil you need a new market.</dd>

<dd>She added the 280 feet to make a mile of 8 furlongs of 660 feet</dd>
<dd>be a mile of 80 perche instead of a mile of 8 furlongs of 625 feet.</dd>
<dd>The perche was not a Roman measure.</dd>
<dd>Trying to lay out a knights fee with a mile that measured 75.75 perche to a side</dd>
<dd>was what led to the confusion as to how many acres were in a hyde and yerde.</dd>

<dd>In the ancient square Milos there were 576 Aroura.</dd>
<dd>Greek Aroura would be measured with a side of 200 Attic pous of 308.4 mm.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Those would have been derived from</dd>

<dd>VI. Further, the length of the seacoast of Egypt itself is sixty “schoeni”1 --of Egypt, that is, as we judge it to be, reaching from the Plinthinete gulf to the Serbonian marsh, which is under the Casian mountain--between these there is this length of sixty schoeni. [2] Men that have scant land measure by feet; those that have more, by miles; those that have much land, by parasangs; and those who have great abundance of it, by schoeni. [3] The parasang is three and three quarters miles, and the schoenus, which is an Egyptian measure, is twice that.</dd>

<dd>VII. By this reckoning, then, the seaboard of Egypt will be four hundred and fifty miles in length. Inland from the sea as far as Heliopolis, Egypt is a wide land, all flat and watery and marshy. From the sea up to Heliopolis is a journey about as long as the way from the altar of the twelve gods at Athens to the temple of Olympian Zeus at Pisa. [2] If a reckoning is made, only a little difference of length, not more than two miles, will be found between these two journeys; for the journey from Athens to Pisa is two miles short of two hundred, which is the number of miles between the sea and Heliopolis.</dd>

<dd>The British nautical mile may have been due to a want of having a sea mile in the same order of magnitude as their land mile?

<p><i>Only this reflection now:</i> Isn't it logical, that cultures with close relationships, commercial and cultural, wouldn't could say: "Oh, I know: One Roman pound is exactly 3/4 of a Greek mine or 600 Greek feet equal 625 Roman feet." And that since the beginning of civilisation in the "crescent fertile" about 8000 years ago?<br />

<dd>There are "connections" of various sorts all throughout history, some strong, some weak, some speculative. In particular, names were often borrowed for similar-sized units, and various attempts at reconciling different systems of measurements, often with adjustments of size in one or both systems, have taken place throughout history. It's when you get into notions of unadulterated transference to the present, or some god-given natural units to which we keep returning, that you get labeled quite justifiably as a crackpot. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 00:15, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>rktect 7/24/05</dd>
<dd>The transferences are not unadulterated but they are tracable</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>rktect 7/24/05 its ironic in a way because the oldest system I know of</dd>
<dd>has a hand of 100 mm and an ordinary cubit of 500 mm</dd>
</dl>
<p>Otherwise you are right, "names were often borrowed". This, because a pace is a pace (generally 5 feet), a foot is a foot (±&#160;30&#160;cm), a span is a span (2/3&#160;foot) and the digit has always been 1/16&#160;foot (&lt;&#160;2&#160;cm), like the inch is 1/12&#160;foot. Only the <i>ell</i> has two meanings: the "natural ell" of 3/2&#160;foot and the the meaning of a more practical "trade cubit" (for cords, ropes, drapery etc.) The values of the trade ells changed with their different definitions: Sometimes simply two feet, sometimes: from the middle of human body to the extremity of the hand (3&#160;feet), sometimes even 4&#160;feet (from the haunch to the fingers of opposite side with outstretched arm). The Egyptian Cubit measured 1.75&#160;feet or 28&#160;digits.</p>
<p>But not only the <i>names</i> of the units were borrowed. Like we can see (Egyptians borrowing the Nippur Cubit), also the <i>values</i> of units are generally taken over by ancient neighbour civilisation. But, often they created their own systems of subdivisions. Centuries later, one of these subdivision-units was not seldom considered to be a <i>main unit</i> and overtaken by others, who still created an other system of subdivisions, and so on.</p>
<dl>
<dd>rktect 7/24/05</dd>
<dd>The problem is that they would borrow a unit, rename it,</dd>
<dd>revise the subdivisions and just keep the value so to track those changes</dd>
<dd>can take more research than most people want to invest</dd>

In the opposite to the European Middle-Ages, <b>science was highly developped in Antiquity</b> <i>(See <a href="../../../e/r/a/Eratosthenes.html" title="Eratosthenes">Eratosthenes</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hero_of_Alexandria_62fd.html" title="Hero of Alexandria">Heron</a> and many others before)</i> and international relationships were omnipresent. Ancient metrological scientists were preeminent. <i>What gives you the arrogance to presume that they worked with corrupted standards?</i><br /></p>
<p><i>On the topo:</i> Professor Dr. Rolf C.A. Rottländer of the University of Tübingen measured hundreds of real existing ancient archeological scales, regrouping this with the architectural values <i>(which can still be measured)</i> of ancient monuments, stades etc. He found values for the ancient measures with a scientific <i>coefficent of faith</i> less than 0.2&#160;percent. The conventional, rounded values now used in <i>historical metrology</i> are within this coefficient of faith. The recent reseaches of Professor Dr.-ing Dieter Lelgemann, Director of the Berlin Geodesic Institut, accomplished with Eberhard Knobloch, Professor of History of Science and Technology at the Technical University of Berlin and Vicepresident of the French Académie Internationale d’Histoire des Sciences confirme – inter alia – the now established fact, <i>that all the ancient measure systems are related&#160;!</i></p>
<p>I count <b>four</b> digits.&#160; 52.92&#160;centimetres (0.2%, admittedly&#160;:&#160; ≤&#160;0.11cm).&#160; But if you prefer, you can consider that the conventional <i>foot of Carthage</i> is defined equal (529.2&#160;mm × 5/9 =) 294&#160;mm. Three digits. 0.2% of 294&#160;mm = 0.588&#160;mm. That you satisfy?</p>
<p>Thus the value 294&#160;mm ±&#160;0.17% (=0.4998&#160;mm) defines also the values 529.2&#160;mm, 370.44&#160;mm, 518.616&#160;mm as like the values 484.0416&#160;mm for the Salamis Cubit (14/15 of Nippur Cubit) and the Pergamon Cubit of 520.93125&#160;mm (15/16 of Babylonian Cubit = 555.66&#160;mm, i.e. 518.616 × 15/14) and dozens of well-known <i>(but untasted by you)</i> other ancient measures.</p>
<p>A definition can't be right or false, only be adequate or not to attain the aim, wherefore it has been formulate. Beyond a definition can be largely accepted or not. Many eminent scientists working in historical metrology do it, like me I do. But, helas!, that's not the case for Mr G.Nygaard.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are high-school student in science, but with your dismissive narrow-mindedness, unable to hold an argued, fair and respectful discussion, I'm not very optimistic for your scientific future.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Note that 294 mm to the nearest millimeter is not a "defined value".</dd>
<dd>No matter how precise your conversion factor is, using it cannot give you one iota more precision in your result than you had to start with. After using the conversion factor, you must round appropriately. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 17:03, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
I insist: <i>All</i> these values (294 as 518.616 like 529.2 and 296.352&#160;mm) are <i>defined values</i>. The <i>first</i> Nippur Cubit found by archaeological excavations, now in a museum of Istanbul, has a measured length of 518.9&#160;mm, 0.1% more than the value found by statistical methods [<a href="http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/uni/afa/projekte/rottl/codetab.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/uni/afa/projekte/rottl/codetab.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] and 0.05% more that the <i>defined value.</i> If Rottländer gives however 294.00 for the Carthaginian foot and not 293.9 like Lelgemann, it's because Röttländer distinguish a real and a corrected Gudea foot, whereas Lelgemann [<a href="http://www.fig.net/pub/athens/papers/wshs2/WSHS2_1_Lelgemann.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fig.net/pub/athens/papers/wshs2/WSHS2_1_Lelgemann.pdf" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>] identifies directly the Pous Italikos (=&#160;25/28 of Roman foot) to the Gudea foot. This one is in the Louvre Museum in Paris and measures 264.6&#160;mm (or 264.55&#160;mm like Lelgemann prefers).</p>
<p>The great advantage of the defined value of 518&#160;616&#160;mm exactly one for the Nippur Ell, that's 2<sup>3</sup> × 3<sup>3</sup> × 7<sup>4</sup> micrometers. <i>A defined value, a chosen value, a pitched value, but a good value.</i> Therefore, this value is now preferred in the historical metrology. It gives generally "round" values for <i>nearly all</i> other units <i>(except for the Arabic systems, where it is a very simply recurring decimal fraction)</i>. Easy, practical, without risk for error by not clearly documented decimal rounding, retaken again as <i>new input</i> values. <i>Admittedly:</i> Not "one iota more precise" than other values, but <i>more practical</i>. After calculations you <i>can</i> round appropriately as it has been done in the Roman measures table in the article (296.352 to 296.4&#160;mm). But you don't "must". At least if it is clearly indicate that's the matter of <i>defined</i> values.</p>
<p>Rottländer specified in his article. In historical metrology, <i>you have to give</i> the values for the <i>ancient digit-measures</i> with <i>at least four significant decimal digits</i>. Because, if not, the values for the <i>leagues</i> are completely corrupted. This not means, he wrote, that ancient cultures could determinate measures in the magnitude of micrometers.</p>
<p>Rounding appropriately, it's obvious with <i>measured</i> values, not with <i>defined</i> values. Even if, I repeat me: <i>Admittedly, you don't gain in precision, but only in practicability.</i></p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ancient meteorology (and even not-so-ancient) is a wonderful mixture of sometimes very admirable standards and methods of tracking, and sometimes outright sloppiness.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>True</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Egyptians couldn't care less about mathematical theorems,</p>
<dl>
<dd>False: They had theorems but not for general cases</dd>
</dl>
<p>but in practical arithmetic and meteorological skills they were true masters.</p>
<dl>
<dd>True: Their skills included developing a system of calculation based on unit fractions</dd>
<dd>Their system was still in use in the middle ages and included</dd>
<dd>formulas for the divisions of 2 by the odd numbers 3 to 101</dd>
<dd>unit fraction tables</dd>
<dd>division of the numbers 1-9 by 10</dd>
<dd>formulas for the area of a rectangle</dd>

<dd>continued fractions</dd>
</dl>
<p>Totally in contrast to the Greek, who were totally brilliant theoretical mathematicians, but left practical matters such as meteorology at a state of laissez-fair.</p>
<dl>
<dd>True but misleading. The Greeks tended to copy first and theorize afterwards.</dd>
</dl>
<p>(Their <i>definition</i> of a <i>stadion</i> being a case in point, it left antiquity in a state of confusion about distances).</p>
<dl>
<dd>False. Its not their definition that is the problem</dd>
<dd>(600 pous= 6 plethrons = 100 orguia)</dd>
<dd>The problem is that we don't understand their system very well</dd>
<dd>because the plethora of individual pous confuse us.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is thus totally impossible to draw any conclusions about relationships between units of measurement among cultures without some additional understanding of the underlying cultures.</p>
<dl>
<dd>True with the stated caveat</dd>
</dl>
<p>Most of the claims made by <b>Paul Martin</b>, to the degree I can say I understand what his claims really are, seem to be quite <i>Däniken</i>, or perhaps <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numerology.html" title="Numerology">numerology</a>. For instance, a claim that 600 Greek feet is by definition equal to 625 Roman feet is simply totally meaningless.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thats actually well documented.</dd>
<dd>World of Measurements" H. Arthur Klein p 69</dd>
<dd>The Milos, The Milliare and the Myle are all 185 m.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Firstly, there is no practicality at all in this claim. Adding up 600 <i>Greek</i> feet is easy enough, but how would the Romans go about diving this distance into 625 in an accurate manner to get their Roman foot?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Both systems are essentially the same in terms of overall length but</dd>
<dd>the pous and pes vary.</dd>
<dd>The Attic Greek pous is 308.4 mm, The Ionic Greek Roman pes is 296 mm</dd>
<dd>600 Attic pous of 308.4 mm = 625 Ionian pous Roman pes of 296mm</dd>
<dd>The real difference is in the calculation of areas.</dd>
<dd>The Greek system is based on the Mesopotamian iku,</dd>
<dd>side 100 great cubits of 600 mm</dd>
<dd>The Roman system is based on the Egyptian st3t,</dd>
<dd>side 100 royal cubits of 525 mm</dd>
<dd>the conversion from sexigesimal to septenary systems</dd>
<dd>keeps both systems feet the same at 300 mm</dd>
<dd>The Mesopotamian - Greek system provides 9 aroura to a stadion and</dd>
<dd>64 stadions to a square Milos</dd>
<dd>The Egyptian - Ionic Greek system initially</dd>
<dd>provides 9 ares of side 200 pous</dd>
<dd>Then the Romans modify the stadion of 600 pous to be</dd>
<dd>a stadium of 625 pes</dd>
<dd>When the Milliare becomes 5000 pes</dd>
<dd>A square Milliare now has an area of 25,000,000 pes</dd>
<dd>The area of the square stadium becomes 1/64 of that or 390,625 SF or</dd>
<dd>aproximately 9 acres</dd>
</dl>
<p>Secondly, there is no such thing as one <i>Greek foot</i>, simply because the definition varied from city state to city state and from time to time.</p>
<dl>
<dd>True but misleading, you learn to recognize which are short feet, which median and which long</dd>
<dd>A short Ionian pous of 296 mm, a longer Attic pous of 308.4 mm and a long Athenian pous of 316mm</dd>
</dl>
<p>Not as bad as in medieval Europe, perhaps, but still bad enough.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Medieval Europe is easiest to understand if you split it up historically to begin c 800 BC</dd>
<dd>east of the Rhine Greek pous</dd>
<dd>west of the Rhine Roman pes</dd>
</dl>
<p>Twisting numbers to find connections where none exist is simply a worthless exercise. <b>Some</b> of the data points are indeed very accurate, but this must not lead to the conclusion that they all are. But I will certainly take time to review the "VORMETRISCHE LÄNGENMASSEINHEITEN" by Rolf C. A. Rottländer. His connection to Universität Tübingen is not clear to me, and it may be we have yet another <i>Däniken</i> here, but let me give him the benefit of a doubt. -- <a href="../../../e/g/i/User%7EEgil_938c.html" title="User:Egil">Egil</a> 09:17, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

Hi Egil, I quote one very accurate phrase of you: <i>"There is no such thing as one Greek foot, simply because the definition varied from city state to city state."</i> It's true, an unified "Greek foot" don't exist.</p>
<p>Many exemplars of the two Egyptian cubits were found and are exposed in museums: Graduated rulers <i>always</i> divided into 28 digits. The Nippur Cubit was a widely-used measure in Mesopotamia and around, five thousand years ago. Let's say for simplify, because you prefer "realistic" numbers of digits: The Nippur Ell is 518.5 ±0.5&#160;mm. So, 51.85&#160;cm divided by 28, that's equal 1.85&#160;cm.</p>
<p>Now you have to know that in Antiquity there are (among others) three important (relative) measures. (Like it has been described even by ancient authors.) Firstly a 20&#160;digit-measure, commonly called with the Greek word "pygon", secondly a 18&#160;digit-measure, called "pygme" and lastly a 16&#160;digit-measure called "pous" (foot).</p>
<p>20 × 1.85 cm = 37.0 cm, the length of the measure called "Remen". Then, 18 × 1.85 cm = 33.3 cm, called "Pes Drusianus" <i>(in Middle-Ages sometimes called foot of Charlemagne)</i>. This measure is identical to the Chinese "Chi". At last, 16 × 1.85&#160;cm = 29.6&#160;cm. That's the "Roman foot".</p>
<dl>
<dd>The remen is originally an Egyptian unit of 5 palms,</dd>
<dd>The Romans made it 15" or 381 mm</dd>
<dd>Gillings says the double remen was</dd>
<dd>the length of the diagonal of a square</dd>
<dd>whose side was one cubit."</dd>
<dd>Using the royal cubit you get a double remen of 29.1"</dd>
<dd>The remen = the hypotenuse of a 3:4:5 triangle</dd>
<dd>where one side is the mh of 4 palms,</dd>
<dd>The mh is the Egyptian foot of 300 mm,</dd>
<dd>the other side is the quarter of 3 palms</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Olympic stade of Athens was constructed to be 500 Remen <i>(or 600 feet, like all Greek stades, but each City State used his own foot)</i>. 500 × 0.37 m = 185.0&#160;m. This Athens stade divided by 600 is a little more than 30.8&#160;cm. This is the <i>foot of Athens</i> commonly called "pous of Kyrenaika". 185&#160;m, that's also 625&#160;Roman feet. Q.E.D.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Let me make it perfectly clear that I am totally open to relationships between the measures of the aniquity (as well as more recent ages), as long as we agree not to involve mystisism. I regretfully do not have the time right now to follow and research all your arguments, but will try to do so in due course.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Beginning in Egypt, a royal cubit is divided into seven palms, each of which are 4 digits, i.e. 28 digits, each digit 1.87 cm. The short (or common) cubit, much used especially prior to the end of the Third Intermediate Period, is divied into six palms, i.e. 24 digits, so they are certainly not all divided in 28. Even though the Egyptian cubit is very well defined in certain times, it has varied a bit over the times, at least by 1%.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>rktect 7/24/05</dd>
<dd>Its hard to carry its value out to hundredths of a cm when</dd>
<dd>the length of Egyptian rulers is as often as not 21 inches</dd>
<dd>rather than 20 something.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The remen is afaik by definition half the diagonal of a royal cubit square, so in reality it consists of 19.799... 'Cubit digits', not 20.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>False (see above)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have not investigated if there are evidence that the Egyptian knew that the 'Remen digits' were different from the 'Cubit digits'.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Many ancient civilizations had finger and thumb variables but</dd>
<dd>SFAIK the Egyptians did not</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
I do also not know if it has been shown that the Egyptians knew of the <a href="../../../p/y/t/Pythagorean_theorem.html" title="Pythagorean theorem">Pythagorean theorem</a> nor the concept of <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irrational_number.html" title="Irrational number">irrational numbers</a>. 
</pre>
<dl>
<dd>The evidence of their use of the Pythagorean theorem</dd>
<dd>is adressed in Gillings who remains unconvinced.</dd>
<dd>Other authors make a much better case.</dd>
<dd>They certainly used 3:4:5 right triangles, pythagorean triples and</dd>
<dd>the fibonacci series.</dd>
<dd>There is good evidence that they worked around irrationals</dd>
<dd>by using ratios like 256/81 (Rhynd Papyrus) if not 22/7</dd>
<dd>In unit fractions 3 '8 '64 isn't bad either for practical applications</dd>
</dl>
<p>I've seen statements that they did not, but it is clear that their neighbors in Babylon knew <a href="http://www.tmeg.com/bab_mat/bab_mat.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tmeg.com/bab_mat/bab_mat.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Regardless, it does constitute an error of 1%, which they should have been able to detect.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Units of measure based on artifacts of the human body are very natural to any culture, and even if independently discovered, will probably be within at least a handful of percent of each other (this goes for digits, palms, feet, cubits and others). So you really need to give some real proof that units have been exchanged between cultures. Numbers matching up can just as well be coincidences.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The connections between Mesopotamia, Egypt, Persia, Greece and Rome are well known, obviously, but when there are claims about China and Japan, we are into deep water unless there is actual proof.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Mesopotamia traded with Iran, India and Afghanistan both overland and by water</dd>
<dd>The extent of its trade routes are probably best viewed by looking at the Persian empire.</dd>
<dd>China came into the picture with the silk road.</dd>
<dd>There was sea trade throughout the southern oceas from Madagascar to Han China</dd>
<dd>The best proof is Probably Ptolomys Geography</dd>

<p>The same goes for numerical relationships like the 600:625 of Greek vz. Roman feet. There has to be a very good rationale why this should be the case. Playing the number games with values which are of uncertainty 1% or so, there is simply no end to the common factors one can come up with. -- <a href="../../../e/g/i/User%7EEgil_938c.html" title="User:Egil">Egil</a> 16:59, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

Excuse for not having answered before.</p>
<p><i>You are in right:</i> The Egyptian Trade Cubit measured <i>24 digits</i> of the New Royal Cubit.</p>
<p>Then, we have to distinguish the "Remen" (a measure of 20 digits) and the "Construction Remen": A <i>set square</i> with sides of 20 engraved digits and a base of exactly 28 digits. As you remarked accurately, <i>the digits of the sides</i> are not equal to <i>the digits of the base</i>. A difference of about 1%. But that's not an error!</p>
<p>Even if this is not attested: We can suppose that Egyptian geometers, when they developed their sophisticated Construction Remen, they first took the Nippur Cubit <i>as base</i> (about 51,8 cm = 28 × 1.85 cm). <i>Therefore</i> the original Nippur Cubit has been divided into 28 equal parts <i>(and not into 30 digits like Mesopotanian did it)</i>.</p>
<p>But anon, they preferred to seize the <i>sides</i> of their Construction Remen as 20 × 1.85 cm = 37.0 cm. Since, <i>the base</i> of the Construction Remen has the attestable length of around 1.87 cm × 28 = 52.4 cm. This is also the length of Old Royal Cubit.</p>
<p>But, as you say it justly: Egyptian geometers were not silly. <i>They knew</i> that the length of the <i>digits of the sides</i> of their Construction Remen wasn't exactly identical to the length of the <i>digits of the base</i>. However, in praxis, they judged that this difference of about 0.2 mm per digit is - in the majority of cases - acceptable. So, even without logarithmic tables or pocket-calculators, they could treat the radix of number two, often encountered by geometers.</p>
<p>Many, many centuries later the Egyptians decided to modify their Construction Remen. As like they did it with the hypothetical experimental Construction Remen, they carried-over 20 digits of <i>the base</i> of their "Old Construction Remen" to <i>the sides</i> of their "New Construction Remen". Since the New Royal Cubit measures 1.89 cm × 28 = 52.9 cm or - exactly one - hundred 98th of the Nippur Cubit.</p>
<p>But unlike you say this is not an <i>"error of 1%"</i> neither <i>"it has [arbitrarily] varied a bit over the times, at least by 1%"</i> nor this <i>"values [...] are of uncertainty 1%"</i>. In the contrary. It's the matter of <i>two</i> well-defined and accurate measures. Each one was used in its well-known and good determinate epoch.</p>
<p>The Old Royal Cubit equal 20√2 / 28 Nippur Cubit.<br />
The New Royal Cubit equal 20√2 / 28 Royal Cubit = 100/98 Nippur Cubit.</p>
<p>One can clearly distinguish the early times, when the ORC was used, and the later times, when the NRC measured 52.92 cm.</p>
<p>You can be sure that, like you, I abhor to involve mysticism in science. I know since more than 20 years the (certainly justified) reputation of M. Däniken. So I never read one line of his commercial, absurd publications. <i>(I don't have time to waste.)</i> Even among the serious researches in the historical metrology, there are several points, where I'm sceptical or I don't agree.</p>
<p>Surely: <i>This or that</i> relationship between two measures could also be a simple coincidence.<br />
(<i>For example:</i> If we didn't know the real history of the definition of the decimal meter, someone would pretend: <i>"The SI-meter is exactly one the yard of the Roman Pygme: 3 × 18 × 1.85 cm = 100 cm."</i> But we know, the decimal meter was originally thought as the ten millionth part of the quarter of an Earth meridian, measured by modern triangulations. <i>Here, it's a clearly established coincidence!)</i><br />
But because <i>all the ancient measures</i> are related by (more or less) simple ratios. It's not possible that <i>all</i> this relationships are coincidences!</p>
<p>Beyond, it's logical: International trade relationships need factors of conversion and "to take reference" is a criterion of all serious, scientific metrology. This, ancient metrologists knew it and heeded it.</p>
<p>Whereas, undisputed, the European Middle-Ages was not a very <i>scientific</i> epoch.</p>
<p><i>For example:</i> The Norwegian foot is said to be the Old Danish foot which is said to be the Rheinfuss. Surely, it is so. But never anyone has found any ratio to the ancient measures. It's about 106 % of a Roman foot, but 106 is 53 twice. The number 53 is a primary number, never used anywhere as ratio. Other relationships to the ancient systems have not been found. For the Middle-Ages you can find many, many examples like this: Local measures without relationships to the old systems.</p>
<p><b>Do you know at least <i>one</i> example of an ancient measure of length not-related to the Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Persian, Roman and the different Greek systems?</b> If this is the case, this would be very interesting for the modern scientific research. Communicate-us this singulary case if you have found one.</p>
<p>For the question, if the Japanese and the Chinese foot is related to the systems of the "fertile crescent", the cradle of all the human civilisation <i>(at least in the Old World)</i> or not:</p>
<p>The digit of the New Royal Cubit is exactly one 1.89 cm. 16 times 1.89 cm = 30.24 cm. <i>This is the Japanese Shaku.</i> It's not contestable.<br />
<i>The Chinese Chi</i> is as long as the well-known and well-attested "Pes Drusianus" around 1.85 cm × 18 = 33.3 cm. It's a coincidence?</p>
<p>Perhaps. But, as user Crissov advisedly remarked: Trade on the <i>Silk Road</i> was constant and durable in former times. Graduated rulers like the New Royal Cubit (we have beautiful specimens today in museums) are "transportable merchandises". What's strange in the idea that merchants brought this rulers to the Courts of China and Japan? Anybody knows, measures <i>(even in ancient times)</i> have to be exact. If you command a piece, it's necessary that both sides use the same ruler. Accuracy is always required.</p>
<p>If we admit this surely not-digressive idea that merchants brought western graduated rulers to Far-East: It would be logical that eastern metrologists copied truthful this measures. <i>The values of the Japanese Shaku and the Chinese Chi</i> confirm this thesis.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, they merely confirm a connection, if at all. By themselves they say not much about the direction of such cultural transfer, if it happened indeed. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrissov_713f.html" title="User:Crissov">Christoph Päper</a> 16:34, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>East-Asian civilisation, culture and history is old, very old. But not as ancient as Mesopotanian-Egytian culture and history. If these measures and graduated rulers are attested in the Fertile Crescent since at least the beginning of the third millenary BC and not in Far-East, <i>the sense West-East</i> seems me to be <i>more than probable</i>. -- <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Martin_ab83.html" title="User:Paul Martin">Paul Martin</a> 10:03, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For the so-called "megalithic yard": I don't know. I never studied this measure. In this time <i>graduated rulers</i> didn't exist. So, all modern researches of the "megalithic metrology" are difficult and approximated hypothesis, and surely many publications about the <i>megalithic yard</i> are not serious and not scientific.</p>
<p><i>For the Olympic stade:</i> What do you understand by "proof"?<br />
The historical Olympic stadion of Athens measures 185.0 m <i>(In spring 2004 Lelgemann and his students measured 184.96 m at site. This are 600 feet of Kyrenaika.)</i> <i>Undeniably:</i> 185 meter <i>is</i> 10 000 Roman digits or 625 Roman feet.</p>
<p>This frequent relationship, 25 to 24, is already well-known in Antiquity. Plinius (VI, 35) mentioned: “For the way from Syene to Meroe, Eratosthenes counts 625 milia passuum, Artemidoros 600 milia passuum.” According to this, the stadion of Artemidoros equal 625 pous Italikon or 600 pous Nikomedesios. That's almost 165,4 m.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Without further context that translation could just as well mean that they used the same <i>milia passuum</i>, but came to different results. But I assume you know the context and it proves your claim. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrissov_713f.html" title="User:Crissov">Christoph Päper</a> 16:34, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>P.S.</i> In one point you disappointed me. You retook into the article this <i>false</i> information:<br />
"As a case in point, the Great Pyramid of Giza was built to a precision of 0.015 m over sides that are 235 meters, over four and a half thousand years ago."</p>
<p><i>Firstly:</i> 1.5 cm of 235 m? It's a precision of 0.006% !!! And that's you who spoke of "realistic values"?</p>
<p><i>Secondly:</i> It's established that the Great Pyramid was constructed with a length of 440 Old Royal Cubits (= 230.5 m) and 440 Remen (= 163.0 m) from the centre to the corners. The length of the Oueen's Pyramid of Giza is 120 Remen (= 44.5 meters) with a diagonal between two corners of 120 Royal Cubits (= 62.9 meters). <a href="http://www.fig.net/pub/athens/papers/wshs2/WSHS2_1_Lelgemann.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fig.net/pub/athens/papers/wshs2/WSHS2_1_Lelgemann.pdf" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p><i>Second Postscript:</i> I hope, one time soon, you will demand the deletion of <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscientific_weights_and_measures.html" title="Pseudoscientific weights and measures">Pseudoscientific_weights_and_measures</a> and you will reintegrate the content into the article. The only reproach one can evoke is that the practical, conventional value of 2×2 × 3×3×3 × 7×7 hundredth of centimeters (equal 52.92 cm) for the New Royal Cubit for example, is a "modern, defined value." But put this value to the test. <i>This value delivers the simplest values for all the other values of the ancient measures of length</i> (except the values derivate from the "irrational" Old Royal Cubit of course). Beyond this value is <i>not</i> in contradiction to the values obtained by modern statistical methods. <i>Therefore it's an easy and the good "over-all rounded" value.</i> (Practical, not numerological!) It should be mentioned in the article.</p>

<p>the statement is nonsense, since an irrational number is one that canNOT be expressed as a ratio.</p>

<p>One way to deal with irrational numbers is to use unit measures that are related irrationally. Not precisely as modern mathematics would demand, but to close approximations which are more than sufficient for all practical measurement.</p>
<p>Setting one measure equal to the circumference of a circle and another to its diameter 22:7</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://users.primushost.com/~whittet/Egyptian%20circle.htm" class="external text" title="http://users.primushost.com/~whittet/Egyptian%20circle.htm" rel="nofollow">Egyptian circle</a></li>
</ul>
<p>An Egyptian architect from the 3rd millenium BC left a sketch which shows how a series of different heights at a unit spacing can be used to define an arc. The heights are given in fractions of royal cubits and therefore its logical to assume the spacing is in royal cubits also, but Egyptian mathematics can be subtle. If the spacing is set as units of an ordinary cubit of 6 palms instead of 7, the arc described is best described as circular.</p>
<p>or the 3:4:5 proportions of a right triangle, where the hypotensuse is a remen of 5 palms and the run a quarter of three palms, the rise is a foot of four palms.</p>
<p>Another way to do this is to relate a length to a volume as its side.</p>
<p>An irrational number is one that can't be expressed as a ratio of two <i>integers</i>. The statement is still nonsense, but just because all ancient measurements are approximate (as opposed to modern, highly technical definitions involving cesium atoms and whatnot), and therefore any ratio between them must be approximate, and therefore the ratio can't be expressed with an infinite degree of specificity, which is what an irrational ratio would require.</p>
<p>In any case, there's no way anyone's actually proven anything like this irrational. Only a handful of things have been proven irrational: certain radicals, <i>π</i>, <i>e</i>, maybe <i>φ</i>. I say remove the statement—it's completely ludicrous. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>) 05:26, 8 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>These relationships are often rational when they are matters of definition, not otherwise. There is now a rational relationship between a pound and a kilogram, something that wasn't true 150 years ago. But, for example, the ratio between circular mils and square mils is a matter of definition, but not rational.</dd>
<dd>The ratio of the diagonal of a square to its side is the square root of 2. Not a rational number. So the statement is correct. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 05:58, 8 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The section on Persian units claims a pre-existing Persian <i>stadion</i> and <i>skhoinos</i>.

<dd>those that have much land, by parasangs; and those who have great abundance of it, by schoeni.</dd>
<dd>3 The parasang is three and three quarters miles, and</dd>
<dd>the schoenus, which is an Egyptian measure, is twice that.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>In other words there are 10 Egyptian scoenus (or itrw of 21,000 royal cubits) to a degree</dd>

<dd>Inland from the sea as far as Heliopolis, Egypt is a wide land, all flat and watery and marshy.</dd>
<dd>From the sea up to Heliopolis is a journey</dd>
<dd>about as long as the way from the altar of the twelve gods at Athens</dd>
<dd>to the temple of Olympian Zeus at Pisa.</dd>
<dd>2 If a reckoning is made, only a little difference of length,</dd>
<dd>not more than two miles, will be found between these two journeys</dd>
<dd>for the journey from Athens to Pisa is two miles short of two hundred</dd>
<dd>which is the number of miles between the sea and Heliopolis.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Chapter 9</dd>
<dd>1 From Heliopolis to Thebes is nine days' journey by river, and</dd>
<dd>the distance is six hundred and eight miles, or eighty-one schoeni.</dd>
<dd>2 This, then, is a full statement of all the distances in Egypt</dd>
<dd>the seaboard is four hundred and fifty miles long; and</dd>
<dd>I will now declare the distance inland from the sea to Thebes</dd>
<dd>it is seven hundred and sixty-five miles. And</dd>
<dd>between Thebes and the city called Elephantine there are two hundred and twenty-five miles.</dd>

<dd>Chapter 109</dd>
<dd>1 For this reason Egypt was intersected.</dd>
<dd>This king also (they said) divided the country among all the Egyptians</dd>
<dd>by giving each an equal parcel of land, and made this his source of revenue,</dd>
<dd>assessing the payment of a yearly tax.</dd>
<dd>2 And any man who was robbed by the river of part of his land</dd>
<dd>could come to Sesostris and declare what had happened</dd>
<dd>then the king would send men to look into it and calculate the part</dd>
<dd>by which the land was diminished, so that thereafter</dd>
<dd>it should pay in proportion to the tax originally imposed.</dd>
<dd>3 From this, in my opinion, the Greeks learned the art of measuring land</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Listing measures seems pretty straightforward</dd>
<dd>I can see where someone who doesn't have familiarity with a measure</dd>

<dd>"1 English furlong : ca. 200 m - This Anglo-Saxon unit hasn't changed in length (significiantly) for centuries. It was said to be 1/8th of a (Roman) mile since that was reintroduced in Britain, but in fact it is only exactly 1/8th of the English statute mile of 1593 (QE1). 5280 milliari = 5000 statute miles (132:125).</dd>

<dd>I looked at some of the "Anglo-Saxon" European units</dd>
<dd>from Romania, Norway, Norman France, Germany, Denmark,</dd>
<dd>Finland, Spain, Scotland, Finland, France, and England</dd>
<dd>All of them are transparent multiples of Greek and Roman units.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I found a couple of similar statements on websites</dd>
<dd>Generally I would characterise such statements as uniformed</dd>
<dd>Especially since you can as readilly find the correct information</dd>
<dd>with the same web search</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The following is from a web page which cites Klein</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"The "ell" is an ancient measure of length,...</dd>
<dd>mentioned explicitly in the Magna Charta,...</dd>
<dd>reluctantly signed by King John on 15 June 1215.</dd>
<dd>This document contains sixty-three pledges or clauses;</dd>
<dd>the thirty-fifth is the "measurements" pledge.</dd>
<dd>Translated from the medieval Latin into modern English,</dd>
<dd>this clause reads: "Throughout the Kingdom</dd>
<dd>there shall be standard measures of wine, ale, and corn.</dd>
<dd>Also there shall be a standard width of dyed cloth, russet,</dd>
<dd>and haberject; namely a width of two ells within the selvedges.</dd>
<dd>Weights also are to be standardized similarly."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One of the earliest of all tables of English linear mesures,</dd>
<dd>Richard Arnold's Customs of London, c. 1503,</dd>
<dd>contains the following sequence ...</dd>
<dd>The length of a barley corn 3 times make an ynche [inch] and</dd>
<dd>12 ynches make a fote [foot] and</dd>
<dd>3 fote make a yerde [yard] and</dd>
<dd>5 qaters [quarters] of the yerde make an elle.</dd>
<dd>5 fote make a pace.</dd>
<dd>123[125 in Klein] pace make a furlong</dd>
<dd>and 8 furlong make an English myle [mile]</dd>

<dd>600 Roman/Greek <i>stadia</i> 111 km, 60 nautical miles</dd>
<dd>or 75 Roman miles (<i>milliare</i>))</dd>
<dd>The comment was added " one degree of Earth" which is meaningless</dd>
<dd>Its one degree of the earth's equatorial circumference.</dd>
<dd>The discussion of such calculations can be found in Ptolomy's geography</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The following question seems a bit naive.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My metrology knowledge in fact is better after mediæval times than before or even inside, but what reason would QE1 have had to increase the number of feet or yards in (and the length of) a mile, if not making eight existing furlongs its new size?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Every time a standard of measure is changed, somebody benefits economically. Someone's acres get larger and they own more land and can charge more in rent or tithes or taxes. Queen Elizabeth clearly had advisors who stood to gain if they suceeded in changing the standards of measure. When they sold her that bill of goods they set the stage for Napoleon and the metric system.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The mile has always been divided in 8 stadions, stadiums and furlongs</dd>
<dd>The Romans also divided the stadium into 5 actus of 125 pes</dd>
<dd>When the Milos was 4800 pous the stadion was 600 pous and 185 m</dd>
<dd>In a square Milos there were 64 square stadions and 576 aroura</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Bodelian manuscript dates from this period</dd>
<dd>14 acres maketh a yerde of land</dd>
<dd>5 yerdis maketh a hyde of land which is 70 acres</dd>
<dd>8 hydis maketh a knights fee which is 560 acres of land</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Look at the confusion</dd>
<dd>the redefinition of the Greek Milos by the Romans and</dd>
<dd>The redefinition of the Milliare by the Elizabeathans, and</dd>
<dd>The redefinition of the Mile by the Metric system brings to Europe.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Virgate - An old English unit of area,</dd>
<dd>equal to one quarter of a hide = 1.25 yerdis = 17.5 acres</dd>
<dd>The amount of land needed to support a person.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The hide is at its root a German word for household.</dd>
<dd>In the Saxon counties of southern England,</dd>
<dd>it referred to the land sufficient to support one family,</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>which equaled what the family plowed in a year.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Depending on the fertility of the land, the hide varied</li>
<li>from as little as 60 to as many as 240 acres,</li>
<li>but it was typically between 80 and 120.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The bovate, 1/8 of a carucate, also appears in the Domesday Book.</li>
<li>Its origin is Danish and it is found</li>
<li>in the northeastern English counties constituting the Danelaw.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A carucata or carucate, like a hide, is approximately 120 acres and</li>
<li>like the bovate was found in the Danish counties.</li>
<li>Plowland or plowgate is equal to a carucate or</li>
<li>an area eight oxen can plow</li>
<li>sufficient for a free family to support itself;</li>
<li>its origins precede 1100.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The plowland compares with the knight’s fee, which was a larger area</li>
<li>sufficient to support a knight’s family</li>
<li>(perhaps to allow pasture for animal husbandry).</li>
<li>Sulung is a Kentish term for two hides.</li>
<li>A yoke in Kent is 1/4 of a sulung.</li>
<li>A virgate is a rod in linear measure and 1/4 of a hide</li>
<li>(or 30 acres) as a measure of area in Saxon counties.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Arpent - Unit of length and area used in France, Louisiana, and Canada. * As a unit of length, =~ 191.8 feet (180 old French 'pied', or foot).</li>
<li>The (square) arpent is a unit of area,</li>
<li>approximately .845 acres, or 36,802 square feet</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Morgen - Unit of area =~ .6309 acres. or 27, 482 SF</li>
<li>It was used in Germany, Holland and South Africa,</li>
<li>and was derived from the German word Morgen ("morning").</li>
<li>It represented the amount of land that could be plowed in a morning.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>560 acres =~ 576 aroura</li>
<li>The square Milos has become the Knights fee</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>in a square stadion there were 9 aroura of 40,000 square pous</li>
<li>each aroura had a side of 200 pous divisible into 2 plethrons</li>
<li>each of the 2304 plethron in a square Milos had a side of 100 pous</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When the Milliare was 5000 pes the stadium was 625 pes and 185 m</li>
<li>In a square Milliare there were still 64 square stadiums but</li>
<li>There were also 25 square actus of 25 acres</li>
<li>A Heridia was 1.25 acres so there were 20 Heridis to a square Actus</li>
<li>Each Jugerum was half a Heridium and Half a Jugerum was an acuna.</li>
<li>A Centuria was 100 Heredia or 125 acres or 5 square Actus</li>

<dd>I just say that it implies that, not that I exclude the possibility. Of course there were people who not believed in Earth as a disc a long time ago, some even calculated its circumference to quite some precision—I'm bad with remembering names, sorry—, but it's a huge step from there to have a system of measurement based on that. Also consider that there is not just one Greek stadium. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrissov_713f.html" title="User:Crissov">Christoph Päper</a> 15:28, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>See Gillings’ “Mathematics in the time of the Egyptians” is a good benchmark for discussions of Egyptian mathematics and their systematic calculations of length, area and volume.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>hekat</i>, <i>hk3t</i> := 1/30 Royal cubit³, 4.8 <a href="../../../l/_/_/L.html" title="L">l</a>, used for grain, was divided into fractions of ½, ¼, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32 and 1/64 by an "Eye of <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horus.html" title="Horus">Horus</a>" rule.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Gillings says the <i>hk3t</i> was 1/30 royal cubit. If we take the royal cubit as 5 cubic feet that would mean that 6 <i>hk3t</i> = 1728 in³ and the <i>hk3t</i> is 288 in³ (4.72 l). Gillings says, Chace gives it as 292.24 in³ (4.79 l).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Since the divisions of the <i>hk3t</i> are clearly a doubling system similar to the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_unit.html#Volume" title="English unit">English systems</a> and since ancient weights and measures often have long, median and short forms, it might be interesting to see what would happen if the divisions of the cubic cubit would follow the same system.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For purposes of accuracy allow a <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronze_Age_9719.html" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a> variation in the length of the cubit, 20.62" ± 1/16" or 523.75 mm ± 1.6 mm.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Comment by my editor</li>
<li>above it is only said to be &lt;= 525 mm</li>
<li>The variance in actual cubit rules is +/- 1/16" at a minimum</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If we set the <i>hk3t</i> at 1/32 of a royal cubit with side 20.7" and volume 8876 in³ and divide by 32 we get 277.36 in³.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For comparison purposes:</li>

<ul>
<li>What does Egyptian stuff do here?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Egyptian measures are the earliest form of the Roman measures.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The acre (Egyptian <i>3kr</i>, the land itself) was first defined</li>
<li>as the area of a farmers fields or <i>3ht</i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In Mesopotamia the <i>iku</i> was 100 cubits to a side.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Mesopotamian measures are the earliest form of the Egyptian measures.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In Egypt the <i>kht</i> was defined as the side of an <i>3ht</i>. The <i>kht</i> measured 100 cubits long by 1 cubit wide. It originated as the length of the irigation ditch that brought water to the field. At first fields were farmed in pairs with one field left fallow and the other plowed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A field with side 100 ordinary cubits of 450 mm (17 2/3 in)</li>
<li>has sides of 147.29 English feet,</li>
<li>its area is 21,693 ft² or about half a modern English acre of 43,560 ft².</li>
<li>its exactly half an acre if the Egyptian ordinary cubit is 17.7"</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Some people may not know that before the time of Queen Elizabeth</li>
<li>Anglo- Saxon English measures derived from the Greek and Roman</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>IOW some people believe in the one-system-everywhere theory and don't accept variations.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>IMHO everything anyone believes is a bias against the alternative.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps two measures with the same name and value would be a coincidence.</dd>
<dd>With an entire system with the same name and value coincidence is harder to support.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Queen Elizabeth added 280 feet to the old Roman Milliare or Myle</li>
<li>so that a furlong would measure 10 perche and be 10 acres so</li>
<li>that 64 square furlongs would egual a square mile.</li>
<li>In an Anglo - Saxon Myle there were 625 acres</li>
<li>Those acres are measured as 40,000 pes with 625 to a square Milliare</li>
<li>(of side 5000 pes) That was the Myle c 49 BC - 1593 AD</li>
<li>The Furlong of that Myle was 625 fote.</li>
<li>Before that c 800 BC - 49 BC there was a Milos of 600 pous</li>
<li>There were 9 aroura to a square stadion and</li>
<li>64 square stadions to a square Milos (of side 4800 pous)</li>
<li>meaning that their aroura was 40,000 sq pous.</li>
<li>The Anglo Saxons derived their measures from the Germanics</li>
<li>and the Germanics East of the Rhine used the Pous</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'd like to see a proof for that. And an explanation. Until then I regard this as a result of deliberately misinterpreted statistics. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrissov_713f.html" title="User:Crissov">Christoph Päper</a> 15:28, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Take a look at the page on Medieval Measures.</dd>
<dd>Look at the values broken down by German city.</dd>
<dd>How many are evenly divisible by subdivisions of a Greek Milos?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The important fact about the Egyptians is that their</li>
<li>3kr or measure of the land itself was derived from</li>
<li>the Mesopotamian iku and so was the Greek aroura or thousand.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Although initially fields had measured a half acre</li>
<li>with sides of 100 ordinary cubits of 17.7"</li>
<li>they had always been plowed in pairs and</li>
<li>the pair of fields had measured an acre</li>
<li>The Egyptians called the field (<i>3ht</i>) and</li>
<li>the field of side 100 royal cubits, a <i>st3t</i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Later as domesticated animals began being used to plow the fields a third field was added and planted in hay or fodder for the beasts of burden.</li>
<li>The field of side 100 royal cubits of 20.5" had an area of 29,040 SF so * three st3t was 2 acres.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Greeks called the <i>st3t</i> an <i>aroura</i> or thousand.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I would be very suprised if the Roman acre is a squared Roman arpent</li>
<li>or that there was a Roman arpent equal to 14400 ft²</li>
<li>or about 0.126 ha or "more exactly almost" 1264.673 m².</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The reason is that none of those measures of area</li>
<li>are evenly divisible into a square Roman Milliare and</li>
<li>every measure the Romans adopted is if nothing else systematic.</li>
<li>625 pes = 500 remen = 1/8 milliare, 1 milliare = 5000 passus</li>
<li>1 square milliare = 625 acres of 40,000 pes</li>
<li>25 square acres = side 1000 pes, 1 area side 100 pes</li>
<li>600 stadia = 75 miliare = 1 degree</li>

 I don't like to see people making statements that have   
 no leg to stand on. If you want to edit something I wrote

<p>I agree with the last. rktect 7/19/05, but would support by cite and by identity proof, that the same system has been used throughout history and traced back to a sngle system.</p>
<p>I don't have a lot of problems with pyramids as evidence for Egyptian standards of measure as long as you include ordinary buildings, inscription grids, all known rulers and rods, fields, nileometers, the volume of h3kts, generally do your homework.</p>
<p>Irrational numbers are irrational, using measures to make them rational along with the classic problems of greek antiquity would be interesting to discuss.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Irrational numbers are irrational. You can't make them rational by using measures.</dd>
<dd>Not even a god could make an irrational number rational.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimp_bb44.html" title="User:Jimp">Jimp</a> 20Jul05</dd>

<p>One way to rationalize an irrational number is to construct a geometric ratio using two units related as the sides of a square to its diagonal or the diameter of a circle to its circumference. Its a somewhat subtle, very Egyptian concept where numbers are not thought of as iterations but rather as individuals as in the seked or ratio of unit rise to unit run so also foot to remen or remen to cubit. ie the ratio is 1x:1y</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Look, I can see where you're coming from with this "rationalising</dd>
<dd>the irrational" but, you surely realise, it's a play on words. In</dd>
<dd>the mathematical sense of the word there is no rationalising</dd>
<dd>irrational numbers: a number is either rational or irrational.</dd>
<dd>There is, of course, the other sense of "rationalise" meaning "to</dd>
<dd>make sense of". Yes, it would be interesting to look at how</dd>
<dd>people used measures to do this.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One good example might be the slide rule. There are a lot of variations</dd>
<dd>on it but essentially its a spread sheet, it allows you to set 1x:1y</dd>
<dd>where x and y can be any two formulas. When you combine that with the Egyptians</dd>
<dd>use of unit fractions you have continued fractions, fluxions, anything you like.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Another good example would be the tables on a framing square</dd>

<dd>gallon "(gal) [1]</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>a traditional unit of liquid volume, derived from the Roman galeta, which originally meant a pailful. Gallons of various sizes have been used in Europe ever since Roman times. In the United States, the liquid gallon is legally defined as exactly 231 cubic inches; this is equal to the old English wine gallon, which originated in medieval times but was not standardized until 1707, during the reign of Queen Anne. Some scholars believe the wine gallon was originally designed to hold 8 troy pounds of wine. The U. S. gallon holds 4 liquid quarts or exactly 3.785 411 784 liters; a U.S. gallon of water weighs about 8.33 pounds. American colonists were also familiar with the Elizabethan beer and ale gallon, which held 282 cubic inches (4.621 liters). gallon (gal) [2] a historic British unit of dry volume still used implicitly in the U.S. In the U.S., the term "gallon" is not used in dry measure, but if it were it would be equal to 1/2 peck, or 4 dry quarts, or 268.8025 cubic inches, or approximately 4.404 884 liters. This unit is the English corn or grain gallon, standardized during the reign of Elizabeth I in the sixteenth century. The earliest official definition of a dry gallon in Britain is a 1303 proclamation of Edward I, where the gallon is defined as the volume of 8 pounds of wheat; the current U.S. "gallon" contains about 7.5 pounds of wheat. Grain gallons have tended to be larger than liquid gallons throughout the history of British units, apparently because they were based on heaped rather than "struck" (leveled) containers. A container in which grain has been heaped above the top will hold as much as 25% more grain, and the traditional corn gallon is in fact 16.4% larger than the wine gallon. gallon (gal) [3] currently the British use a larger gallon than either of the American gallons. The Imperial Weights and Measures Act of 1824 established a new unit for all volumes, liquid or dry, replacing all the other gallons in previous use in Britain. The imperial gallon, designed to contain exactly 10 pounds of distilled water under precisely defined conditions, holds exactly 4.546 09 liters or approximately 277.4194 cubic inches. The imperial gallon equals 1.20095 U.S. liquid gallons (British wine gallons) or 1.03206 U.S. dry gallons (British corn gallons). gallon (gal) [4] a traditional unit of volume in Scotland equal to 4 Scots quarts. This is almost exactly 3 British Imperial gallons, 3.6 U.S. liquid gallons, or 13.63 liters. "</p>

<p>The metric system was first used in decimal form in ancient mesopotamia.</p>
<p>Our modern rediscovery of it goes back to when it was first being proposed in the 16th century. Its adoption and definition were based on a survey of ancient measures by Napoleons savants and it was used by the French peasantry as a political tool to overthrow the feudal system</p>

</ul>
<p>that looks at the Roman units of area in comparison with equivalents of its peers as well as our modern equivalents and gives some sources.</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't think you get the same British Imperial system</li>
</ul>
<p>equivancy if you only look at its metric system value and so while you may be telling the truth you are not telling the whole truth.</p>
<ul>
<li>The mile has always been divided in 8 stadions, stadiums and furlongs</li>
</ul>
<p>The Romans also divided the stadium into 5 actus of 125 pes The Greek Milos was the immediate predecessor to the Roman Milliare It derives its acre or aroura from The Mesopotamia iku which is 100 cubits to a side rather than from the Egyptian st3t which is also 100 cubits to a side</p>
<ul>
<li>When the Milos was 4800 pous the stadion was 600 pous and 185 m</li>
<li>In a square Milos there were 64 square stadions and 576 aroura</li>
<li>560 acres =~ 576 aroura</li>
<li>The square Milos became the Knights fee</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In a square stadion there were 9 aroura of 40,000 square pous</li>
<li>each aroura had a side of 200 pous divisible into 2 plethrons</li>
<li>each of the 2304 plethron in a square Milos had a side of 100 pous</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When the Milliare was 5000 pes the stadium was 625 pes and 185 m</li>
<li>In a square Milliare there were still 64 square stadiums but</li>
<li>There were also 25 square actus of 25 acres</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A Heridia was 1.25 Roman acres so there were 20 Heridis to a square Actus</li>
<li>1.25 Roman acres is 50,000 pied = side 217.15 Ft area 47,154.54 SF</li>
<li>Each Jugerum was half a Heridium and Half a Jugerum was an acuna.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A Centuria was 100 Heredia or 125 acres or 5 square Actus</li>
<li>in a square acre there were 40,000 square feet or fote</li>
<li>each acre had a side of 200 feet</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When the Mile was made 5280 feet the furlong became 220 yards</li>
<li>Each square furlong was divided into 10 acres or 8 Heridia</li>
<li>each acre measured a perch by a furlong</li>
<li>Each square furlong was half a square Actus</li>
<li>Each Jugerum was half a Heridium and Half a Jugerum was an acuna.</li>
<li>Each Furlong was 16 Jugerum and 32 acuna</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A Centuria was 100 Heredia, 12.5 square furlongs</li>
<li>125 acres or 5 square Actus was one</li>
<li>in a square acre there were 40,000 square feet or fote</li>
<li>each acre had a side of 200 feet</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Romans conquered (much of) Britain,</li>
<li>when it was inhabited by Celts, bringing with them their mile</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In Roman Europe The Bodelian manuscript tells us</li>
<li>14 acres maketh a yerde of land</li>
<li>If those are Roman acres of 40,000 pied then the yerde is 12 English acres</li>
<li>5 yerdis maketh a hyde of land which is 70 acres 60 English acres</li>
<li>8 hydis maketh a knights fee which is 560 acres of land = 480 English acres</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>the redefinition of the Greek Milos by the Romans and</li>

<ul>
<li>brings to Europe.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Virgate - "An old English unit of area" is actually Roman in origin</li>
<li>equal to one quarter of a hide = 1.25 yerdis = 17.5 acres</li>
<li>The amount of land needed to support a person.</li>
<li>The hide is at its root a German word for household, but also a Roman derived unit</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We are told that in the Saxon counties of southern England,</li>
<li>it referred to the land sufficient to support one family,</li>
<li>which equaled what the family plowed in a year.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We are told that depending on the fertility of the land, the hide varied</li>
<li>from as little as 60 to as many as 240 acres,</li>
<li>but it was typically between 80 and 120 acres.</li>
<li>Its 60 modern English, 70 Roman acres</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We are told that the bovate, 1/8 of a carucate,</li>
<li>which also appears in the Domesday Book has its origin as Danish</li>
<li>and it is found in the northeastern English counties constituting the Danelaw.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Lets allow a carucata or carucate, like a hide, is approximately 120 acres and</li>
<li>like the bovate was found in the Danish counties.</li>
<li>A Plowland or plowgate is equal to a carucate or an area eight oxen can plow</li>
<li>sufficient for a free family to support itself;</li>
<li>its origins precede 1100.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We are told the plowland compares with the knight’s fee,</li>
<li>which was a larger area sufficient to support a knight’s family</li>
<li>(perhaps to allow pasture for animal husbandry).</li>
<li>Sulung is a Kentish term for two hides.</li>
<li>Its 120 modern English, 140 Roman acres</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A yoke in Kent is 1/4 of a sulung.</li>
<li>A virgate is a rod in linear measure and 1/4 of a hide</li>
<li>(or 30 acres) as a measure of area in Saxon counties.</li>
<li>30 acres is 1/4 sulong</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We have the Arpent a unit of length =~ 191.8 feet and</li>
<li>the (square) arpent is a unit of area, area</li>
<li>(180 old French 'pied', or foot) used in France, Louisiana, and Canada.</li>
<li>approximately .845 acres, or 36,802 square feet</li>

<dd>Despite the fact that you've just proposed that before we the main page again we discuss,</dd>
<dd>Rktect, you've gone and changed it without discussion. Let's now attempt to identify</dd>
<dd>what's questionable about this and why.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Old version</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>Many systems ... are related to a varying degree, despite a number of different</dd>

<dd>Many systems ... are related to a varying degree. Despite a number of different</dd>
<dd>civilisations making ... adjustments to serve their own purposes, the accuracy of</dd>
<dd>definitions improved over time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You do realise that this completely changes the meaning, don't you, Rktect?</dd>
<dd>The first version says that the systems were related inspite of the adjustments.</dd>
<dd>The second version says that the accuracy of definitions improved inspite of</dd>
<dd>the adjustments.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The first version makes sense: the systems are still related</dd>
<dd>though different. The second is nonsense: how could these adjustements possibly</dd>
<dd>have reduced the accuracy of the definitions?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimp_bb44.html" title="User:Jimp">Jimp</a> 20Jul05</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Think about that...</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think people do need to re-read and self edit from time to time to remove poor phrasing, obvious typos, and bad formating.</p>
<p>Neither of those first two versions is well phrased.</p>
<p>The first is a run on sentence which says.</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. The systems are related to a varying degree.</dd>
<dd>2. The degree they are related to varies.</dd>
<dd>3. The accuracy of the definitions improved over time.</dd>
<dd>4. This was despite adjustments.</dd>
<dd>5. A number of different civilizations made them.</dd>
<dd>6. The adjustments were to serve their own purposes.</dd>
</dl>
<p>That's just too many clauses for a single thought.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The second uses two run on sentences to say.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I</dd>
<dd>1. The systems are related to a degree.</dd>
<dd>2. The degree they are related to varies.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This has the misfortune of suggesting the degree was a variable standard.</p>
<dl>
<dd>II</dd>
<dd>3. The accuracy of the definitions improved over time.</dd>
<dd>4. This was despite adjustments.</dd>
<dd>5. A number of different civilizations made them.</dd>
<dd>6. The adjustments were to serve their own purposes.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Perhaps this is a better way to say it.</p>
<p>Many systems of <a href="../../../w/e/i/Weights_and_measures.html" title="Weights and measures">weights and measures</a>, that have been used throughout history, are related. To a varying degree, despite a number of different civilisations making their own adjustments to serve their own purposes, the accuracy of definitions improved over time.</p>
<dl>
<dd>rktect 7/21/05</dd>
<dd>rather than continue to see a big sign at the top of my favorite article which says this needs attention, unless someone objects I will give it some.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would like to try and make it clear why the various systems are related</dd>
</dl>
<p>by listing equivalents to each systems units in the units of their peers rather than just modern or metric equivalents.</p>
<dl>
<dd>In the ancient world people measured things by cubits rather than feet or meters. It would be nice to see just how all the cubit systems equate when evaluated in unit fraction fingers or palms rather than just decimal feet inches or mm.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have had this in spread sheet form for a decade or so but just never bothered to try to prove it systematically.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One place I would like to pay particular attention is the definition of units of length and their development into areas.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>dividing measures up by unit and the various unit fraction multiples rather than culture might be interesting.</dd>

<dd>the Middle East and Europe. The intro seems to imply that</dd>
<dd>there be some underlying <i>theme</i>, some basic system.</dd>
<dd>What does this mean? One system can in part be based on another.</dd>
<dd>Do they share the same <i>theme</i> therefore?</dd>

<p>I am not sure what's up with this subject and with this article, but the article has now moved into a state of total chaos for anyone trying to find out who-did-what and what-can-we-trust, in addition to very bad markup in places, and so on.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is obviously that the subject at hand is most obviously open to controversy, and may I say, sometimes <i>original research</i>. Another part of the problem is the sheer amount of information, making it impossible to maintain and understand.</p>

<dd>Ro or portions are an important part of the Egyptian use of unit fractions in computing the value of weights and measures. Probably this should be fleshed out more especially as regards plowing as a point of origin for agricultural distances measured as strips of area. It would also be interesting to compare the concept of strip meassure with inscription grid. <a href="../../../f/e/d/User%7EFederal_Street_5da6.html" title="User:Federal Street">Federal Street</a> 10:26, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I would also dispute many of the statemants on this page and others about ancient metrology. I have many reasons, some of which are cited here <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_saunders_7d99.html" title="User:Michael saunders">Michael saunders</a> with sources. These pages should really be locked and removed until such time as concensus or approval can be reached. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_saunders_7d99.html" title="User:Michael saunders">Michael saunders</a> 21:48, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
