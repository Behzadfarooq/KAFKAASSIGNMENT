<p><b>Animus</b> is a Greek Art Rock Group. Members of this band are Jorgos Kouinis (Vocals, Electric Bass Guitar), Arthen (Solo and Rhythm Acoustic Guitar, Keyboards), Charis Trataris (Rhythm Acoustic Guitar, 12-Stringed Guitar) and Christos Avrilionis (Electric and Acoustic Bass Guitars). The main element that characterizes Animus as a band is their international profile. Animus compose their songs and perform live in more than 10 European languages. Animus' music combines elements of medieval and traditional European music, modern art rock and pop music as well as it is based on the introduction of classical style vocals to create a unique sound.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/i/Animus_%28band%29.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h3>
<p>The idea of starting a band had existed many years before Animus was created by some close friends studying together at the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB), namely Jorgos Kouinis, Panagiotis Spyropoulos, Antonis Palamaris and Charis Trataris. However, the concept could not come true for a lot of time, since each one of them was following his own music path and was engaged in several bands with his own creations. But the very idea of a joint band remained; it was just waiting for favourable circumstances to help it come true...</p>
<p>The first collaboration took place when Antonis, already a professional musician, asked Jorgos to participate as a singer in the band where Antonis was a member; that band was named "Peri Opis" and worked long enough in studio under this formation; they performed live in the rock club "To Onoma Tou Rodou" in January 2004. In the meanwhile, Antonis had already set to music a poem written by Panagiotis Spyropoulos; however, that song was never recorded. At the same time, Jorgos and Antonis stepped out "Peri Opis" and, for some time, Jorgos was engaged more in vocal studies rather than in a band.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the friendship between Jorgos and Arthen had not as yet ended up to any musical collaboration. Arthen was already an experienced musician, having his own music compositions, as well as many live performances in numerous bands, mainly in Corinth. Since February 2004, Arthen had proposed Jorgos to record a demo CD together, where they would present Arthen's compositions with Jorgos' voice. In the meanwhile, Jorgos had planned the recording of a demo CD with Antonis. The atmosphere was already created for a demo to be "born"; it was just a matter of time...</p>
<p>Everything began when Jorgos Kouinis composed the song "San Chtes" and presented it to Arthen, to Charis Trataris and to Antonis Palamaris. Jorgos had then the idea of a joint demo to be recorded, including Arthen's compositions, as well as Jorgos' own song; he also summoned Charis to record two songs of his own, which had impressed Jorgos from the start. Thus the "One Night Stand" Demo was created, which had been being recorded from June to August 2004 in <a href="../../../a/g/i/Agia_Paraskevi_d94f.html" title="Agia Paraskevi">Agia Paraskevi</a>. Arthen and Charis Trataris got to know each other's music through this collaboration; they immediately "stuck" together.</p>
<p>In July 2004, before the demo production was completed, Jorgos Kouinis, Charis Trataris and Panagiotis Spyropoulos agreed to create a band to perform their own songs; they would give live performances during the next winter. The band was "officially created" at the end of July 2004 in <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astypalaia.html" title="Astypalaia">Astypalaia</a> Island by Jorgos Kouinis, Charis Trataris and Panagiotis Spyropoulos. It was there the lyrics of the song "Oi Dromoi" were written on Charis' music, as a sample of joint collaboration. Thereafter, Arthen was proposed to become a member of the band and to dedicate his compositions and musical activities to the new band. Arthen immediately accepted the proposal; so the new band was "born". Antonis avoided a full time collaboration due to assumed professional obligations and Panagiotis Spyropoulos was obliged to abandon the relevant activities in September 2004 due to studies. So the band got essentially started with Jorgos, Charis and Arthen.</p>
<p>There existed compositions, as well as lots of ideas; appetite for work was great and the only thing needed was to find a name. It was Arthen who had the idea of the name "Animus"; the name was agreed upon in November 2004. It was Arthen who also drew the sign of the band. During the same period the general style of the band was decided upon, focusing mainly on Art Rock and European Music. What differentiated Animus from any other art rock band was, from the very start, their international profile. Their music has elements of Northern European art ballad, of traditional Baltic music etc., while the lyrics of the songs they perform during their live concerts are written in about ten European languages.</p>
<p>Animus began to rehearse and to collaborate as an acoustic trio in November 2004; their first live performance took place on January 23, 2005.</p>
