At the dawn of th century a reassessment of the existing cultural values began in India and stalwarts like Ram Mohan Roy, Eswara Chandra Vidya Sagar, Ranade, Dayananda Saraswathi were pioneers of the renaissance movement. In Andhra area K. Veeresalingam, Gurazada Appa Rao and others took it up. Tripuraneni Ramaswamy had been a worthy successor of the great reformers who undertook the task and strove for the spread of new ideas among Telugu speaking people.</p>
<p>Tripuraneni Ramaswamy was born on 15-01-1887 in Anagaluru village in the Krishna District of the present day Andhra Pradesh in a family of Agriculturists. Ramaswamy grew up in an agricultural background, but tempered by literary refinement. At the age of 23 he passed Matriculation Examination and in the same year he wrote two plays “Karempudi Kadanam" based on Palanadu battle and also "Kurukshetra Sangramam" based on Mahabharatha war. He joined the Noble College at Bandar in 1911 to study for Intermediate Course. In those years he displayed his literary skill and prodigious memory in his Avadhanam.</p>
<p>In 1914, he went to Britain and studied law in Dublin. There he studied not only law but also the vast English Literature and the modern European culture. After returning to India he practiced law for some years mostly in Tenali town. But his main activity was directed towards social reform. He launched a full scale attack on the caste system and the social injustice which were propagated by Smritis and Puranas and the institutionalized religion. He led the fight against social inequality and inequity.</p>
<p>He chose literary writing as the vehicle for expressing his rationalistic thought for the awakening of his people. His famous work 'SUTAPARANAM' in four cantos was a fierce attack on ancient Puranas which were powerful instruments to spread unquestioning faith among the people in custom, tradition, caste system. His inimitable logic and wide range of knowledge displayed in his works is amazing. His poetic work “Kuppuswamy Satakam" reveals the theme of Social Revolution and tells many home truths about social evils, blind faith and indignity to man. In this work he blazed the train which Vemana centuries back heralded.</p>
<p>In all his other works such as 'SAMBHUKAVADHA", "SUTHASHRAMA GEETHAALU', 'DHOORTHA MAANAVA', 'KHOONI', 'BHAGAVADGITA', 'RANA PRATAP', 'KONDAVEETI PATHANAM', he made a rational analysis of dogmas prescribed by ancient classics and the injustice done to people belonging to lower social order and attacked all the discriminating standards advocated by the Smritis. He was a fighter for the upliftment of the down trodden and the hapless.</p>
<p>Ramaswamy not only expressed his ideas in literature, he tried to put them into practice. He was against the cumbersome procedure of Hindu marriage resulting in unnecessary expenditure. He prepared a simple procedure in Telugu called,'Vivaha Vidhi", himself officiated as priest and conducted many marriages. When he was the Chairman of Tenali Municipality he did not permit animal sacrifice to appease Devatas. He fought against the Scourge of untouchability. He was reformer in thought and in practice.</p>
<p>Ramaswamy was an ardent patriot even when he was a student, he wrote a patriotic play "RANA PRATAP", which was proscribed by the British government. When he was studying law at Dublin he wrote to Krishna Patrika, a Telugu weekly appealing to Indians to support the Home Rule movement stared by Annie Beasant. He pleaded for India's independence.</p>
<pre>
Ramaswamy wrote many patriotic songs inspiring the people to great  
</pre>
<p>heights of sacrifice during the independence movement.</p>
<p>He was an ardent lover of Telugu language and culture and was proud of their history. He was an educationist and was a member of the senate of the Andhra University for three terms. He was recipient of many honors and was popularly known as 'KAVIRAJU', a title conferred on him.</p>
<p>This great revolutionary thinker and poet died in 1943 but left his imprint on the development of rational thought among Telugu speaking people.</p>

<p>Hi, just notced that you've been on Wikipedia for a long time, yet am attaching these, just in case..... --<a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 07:28, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, please read <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMoS_1f61.html" title="WP:MoS">WP:MoS</a> to understand about titles. I have reverted your changes - first of all, honorifics are not to be used in titles generally. Also, the most popular name is to be used. If he is against casteism, the same should be mentioned in the article. If he did not want to be called by the name Chowdary, it must be mentioned in the article but the article should not be moved. As a general rule, popular names are used. --<a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 18:03, 4 February 2006 (UTC) Yes. got your point. But it is a question of someone knocking off his 'ideals and values' that he stood for. Wikipedia is here to set the records straight. It is accepted when there are to be no honorifics and are adjectives to be used. But just because some had appended it, it is not right.</p>
<p>Thank you for correcting. No honorifics.Yes Sir. Genrally. What is generally may I ask? "well it depends on when was the signature from. (I guess it is from Later part of his life when he became more iconoclastic). I do agree that Ramaswamy is bigger than the narrow caste confines", was a comment left by a anon visitor to the kaviraju.blogspot.com The signature of Ramaswamy very clearly mentions the date signed. Please visit and ascertain for yourself. He himself loved to be known as a Ramaswamy (Rama's + 'swamy').Don't you think that the tarnished history should be corrected? The future generations deserve a better knowledge world.</p>
<p>When one visits Wikipedia she looks for the authenticity of the material that is present there. As you rightly pointed out, the article may, can and or should mention the fact that "he is against casteism" to quote your own words.But are we not perpetuating what others had 'imposed' on him? The records at the municipality in Town he was a chairman for three terms mentions his 'popular' name to be 'Tripuraneni Ramaswamy' not ' Ramaswamy Choudary/Chowdary".Is it enough for documentation purposes. Is it enough that one can be called by a 'nick' and chroncile her biography with that 'name'?</p>

<dd>Hi Anil, your latest move is fine, but some double re-directs need to be fixed. I guess a bot would take care of it. btw, all this discussion would not have taken place if you were clear in your edit summary that he did not want the suffix choudhary. Please see your summaries for both the moves - they only state that he was against caste system but do not say that he did not want the suffix to be used. I am appending your edit summaries for your reference.</dd>
<dd>the first edit summary when it was moved to 'KAVIRAJU'...:- (He never believed in caste system and it is unfortunate that his name is appended with a word that denotes a caste.)</dd>
<dd>the second edit summary when it was moved to the current location:- ("Kaviraju" as he is fondly called by his people never allowed himself to be restricted to his own community,an evil still in the hindu culture. As is in practice by some cutting across various segments and across communites he did not append the name of)</dd>
<dd>Another thing to note:- If the article were retained at 'KAVIRAJU'..., people would have problems in finding it because they would search for "Tripuraneni..." or even may be "Kaviraju", but never "'KAVIRAJU'". --<a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 08:04, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you "Gurubrahma'! "Another thing to note:- If the article were retained at 'KAVIRAJU'..., people would have problems in finding it because they would search for "Tripuraneni..." or even may be "Kaviraju", but never "'KAVIRAJU'". You are right again. Let it be where she can find it easily --Ramaswamy Tripuraneni. Let the bog take care of the other 'tags' I welcome your suggestions. Time is one thing that is not on my side. <a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnil_atluri_a8eb.html" title="User:Anil atluri">Anil atluri</a>Anil Atluri 12th Feb 2006</p>
