<p>Thank you for your commentary on the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Laurens_Johannes_Griessel-Landau_e9f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Laurens Johannes Griessel-Landau">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Laurens Johannes Griessel-Landau</a> page. There you recommend to "merge the event into the article". I would agree, but the problem is that <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELochdale_5ee1.html" title="User:Lochdale">User:Lochdale</a> is frequently deleting most of my edits concerning <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a>. Some months ago, I tried to reinstate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=65293626&amp;oldid=65291010" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=65293626&amp;oldid=65291010" rel="nofollow">this version</a> of the "male friendships" paragraph. But it was repeatedly removed by Lochdale. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=65636302&amp;oldid=65601460" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=65636302&amp;oldid=65601460" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=65696377&amp;oldid=65685934" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=65696377&amp;oldid=65685934" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. The same thing happened with the Griessel-Landau case, which once was part of the Elvis article. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=66364306&amp;oldid=66333271" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=66364306&amp;oldid=66333271" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. I created the Laurens Johannes Griessel-Landau article in order to solve the problem by excluding the material from the Presley page. As you are not part of the edit war, may I ask you to include the following paragraph in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley#FBI_files_on_Presley" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley#FBI_files_on_Presley" rel="nofollow">FBI files</a> section of the <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a> article, if you agree:</p>
<dl>
<dd>As Elvis was a very popular star, the <a href="../../../f/b/i/FBI_73d2.html" title="FBI">FBI</a> had files on him of more than 600 pages.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> According to Thomas Fensch, the texts from the FBI reports dating from 1959 to 1981 represent a "microcosm [of Presley's] behind-the-scenes life." For instance, the FBI was interested in death threats made against the singer, the likelihood of Elvis being the victim of <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackmail.html" title="Blackmail">blackmail</a> and particularly a "major extortion attempt" while he was in the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army.html" title="Army">Army</a> in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, complaints about his public performances, a paternity suit, the theft by larceny of an executive jet which he owned and the alleged fraud surrounding a 1955 <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corvette.html" title="Corvette">Corvette</a> which he owned, and similar things.</dd>
<dd>According to one of these accounts, Elvis was the victim of Laurens Johannes Griessel-Landau of <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johannesburg.html" title="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, who was hired by the singer in <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_Nauheim_8a12.html" title="Bad Nauheim">Bad Nauheim</a>, Germany, as an alleged specialist in the field of <a href="../../../d/e/r/Dermatology.html" title="Dermatology">dermatology</a>, but had made <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> passes at the singer and his friends. When on 24 December 1959 Presley decided to discontinue the skin treatments, Griessel-Landau endeavored to extort sums of money from the singer. According to the FBI files, Griessel-Landau "threatened to expose Presley by photographs and tape recordings which are alleged to present Presley in compromising situations." An investigation determined that Griessel-Landau was not a medical doctor. Finally, "By negotiation, Presley agreed to pay Griessel-Landau $200.00 for treatments received and also to furnish him with a $315.00 plane fare to London, England." After having "demanded an additional $250.00, which Presley paid" and a further "telephonic demand for 2,000 £ for the loss of his practice which he closed in Johannesburg", the blackmailer departed to England.</dd>

<dd>As I noted on your Talk Page, I have removed vandalized text before. You seem to get into these edit wars with numerous people based on your obsession (and that's really what it is) with Presley. Everyone is either out to get you or part of some non-existent conspiracy. This is an encyclopedia. You've made it your Wiki life's work to push your own fringe agenda regarding an entertainer. The reality is, you are going to get into these edit wars with people as long as you continue to push this agenda. <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELochdale_5ee1.html" title="User:Lochdale">Lochdale</a> 05:21, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As your contribution history clearly shows you did not remove vandalized text on 19 October. It also shows that you are primarily removing my well-sourced edits from the article. There is not a single paragraph of some significance you have written. I have not yet seen you contributing a single quote from one of the major books on Elvis. On the other hand, I have contributed much material to several important sections of the article: Elvis's youth, his music, his movies, his relationships, his male friendships, his consumption of drugs, his death, his manager Colonel Tom Parker, the allegations of racism, the Elvis cult, the FBI files on the singer, etc. etc. You can only remove passages I have written. That's the difference between us two. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnefortyone_0698.html" title="User:Onefortyone">Onefortyone</a> 17:54, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not here to "violate anything" but you seem a bit confused about some things that might save some of your time on the latest edits to the talk page on Anaheim Hills. Yes, I did get most of the information for the intro from that realtors site. He sent me an email (more like spam) a long time ago about real estate around here, and I decided to add some of the stuff from his website. The only problem was I couldnt find the email or recall the website when a "citation needed" thing was added. And the history of Anaheim Hills. The lady that does that was the chief real estate editor for Anaheim in the United Way Airline Magazine about a few months ago. In the article she had charts, and had a similar history written to describe both Anaheim and Anaheim Hills (it was an editorial on popular tourism). So, I found her website to be pretty reliable if it was in a large distribution magazine like United Way. And, I meant Charter Schools when I was describing the Distinguished School awards. I added middle school by accident, but meant charter schools in Orange County. And the weather you seem confused about. I emailed the weatherman for the OC Register, and he told me to look up the weather for Corona for Anaheim Hills when I was adding that section. He says that the two areas have almost the same weather, and in the paper, he uses the weather data for Corona as Anaheim Hills, so I added Corona as he told be was accurate. And, the DR Horton, Lasco, etc. corporations. DR Horton has its Orange County design studio located next to our Home Depot, and they serve almost all of the OC in designing a home. And the Lasco, etc are all corporations located in the Anaheim Business Center located at Santa Ana Canyon Rd. and Roosevelt Rd. in Anaheim Hills, however many of them use PO boxes in "mainland" Anaheim. Everything on the page now has merit to it, and I wish I could go back and add sources because I was dumb enough not to do that from the beginning. Please dont delete this, and know I am doing this out of the stress that this will save you when you go to clean out this page.

<p>The matter has been resolved with an apology from Yannismarou. Thanks for your time and advice. <a href="../../../n/a/y/User%7ENayan_Nev_d8e0.html" title="User:Nayan Nev">NN</a> 14:48, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for your latest message on my page. As you can see from posts by <i>Miskin</i> this issue still generates much passion. Hence I think the acknowledgement by Yannismarou that the block was wrong following assertions by you, Chris73 and Georgewilliamherbert that the stated reason WP:POINT was not valid is still a very good outcome. Not a perfect outcome but still a very good outcome. It certainly establishes the principle that admins involved in content disputes should get other admins to do blocks, which is a very good outcome. Thanks again for all your support. I am refraining from replying to posts on this matter from <i>Miskin</i> and <i>Domitius</i> as the issue is considered closed. <a href="../../../n/a/y/User%7ENayan_Nev_d8e0.html" title="User:Nayan Nev">NN</a> 00:03, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Greetings. First of all I would like to openly declare that I find the incident against Yannismaru disgraceful to wikipedia community. It only goes to show how a disruptive user, who has provoked nothing but disputes can get away with it, and also receive an apology from a well established contributor. I'm the only person who has been a regular editor in the article <a href="../../../s/p/a/Sparta.html" title="Sparta">Sparta</a> for the past few months, and also I'm the only person who has participated in the dispute with NN since the very beginning. I think it is ridiculous that I wasn't given a chance to participate before the judgement on Yannismaru was passed. Please see my comments at <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_73_0282.html" title="User talk:Chris 73">User talk:Chris 73</a> for further details. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 22:58, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. By the way you speak to me, it feels as if you have already taken your decision, and your side. Please read my messages to Chris closely, I never acted as if I were the owner of the article, nor did I ever try to stop Nayan from editing. What I tried to prevent him from doing was his <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">disruptive editing</a>, which involved removing referenced material and replacing it with POV, moving ref tags around to random positions, reverting before talking, and others. If you go through the edit history you'll find out that I actually built above his edits and never removed them unless of course he failed to cite a source. As a matter of fact, the entire "Rise and Decline" section was created after Nayan initiative, which of course began as POV-insertion. I also tried to be lenient and understanding with NN, without claiming to have been perfect, but the "new editor" argument has its limitations. The Talk page is _huge_ and I doubt that anyone took the time to read it all, which is only normal. But if anyone had done so, he would have realised how NN's sole objective was to remove a wording that he didn't like, eventhough it had been sufficiently sourced and no counter-source was <i>ever</i> presented. Frankly I don't understand how can you be so hard on Yannismaru. He did a mistake, yes, but it was a human mistake that took place during a hectic moment. I'm used to this kind of thing, that moment was so hectic that I quit discussion and refused talk to NN unless it would be under an official content-dispute process (which I pretty much still retain). And that was before the horrible one-hour block was put. And in all seriousness, you are concerned about Yannismaru not having fully understood "wp:point" and you're not concerned about all the other editors not having understood <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>?? There's a certain utility gap between the two policies which I cannot help but notice. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 23:55, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In other words, as the oldest member of the original dispute, I honestly find it ridiculous to see NN get victimised while Yannismaru gets black-listed. I've been the bluntest of all editors who opposed NN's position, but as I explained to Chris, I do this because I never compromise on a non-negotiable <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPOLICY_ce11.html" title="WP:POLICY">WP:POLICY</a> issue, especially one of such a fundamental scale. In fact I think that all editors should be like this, but people like NN and all those neutral editors who supported him, make me feel as if I'm trying to enforce a utopian practice. I repeated to Nev like 1 million times, that if he came up with <i>one</i> single counter-source, his request would become negotiable. I could not care less whether Sparta or Rome are called superpowers or supervillains, the only thing I care about is editing by the Rules, whose very existence attracts me to wikipedia in the first place. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 00:10, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your time and effort. I was not offended, I just felt bad for the one-sided criticism that was passed on Yannismaru, and not just by you, but by all the participants who got the wrong idea in the AnI. I'm not really accusing any particular editor, not even NN, what troubles me most is the inefficiency in some parts of WP. Take care. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 00:15, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're right on that, whether or not the word stays, it should be unlinked and/or preceded by "ancient" - this is the next compromise I'm willing to propose. You're also right about my fixation on the rules, but I need to feel the security of at least <i>some</i> rules (say wp:att), otherwise, I wouldn't find spending time on edits to be worth it. So in order to feel that security and make edits, I need to feel that those rules exist by protecting them at all cause. Finally, I do acknowledge Yannis' mistake, but I cannot acknowledge NN's victimisation, nor ignore his prior behaviour upon passing a judgement on Yannis. Yannismaru was after all, in an unorthodox manner, judged for his mistake, whereas NN was not. He got away with it and became victimised, which I consider extremely unfair. That is all. Regards<br />
PS: I'm not as weird as I sound on occasion. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 00:49, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Maybe RFC is not such a bad idea after all, we should give it a chance since you've already started it. I made some edits on the entry, I hope you don't mind. I'm sorry but I can't ignore NN provocations after today's episode with Yannismarou. He indirectly called me a liar in order to avoid responsibility for everything he's done so far, and who knows, maybe even get another apology. He thinks that now all WP is on his side. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 03:10, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry about that. I was going to ask for your permission but I then saw your message and I rushed on the thought that you might remove it. Already done, I took the dispute in his talk page. Of course he's going to avoid responding. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 03:31, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please take a look at how NN is dealing with my request <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Nayan_Nev#Your_fallacies_against_me" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Nayan_Nev#Your_fallacies_against_me" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. This trolling behaviour of provoking-denying-irritating has been going on for some 10 days now, non-stop, all communication between us has been on this level. You cannot imagine how tiresome this may be. I hope you have no more doubts that all this is done on purpose in order to simply irritate other editors until they're rude to him, when suddenly he's going to turn smart again and report them for something. You've already witnessed how he tried to call me a liar, now you can witness also his trolling, and maybe understand that he's not at all the victim he's been pretending to be. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 04:18, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would have nominated it, TBH. Her WP article is now the top hit on Google for her, and the next 4 are blogs or videos. The Salukis were ranked fourth in their division in the NCAA tourney and were just eliminated; no mention of Kristi was made at all. Most importantly, it's not a biographical article; it's an article about an accident, and other than that, we know nothing about Kristi as a person. I'd probably post about it on the talk page to see the reaction, but I fail to see how it doesn't meet AfD criteria. The only reason it didn't the first time was because of a knee-jerk 15 minutes of fame reaction, and the article hasn't changed substantially since the "Best Week Ever" reference a week after the accident. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 11:54, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That was the point I made all three times, and policy clearly states that people are generally not notable for accidents they were involved in. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 12:20, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know the article has been semi-protected for a long time, but an indefinitely banned user <i>just</i> edited it two days ago. Is unprotecting it really a good idea? <a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAniMate_73bc.html" title="User:AniMate">AniMate</a> 20:34, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think so. You can see that the semiprotection didn't keep the banned user from editing it. And that user's edits should be pretty easily identifyable, assuming he/she always puts in the same stuff. I've been unprotecting a lot of long-protected articles lately, in hopes of supporting the assertion that this is the encyclopedia anyone can edit. (I would appreciate extra eyes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Recentchangeslinked/User:Fang_Aili/sandbox2" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Recentchangeslinked/User:Fang_Aili/sandbox2" rel="nofollow">here</a>.) Let me know if you feel strongly about this. But it seems the article needs to be watched closely anyway.

<dl>
<dd>Just a heads up. I went a head and requested semi-protection again. Look at the history of the article... it's... it's not pretty. I agree with your intentions, but right unprotection is not realistic. <a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAniMate_73bc.html" title="User:AniMate">AniMate</a> 05:45, 2 April 2007 (UTC)
