<p>U are right. I should had looked better on what I reverted... In fact, my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pope_Benedict_XVI&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103999413" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pope_Benedict_XVI&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103999413" rel="nofollow">edit summary</a> contradicts my revert! I will be more careful next time:). btw, I think that the article should be semiprotected for some time. 88.107.146.244's edit was indeed valid, but the Pope's article is vandalized in a daily basis. <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 05:07, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's great to see that you've made yourself right at home, and your recent responses on the Spain talk page were very helpful. It's great that you've put the WikiProject tag on your user page (me too!). There's actually a "Participant" list on the front page of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Spain_e988.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Spain">WikiProject Spain</a> page, that is helpful if we all list our names there.</p>
<p>Is there anything yet about the Spain-related materials that you are particularly interested in lending a hand on? If you'd looking for a little project, I might have a suggestion or two.</p>

<p>Greetings, whoever is kind enough to answer this. A quick question on dealing with vandalism. I do a lot of cleanup of vandalized articles, but I was never clear on one thing...is it better to revert or to use the undo feature? It seems that clicking the undo button is a lot simpler, but is there a catch? Is there a benefit to going through the longer process of reverting (going to the previous good version, going into edit, and saving it...)? Seems that reverting takes longer, and could lead to an accidental revert of someone who edits the article while you're doing it. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnietor_4a7c.html" title="User:Anietor">Anietor</a> 01:58, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think there's a catch to using the 'undo' feature, and you're right, it is faster. If you accidentally revert someone's legitimate edit, you can always add it later and apologise, so it shouldn't matter that much. But I think that you should just use whichever one is easier for you and for the situation. Reverting is still useful, for example, when a vandal makes several vandalizing edits, since undoing just the last one will still leave vandalism. —<b><font face="century gothic"><a href="../../../k/e/a/User%7EKeakealani_18ec.html" title="User:Keakealani"><font color="#8100B4">Keakealani</font></a>·<a href="../../../k/e/a/User_talk%7EKeakealani_7998.html" title="User talk:Keakealani"><font color="#689C36">?</font></a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Keakealani_0c67.html" title="Special:Contributions/Keakealani"><font color="#CC5BA3">!</font></a>·<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Keakealani_cb38.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Keakealani"><font color="#5899A7">@</font></a></font></b> 02:05, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, Anietor! May I add my own welcome to Wikipedia, and my appreciation of the good work that you have already done in your short time here.</p>
<p>Given the high standard that you have set for yourself, I was surprised by your post to <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECapt_Jack_Doicy_c722.html" title="User talk:Capt Jack Doicy">User talk:Capt Jack Doicy</a>; not only its peremptory tone, but also the decision to title the post <i>sock puppet</i>. As a result of an edit dispute with Capt Jack, I have no doubt at all that he and 82.26.106.141 are one and the same. However, this is <b>not</b> sock puppetry. As the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">policy article</a> makes clear, <i>a sock puppet is an additional username used by a Wikipedian who edits under more than one name</i>. It also points out that <i>multiple accounts may have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sock_puppetry#Legitimate_uses_of_multiple_accounts" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sock_puppetry#Legitimate_uses_of_multiple_accounts" rel="nofollow">legitimate uses</a></i>. 82.26.106.141 is not a sock puppet, since it is not a named account; it is simply the IP address from which a post was made by a user who had not logged in. Obviously it is good practice to make a point of logging in before making contributions (especially contentious ones), but as far as I know it is not mandatory, and I am sure Capt Jack is not the only user who occassionally forgets to log in (I have done this myself from time to time) or assumes that it makes no difference. Certainly this can create a bad impression, but it is <b>not</b> evidence of bad faith.</p>
<p>I need hardly remind you that a suggestion that a user is employing a covert sock puppet is, in effect, an accusation of gross dishonesty. Such an suggestion should not be made unless there is compelling evidence. In this case, I would suggest that evidence is lacking: on the contrary, though Capt Jack is not my favorite editor, I would suggest that he is more notable for candour than for duplicity. Given that you have highlighted the assumption of good faith as part of your Wikipedia philosophy, you might wish to consider making an an apology.</p>
<p>You may reply here if you wish; I have added this page to my watchlist. Regards, <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Moore_309_be9c.html" title="User:John Moore 309">John Moore 309</a> 13:12, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the comments. I always appreciate feedback from other editors, especially when it helps me understand how others may interpret something I meant in a different way. I didn't intend my query to be accusatory, which is why I put it on his user page and not the discussion page of <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Benedict_XVI_f9c4.html" title="Pope Benedict XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a>, where the ongoing debate was taking place. My concern was the possibility that he was using an IP address AND his registered name to make it seem that there was more than 1 person in favor of putting the NPOV tag on the page (and to support his "Nazi-pope" rantings in the discussion page). I did research the WP guidelines on this, including the article you suggested. I disagree that an IP cannot be used for sock puppetry, however, since there is a specific tag for identifying an IP address as being suspected of the practice. I thought it would be premature to label him an abuser, or to even give his page the suspected sock puppet tag. So, I made a simple inquiry and asked him to address the issue, without notifying any administrator, tagging him, etc. If it turns out my concerns were unfounded, I would remove the post and apologize. I did label my post "sock puppet", but didn't think that would raise any alarms, again, since it was just an inquiry, not an accusation or tag. But I suppose I should realize that other people may see his user page and take away the wrong impression, so I understand your point. I will err on the side of caution (and kindness!) and change the name of the post, so he can still address the issue without the dreaded "SP" word appearing on his discussion page.

<dd>Thanks for your prompt and courteous reply. I had no way of knowing, of course, when I made my post, that you had already looked up <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">Wikipedia:Sock puppetry</a>; I am not sure that I agree with your reading, but I am not a specialist in the subject. I must also admit that my own initial reaction to Capt Jack's work was to suspect sock puppetry; it took me some time to realise that editing without logging on would produce the same effect.</dd>
