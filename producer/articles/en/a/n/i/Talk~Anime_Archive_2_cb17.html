<h2><span class="mw-headline">Too Many Errors on this page</span></h2>
<p>There needs to be organization, the anime page is a MESS. We have romanized Japanese titles mixed with English titles. I think there needs to be a system where the anime is listed as it's Japanese name, followed by romanization, and then the English title after that. It is very very confusing and unencyclopedic for it to be jumbled like this. I'd be willing to help clean this up... but I'm not going to do it all on my own... we also all need to agree to it or else trolls will just throw a fit and change things around to suit themselves. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatsukiGirl_8595.html" title="User:NatsukiGirl">natsukigirl</a> 20:17, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You may want to see the proposal towards the bottom of this talk page to split the article up and "kind of" merge it with List of anime. As far as Japanese/English titles, if there is an official licensed English title, you should use that. If a title is not licensed in an English-speaking nation (and thus has no official English language title), Japanese should be used. This is an extension of the <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">naming conventions</a>, which states "Generally, article naming should give priority to what the majority of English speakers would most easily recognize..." <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadicalBender_a5e1.html" title="User:RadicalBender">R<small>ADICAL</small>B<small>ENDER</small></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadicalBender_2a58.html" title="User talk:RadicalBender"><small>★</small></a> 20:29, September 1, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't buy that. English speakers who do not know the American titles DO EXIST (Maybe someone gave them the original title and they need to look up what the English is, or perhaps some people may be wanting to learn Japanese and be searching for the original title)... therefore the original titles should be included along with the translated title. To not do this would be unencyclopedic and is also going against the wiki NPOV. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatsukiGirl_8595.html" title="User:NatsukiGirl">natsukigirl</a> 20:33, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On the chance that someone happens to know the Japanese title but not the English title, they will search for the article directly and, in that case, we redirect original Japanese titles to the English article title counterpart (like <i><a href="../../../s/h/i/Shin_Seiki_Evangelion_bc78.html" title="Shin Seiki Evangelion">Shin Seiki Evangelion</a></i>). Otherwise, the articles are perfectly fine for featuring the Japanese title. There's no need to feature them in the list and clutter it up further. It has absolutely nothing to do with being encyclopedic or NPOV. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadicalBender_a5e1.html" title="User:RadicalBender">R<small>ADICAL</small>B<small>ENDER</small></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadicalBender_2a58.html" title="User talk:RadicalBender"><small>★</small></a> 20:57, September 1, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Still not buying it. My <i>initial</i> point was that it's jumbled up, some of the list is romanized, some is English only. There needs to be both. It doesn't matter of each individual page has all the details, the list must carry the basic titles. the ORIGINAL and the translation. Also, it's a way of confirming that you have the correct item. For example, I saw "His and Her Circumstance" on the list... and and I had to do look it up to find out it was actually "KareKano" that means that the list is unencyclopedic, NOT useful, cumbersome. The idea is to not have to jump around all over. So yea... not only should there be both, as it stand, the list is a jumble of different formats... it needs to be streamlined, regardless of what is decided. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatsukiGirl_8595.html" title="User:NatsukiGirl">natsukigirl</a> 22:23, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

No one is going to come to <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html" title="Anime">anime</a> or list of anime to find a particular anime title, so arguing about the merits of including both languages just because some titles have English titles and others have Japanese titles is moot. They will go search for the article. Don't make this article another example of poor information design by adding a bunch of superfluous information.

<dd>There's no reason for personal attacks. I can see that in the case of someone looking to see if their favorite anime is in the list, having both names helps streamline this page. However, that's not the purpose of this page - this page is for people who want to learn more about anime in general, and the list is for people who want more information on a particular genre. It is organized into genre, having one name instead of two for each title keeps it more neat, and it's informative by providing examples. As for coming up with a consistent rule for what title is used, there is one: we use the name of the Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenisMoskowitz_1bb7.html" title="User:DenisMoskowitz">DenisMoskowitz</a> 15:31, 2005 September 2 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>there's no need to exaggerate the situation. I'm simply pointing out a wikipedian who doesn't agree that everything should be NPOV. Learning more about an anime in general INCLUDES the original title for so many reasons it's appauling that no one can understand that. IT's neat, but VERY unencyclopedic to not place both names together. What is so difficault about putting the actual title next to the English translated version? since this is English Wiki, then English would naturally go first, but leaving out the original title is unencyclopedic. And for the LAST TIME, as the page is CURRENTLY it's a jumble of BOTH... some titles are romanized, some are translated... this is UNORGANIZED. Get with the program please... ugh, this reminds me why I don't like anime anymore... the fandom is just off it's nut. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatsukiGirl_8595.html" title="User:NatsukiGirl">natsukigirl</a> 16:26, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>in french the term "animation" is used too ( from the english word ) and i think the pronunciation of anime in japanese is "animé" so the source of the confusion came perhaps from the french word "dessin animé" ( "animated pictures" or animated cartoon)</dd>
<dd>The first animated cartoon was from Frenchman Émile Reynaud, who created praxynoscope, animation system of 12 pictures, and films of about 500~600 pictures, projected on its own théatre optique, system near from modern film projector, at Musée Grévin in Paris, France, the October 28, 1892. The first animated cartoon on modern picture film projector was Fantasmagorie by the French director Émile Courtet (also called Émile Cohl), projected for the first time August 17, 1908 at 'Théâtre du Gymnase', in Paris. Émile Courtet went to Fort Lee, New York near New York City in 1912 émile Courtet <a href="http://www.lips.org/bio_Cohl.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.lips.org/bio_Cohl.asp" rel="nofollow">some pictures and bio in french</a> --<a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeuromancien_cf79.html" title="User:Neuromancien">Neuromancien</a> 23:48, 30 May 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Your challenge is to find a reference in <i>English</i> that admits to adopting from the French <i>dessin animé</i> to refer to Japanese animation as <i>anime</i>. The earliest anime fan club in the US was the Cartoon/Fantasy Organization, and they called it "Japanimation." In English, <i>anime</i> get ingrained to refer to Japanese animation when rec.arts.anime got started on Usenet.</dd>
<dd>In the Japan, and more importantly in the animation industry in Japan, <i>anime</i> (アニメ) was always short for <i>animation</i> (アニメーション). If you doubt that, your challenge is to find some kind of spiritual reverence to French dessin animé, especially in early Japanese animation. Alternately, find a (preferably paper) account on the history of Japanese animation that mentions French influences. Do you need to give any legitimacy to netlore that may have no basis on literacy in Japanese or familiarity with modern Japanese history?--Outis 04:56, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I find it interesting that the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> online says this in the etymology section of the relevant "anime" entry:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>[&lt; Japanese anime &lt; French animé (in dessin animé animation, cartoon (1935 or earlier) &lt; dessin drawing (see DESIGN n.) + animé, participial adjective &lt; animer to animate: see ANIMATE v.).]</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, its source is not cited. Moreover, that is the <i>only</i> English dictionary that I can find that gives such an etymology. I have the feeling that the dictionary's etymologists got that from one of the many sources that claim "'Anime" derives from the French word for 'animation'."--<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan-Miller_0cd1.html" title="User:Ian-Miller">Ian-Miller</a> 6 May 2005</dd>

<p>In general I didn't like how the possible French origin of "anime" was referenced in the main article. It seems to me there is overwhelming evidence for the claim of an English origin and that the idea of French origin is only being discounted more and more. I removed the sentence referencing the "non-Japanese speakers" who believe in a French origin because in general I felt the claim could not be sufficiently backed up both on the basis that most people (both Japanese speakers and non-Japanese speakers) who are well-informed believe in the english origin and because the statement of "non-Japanese speakers" appeared to be a statement of fact where no evidence could be provided. In general, I thought there was a lack of evidence and probability for the whole thing, so I removed it. Please, if someone has a different perspective, I would encourage them to come forward so we can have a discussion about it. I hope you understand my perspective. --<a href="../../../x/a/l/User%7EXaliqen_c3d2.html" title="User:Xaliqen">Xaliqen</a> 21:29, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I apologize too. I didn't give the Terminology section as good of a run-through as I should have before I modified the sentence the first time.

<p>Something that might be worth noting is that the opening of most anime TV series is exactly 1:30 long. In fact, I can't name a single instance where that is not true, although I know there are cases. Even 5 minute long episodes(including opening) have 1:30 long openings, for example <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panda_Z_5001.html" title="Panda Z">Panda Z</a>... which is kind of an OVA. -- <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Nilsson_a8a2.html" title="User:Philip Nilsson">Philip Nilsson</a> 21:29, 17 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed the entire paragraph on the different production values of anime, as it is not relevant. American production values on animation vary just as much. full cell animation wasn't invented in America because the first animation wasn't, and limited-cell animation WAS invented in America, by Hanna Barberra for television animation, a novelty at the time. Disney uses full animation for their full length movies just as Miyazaki does, and Disney uses limited cell animation for TV and video-only, as Japanese companies do.--alan D</p>

<p>I'd like to propose that the list of anime be shortened to those which already have pages in the encyclopedia and those which are otherwise well-known. The current list is apparently attempting to list all of the television shows in Japan which happen to be animated. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">User:Ashibaka</a></p>

<p>"Anime became fairly popular in the Western World in the mid 1990s (many people think it is the cult-anime <a href="../../../a/k/i/Akira_%28film%29.html" title="Akira (film)">Akira</a> which triggered this) but interest quickly faded again. However, recently anime is gaining in popularity again, probably due to the recent improvements on the field of broadband internet, making anime more easily accessible to the masses. This, however, also triggered a huge increase in the illegal distribution of anime."</p>
<p>I removed this paragraph because the current resurgence in anime predates broadband. I've no qualms with the Akira part (it's removed with the rest until it can be easily reinserted) save for an exclusion of a de-facto popularity in anime in the early 1980s due to a number of dubbed anime series in the USA (robotech, starblazers, voltron, and I even saw at least one ep. of galaxy express 999) that was passed off unknowingly to a lot of kids.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I can trace the popularity of anime for several years, having been involved in the scene for quite a while (by the way, the scene has simultaneously never been better, or worse.) Anime in every video store is both a symptom and a cause of a widespread anime popularity in its current surge. I'll write more on this later.</p>

<p>Some argue that the term "hentai" should be used simply because it's used in America. However, the first key policy states that articles should be written from a neutral point of view. Why, then, is "hentai" still used when most of the bloody world, Asia in particular, uses "H"?</p>
<p>I find it amusing that you suggest "H" is outdated as a term. It's used practically all the time. "H" may not stand for hentai in the normal sense, but it most certainly does stand for "hen," or strange.

<dd>I think cowboy bebop sucked. I think Tenchi Muyo lost my attention after so many transitions and different version. I've been watching anime for the longest time. Why is cowboy bebop even part of the mainpage? I liked the fact that people added astroboy. I was hoping to see a sailormoon picture since it was one of the widely known animes on american tv including on the USA network in the 90s.</dd>

<dd>Cowboy bebop was just on tapes and then came to america on cartoon network or w/e. I think sailormoon has more importance than Bebop mainly because it has more episodes. Bebop makes a person lose interest after seeing the same scenation as, "I'm poor, i need to catch a bad guy." Wow, real great! thanks, you didn't impress me this episode. Atleast with outlaw star gene had to run from pirates or other bad guys but find a cool way to do it while have new characters introduced that actually seemed important.

<p>A certain hateful sentence is usually inserted into the text of the "Anime" article by someone at IP address 68.55.93.144. I recently fixed the irrelevancy by erasing the sentence. The sentence usually takes these forms:</p>
<p>1) The majority of these anime fans often speak of the "superiority" of Japan and bash American culture.</p>
<p>2) Many North American anime fans often speak of the "superiority" of Japan and bash American culture.</p>
<p>A reference to Japan bombing Pearl Harbor is usually added as well.</p>
<p>My idea about Japan? Japan is a bad culture and no true anime fan wants to say that. But it's true and they are all in denial. That's somewhat why I stopped studying Japanese and became more interested in China because of their soon to be superiority. --<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberman_3feb.html" title="User:Cyberman">Cyberman</a> 12:08, 10 July 2005 (UTC) Szczerbiec01 4:41 PM, July 27, 2004</p>

<p>"It is common for subsequent episodes to be completely unrelated to each other, so viewers can enjoy the show even if an episode is missed."</p>
<p>I'm not sure about this statement. What it sounds like it's saying is that the episodes in a TV series are episodic and have little to do with each other (makes me think of American sitcoms, for example). Personally, I have never experienced this, and all the anime TV shows I've watched are not in any way episodic and you do have to watch them all to get the full impact of the series. To miss one could be detrimental, because you would miss all the development (particularly in short 13 episode series). I understand that this is not true for all series, but neither is it "common." I didn't want to change it without seeing what others think, though. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatsurika_7111.html" title="User:Matsurika">Matsurika</a> 18:10, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with you Matsurika. I don't think it's particularly common for series to be episodic, although of course some series are more episodic than others (just as with television series anywhere). I don't feel that this is a detail that should even be included in the article.</dd>
<dd>Another problematic comment is this: "It is very common for one title to spawn several different releases." I would disagree that this is "very common."

I still think it's some kind of robot head, but that's another matter. The point is, if we're trying to educate about anime, the first image should be something indentifiable, like a standing character.

<p>The article for <a href="../../../w/o/n/Wonderful_Days_f6e8.html" title="Wonderful Days">Wonderful Days</a> describes its subject as "a Korean anime science fiction film".

<li>There was a term I coined called "amerime", which was anime made in the West.

<li>My understanding is that <i>anime</i> refers to a style, not a nationality (or at least it can be used that way). Are there non-anime animated films made in Japan?

<p>Think about it. "Non-anime animated film made in Japan" does not exist. Do you really need a reminder of what the word <i>anime</i> means and refers to in Japanese?--Outis 08:02, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Anime is getting close to the point where it will cross an identity boundary. At the moment, anime is a specifically Japanese art-form. However, in the near future this will change. It will change because anime will cross a certain threshold of popularity, and it will, at that pont, go from being a Japanese pop-culture phenomenon to an international pop-culture phenomenon. In certain places, this boundary may already have been crossed. The way this phenomenon will be recognized for certain will be when a non-Japanese anime-style production becomes an international pop-culture phenomenon, popular in Japan as well. I believe it is only a matter of time before this occurs. At its heart, anime is an art-form. And, like any art-form, it is ridiculous to say that only certain nations can do it. Italians, Greeks and Romans were not the only true sculptors the world has ever seen, despite their prominence during ancient times and the Renaissance. So, though it may be correct, at this moment, to say that, 'so far, anime has only come out of Japan,' it is also good to understand that, especially given the rise in popularity of the art-form internationally, this way of things will soon change. Thus, it would be better, in my opinion, to take this into consideration within the context of the article. Some might argue that, 'a haiku is not a true haiku unless it is written in Japanese.' I would say that, 'a haiku is not a haiku unless it has the heart of a haiku.' And the heart of the art-form can be composed in any language. This is how I feel about anime as well. --<a href="../../../x/a/l/User%7EXaliqen_c3d2.html" title="User:Xaliqen">Xaliqen</a> 19:46, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think to most people, anime isn't art, it's cartoons for kids, made in japan. The current 'international anime' section, is quite frankly, confusing. If we want to address the issue properly, like in the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html#International_Influence" title="Manga">Manga#International_Influence</a> section. As for a personal opinion of the current wave of american anime imitations, I think <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pastiche.html" title="Pastiche">pastiche</a> has limited scope - if the US animation industry wants to get back on track, they should try doing new and interesting things again rather than just making poor copies. --<a href="../../../z/i/p/User%7EZippedmartin_fad3.html" title="User:Zippedmartin">zippedmartin</a> 13:04, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

American, German, Korean, Chinese, and even vietamese. Japan is not the only person who creates anime, but they just started it and now everyone that enjoys anime, trys and sometimes is a succes in making more anime shows. Also I've talked to many anime fans, from all over the globe which means that anime has now become an international phenomenon. --Sumizome_queenofdarkness 10:43, 02 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Not all images used are optimal</span></h2>
<p>I think an article about visual art, which anime is, deserves a couple of very good images. Some of the currently used are not really the greatest. I'm not really a fan and I don't have much material, so I will provide just some notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The image at the top should be perfect. The particular shot used is dominated by the big reddish area in the middle. The meaning of the situation depicted is uncomprehensible. There must be some better scenes in Cowboy Beebop.</li>

<dd>That's all well and good, but without giving at least a direction to go in in terms of the types of images he'd like to see, it's rather difficult to just go out and find new things. Now, of course, this is just my opinion, but I believe the criticism would be more constructive if there were some well-laid-out suggestions as to what should be done, and perhaps the specific types of images newcomers to the article would like/expect to see. Personally, I'd be happy to go and find some new images, but without some kind of suggestion, I'm not very motivated to. --<a href="../../../x/a/l/User%7EXaliqen_c3d2.html" title="User:Xaliqen">Xaliqen</a> 18:33, 3 May 2005 (UTC)

<p>Hey, the new mecha still is nice. It gives some idea about what are some animes like. The other image above also seems appropriate, and there is no other image in this style on the page.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Massive lists of anime in the 'Notable works' section</span></h2>
<p>It's not to the point of being too large yet, but every day the lists of popular and ground-breaking anime grows a little larger. I think the possibility of the lists growing to be massive and unwieldy should be a concern. When I was concerned about this possiblity in the listings of popular manga in the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">Manga</a> article, I made some instructions that the examples should be limited in number and be good examples of the genre. I don't know if something similar would be helpful here, but I think some sort of guidelines would be useful. Now, not everyone followed the instructions 'to-the-letter' in the Manga article, but this isn't really the point. The point is just to keep things down to a reasonable size so things don't get out of hand. --<a href="../../../x/a/l/User%7EXaliqen_c3d2.html" title="User:Xaliqen">Xaliqen</a> 00:57, 5 May 2005 (UTC) Maybe if there were a seperate article or articles some of the listings could be placed into that would be a better way to handle things.

<dd>I've made various deletions as a fresh look at the lists, though I'm sure people will continue adding their favourites when they don't seen them there.

<p>It's important to note as well that just because an anime is popular (or main-stream) it doesn't denote by any means that it's sophisticated or complex, or that it should be in the same league as ones that are. For example, we wouldn't liken Dr. Seuss with Shakespeare, or imply they are the same caliber just because one may enjoy an equal or greater popularity than the other. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EEreinion_4e78.html" title="User:Ereinion">Ereinion</a><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:RAHSymbol.JPG">Image:RAHSymbol.JPG</a> 05:23, May 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed, and I may be wrong, but I don't think anyone was specifically implying that popular works are always dusted with an aura of genius. At the same time, it is good to keep in mind that many popular works are good representative examples of anime as a whole and that, I believe, would be the primary reason they would be listed in the article. Naturally, the truly original works that may not always be as popular are extremely important, but making the distinction between what is more on the fringe versus what is more mainstream is important in the context of the article. So, I am fully supportive of a recognition of original works that may not receive as much fan support, but I also think these things need to be placed in proper context. --<a href="../../../x/a/l/User%7EXaliqen_c3d2.html" title="User:Xaliqen">Xaliqen</a> 08:20, 14 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>In my mind, the list-of-anime is there as an attempt to present a representative cross section of choronology and style. I think it's important both to have what might be considered 'ground breaking' works, and 'well known in the west' titles. I see Xaliqen has been continuing the much needed clean up, I don't agree with all of it but it's going in the right direction. But... er... could you edit a bit more at once? atm the history reads like the talk page...&#160;:D --<a href="../../../z/i/p/User%7EZippedmartin_fad3.html" title="User:Zippedmartin">zippedmartin</a> 10:54, 14 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, I'm sorry about that. I just wanted to edit one small thing and then I started realizing other things and it kind of went on like that for awhile. I was thinking what might be ideal is to have a number of sub-headings for various genres and then have a limited number of anime titles under each (say three, or whatever number people decide is best). I don't think my edits were perfect, but I think being more precise with the sub-headings and having less titles overall will increase the usefulness of this section in the long-term. In any case, let me know if you think this is a good strategy or if we should try doing something else. I realize some of the changes I made may be more controversial. I know especially there may be those who believe Samurai Champloo has a right to be placed under the Samurai-era sub-heading at this point. The reasons I decided to remove that title specifically were, among other things, that it has only been out for about a year and its place among the annals of the history of the development of anime has not yet been firmly established in my opinion. I'm not disputing that it may very well be a very influential anime, but at this point in time I think it's still too new to make this determination. Please, if anyone has any concerns and or criticisms regarding my edits specifically, then I am always open to hearing them. I simply make edits that I think may work better for the present moment and I am by no means perfect in doing so. --<a href="../../../x/a/l/User%7EXaliqen_c3d2.html" title="User:Xaliqen">Xaliqen</a> 02:33, 15 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, it's certainly an improvement. I'm not overly worried about Champloo not being in, I removed various other titles for being 'to recent', does mean the 'samurai section' is a little bare.

I know that, for some, SDK might not be seen as the greatest example, but I feel it did bring certain new and original elements to the genre. This, combined with its popularity, made me feel it was appropriate to list it.

<dd>Whoops, did I not respond to this?

<dd>Kazemakase Tsukikage Ran is a recent, well-done, original Samurai-era series, and not a bad introduction to the genre - imho at least. If SDK is just a Kenshin clone, I'd be inclined to switch it to KTR until something better comes along.

<p>It occurs to me, what with the list/inclusion thing, that the main problem will be dealing with categorization and placement of titles. Especially with cases like Watanabe, who is always trying to merge genres to create new ones (which has never really sat right with me anyway). An example would be Samurai Champloo, like Xaliqen mentioned earlier. I think we'll have to come up with a way to properly catalog these new styles in a way that will be both functional and true. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EEreinion_4e78.html" title="User:Ereinion">Ereinion</a><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:RAHSymbol.JPG">Image:RAHSymbol.JPG</a> 02:49, May 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">International anime section (now removed)</span></h2>
<p>I think this should really be a seperate article at this point. Rather than listing a bunch of examples of anime and anime-influenced works made outside of Japan, an article could be more in depth. As it stands, I think the list of International Anime only adds complexity and size to the already-too-large lists of anime. It's safe to say that, when most people visit the anime article at this point, they're looking for anime made in Japan. I propose cutting this section out of the current article and creating a new "International anime" article that can go into greater depth on the subject-matter. Perhaps there could be a link to the article somewhere close to the current list section. Though I believe that anime will, at some point, become a truly international phenomenon, the fact of the matter is that, when people speak of anime today, they are speaking of anime that is produced in Japan. --<a href="../../../x/a/l/User%7EXaliqen_c3d2.html" title="User:Xaliqen">Xaliqen</a> 23:04, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Kodomo" and <i>Howl's Moving Caste</i></span></h2>
<p>To explain my earlier edits, I added a <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macron.html" title="Macron">macron</a> to the "kodomo" words in the article because it seemed like the right thing to do. Only later is that I noticed that's not the way the romanization is done. That last syllable is indeed stronger, but it's not a oo/ou case. I had forgotten that. I would have corrected that today, but someone did it first. Sorry.</p>
<p>As for adding <i><a href="../../../h/o/w/Howl%27s_Moving_Castle_801a.html" title="Howl's Moving Castle">Howl's Moving Castle</a></i> to the Ghibli category, it seemed perfect fine to me. I didn't knew that everything added to "Popular recent anime" has no place on their correct category. I actually think that should be re-thought. Doesn't make much sense to me, and I think that everyone to sees that has an uncontrollable urge to add those animes to the categories they belong, instead of just that one.--<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackeriv_619c.html" title="User:Mackeriv">Kaonashi</a> 20:55, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To be honest, the whole idea of the "Popular recent anime" section has been called into question. I stand by my sentiments that, in order to truly be notable, an anime must find its place in history and this really takes a few years to happen. Despite the fact that Howl's Moving Castle is a Ghibli work and almost every Ghibli film ends up being notable in some way, I believe it should still go through the process like all of the other titles. It's the same idea of listing notable media under any topic. It would be inappropriate to add "War of the Worlds," for instance, to a list of notable movies just a year after it's been released. This is because it will really not have found its place in film history by then. However, listing it under a "popular recent movie" category would most likely be fine. In any event, that's my perspective. --<a href="../../../x/a/l/User%7EXaliqen_c3d2.html" title="User:Xaliqen">Xaliqen</a> 19:56, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Angie, thanks for responding here (remember to sign with ~~~~). I think it's fair to say that many modern comic book artists and animators in america have been pretty heavily influenced by 'the anime style', and it's relevant to mention that in those articles. However the issue here is what's appropriate to 'forward link' from the anime article.</dd>
<dd>Looking at a parrallel example, the <a href="../../../u/k/i/Ukiyo-e.html" title="Ukiyo-e">Ukiyo-e</a> woodblock prints of the <a href="../../../e/d/o/Edo.html" title="Edo">Edo</a> period had a pretty big influence on many later artists in the west, I'm not an art historian, but just checking <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Ukiyo-e_8509.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Ukiyo-e">what links there</a> you'll see <a href="../../../g/u/s/Gustav_Klimt_283b.html" title="Gustav Klimt">Gustav Klimt</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgar_Degas_bbe1.html" title="Edgar Degas">Edgar Degas</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Gauguin_2d24.html" title="Paul Gauguin">Paul Gauguin</a>. Looking at the article itself though, you'll see that's only mentioned in one sentence near the end.</dd>
<dd>So, while some sort of content about what influence anime has had on other popular culture around the world is relevant, rather than placing it near the top of the article in a section about how disney influenced Tezuka and later work, it should probably be living in it's own section, and encompassing rather more than just Vasquez. Both Xaliqen and I have opted out of actually starting it, though... Feel free to try, but I'd reccomend a little research outside your zim hobby before trying. --<a href="../../../z/i/p/User%7EZippedmartin_fad3.html" title="User:Zippedmartin">zippedmartin</a> 28 June 2005 23:35 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A Little Change</span></h2>
<p>Hi! I changed the article under "Terminology" a little, saying that in Japan, manga refers ONLY to comics. I have lived in Japan for eight years, so I am sure the information is correct.</p>
<ul>
<li>The term manga is used primarily for the print medium, but it has been historically used to describe animation as well. For example, the very first Japanese animated television series was 1962's <i>Fairy Tale Manga Calendar</i>. Even now, some in the older generations of Japan still refer to Disney films as manga because the earliest Disney animated films and the term manga predate the Japanese use of the terms "anime" and "comic." This is roughly similar to how animation was initially called "cartoons" in English after their printed predecessors (and are still called that today). Egan Loo 20:47, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well in this case, I was the person who added it, and I'd be happy to argue it's merit here with you on this page. There appeared to be no precendent set or concensus that all new links be brought up in here first, so I followed the <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">be bold</a> guideline. What I meant by "popular enough" was a very active community forum, there is over 400 posts per day on the site in question. The bulk of those posts are users trading unlicensed anime, and it is by far not a start-up site looking for a free link, this forum has been a part of the internet anime comunity since 1998. A recent setback two years ago forced a complete loss of all data and they had to restart the site from scratch again. The ownership has taken steps to insure its continued survival into the future buy setting up some revenue generating sections, however these don't seem to be doing very well, the primary use of the site is the forum and torrent database (where only unlicensed titles remain listed). Just because you prefer one site over another does not make this one unpopular or mention of it unwarranted. Observe the experimental <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinkBot_bb26.html" title="User:LinkBot">User:LinkBot</a> plucked noated out of the search engines as a <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinkBot_suggestions_Anime_9524.html" title="User:LinkBot/suggestions/Anime">reccomended link</a> for this very page in <a href="../../../d/e/c/December.html" title="December">December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, barely a month after I included it last year and someone removed it, citing it was advertising. --68.209.108.64 21:42, 23 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Hi! It's really nice of you to drop in to discuss the addition of this link. <small><i>There appeared to be no precendent set or concensus that all new links be brought up in here first, so I followed the <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">be bold</a> guideline.</i></small> However, there has been a definite trend towards distrust to new links because of persistent linkspam that plagues this page. <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links</a>. <small><i>The bulk of those posts are users trading unlicensed anime, and it is by far not a start-up site looking for a free link, this forum has been a part of the internet anime comunity since 1998.</i></small> However, there's nothing that distinguishes it from the big players (i.e. <a href="../../../a/n/i/AnimeSuki_2f37.html" title="AnimeSuki">AnimeSuki</a>, which even has its own Wikipedia article). <small><i>Observe the experimental <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinkBot_bb26.html" title="User:LinkBot">User:LinkBot</a> plucked noated out of the search engines as a <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinkBot_suggestions_Anime_9524.html" title="User:LinkBot/suggestions/Anime">reccomended link</a> for this very page in <a href="../../../d/e/c/December.html" title="December">December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, barely a month after I included it last year and someone removed it, citing it was advertising.</i></small> I'm sorry, but you have it wrong. LinkBot, while scanning a version of the page that had this link before it was removed as linkspam, simply had a link suggestion about a phrase near the Noated link, and thus Noated was inadvertently included in the page. — <span style="font-variant:small-caps;font-family:sans-serif;"><a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbush_Commander_08e2.html" title="User:Ambush Commander">Ambush Commander</a></span><sup style="font-family:serif;">(<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbush_Commander_60e0.html" title="User talk:Ambush Commander">Talk</a>)</sup> 01:44, August 24, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>To add to Ambucom comments above, has an alexa rank an order of ten times lower than the other external links we have, and no novel content. As for the 400 posts per day, I note that a lot of these are in <i>Automated live feeds</i> forums, the general 'Anime Discussions' forum has only ~5,000 posts, compare that to ~100,000 on the ANN one - or smaller sites ~20,000 on Anime Planet, and even ~40,000 on Christian Anime Alliance (a site nearly worth including for having <a href="http://www.christiananime.net/showthread.php?t=4946" class="external text" title="http://www.christiananime.net/showthread.php?t=4946" rel="nofollow">the funniest thread</a> on any anime forum). In summary - noated is just not any more noat-able than all the other content-farm sites around. Sure, there's info on there, but it's just cribbed from other sites, and the traffic isn't as high as the animesuki, which is the only other content-farmer we have at the moment. --<a href="../../../z/i/p/User%7EZippedmartin_fad3.html" title="User:Zippedmartin">zippedmartin</a> 02:04, 24 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You should look at the alexa ranking for <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=noated.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=noated.com" rel="nofollow">noated.com</a> then, as explained previously some time back noated hit a problem and had to start over again, the domain name changed at that time to noated.net due to a domain ownership issue. Noated.com is where you'll find the alexa hits, which, by my assesment outweigh AnimeSuki's by far. Whatever though, this isnt' personal for me, I was justr trying to too a good deed, for a good site. You guys can remove the links and promote whatever your favorite places are all you like. --68.209.108.64 03:38, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I should also note that the majority of the posts on the site are not automated feeds, the marjority of them are file trading type posts. I believe work is being done to give more areas and motivation for discussion of various anime topics in the near future, but as you have AnimeSuki listed (which is mostly file sharing) with 1/400th of an Alexa ranking, I hardly think there being a high volume of traffic there trading files excludes it from inclusion here. --68.209.108.64 03:46, 24 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Smaller is better on alexa, as a comparison google has a rank of <i>3</i>. Personally I think suki is useless as well, but as you point out, it does have a vastly lower alexa ranking than noated. --<a href="../../../z/i/p/User%7EZippedmartin_fad3.html" title="User:Zippedmartin">zippedmartin</a> 03:51, 24 August 2005 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Notable Works/Notable Names Article Split Proposal</span></h2>
<p>I would like to propose that it is time that we start considering that the Notable Works section be split into a new article separate from the overall anime article. For this I would like to submit the following justifications for consideration:</p>
<ul>
<li>The current article is over 42Kb long, which exceeds the recommended Wikipedia conventions; removal of the Notable Works would reduce the article size by approximately 11Kb, which would bring the overall article down to approximately 31Kb</li>
<li>The section leads to the anime article being excessively long, with approximately 4-5 pages of information being nothing more than the Notable Works</li>
<li>The section is one of the more edited parts of the article and is subject to a good deal of controversy as to what is in fact a notable work, and what is just a popular series.</li>
<li>A dedicated page would be conducive to better discussion of what should be on the page and what needs to be removed</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see there is a very good technical reason for such a split to occur, and it would also contribute to the overall flow of the article making it feel less "list like" and allow for more detail to be put into some other sections. - <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkstar949_7f19.html" title="User:Darkstar949">darkstar949</a><a href="../../../d/a/r/User_talk%7EDarkstar949_e867.html" title="User talk:Darkstar949">(talk)</a> 1428, 23 August 2005 CST</p>

<dd>On second thought, maybe we should move the Notable Names in anime section too... even though it isn't as big, it certainly is list-like. — <span style="font-variant:small-caps;font-family:sans-serif;"><a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbush_Commander_08e2.html" title="User:Ambush Commander">Ambush Commander</a></span><sup style="font-family:serif;">(<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbush_Commander_60e0.html" title="User talk:Ambush Commander">Talk</a>)</sup> 19:36, August 23, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree, a split is not the solution. What's needed is enough actual article content so those sections could be removed entirely. As a split list, List of notable anime is against guidelines, and would probably be vfd-ed. --<a href="../../../z/i/p/User%7EZippedmartin_fad3.html" title="User:Zippedmartin">zippedmartin</a> 21:14, 23 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>However, as it stands now the section is a major problem for the article and is causing the "list like" feel. Perhaps a better idea may be to limit the section to "Ground Breaking" anime that both won awards and created a new concept within anime. - <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkstar949_7f19.html" title="User:Darkstar949">darkstar949</a><a href="../../../d/a/r/User_talk%7EDarkstar949_e867.html" title="User talk:Darkstar949">(talk)</a> 1623, 23 August 2005 CST
<dl>
<dd>I'd suggest what needs to be done is the writing of prose that explains why certain work is 'notable', thereby making the list redundant. Huge task though, and not one I'm going to be attempting in the very near future. --<a href="../../../z/i/p/User%7EZippedmartin_fad3.html" title="User:Zippedmartin">zippedmartin</a> 21:32, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I have done some looking around and we already have some pages such as the List of anime, which should be VfD-ed, however, if we rewrote the Notables where each entry had to have at least a sentience justifying it's inclusion on the list it would avoid being VfD-ed. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkstar949_7f19.html" title="User:Darkstar949">Darkstar949</a> 18:41, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>If we were to limit the amount of works to be mentioned it could free up enough space to create a run-down explaination of why each anime is indeed notable, and what makes it so significant. It doesn't have to be something grandiose, just something to clean it up. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EEreinion_4e78.html" title="User:Ereinion">Ereinion</a> 23:06, August 24, 2005 (UTC)</p>
