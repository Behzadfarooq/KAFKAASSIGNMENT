<p><b><a href="../../../p/l/a/Planetes.html" title="Planetes">Planetes</a></b> (Ancient Greek: ΠΛΑΝΗΤΕΣ (Wanderers), Japanese Katakana: プラネテス, puranetesu) is a manga by Makoto Yukimura and a 26-episode anime of the same name, that was produced by Sunrise and broadcast on NHK in Japan from October 2003 through April 2004. The story revolves around a team of space debris collectors based in the debris ship Toy Box in the year 2075.</p>
<p>The manga is published in English by TOKYOPOP and it retains its right-to-left format. The anime has been licensed for US and Canadian distribution by Bandai Entertainment.</p>
<p>The story of <i>Planetes</i> follows the crew of the <i>DS-12 "Toy Box"</i> of the Space Debris Section, a unit of Technora Corporation. Debris Section's pupose is to prevent the damage or destruction of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satellite.html" title="Satellite">satellites</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_station.html" title="Space station">space stations</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spacecraft.html" title="Spacecraft">spaceships</a> from collision with debris in <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a>'s and the <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon.html" title="Moon">Moon</a>'s orbits.

<p>The episodes sometimes revolve around debris collection itself, but more often the concept of collecting "trash" in space is merely a storytelling method for building character development. The members of the Debris Section are looked down upon as the lowest members of the company and they must work hard to prove their worth to others and accomplish their dreams.<br clear="all" /></p>

<p><i>Spirited Away</i> was released in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> in July 2001, drawing an audience of around 23 million and revenues of 30 billion <a href="../../../y/e/n/Yen.html" title="Yen">yen</a> (approx. $250 million <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_dollar_db5c.html" title="United States dollar">US</a>), to become the highest-grossing film in Japanese history (beating <i><a href="../../../t/i/t/Titanic_%281997_film%29.html" title="Titanic (1997 film)">Titanic</a></i> (1997)). It was the first movie to have earned $200 million at the worldwide box office before opening in the United States. <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/02/03/DDGHFB40EG1.DTL" class="external autonumber" title="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/02/03/DDGHFB40EG1.DTL" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> By 2002, a sixth of the Japanese population had seen it.</p>
<p>The film won the <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_136f.html" title="Academy Award">Oscar</a> for <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_for_Best_Animated_Feature_b83a.html" title="Academy Award for Best Animated Feature">Best Animated Feature Film</a> at the 75th Annual <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_136f.html" title="Academy Award">Academy Awards</a> ceremony in 2003, and it has received numerous other awards.</p>
<p>In the movie, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chihiro_%28Spirited_Away%29_52eb.html" title="Chihiro (Spirited Away)">Chihiro Ogino</a> is a little girl who is moving to a new town with her parents, Akio and Yuko (<i>Yūko</i>). She is clearly unhappy about the move and appears rather petulant. They lose their way and come across a tunnel, and out of curiosity enter it, unaware that it actually provides access into a spirit world—specifically, to a spirit <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sento.html" title="Sento">bathhouse</a>, where the <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kami.html" title="Kami">spirits</a> and gods (drawn from the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shinto.html" title="Shinto">Shinto</a> religious tradition) go to rest and relax.</p>
<p>It is often commented that the film constitutes an allegory on the progression from childhood to maturity, and the risk of losing one's nature in the process. The main character's development in the setting could also be seen as a sullen, spoiled and very modern Japanese ten-year-old being forced to grow up when faced with more traditional Japanese culture and manners. A separate understanding holds that the film is based on the prevention of greed: those swallowed by No-Face were attempting to receive the gold he made.<br clear="all" /></p>

<p>Set in a universe where men and women are completely segregated (on completely different planets, Mejare by the women, Tarak by the men), the gender wars are more than just a metaphor.</p>
<p>Hibiki Tokai, a 3rd class laborer, takes up a bet to steal a high-tech humanoid robot, known as a Vanguard, from the male attack force about to fight the "evil females". Caught onboard when it takes off, the ship is rapidly attacked and all males evacuated, with the exception of Hibiki, Duelo McFile, and Bart Garsus. Stuck onboard the damaged warship with female pirates all around, things seem to have hit an all time low until the retreating males fire a rather large torpedo at the ship to prevent it from falling into women's hands. The core of the ship, a mysterious crystalline entity, protects itself by eradicating the missile, forming a wormhole sending the pirates and warship to a distant sector, and fusing the large warship with the female craft. This results in a quirky ship with very smooth lines, a host of technical problems, which episodes are often aimed at solving, and various hidden capabilities that become apparent in later episodes. The "Vanguard" Hibiki attempted to steal has also been altered along with three of the women's fighters, known as Dreads, allowing the separate ships to combine. The fusion of Hibiki's mech with one of the fighters is called a <i>Vandread,</i> the title mecha of the series.<br clear="all" /></p>

<p>The series is centered on the antics of Yotsuba Koiwai (see characters, below), a five year old adopted girl who is energetic, cheerful, curious, strange and quirky; so strange and quirky in fact, that even her own father calls her a weirdo. She is also completely ignorant about a large number of things one would expect a child of her age to know about, among them doorbells, escalators, and even playground swings. This not only adds to her weirdness, but also allows for humorous stories where she first learns about and/or misunderstands these everyday things. She and her adoptive father, Koiwai, have recently relocated to a new neighborhood with the help of Koiwai's best friend, an impressively tall man nicknamed Jumbo. Yotsuba makes quite an impression on the neighboring Ayase family's three daughters Asagi, Ena, and Fuka, whose interactions with her often lead to hilarious misadventures.</p>
<p>Though there seems to be no central plot, the main focus of the manga story is purely Yotsuba's voyage of discovery. Within that process, the reading audience is on the same voyage to discover more about the characters, especially Yotsuba. Each chapter has a prevalent theme or object pertaining to its title. This theme is often Yotsuba discovering something for the first time, or other characters dealing with and reacting to her discoveries.</p>
<p>"<i>Yotsuba to&#160;!</i>" means "<i>Yotsuba and&#160;!</i>", which comes from the fact that the title of nearly every chapter/issue of the manga is of the form "Yotsuba and something". The name "<i>Yotsuba</i>" (四葉) can be translated as "<i>four leaves</i>," and is part of the phrase 四葉のクローバー <i>yotsuba no kurōbā</i> ("<a href="../../../f/o/u/Four-leaf_clover.html" title="Four-leaf clover">four-leaf clover</a>"). In reference to this fact (or perhaps because of it), Yotsuba has four ponytails and green hair.<br clear="all" /></p>

The series begins on a light comedic tone (most of the early episodes are about schemes to rejuvenate the bathhouse), and deepens somewhat as it explores the evolving relationship between Mayuko and NieA, but the overall ending is upbeat. The series touches lightly upon issues of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discrimination.html" title="Discrimination">discrimination</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereotypes.html" title="Stereotypes">stereotypes</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alienation.html" title="Alienation">alienation</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assimilation.html" title="Assimilation">assimilation</a>.

NieA, who is apparently placed in an inferior class by her fellow aliens, immediately accuses anyone who calls her a 'stupid no-antenna' or the like of discrimination. Another alien adopts stereotypical <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">Indian</a> dress and opens a convenience store. This theme of the comic alien is carried through in the brief live-action sequence which ends each episode, "Dalgit's Tidbit of Indian Information." which is in a foreign language and must be subtitled if you want to read it.</p>
<p>NieA_7 is based on a <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doujinshi.html" title="Doujinshi">doujinshi</a> by graphic designer <a href="../../../y/o/s/Yoshitoshi_ABe_96ba.html" title="Yoshitoshi ABe">Yoshitoshi ABe</a> and published by Kadokawa Shoten.
