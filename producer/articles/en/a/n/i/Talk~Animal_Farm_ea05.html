<p>"However, he [Snowball] is far from perfect and agrees in the uniting of the apples by the pigs. This suggests that had Snowball triumphed the outlook for the animals would have been not much better under his leadership than Napoleon's"</p>
<p>...the incident does indeed indicate that Snowball/Trotsky was not perfect regarding the temptation to exploit party status for material self-interest, and helps establish Snowball as an imperfect personality, avoiding depicting his conflict with Napoleon/Stalin as a simplistic good guy vs. bad guy arrangement. That aside, the book very strongly suggests that the farm would have been much better off had Snowball been able to retain power. That's my impression, anyway; it'd be rather POV to put such a thing in the text. Much like the second sentence above, wherein someone's personal opinion somehow snuck in there.</p>
<p>OK to nix? Or does mainstream critical analysis of the book actually suggest that Snowball would have been just as bad a leader as Napoleon? What I've read suggests quite the contrary; will edit that bit in a week or so unless someone talks me out of it.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Since I'm not reading any objections on this here discussion page, I've gone ahead and tweaked that point in the interest of sustaining NPOV.

<p>I really think the note about <i>interpreting</i> "ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL… BUT… " should be removed. To use <i>either</i> MORE or LESS when talking about EQUALITY is an absurdity.

<dd>"ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL, BUT SOME ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS" is supposed to be ironic and absurd. The point is most of the animals are so stupid, they don't recognize the saying as being strange.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The idea is that they, the pigs, have such a great control over the animals that they can change the rules and a)the other animals won't even notice the change, and b)they can slowly take over the other animals by using logical fallacies to convince them.</dd>

<p>Well, yeah... I don't doubt it's most possible purpose, and I don't deny George Orwell might've thought of humour in that grim situation of the Animals, but...sometimes...it has other - double, perhaps - meaning's, aswell. To interpret what it would directly mean can be interesting to some, even if makes no apparant sense. Any attempt to make it a useful statement I'm willing to give a shot, but I won't care. It's atleast nothing logical, and still just pointless propaganda (And any philosophing on it being anything but unsincere) in my ears.

<p>Gotta look it up in a day or so, but Orwell wrote a letter to his publisher when "Animal Farm" was in the last stages of preparation for press, asking him if he could change some detail sentence, about Snowball's precise location in some point in some battle, as "I have found out that Trotsky was probably not in [thus-and-such-place during thus-and-such incident]." I hadn't realized this myself, but obviously Orwell intended it to have a very detailed relationship to history, and only my ignorance of the history of the Soviet Union prevented me from realizing it.</p>
<p>There's also some letter to a publisher in which he says, in reference to <i>Animal Farm,</i> something like "I'm working on something now but it is so not OK politically that Gollancz will never accept it..."</p>
<p>As I say, details when I have time to look them up. They're all in the Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters.--<a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> 16:30, 11 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Orwell subtitled his novel "A Fairy Story". If he didn't want to veil it he would never have given such a subtitle (Does it read like a fairy story to you?). It is meant to mislead the authorities but not others.</dd>

<dd>Animal Farm was a book by George Orwell. It was a classic and should not be compared to the movie. Since the book was so good (yes I said it), the movie had much to live up to and Hollywood decided the movie would be better with a head of the guard. Regardless, I find it to be insulting that a synopsis of the book is criticized because there was no inclusion of something about the movie in an article about a movie. Thank you, modern America, for producing people who do not celebrate or recognise great originality.</dd>

<p>There's a whole section like this that reads like it was written by a high schooler, including the line "Mr. and Mrs. Jones went home and got it on."</p>
<p>While I've not seen the movie and have no reason to doubt that this happened, that doesn't seem to be very "encyclopedic".</p>
<p>Also it's written in a first person point of view, with a lot of "I" statements, as in, "I didn't include them all, so if you know of any others, go ahead and add them."</p>
<p>I personally see little to no redeeming value in this section whatsoever and, at the very least, should be rewritten to something appropriating more professional language.--159.121.130.84 12:44, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well? First of all, let's not take any extreme choichepoints here. (Heh! New word invented.) Section-removal, yaddah, yaddah. Hey! What's so wrong 'bout school report's anyways? It depends on how you read between the lines. Although I know the sex-lingo "Get it on"....Be prepared that it might've been literally. To get something on. And if you think that's dirty-meanin'..well, it depends...it doesn't necessarily mean the author thought so, but the reader. Stop thinkin' "briefcase". Pretend that it's not. And if they did ('Get it on'), it's a fact, who cares about the phrasing? Oh yeah, go ahead, write "sexual intercourse". I'll laugh my arse off over this academic quabbling.

<p>The claim that the movie was true to the book looks very POV to me. The movie explicitly rejects Old Major's teaching, which the book does not do. In the book, the animals wind up as bad off under the pigs as they were under Mr. Jones. The movie, on the other hand, has a happy ending with new human owners taking over the farm, bringing back the "good old days". It's not at all true to the book.--RLent 21:21, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since I first read Animal Farm in High School, I've always wondered whether there was some hidden significance to the similarity in the meter of the Animals Anthem <b>Beasts of England</b> and the <a href="../../../d/a/s/Das_Lied_der_Deutschen_3057.html" title="Das Lied der Deutschen">German National Anthem</a> (Once known as Deutschland Über Alles).</p>
<p>Without too much strain, the meters do match. You do have to spread some of the syllables (Such as the 'aw' sound in trod and the 'ah' in alone) out over several notes, but that is not uncommon in music.</p>

<i>Beasts of England, beasts of Ireland,</i> 
<i>Beasts of every land and clime,</i> 
<i>Hearken to my joyful tidings</i> 
<i>Of the golden future time.</i> 

<i>Soon or late the day is coming,</i>

<i>And the fruitful fields of England</i>

<p>I did Animal Farm as a set book about 1962 - it was presented to us then as a <i>very close</i> allegory of the events in Soviet Russia (E.g. the Socialism in One Country vs World Revolution debate). And contrary to the intro to the present article Orwell was not a CP-Sympathiser for most of his life . He witnessed aspects of the CP-Behaviour in the Spanish Civil War which made him suspicious of the Moscow-directed CP. He was a good old fashioned thinking British leftie :-) Suggest we amend the silly last sentence in the intro.--<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxlad_bd3a.html" title="User:Linuxlad">Linuxlad</a></p>
<p>I think the book was merely a distrust of some Communist's genuine-ness in helping people, not the ideology of Communism itself. Of course, Capitalists like to twist this book, well around their fingers, and use it against Leftist's. The book was more about a farm led by a man called Jones Manor, that was overthrown by the Animal's, obviously enough, and they succeed, as was foretold by an old pig called "Old Major". The leaders of the revolution were "Napoleon" and "Snowball". Not giving away too much here, but some of them succeed more than the other in the long-run, and although keen propaganda and cunningness, one has to go. Read it.--<a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleMaster_fbc4.html" title="User:OleMaster">OleMurder</a> 21:13, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>(Er, thanks...) The identification of the characters presently quoted in the text is pretty standard, (and more or less as I remember it from a 1960s 'gloss') but not totally above contention - have we got a _reference_ for the version in the WP article?? (Especially the slightly POV statements on how much Mr. Blair really loved Mr. Marx greatly - which may well be true for all I know...)--<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxlad_bd3a.html" title="User:Linuxlad">Linuxlad</a></p>

<p>However, Reed's critique, a concentration on the contrasts of capitalism and socialism, fails to recognize the book's message of the corruption of the ideals of the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Revolution_of_1917_c160.html" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Russian Revolution</a> and the progressive subversion of the ideals of Lenin (Old Major) and Trotsky (Snowball) by Stalin (Napoleon). The humans (capitalists, <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascists</a>, and the tsar) are in no way portrayed sympathetically. Nevertheless, the book was released at a time when Stalin was widely admired by portions of the Western Intelligentsia, partly because the Soviet Union had suffered less from the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> than most <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_countries.html" title="Western countries">western countries</a>, and because Stalin had led the Soviet Union in the successful and dearly-won victory over <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>.

<p>The basic allegory of animal farm, and the main layer on which it is read, is obviously George Orwell's own, personal view on soviety russia. However, on another, deeper level, it challenges the very nature of human society and if it is possible to live in a world in which everyone is equal? It it actually feesable for our own, human nature not to crave power or a highraquay. This is just one of many, thought provoking ideas of the novel.</p>

<p>What the HELL is that supposed to mean? Because you see a general use for it, as in cheating at school, you decide, that a long and short plot probably is totally meant entirely for so? Talk about reading inbetween the lines way too much. Black and White. Guess WHAT!? They could've just copied the whole article, perhaps entire wikipedia is meant to help students cheat, so we should delete it! HOORAY FOR INSANITY. It doesn't need justification. People sometimes want to read the long or short plot, based on their time available on a PC. And if a student may 'cheat' because of getting a good summarization...well, there's risks to being a good enclycopedia, so if we're 'sposed to be afraid of that and take the blame for such a silly thing I'd "approve" of anyways (Who cares?

<p>The book states that he was given some medicine they found in the cabinet. Perhaps this references peoples blind faith that the medicene would help without even knowing what the medacien did? Your thoughts.-Tom</p>

<p>"Thanks for your contributions to Animal Farm! However, please don't delete parts of articles without stating why. Tense relationships between US and Soviet Union immediately developed with the end of World War II, and both superpowers were involved in a power struggle for dominance. Since the animals of Animal Farm were representing satirically the Soviet Union and Mr. Pilkington represented the Allied powers, it follows that the ending struggle was probably a representation of the Cold War.

<li>My error... I'm so sorry, I was rushing my homework and reverted your edits while looking at the part in the parenthesis only. I kind of retract what I said before (not fully though), I do think rising tensions between the Soviet Union and Allies powers did prompt the Cold War and hence I restored it. It has now been changed to a more passive view, where it is now like "might have" and stuff like that. I realize that the book was written before the end of WW2, and therefore the action was not exactly the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>. Still, I think the two have some sort of a relationship, though it is possible that Orwell just placed it in there to further the satirical part of the book. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyZ_5810.html" title="User:AndyZ">AndyZ</a> 23:31, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Orwell probably implied the rising Allied and Soviet tensions. It would have ben pretty easy to guess taht there would be rising problems.

<p>"Napoleon is Orwell's chief villain in Animal Farm. Napoleon, the pig, is really the central character on the farm. Obviously a metaphor for Stalin, Comrade Napoleon represents the human frailties of any revolution. Orwell believed that although socialism is good as an ideal, it can never be successfully adopted due the to uncontrollable sins of human nature."</p>
<p>Did Orwell believe this, or is this a reader's interpretation of his views? I'm very familiar with George Orwell's essays and novels, and I can't recall him ever saying anything so simplistic as 'socialism is a nice idea that doesn't work in practice.' If no one objects, I'll take this bit out, aside from being of questionable accuracy it is completely superfluous. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 70.51.72.26 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.51.72.26_fa38.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.51.72.26">contribs</a>) 02:55, 13 January 2006.</small></p>

<p>I think one very important point is overlooked in the plot analysis, namely that the animal revolution begins to degenerate by degrees, virtually from the outset. Napoleon's later siezure of absolute power only accelerates the whole process. To see the book as an argument against Stalinism risks turning it into an argument in favour of Trotskyism. The truth is both are equally repellant. Benjamin would have understood this. <a href="../../../r/c/p/User%7ERcpaterson_27d2.html" title="User:Rcpaterson">Rcpaterson</a> 03:42, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Remember that Snowball also has special privileges and is a member of the coordinators with all the power that entails. He also does not do his share of the hard labor, instead doing only intellectual work, making decisions for others etc. It is not, I think, an argument in favor of Trotskyism. Rather it is a warning (by Orwell, a life long socialist) pointing out the dangers of the <a href="../../../c/o/o/Coordinatorism.html" title="Coordinatorism">coordinator class</a> who raise to the top and take over in Communism.

<li>Perhaps it could be rewritten as "The cat can also be seen to represent certain facets of human nature; not willing to work and taking advantage of the government".

<p>Re: 2006-09-17T08:53:24 by HawkerTyphoon.</p>
<p>The main Wikipedia entry is <a href="../../../t/s/a/Tsar.html" title="Tsar">Tsar</a>. That article says that the spelling <a href="../../../c/z/a/Czar.html" title="Czar">Czar</a> is less common. The spelling c-z-a-r makes me think of baseball!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Tsar</b><br />
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br /></p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Czar and tzar redirect here.</b> For other uses, see Tsar (disambiguation)<br /></dd>
</dl>
Tsar (Bulgarian, Serbian and Macedonian цар, Russian царь (help·info), in scientific transliteration respectively car and car' ), <b>occasionally spelled Czar or Tzar</b> and sometimes Csar or Zar in English, is a Slavonic term designating certain monarchs.</blockquote>

<p>The issue seems unimportant, but the revert of 2006-09-27T10:44:31 from <i>humour</i> back to <i>humor</i> seems very strange. A link was provided to <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html#National_varieties_of_English" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">policy</a>. I quote from that policy: <i>If an article's subject has a strong tie to a specific region/dialect, it should use that dialect.</i> George Orwell is British, Animal Farm is a British novel, The animals revolutionary song cited in the article is <i>Beasts of Englind</i>. Is not h-u-m-o-u-r the British spelling?</p>
<p>Am I confused? <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=humor" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=humor" rel="nofollow">Dictionary.com</a> cites both Random House and Merriam Webster as stating that <i>humour</i> is British. --<i><a href="../../../o/r/y/User%7EOryanw_23db.html" title="User:Oryanw">O'RyanW</a></i> (<a href="../../../o/r/y/User_talk%7EOryanw_e4ac.html" title="User talk:Oryanw">☺</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Oryanw_d517.html" title="Special:Contributions/Oryanw">₪</a>) 21:05, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>However, the editor who changed "humor" to "humour" failed to note that the article being linked to spells it "humor". They thus changed a link directly to the related article into a link to a redirect to the article. It wasn't a big deal, but it was just easier to revert the ill-planned change rather than dig through and find the link again. <a href="../../../s/x/e/User%7ESxeptomaniac_2337.html" title="User:Sxeptomaniac">Sxeptomaniac</a> 22:07, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh. I see. Thanks. I really should have noticed that. Would it have been wrong to revert just the spelling in the link and leave the spelling that the reader sees British?

<dd>It's not really a big deal to me what dialect of English the article's in, overall.

<dd>Actually, according to the wikipedia article on <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">Copyrighting</a>, "The length of the copyright term within the United States was extended by the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act which made the copyright term the life of the author plus 70 years for works created after January 1, 1978." So, it's possible Animal Farm is out of copyright in the US.</dd>

My guess would be that one of the reasons for all the vandalism is the location of the books within the Cultural Politics in the late 20th century - they've both been used by various people to support their own political causes, and I think this sort of activity forms how people view the books. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Kemp_db60.html" title="User:James Kemp">Jim</a> (<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJames_Kemp_4cf0.html" title="User talk:James Kemp">Talk</a>) 10:37, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm pretty sure the reason is that it is a common middle/high school read. Most students probably use wikipedia instead of sparknotes then vandalize it for kicks and giggles.
