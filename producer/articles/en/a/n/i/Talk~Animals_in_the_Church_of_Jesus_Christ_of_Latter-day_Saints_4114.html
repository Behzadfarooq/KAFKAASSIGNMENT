<p>What in the world is this article about? It comes across as someone pushing a pet agenda, not as an encyclopedic article. --216.195.220.34 20:45, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The article's generalizations and lack of citations indictate that there may be very little truth to its contents. --24.2.75.74 21:29, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Basically this article accords with LDS theology - as I am not conversant on the subject other than peripheral knowledge that the theology supports it etc - I am asking the editors to respond to the {{<a href="../../../d/b/_/Template%7EDb_645c.html" title="Template:Db">db</a>}} <a href="../../../s/d/_/WP%7ESD_2382.html" title="WP:SD">speedy delete request</a> --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 20:46, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Animals in the grand scope of Christianity need to be explored more! LDS are but one Christian church whose leaders have evidently commented on the significance of animal life, but animals are important to many more than just LDS, including non-Christian perspectives. They should be included also. The broader Christian view needs to be navigated carefully (including LDS, also a Christian church). Interestingly enough, CS Lewis devotes an entire essay in The Problem of Pain (ISBN: 0060652969) titled "Animal Pain" that parses the moral and physical intracacies of animal life, especially in their relation to humanity. Clearly, animals are important in his fiction as well. Thus, an article dealing with just the LDS view is, I think, a little too narrow in the broader scope of the issue, albeit very, very interesting...it merely needs expansion, context, and references, not deletion! I don't think we should abandon valid information, even if it doesn't appear to be timely, immediately relevant, or interesting to resident Wiki editors. Look, frankly I don't perceive this information to be in error, just that it needs more substantiation, not to mention context. It doesn't sound like you're overtly advocating a speedy deletion, <a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel">Trödel</a>, just a review. So, my vote: deleting this would be a shame.--<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiewalker_b307.html" title="User:Piewalker">Piewalker</a> 16:00, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Deleting this article would be an egregious case of anti-Mormon bigotry and religious persecution. Vote no on deletion. Vote yes on adding more information and documentation. Also, yes on more articles on animals in Christianity in general, and in other religions as well.<a href="../../../d/a/s/User%7EDas_Baz_9f9f.html" title="User:Das Baz">Das Baz</a> 15:34, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I know it can be tough when an article that you like is proposed for deletion, but I hope you can realize that it's not meant as a personal attack, or as an attack on Mormonism. I think it's <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">verifyability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">notability</a> that people are concerned about here, not anything relating to liking or disliking the LDS church. A lot of articles are nominated for these reasons. Once a AfD (articles for deletion) nomination is made, it cannot just be removed. Once the discussion on it is completed, the article will be kept, deleted, or merged into another article depending on the general consensus. If you think that the article is up to par, you're free to voice that opinion at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Animals_in_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_3ce0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Animals in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">the AfD discussion</a> and your views will be taken into account. As you can see from the discussion already there, Wikipedians are seriously considering the issue and will not make this decision out of frivolity. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../i/c/a/User_talk%7EIcarus3_9890.html" title="User talk:Icarus3">Hi!</a>)</sup> 20:09, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Icarus, I don't think you understand <a href="../../../d/a/s/User%7EDas_Baz_9f9f.html" title="User:Das Baz">Das Baz</a>'s argument about the existence of anti-Mormon angst. There is some sensitivity to the matter because there has been a great deal of prejudice leveled against LDS on Wikipedia and throughout the church's history. Take one look at one page of <a href="../../../l/d/s/LDS_Church_bdf6.html" title="LDS Church">LDS Church</a> article discussion. I agree this matter will be sorted out in discussion, but one must consider potentially insidious efforts to delete information as a form of attack in the war of words and contest of religions. We here at Wikipedia do not champion the notion of deleting truth, regardless of whether or not it could be considered noise or just a kernal of truth that's limited in its verifiability, and this article is not limited in that regard. I'm sure you can come right back and say you're not on one side or the other, but you seem to be leaning one way in the sense that I get the feeling that the information in this article doesn't seem valuable to you as evidenced by your frankly cavalier criticism leveled against <a href="../../../d/a/s/User%7EDas_Baz_9f9f.html" title="User:Das Baz">Das Baz</a> above..."I know it can be tough when an article that you like is proposed for deletion." <a href="../../../d/a/s/User%7EDas_Baz_9f9f.html" title="User:Das Baz">Das Baz</a> has been around awhile and has made some valid and notable contributions to our community. Do you not think <a href="../../../d/a/s/User%7EDas_Baz_9f9f.html" title="User:Das Baz">Das Baz</a> already knows about the deletion process? If you claim to be neutral, why are you even chiming in this discussion and asserting yourself against a simple user request to have the article removed from deletion after effort has succeeded in making at least a little better than what it was by a different user? So just hold on there a minute; exactly what is your position on the content of this article? Oh, and please don't take this personally.--<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiewalker_b307.html" title="User:Piewalker">Piewalker</a> 00:24, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wow, it looks like I unintentionally got in the middle of something that's much bigger than I was aware of! I wasn't intending be at all callous toward Das Baz, but instead trying to give a friendly reassurance that AfD isn't necessarily the big threat is it can appear to be. Some articles receive an overwhelming majority of "keep" votes, so it may be premature to get worried or upset. I have seen editors (especially new ones unfamiliar with the process; see next paragraph) become prematurely upset in the past, and was hoping that a quick reassurance would prevent the level drama that I've seen in the past. It looks like it did just the opposite!</dd>

<dd>If I was unintentionally patronizing, then I apologize. As far as I know, the only way to end a AfD early is through <a href="../../../s/k/_/WP%7ESK_0a05.html" title="WP:SK">speedy keep</a>, which due to confusing time stamps (see note below) I thought was already impossible due to "delete" votes. As such, I thought that a user making such a request must be unfamiliar with AfD process. If I was misinterpreting Das Baz's request, or am (ironically) unaware of some other deletion policy that Das Baz was invoking, then mea culpa. I have no reason to doubt your claim that Das Baz is experienced and familiar with the process, and that any appearance to the contrary was a result of a (possibly incorrect) interpretation of his request.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(Note: Now that I have taken a closer look at the time stamps in the edit histories, and not just at the time stamps on the sigs which don't seem to correspond to the edit histories or each other due to time zone differences, I see that there were no "delete" votes when Das Baz made his request. Thus, he may have meant that he wanted the nominator to revoke the nomination and invoke Speedy Keep criterion #1.)</dd>

<dd>Again, I didn't mean "deal with it" or "quit whining" or anything else of the sort, and if it looked like that then I wish I'd used a clearer wording. Instead, I meant something more along the lines of "don't worry, the process can be trusted". If that is not true in the case of LDS-related articles, then it is a most regrettable situation. My comments, however, had nothing to do with any battles waging over LDS-related articles, and would have been the same for any user requesting the early closing of an AfD discussion.</dd>

<p>I apologize if I seemed too touchy. Too often, I have seen magazines, such as as <i>New Republic</i>, <i>Harper's</i>, <i>Biblical Archaeology Review</i>, etc., publish the most egregious anti-LDS material and allow little or nothing to be said for the LDS position. But it seems that Wikipedia is more decent than those magazines. <a href="../../../d/a/s/User%7EDas_Baz_9f9f.html" title="User:Das Baz">Das Baz</a> 16:12, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think you'd be right on the money if trees, rocks, or people with Hebrew-sounding names (meaningless or otherwise) were the express focus of extensive theological discussion on the nature of their own progression, especially in relation to humanity. The greater Christian theological discussion in general (especially beliefs of LDS, who are Christian) places far more screen-time to animals than trees and rocks, as evidenced by the Genesis account:</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Genesis 1 (KJV):</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>21 And God created...the great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>Compare that to how much theological screen time is devoted to a tree. Were trees given dominion? To dominate like the animals were (humans included)? If you want to read about trees, start off with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Giving_Tree_a051.html" title="The Giving Tree">The Giving Tree</a> by <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shel_Silverstein_ac5f.html" title="Shel Silverstein">Shel Silverstein</a> (I have some good quotes on trees on my user page, too). So, as we see, <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanity.html" title="Humanity">humanity</a> suddenly jumps (out of the clear, blue sky?) onto the stage, the surface of the earth (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Personal_Voyage#Episode_I:_.22The_Shores_of_the_Cosmic_Ocean.22" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Personal_Voyage#Episode_I:_.22The_Shores_of_the_Cosmic_Ocean.22" rel="nofollow">the shores of the cosmic ocean</a>), immediately after the appearance of the animals. I wonder if there's any significance of that? Hmmmm. And why were things done in that order? Such a discussion could be engendered on this page, or a page similar to this. True, it may not be the best name in the world for a page, but come on, how hard is it to rename something, that is, if you're into naming things, <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a>. When one thinks about it, funny-sounding names are pretty much everywhere in all of history, oh history-diva-of-all-time-(ever). I wonder if anyone has ever used nomenclature as a prejudice. Does anyone know? Wait a minute, I'd say even animals have "meaningless" names, or not-so-meaningless ones if you want to begin cataloging them and differentiating them from one another. What possible use could there be for that? Why is the Hamburglar called that, anyway? What is a species, anyhow? Any other more compelling reason for deletion?. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiewalker_b307.html" title="User:Piewalker">Piewalker</a> 19:58, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd suggest minimizing the official use of the word "Mormon," as it is a name that indicates innacurate data. although most members of the LDS church refer to themselves as Mormons, I think it would be wise to use the full name of the church or the abbreviation LDS in article titles. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_runner_5a59.html" title="User:Master runner">Master Runner</a> 00:59, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I made some significant edits and additions to this page today. However, I did not change the name. I strongly agree that the current name needs tweaking. Perhaps the first suggestion above is the best (Animals and TCoJCoLDS). Perhaps LDS Beliefs about Animals. Somebody somewhere else suggested something like LDS Theology of Animals, but I think that is a misuse of the word theology.Nayatwa 01:06, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge</b>—or link; I oppose the opposers here not merely because the subject matter is relevant (and somewhat controversial, even among LDS—which would be a great reason to allow debate on honing its content, placement, and expansion), but because one of the few quasi-valid arguments above that flies in the face of a merge is the article length guideline; but honestly, how in the world does length parameters dictate content...especially online? It's the Internet, man, not ink on paper. And Wikipedia isn't gonna be like some capricious Zeus character throwing out bolts of lightning as punishment for exceeding 100K. A "See also" section + link is conceivable, but I agree with <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> that these beliefs should at the very least be mentioned somewhere here. Give me a sentence, reference it, and me and my camp will be happy. The argument of specificity, obscurity, or isolated novelty is subjective regardless. Tell me you've never considered the spiritual nature of pets, or that you don't know where juicy T-bone's come from, regardless of whether or not the cow itself was a vegetarian. I suppose one could ignorantly say "Who cares that Adam and Eve named the animals of the Garden?" or "Who cares about Noah and the Ark, anyway?" or "Who cares that Christ was born in a stable?" or "Who cares Christ rode into Jerusalem on an ass?" or "Who cares about animal sacrifice from Adam to the Last Supper?" There are many specific/novel points of LDS doctrine already listed on this page, and their importance varies from user to user. Come on, even with a length "recommendation," do we seriously want there to be absolutely <i>no mention</i> that LDS believe animals will be resurrected? That animal life is important here and in heaven (pick a spot, any spot in the Book of Revelation). And lacking that information on the religion's most front and center article, no less? I'd go so far as to say that it would be a disservice to those beliefs. Yes, there have been other LDS-related target articles proposed for merge...<a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormonism.html" title="Mormonism">Mormonism</a> is one of them, but this place is the logical first choice.

Theology relating to animals has <i>never</i> been a topic of significance in the CoJCoLDS, and what little has been said about it is summarized in this article. What we have here is essentially four sentences, then a long (and unnecessary) quote by Joseph F. Smith, and a final sentence of speculation which pertains to the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Word_of_Wisdom_6e64.html" title="Word of Wisdom">Word of Wisdom</a> article. Four sentences does not an article make, and turning down a merge because "the target article is too long" or "we've already got too much to work on there" just avoid the issue. Alternatively, I would also support merging this into an articles that combines a number of lesser points of theology in the CoJCoLDS. <b><a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #FF4500; font-family: Times New Roman; font-variant: small-caps;">Tijuana Brass</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/i/j/User_talk%7ETijuana_Brass_8109.html" title="User talk:Tijuana Brass">¡Épa!</a></sup></b> 11:48, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>While I'm undecided on whether a merge is appropriate, I think that it needs to be agreed upon what doctrine presented here is unique to the CoJCoLDS, and what is accepted by Mormon denominations in general. The links provided here are all CoJCoLDS biased, and most of the statements are from leaders of the Brighamite church. To me, that suggests that <i>if</i> a merge should happen, it needs to happen on an article pertaining to their denomination, rather than the more general <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plan_of_Salvation_7a17.html" title="Plan of Salvation">Plan of Salvation</a> or <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormonism.html" title="Mormonism">Mormonism</a> articles.

<dd>I agree with Tijuana. Until some source tying in the Animals article to another of the larger, denominations of the Latter Day Saint Movement, this article should be part of a CoJCoLDS based article. Clearly, these options are more general to all of the LDS denominations. Which is why I propose keeping this article exactly as it is. It doesn't fit into the main CoJCoLDS article, doesn't belong in any of the more general articles, but certainly is an important enough topic to warrant its own discussion. The current "see also" link on the bottom of the main article is presently adequate enough for the needs of those who wish to read about animals in the Church, and we shouldn't subject any reader to an even longer version of an article that is clearly too long. --<a href="../../../p/a/h/User%7EPahoran513_f437.html" title="User:Pahoran513">Pahoran513</a> 17:16, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Which statements are from leaders of the Brighamite church? I am suddenly curious. I know some of the references go various places, but the content looks fine doctrinally. I'm undecided on the merge thing, too. I'm leaning towards keeping the article as is (linkability, that is, not that the article shouldn't evolve...it should). <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiewalker_b307.html" title="User:Piewalker">Piewalker</a> 20:06, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Brighamites = CoJCoLDS = Rocky Mountain Saints = faction which followed Brigham Young West. During the schism -- almost all the leaders names were used with "-ites" (i.e. BOM) in general reference, as in "Rigdonites", "Brighamites", etc. But this has fallen out of general usage today.

<p>Okay, if there is no further discussion, I am in favor of removing the merge tag. It appears we have consensus, people, so why keep discussing this? ``<a href="../../../p/a/h/User%7EPahoran513_f437.html" title="User:Pahoran513">Pahoran513</a> 02:57, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agree - I don't think we have concensus to merge to a Mormonism and Environmental Stewardship article yet. Additionally, I know of no references/quotes from other Latter Day Saint movement denominations, so it may not be accurate to include the information in an article that is about the movement as a group. --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 13:38, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Peyna - that you would accuse another editor of suppression because I don't want unnecessary <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">metadata</a> on a high profile article that is undergoing discussion on how to split off information is unbelievable. This is the proper place to at least reach some kind of support first - then proposing it on the target article's page with the merge templates would make it much more likely to succeed.</p>
<p>I'm sorry that your feelings are hurt because not one other editor on the CJC article would restore the merge notice - as you know (assuming you read the dicsussion on the Afd), I opposed the deletion of the material - and am personally undecided on whether a merge is even necessary - though I think it is clear that if there is a merge it should be on a doctrine related article.</p>

<dd>Please don't do this. Merge notices are placed on article pages partially because editors don't always think to look at the talk page. This is the same reason I asked above to let the discussion play out; removing a merge tag from the article means that less editors will become aware that the discussion is actually taking place. I don't consider this any question of you claiming ownership of the article, as you've always been active in LDS topics, so if I made the implication, forgive me. I do feel strongly about keeping the tag up, though.

<dd>The point that was being made I believe, is that although there is some doctrinal philosophy regarding the souls of animals, it is such a minor topic that it does nto warrent it's own article. I suggest merging it with <a href="../../../w/o/r/Word_of_Wisdom_6e64.html" title="Word of Wisdom">Word of Wisdom</a> in the section about 'meat sparingly'. As for trees, since Mormons don't worship trees (or animals for that matter), it seems this topic is moot. I see this article a prime candidate for deletion. In the realm of Mormonism, the souls of trees and animals are interesting on a speculative level, but not more than a bit of trivia, at best. When have you ever heard a talk at a General Conference on the nature of the soul of anything other than man? 66.151.81.244 18:15, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After thinking about this for a time and doing some research, I have a new proposal for target article to merge Animals into: Spirit influence in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or something like that(not satisfied with the name). Reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>All the information I have seen about Animals stems from a discussion that Animals have spirits and that their spirits were, like human spirits, organized from intelligences.</li>
<li>Such an article could cover a broad range of topics of which this one could be part</li>
<li>It would provide context for the concept that man should be kind to animals, as they have spirits also, etc.</li>

<li>Latter Day Saint theology regarding animals having souls and animal salvation.</li>

<dd>We've been having these merge discussions for months now. Merging efforts are stalled. For this article's credit, it has survived on its own as a stand-alone thus far! It was not accepted at the main LDS Church page, nor anywhere else. Nonetheless, in its present form, work still needs to be done on it, including revising the title. <b>On the title:</b> <i>Animals and _______&#160;?</i> It should instead be something like "<i>Theological perspectives of animal life and death,"</i> or <i>"Mormon/LDS Beliefs of Animal Life."</i> Let me tell you why. A titl phrased <i>"Animals in ______"</i> could potentially be misunderstood by the casual reader that <b>Mormon's themselves are the animals</b>...or that Animals are <i>in</i> the LDS church <i>as members</i>, or something crazy like that. The title is very important to communicating LDS beliefs, or the beliefs of any other theology regarding the significance of animal life. We should just rename this page to be something a little more apropos. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiewalker_b307.html" title="User:Piewalker">Piewalker</a> 19:26, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
