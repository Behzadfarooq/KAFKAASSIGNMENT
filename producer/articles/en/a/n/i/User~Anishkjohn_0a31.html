<p><b>About My State:Kerala - God's Own Country</b></p>
<p>The National Geographic magazine has named Kerala as one of the ten Paradises Found in the world!</p>
<p>The Kerala State Tourism Department has rightly named our state The God's Own Country. Kerala means the land of coconuts. And guys! we do have coconuts, arecanuts and also nuts like me in abundance!</p>
<p>The state is gifted with greenery and water. There are lot of tourist spots. Kovalam is a well known beach; Thekkady is equally known for its wild life. For people who love silence, we've Silent Valley, which is the only forest where the insects don't make any sound. Want to be still closer to nature? Well, we've Wynad and Munnar in the Western Ghats.Or you prefer sea to mountains? Travel along the west coast of Kerala. Or just take a train ride from Kasaragod to Trivandrum. If you can keep the count of bridges you cross, you don't have to worry about your memory power.</p>
<p>The language we use is Malayalam. If you speak English, you won't have any problem in Kerala. Many people speak Hindi and Tamil also. As the subject of quite a lot of jokes, you may find the pronounciation a bit hilarious. But that is quite common in any part of India! Our traditional dress is Mundu for men and a slightly longer version of the same for women. Now a days, it is very difficult to see such costumes. The changing times have resulted in people switching over to more easy to use stuff! Do visit our state. We are only too happy to welcome you.</p>
<p><b>Interesting Facts</b> According to your nationality, I guess you might be interested in the following facts about Kerala.</p>
<p><i>American</i> First state in the world which elected a communist government. Medication is sponsored by the government. Lush green paddy(rice) fields and ultra-populated road-sides! The number of people wasting time on news papers. (Reading news paper is a good habit, but unfortunately, our news papers are quite awful.) Sea, sun and mountains so close to each other <i>British</i> Ready availability of tea, and tea plantations. Extremely informal people. Curries of a different class all together. <i>French, German</i> People immediately like you. A former French protectorate called Mahi(Mayyazhi) Hermann Gundert, from DeutscheLand gave Malayalam its first dictionary. Napoleon is revered here. And for all, abundant natural beauty of the tropics.</p>
<p>Kerala is a very easy place to simply sit back and enjoy. The name means "land of coconuts," and the palms shade nearly the entire state from the tropical sun; many call the beach at Kovalam the best in India; visitors can spend a day riding small ferries through the backwater lagoons or watching elephants cavort in the wildlife sanctuaries; the spicy food may be the best vegetarian cuisine on the planet.</p>
<p>This small state in India, though not much larger than Maryland, has a population as big as California's and a per capita annual income of less than $300. But its infant mortality rate is low, its literacy rate among the highest on Earth, and its birthrate below America's and falling faster. Kerala's citizens live nearly as long as Americans or Europeans. Though mostly a land of paddy-covered plains, statistically Kerala stands out as the Mount Everest of social development; there's truly no place like it.</p>
<p>In the mornings, from nearly anywhere in Kerala, you can hear loud music from the Hindu temples, wailing muezzins at the mosques, and church bells ringing at the cathedrals. Religious tolerance is just one reason for Kerala's success. The state government has effected sweeping land reforms and spends almost half of its budget on health and education. A heritage of female-headed households means women have always been equal participants here. Unlike almost everywhere else in Asia, women outnumber men in Kerala, suggesting that there has been no selective abortion or female infanticide.</p>
<p>Kerala is not a quiet spot. It has a rate of newspaper readership that is among the highest in the world and plenty of never-ending political arguments. Parades of striking bus drivers or medical students or kathakali dancers block traffic in the capital of Trivandrum almost daily. But for me, that engagement with the world is one of the best things about the place. Keralites meet you on more or less equal terms, with neither the subservience nor the rage you'll find in much of the Third World.</p>
<p>Kerala is a place to meander: Simply take a bus from Trivandrum or Cochin out to almost any village and spend a day wandering the dikes between the rice paddies and rubber trees, seeing how half the world still lives: men and women stooping to cut rice with sickles, or spreading coconut along the road to dry; water buffalo wallowing in the irrigation ditches; every inch of ground cultivated; every small field lined with palms; a place where little is wasted. The breeze rustling the palm fronds is just a bonus.</p>

<b>My Residing Country:</b></p>
<p>Singapore - The Fine City</p>
<p><br />
Singapore is famous for being the cleanest city in the world. Tourists will be astonished and impressed by the strict rules and regulations formed by the Singapore government. There are many posters in buildings and parks telling people what they should do, what they shouldn't do and how much they will be fined if they break the rules. That is the reason why Singapore is called "the fine city".</p>
<p>The Singaporean government wants to establish a clean and green country where all citizens are well educated and are considerately to others. Therefore they have set many strict rules as well as put a lot of instructions and reminders in public places so that people always remember what they aren't allowed to do and everything is orderly. Children are taught at school and in their family, right from very early ages, about what they should do and how to behave in this society.</p>
<p>If you are a tourist visiting Singapore, you should be considerate and pay attention to every one of your actions. There are many things considered normal in your country but which are illegal in Singapore. You will be fined heavily if you litter or smoke in public places. Also remember to flush public toilets after using it so that you aren't fined S$500.</p>
<p>It is summer and you enjoy lying on the beach sunbathing. However, if you are in Singapore, you mustn't go nude or topless when sunbathing, even if it is your own back yard. It is forbidden in Singapore and you will be fined if you're caught doing that.</p>
<p>Chewing gum is not forbidden in Singapore but bringing gum into the country in large amount is illegal and the gum seller can be sent to jail. Therefore, be careful with what you bring to Singapore. You can find more information about what is not allowed to be brought into Singapore by visiting the Singaporean customs' website.</p>
<p>Drugs are strictly forbidden in Singapore. People trafficking, manufacturing, importing or exporting more than 15g of heroin, 30g of morphine, 30g of cocaine, 500g of cannabis, 200g of cannabis resin and 1.2kg of opium are sentenced to death. Possessing these amounts is also regarded as trafficking and equals a death penalty. Therefore you must not get involved in drugs in Singapore by any means.</p>
<p>Thanks to the strict laws of Singapore, this country is very safe and orderly. There is virtually no crime, no corruption and you are safe even when walking alone at night. There may be some pickpockets in crowded places. However, they are rare unlike any other Asian countries.</p>
<p>Every year a large number of tourists are fined during their stay in Singapore because they are unaware of the strict rules and regulations. You should read about its rules and regulations carefully before going there and be aware of every board, poster or sign you see. Being a decent person and showing your respect to others, you won't encounter any problems and will have an enjoyable stay in this clean country.</p>
