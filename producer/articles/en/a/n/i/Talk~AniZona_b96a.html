<p>As much as I enjoy anime, it may be overstating the case to call an anime convention "Arizona culture". However, as the equivalent conventions in other cities are labeled as such, the category should probably stand. Even if I don't like it.

<p>I don't do much editing or modification here on Wikipedia so I'm not 100% comfortable with the policies on deletion here. the following paragraph seems to violate many of wikipedia's standards of quality. Here is the suspect entry</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The third year may prove to be just as boring and lacking in competent organizers as the first two years. Stay tuned for a lack of printed schedules. Stay tuned for printed schedules that are inaccurate. Stay tuned for not being tuned in to the activites because they are out of schedules or they forgot to put half the stuff on them."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't know if the page should be reverted, or the section should be deleted. Maybe the writer would like to reword this? 4.190.165.100 00:53, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Try Google. Hasn't anyone written any third-party reports about the convention? Have their been any news articles published? --<a href="../../../p/d/e/User%7EPDelahanty_5985.html" title="User:PDelahanty">PatrickD</a> 16:43, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There are. The best is an article on AZ central that qualifies as a professional convention report. AZC is owned by the <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona_Republic_46b7.html" title="Arizona Republic">Arizona Republic</a> (largest newspaper in AZ). If that's not a reliable source, than we might as well throw out all convention reports. "^_^" It confirms the dates of the convention, the guests, and Anthony G's involvement (but not necessarily as chair, that could be confirmed elsewhere or through ACML archives).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now, technically, "valley" means the corridor along the I-10 in which Phoenix occupies (I'm from California originally, but that's how I've come to understand it). However, unless somebody threw a convention in Tucson or Flagstaff, I can't see the claim of them being the first in AZ challenged. AZ simply doesn't have that many population centers. Lepercon and Coppercon don't count for reasons cited by another editor. It'd be like considered San Diego Comic Con as an anime convention.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>While we're on the subject, I really think Anime-Cons.com should have a search-able database by state (*hint*Patrick*hint*). That would work fine as a secondary source to prove they were the first in AZ. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKensuke_Aida_4eea.html" title="User:Kensuke Aida">Kensuke Aida</a> 09:29, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First of all, with respect to Patrick's concerns, the article as I just edited now contained backup sources. However, there are three instances where is doesn't and I don't think absolutely needs it:</p>
<p>1. There is an attendance cap. 2. The guests confirmed by Anizona in 2007. 3. The sponsors confirmed by the convention</p>
<p>Frankly, I don't think any of those need additional confirmation. Especially seeing as all outside sources would use AniZona's info as their own source. There are more than enough citations now to corroborate what is written.</p>
<p>The only two OR problems now is the comment about being the first in AZ (which could be confirmed via anime-cons.com if there is a per-state search function), and sentence about California affecting attendance (which I want to give Miwasatoshi the courtesy of addressing). <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKensuke_Aida_4eea.html" title="User:Kensuke Aida">Kensuke Aida</a> 11:56, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding Patrick's concerns here:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Honestly, we could (and probably will) probably remove the California affecting attendance segment.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However: the "first anime convention" is directly from Anizona itself, and this is a fact that has not been questioned by anyone currently or formerly resident in the state. Note that there are ZERO anime conventions in Flagstaff, Prescott, and Tucson to this day. Never have been. You could even ask the TASS folks (or you could if their website weren't down!) - they've never held a convention down in Tucson in their many years of operation: the only regular "fandom-related" convention in Tucson is TusCon, run by BASFA for the past 33 years <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~basfa/" class="external autonumber" title="http://home.earthlink.net/~basfa/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>According to Anime-Cons.com itself, there are no anime conventions in Arizona prior to Anizona in 2005 <a href="http://www.anime-cons.com/events/state.shtml/AZ0020505" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.anime-cons.com/events/state.shtml/AZ0020505" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. You won't find them in any other source either: they simply don't exist. Even excluding any potential "original research", this is not just a "claim" but a provable and largely incontrovertible fact.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, if any editors have remaining issues with the formatting of this article, be aware that it was originally largely patterned after the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime_Expo_8bc1.html" title="Anime Expo">Anime Expo</a> article.

<dd>Since press releases are just re-printed text sent from the con, they aren't really that "external". I could put out a press release saying that I walked on the moon if I wanted to...but that doesn't make it true.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Um, print newspapers vet press releases. Your theoretical "walk on the moon" would not be considered newsworthy and wouldn't be published. What qualifies to you as a reputable "external" source in terms of anime conventions? There's not exactly a wealth of hardcopy information, and if you aren't accepting newspapers then we can rule out the Internet, because anyone can post a website! But Wikipedia protocol clearly indicates this as acceptable. Also: <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith</a>. Might be worth looking at.

<dd>If we're going to get this ridiculous I recommend ejecting attendance numbers on every wikipedia article, since as near as I can tell they are sourced from the convention themselves and not subject to independent confirmation.
