<p>Wikipedia cannot, under <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, dicate what is correct or not; it only reports what others believe. Moreover, in English, there is no academy to set right and wrong; the only way to tell right from wrong is what is used and what is generally considered correct. From a prescriptionist perspective, I'm always pro-nativizing; we shouldn't spell something one way just because another language does. Unlike an NEEM, I'm not going to accept a flat claim that animé is not considered correct; I've seen it too often for that.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 20:02, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, that's fine. But I've never seen anyone who actually watches and enjoys anime spell it "animé." So, while you may have seen that spelling 'often,' I'm willing to bet that you haven't seen it spelled that way by anyone actually knowledgeable about the subject. Additionally, it should be noted that "animé" has a different definition than "anime" according to most dictionaries and 'animation' is not listed as a definition under the "é" spelling. --<a href="../../../x/a/l/User%7EXaliqen_c3d2.html" title="User:Xaliqen">Xaliqen</a> 00:34, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My post was specifically about one editor's changes, who kept changing "anime is sometimes spelled as <i>animé</i> in English" to "anime is sometimes spelled incorrectly as <i>animé</i> in English" and kept adding the sentence "However anime is spelled "anime" in Japanese <a href="../../../r/o/o/Roomaji.html" title="Roomaji">roomaji</a> and has already been <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanized.html" title="Romanized">romanized</a> therefore the correct spelling in English is always "anime" (singular or plural) even though this does not give additional information to it's [sic] pronunciation in English." I'm not against improvement of this section, as long as it stays prescriptive, but I do think absolutes are dangerous; note User:Egan Loo's edit comment that "The accented é was used in The Berkeley Journal of Japanese Animation (1990), one of the first English books written on the subject", and it took me about a minute to find a couple fan pages that used animé (use Yahoo Search, as Google folds the é.) I don't know about dictionaries; www.dict.org has no relevant definitions for anime and none at all for animé, and I don't think any of my hardcopy dictionaries are very up-to-date. (And I can no longer check the online OED, which is frustrating.) Let's talk evidence and specifics as much as we can, and hopefully we can improve what we have.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 07:42, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"kept?" I think you are misstating things. I am the guy who added that section. Then you reverted it once, and I re-reverted it once, then you changed it back. Now that section is gone as someone else noticed that without my changes that section was not even about spelling. While hardly authoritative on the subject, you really should have read the wikipedia entries on <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanized.html" title="Romanized">romanized</a> <a href="../../../r/o/o/Roomaji.html" title="Roomaji">roomaji</a> <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transliteration.html" title="Transliteration">transliteration</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_orthography.html" title="Latin orthography">Latin orthography</a> BEFORE you started making reverts based on your own understanding of what you felt should be correct. I'll go through your points one at a time to refute them:
<ul>
<li>1. "Anime" is roomanji. That means it has been <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanized.html" title="Romanized">romanized</a> according to <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_orthography.html" title="Latin orthography">Latin orthography</a>. Or simply put, the word has ALREADY been converted into English! I really can't stress this enough... ROMANJI = ENGLISH SPELLING. That is the purpose of romanji. It would be improper to convert it again, because then all you are doing is adding slang! It's also incorrect to say that romanji is Japanese. Japanese is Japanese. Romanji is the conversion of Japanese to the latin alphabet. In other words it exists only to illustrate the correct spelling of English words!</li>
<li>2. Prosfilaes wrote "there is one and only one thing that controls correct spelling in English; usage.)" Sorry but you are absolutely wrong. That is hardly the ONLY basis for the English language. That is one of MANY (and I stress many) factors that determine spelling, but historical use is far more important than phonological use. (see <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English_language</a>)</li>
<li>3. Anime was added to the English language by <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transliteration.html" title="Transliteration">transliteration</a> NOT by <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transcription_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Transcription (linguistics)">transcription</a> which could have been used, BUT WAS NOT. Unlike for English, Japan DOES have an authoritative body to set language standards, (even ISO standards) for the conversion to other alphabets (<a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthography.html" title="Orthography">orthography</a>). They had the choice of HOW to romanize "anime" and they could have spelt it "animé" if they so desired (as they did with "Moé") but they didn't for very sensible reasons. The fact is, "anime" was how it was romanized... therefore (by definition) all other spellings are incorrect.</li>
<li>4. "Anime" is a reborrowed <a href="../../../l/o/a/Loanword.html" title="Loanword">loanword</a> from English. As standard pratice, English doesn't use diacritics (accents) except in loanwords that orginally have them (and then not always). The orginal word the Japanese used ("animation") does not have accents and comes from English (regardless of where English got it from), so I guess that is the reason why it was set that way in roomanji. But whatever the reason it doesn't matter, that is the way it was set.</li>
<li>5. "I'm not going to accept a flat claim that animé is not considered correct; I've seen it too often for that." So based on that logic, "<a href="../../../t/e/h/Teh.html" title="Teh">teh</a>" is an acceptable alternate spelling to "the" after all it has it's own wiki entry. (You even caught my incorrect use of "it's" and even though that's a frequent persistent mistake by many, that doesn't make "it's" correct.) There are lots of words that are spelt incorrectly, List_of_common_misspellings_in_English but lots of people over a long period of time for "grammer" to become acceptable "grammar". BTW: I've spelt "rōmaji" incorrectly many times above but I'm not claiming I care enough about a discussion entry to comb it over for spelling errors, I'm only making the claim that "animé" is always wrong under one of the few hard and clear rules regarding the English language.</li>
<li>6. "Ä-ni-mé: The Berkeley Journal of Japanese Animation" was a fan mag that saw 2 issues before folding! I would not describe it as "one of the first English books written on the subject." Not a good source. Plus the direct quotes I found of articles spelt "anime" as "anime" while "Ä-ni-mé:" was only spelt that way because it was the title. (Regardless of how they spelt it, it doesn't mean they were correct... it was a fan mag!)</li>
<li>7. How can you possibly justify "fan sites found with yahoo" as a source for proper spelling? "The Internet" is hardly a paragon of spelling.</li>
<li>8. I agree that absolutes are dangerous *if it is an opinion.* Sometimes things are facts and are an absolute. For example, the earth revolves around the sun is a fact (regardless that some people claim that is an opinion). <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is not relevant.None Error 20:08, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>(1) Transliteration is a tool to display Japanese (or other foreign words) without forcing people to know another script. A word transliterated into the Latin script is not an English word. Anime, in this case, is not a Japanese word; it is an English word. (2) Where the hell does historical use and phonological use come from? It's how people use the word. (3) Japanese spelling doesn't control English spelling, any more than French, Latin or Greek spelling controls how English words derived from those languages are spelt. (5) <a href="../../../t/e/h/Teh.html" title="Teh">teh</a> is wrong, because people don't use it believing it's the correct spelling. <a href="../../../t/e/h/Teh.html" title="Teh">teh</a> is wrong because there's a well understood standard. Likewise with the incorrect use of it's. There are no such hard and clear rules regarding the English langauge. The Internet may not be a paragon of spelling, but it's an example of usage.</dd>

Just as much to the point, spelling is all opinion; if tomorrow, every publisher in the US spelled the "teh" and continued to do so, that would be the correct spelling.

"Paasokon" or "Persocon" are the acceptable ways to spell those words. It's not "Pearsokon" nor any other weird spellings.

<dd>You would make sense but why would Tidal Waves become "tidar wavees"? I personally spell it Animé because that's how I say it (otherwise its spelt anime and I'm saying AHN-IHM). Café is pronounced CAFF-EE because of the flick, had it not had the flick it would be CAAF. Pokémon is POKE-EE-MON because of the flick and that doesn't conform because? Oh wait, no it doesn't make sense. If its spelt anime, I'm saying AHN-IHM. If it was correctly spelt (in my eyes) with the flick then I would "correctly" pronounce.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">National Child Exploitation Coordination Centre Issue</span></h2>
<p>I have added a note to the page regarding the latest controversy regarding the "National Child Exploitation Coordination Centre" of Canada. They have conflated the concept of anime with hentai, and also conflated hentai with illegal/obscene acts. Most notably, they keep referencing how predators could use anime/hentai to "groom" children for said acts, and several other issues.</p>
<p>I am doing my best not to interject POV or insulting comments in this post, so please forgive the somewhat stiff form I have used. I have placed the note regarding this matter at the top of the page, just below the basic definition, in the hopes that readers of that NCECC report will come here and see it immediately, and hopefully realise that the report is incorrect at best. Also, it is a significant issue, and represents something that the anime community has faced for many years.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Anime vs. western movies</span></h2>
<p>Western movies (even animated ones) seem to be fitted more into reality than anime. Both have their appeal in their archetypal idealism, but while western art tries to fit those dreams into current/prognosed reality, anime creates a world around these archetypes. Or to say it more practically: the worlds of anime do not make scientific sense. Anime helps you only to learn about yourself and your phantasies, it does not suggest ways to apply them to your life.</p>
<p>Take for example the multitude of romance stories in which the hero has unlimited success with females, where every woman or girl is cute - this would be called pulp fiction if it weren't japanese. James Bond is a secret agent against the forces of communism and meglomaniacs - he may be supersmart and superlucky, but Lupon in comparison is out of this world. He is in open machine gun fire range all the time and never gets hit, he does have little mission except looking cool. "Science" fiction movies include such things as people shooting slow-firing rifles in US-civil-war-like rows from massive howering spacecraft.</p>
<p>The innovativeness of anime lies not in the refitting of known appeal into a relevant setting, but to explore the appeal. Examples are: cute, cool, hot, massive, angry, evil/stupid, mysterious, philosophical. Very few animes break from this. Some are parodies on exactly these stereotypes, such as Excel saga. Others are movies in the western sense, such as Mononoke Hime. I think that things like the Otaku phenomenon are due to this surreality. Anime is a place where you are not bothered with the problems of the world.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Manga</span></h2>
<p>Regarding this line: "manga can refer to both animation and comics (although the use of manga to refer to animation is mostly restricted to non-fans)." I don't think the word "manga" refers to animations among "non-fans," at least in Japan. I think it's just that definition of manga as anime is not used that commonly among the young people in Japan. For example I know that my grandparents use that term "manga" to refer to anime on TV, but we as younger populations don't really use it. I know it's not really talking about how it's used in Japan but that part kinda caught me. I guess it's not the matter of being fans or not, but if you're the anime generaton or not. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 128.54.155.69 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.54.155.69_73c9.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.54.155.69">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>It's becoming less common, but anime is still commonly referred to as "manga" by those in their mid-30s and older. <i><a href="../../../p/o/m/Pom_Poko_591f.html" title="Pom Poko">Pom Poko</a></i> indicates it is a "full color manga movie" in its full title, for example. --<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe">日本穣</a> 22:29, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
