<p>The <b>Anita Cobby murder</b> was the name given to the murder of 26-year-old <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian.html" title="Australian">Australian</a> <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nursing.html" title="Nursing">nursing</a> sister and <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beauty_pageant.html" title="Beauty pageant">beauty pageant</a> winner, <b>Anita Lorraine Cobby</b>, on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_2.html" title="February 2">2 February</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>.</p>
<p>Her murder has been remembered as one of the most horrifying and violent crimes ever perpetrated in Australia. The violent nature of the crime shocked most Australians and united the public in outrage. <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petitions.html" title="Petitions">Petitions</a> containing tens of thousands of signatures were sent to governments, and thousands of telephones calls were made to television stations and talk back radio shows, supporting the reintroduction of the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_penalty.html" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a> to Australia.</p>

Anita Cobby, crowned 1979 Miss Western Suburbs Charity Queen</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Anita Lorraine Lynch</b> was born on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_2.html" title="November 2">2 November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>.</p>
<p>Anita met her future husband, John Cobby, while studying for her nursing degree. They married on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_27.html" title="March 27">27 March</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>. At the time of her murder, though, the couple had divorced and Anita was living with her parents in <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blacktown%2C_New_South_Wales_9b7b.html" title="Blacktown, New South Wales">Blacktown, New South Wales</a>.</p>

<p>On the day of the murder, Anita finished work at <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Hospital_9922.html" title="Sydney Hospital">Sydney Hospital</a> at 3pm and met friends for dinner in <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redfern%2C_New_South_Wales_d0f8.html" title="Redfern, New South Wales">Redfern</a>. She then caught a train from <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_railway_station%2C_Sydney_f9b9.html" title="Central railway station, Sydney">Central Station</a> to <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blacktown_railway_station%2C_New_South_Wales_10e8.html" title="Blacktown railway station, New South Wales">Blacktown Station</a>. She was never seen alive again by anyone but her killers.</p>
<p>Anita was walking alone along Newton Road when the gang of five youths drove up alongside her and stopped their stolen <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holden_Commodore_6efa.html" title="Holden Commodore">Holden Commodore</a>. Two men leaped from the car, dragging Anita kicking and screaming into the car. She was ordered to strip off her clothes but refused, begging her attackers to let her go, saying she was married and that she was on her <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menstrual_cycle.html" title="Menstrual cycle">period</a>.</p>
<p>Her attackers continued to punch Anita repeatedly, then drove to a <a href="../../../s/e/r/Service_station.html" title="Service station">service station</a> to purchase fuel using money stolen from Anita's purse. She was then driven to a secluded paddock, while being held down in the car whilst continuously being raped and beaten by the five attackers.</p>
<p>Anita was reported missing by her family on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_3.html" title="February 3">3 February</a>.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_4.html" title="February 4">4 February</a>, farmer John Reen discovered the naked body of a young woman on his <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prospect%2C_New_South_Wales_7eba.html" title="Prospect, New South Wales">Prospect, New South Wales</a> farm, and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_Police_dd31.html" title="New South Wales Police">Police</a> were called to the scene. The body had been dragged through a <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbed_wire.html" title="Barbed wire">barbed wire</a> fence, bashed, raped and slashed twice across the throat, almost causing <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decapitate.html" title="Decapitate">decapitation</a>. Her neck was apparently being held onto her torso by a thread. There was bruising on her head, breasts, face, shoulders, groin, thighs and legs. Both shoulders and several fingers were also broken, the result of an attempt to restrain Travers from causing her more pain. Her fingers were nearly severed from holding the knife away from her throat; this is why police believed the victim was still alive when her throat was cut.</p>
<p>After investigations of the crime scene, police believed more than one person, possibly a gang, had committed the crime.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_6.html" title="February 6">6 February</a>, the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_of_New_South_Wales_e773.html" title="Government of New South Wales">NSW State Government</a> posted an <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_dollar.html" title="Australian dollar">AUD</a>$50,000 reward for information leading to the capture of her killers.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_9.html" title="February 9">9 February</a>, police re-enacted Anita's movements on the night of her disappearance in the hope of jogging the memories of travellers or others who may have witnessed her movements. Constable Debbie Wallace wore similar clothing to Anita and travelled the 9:12 p.m. train to Blacktown. Detectives interviewed the passengers and showed them photos of Anita whilst Constable Wallace walked the length of the train during the journey.</p>
<p>While in police custody, John Travers requested that his friend be called so she could bring him cigarettes. This simple request was his downfall, as the number was handed to the investigating police who contacted the woman. Although she was terrified of Travers, she agreed to help with the investigation, and met with an officer and gave him details of Travers sadistic and violent background.</p>
<p>The woman, who became known as Mrs. X, talked to Travers and he confessed the crime to her. 'Mrs X' was sent back in to talk to him with a recording device, which she was able to get a confession on.</p>
<p>Eventually 5 men were arrested and charged with the murder. Police were praised for the quick response in capturing all suspects involved. In total, 22 days had elapsed from the time of the murder to the time all suspects were taken into custody.</p>
