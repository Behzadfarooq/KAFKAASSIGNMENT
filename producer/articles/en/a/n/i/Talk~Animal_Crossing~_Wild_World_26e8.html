<dd>This is true. Nintendo has stated AC DS will utilize a friends list of sorts, and you can also blacklist people from your village, if they try to do things like chop down trees. Other people can be invited to your village, and kicked out as well (speculative feature). Plus, no one who is not a native of a village can't enter it if no other natives are online (and in the said village). --<a href="../../../g/a/k/User%7EGakon5_821a.html" title="User:Gakon5">gakon5</a> <a href="../../../g/a/k/User_talk%7EGakon5_4f71.html" title="User talk:Gakon5">(talk)</a> 22:17, August 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>i'm a little confused by the Current Information on this page, and am curious how letters actually work:</p>
<ol>
<li>Players may only visit another player's town if he or she is online.</li>
<li>Players may send letters and items to friends via Nintendo WFC, regardless of their online status. To do this, the player sending the mail must be in the letter recipient's town.</li>
</ol>
<p>does this mean only a player who is online can visit other people's towns, but if that player is online they can visit the town of an offline player and leave them a letter? thanks for any clarification =) and i will post my friends code when i have the game ... <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarpause_04a6.html" title="User:Starpause">Starpause</a> 03:40, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I understand it, you can visit someone if both are online, and both have exchanged friend codes. If the other is not online, but you have his friend code, you would "reach" the gates only, where you could leave a message. If the other is online, he would get a notification, and would be able to either accept or ignore the request. I would think the "offline" messages would be stored in Nintendo Wi-Fi network until the other connects, just like ICQ. Of course, this is what I understand from the article. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 04:27, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, but alexa rankings don't judge how good a site is, just how many people go there. How about one site that's the best for one thing, so there are multiple fansite resources, each one good with one thing, which would be an improvement upon that system, which has slip-ups, like Project Hyrule was the first site to crack the code for the AC for GCN tom nook code system, and they have every code, but were rejected from the AC article due to 'a low alexa ranking'.68.107.17.239 23:57, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think that you should exclude fansites altogether, especially since other wiki pages link to fansites. Many of the links are useful, such as Animal Crossing Ahead (for information), AC:WW Live (for friend finding) and a variety of the forums and communities that were (useful for organizing online trading in a moderated setting). What I do object to is people who are using Wikipedia to advertise their sites. These, I think, are obvious from the "THIS IS THE BIGGEST AC SITE ON THE NET" taglines. They may be relevant links, but presented in such a way that users are misled.67.165.2.106 03:10, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think the review site idea is good, but on the point of advertising, some sites like Project Hyrule made some stuff members only a while back due to it being stolen a lot, so they should say 'sign up needed' if you need to sign up for a forum or something for some info. Either that or make a 'fansites' section for sites that aren't in external links but are worth mentioning, which is just plain stupid, so I go with the former. 68.107.17.239 02:21, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, I'm going to return Animal Crossing Ahead to the link section as a result of this conversation. Animal Crossing Ahead (www.animalxing.com) has a lot of material available on Animal Crossing: Wild World. Concerned parties should feel free to review this site if they disagree, but I think they'll be pleased. It also does not require any plug-ins to view it, so ReyBrujo should be satisfied. Project Hyrule was a useful Animal Crossing site, but having just googled it, I can't find the Animal Crossing: Wild World information. My understanding is that it's mainly a site for Universal Codes that apply to Animal Crossing (GCN) only. Correct me if I'm wrong. Someone else can feel free to add it if they can clarify where the Animal Crossing: Wild World material is. I'm doubly confused by the different sites listed as "Project Hyrule" when you search for it. Lastly, I would like to return Ac:wwlive to the link section, but I believe it requires a plug-in of some sort (I can't tell and wasn't willing to disable my plug-ins for the sake of testing). However, it offers a specialized service for Nintendo wifi users that I can't imagine would be possible without some sort of a script. So I'm going to wait on a response about that link. Someone else who knows better than I can feel free to put it up. Oh, and I'm also going to add a link to www.nintendowifi.com. It's the official wifi site and I have no idea why no one added it earlier. There's an Animal Crossing wifi hub on that page, but I don't believe you can link directly to it without logging into Nintendo, so I'll just add a link to the main page. First time visitors are redirected to a language site anyway. 67.165.2.106 04:40, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Well I am sad you guys took out the fan sites. AnimalCrossingWildworld.com has more traffic than the other sites and ACWW fans often are looking for people to converse with or change friends codes to play online. ACWW doesn't even require email authentication to sign up at their forums. In a month there has been over 600 members join and over 20,000 posts.

A quick Whois search reveals that the domain animalcrossingwildworld.com was created on 08 Sep 2005 10:56:11, while animalxing.com was created on 2002 (dedicated to the original GC version back then). -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 16:25, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia where users can go for basic infomation on, say, a video game. External Links should be a list of major sites (typically official sites) where users can go to find more infomation on the topic at hand.

<dd>There are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links" rel="nofollow">general guidelines for links</a>. Much of the link bloat in this article is due to fan sites, and are the main topic of this discussion. If they add no extra info or there are too many of them, then removing them is appropriate under the guidelines. It is a matter of opinion and debatable which ones are the best. However check the [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing" rel="nofollow">GC Animal Crossing article</a>] and see it has a lot of links, including fansites (but only a few of them).</dd>
<dd>For the AnimalMap link, it is different.

<li>It's not about the topic of infomation provided by either of the two sites (the Icon Maker or the Action Replay aid), it's the fact that the two sites are simply there to aid in gameplay - not to provide infomation on the game that cannot be included in this article. If you want to include reviews *about* the game, that's one thing, but as far as 'how to play' the game, that's what GameFAQs is for. This article isn't about 'here's infomation on any one particular way to play the game', it's about 'here's basic infomation on the game'. As per wiki's External Link's Guidelines, I say the links need to be deleted until a neutral Wikipedia editor would like to comment on if these two links are proper for this kind of site. 71.124.6.74 04:40, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It is not giving a reason to delete it, but instead a valid reason to include it. There are thousands of Animal Crossing sites around that claim to be the biggest AC community in internet; few can give enough proofs, though. That is "fast-growing" doesn't mean it is notable enough. How many registered users it has? How many articles have been created? When was it created? Are you the owner of the site? The <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html#Occasionally_acceptable_links" title="WP:EL">guidelines</a> state that <b>occassionally</b> <i>On articles about topics with many fansites, including a link to one major fansite is appropriate, marking the link as such. In extreme cases, a link to a web directory of fansites can replace this link. (Note: fanlistings are generally not informative and should not ordinarily be included.)</i> Thus, we could find the biggest current fan site, and delete all the others.

<p>I disagree. I visited an Austrailian town over WiFi (I'm American)and in his town, the clock said February but by the looks of it, it was late summer.

<p>While playing, I noticed that the game censors curse words and the word "nigger", but a lot of curse words such as "cock" and "pussy", along with the rest of the racial slurs in the English language, remain uncensored.

<dd>The article's not actually that great, but I'll give you a mini peer review right here of the more obvious problems:
<ul>
<li>Insufficient lead.</li>
<li>Insufficient inline citations with improper formatting.</li>
<li>Images need fair use rationales. I'd rethink the screenshot gallery also.</li>
<li>The Trivia section needs to be removed or at least severely reduced. Things like "Patty the cow's name is very likely derived from 'cow patties,'..." do not belong in an encyclopedia, and this example is also speculation.</li>
<li>Italicize all video game names.</li>
<li>Too many short/one-paragraph sections.</li>
<li>Don't write in the third person. Ex: "...after you get to 1,000 bells..."</li>
<li>The writing also needs work, there's a lot of filler text. Consider this sentence: "<i>Another goal that the player can choose to pursue is that of collecting the fossils, fish and bugs in the game.</i>", which can be replaced by "<i>Players can also collect fossils, fish, and bugs.</i>"</li>
<li>"<i>Unlike most video games, Animal Crossing: Wild World features minimal plot, instead letting the player roam freely and play at their own discretion.</i>" - I'm not sure about that, I can think of a lot of video games with minimal plot, such as early games and just about anything in the puzzle genre. Also, the sentence implies that having a minimal plot is what allows the player to roam freely, but <i>Final Fantasy</i> games have complex plots and let the player roam.</li>

It might be good to link to that site in the Wi-Fi section because that is a site that has a well organised way of swapping friend codes. To play in multiplayer the player needs to use a friend code.

<li><b>Support</b> At this point in time, I would fully support a lock on most of the <i>Animal Crossing</i> game pages (WW, GC, and Series). I do not know why the <i>Animal Crossing</i> pages attract vandalism, but they do. They attract semi-regular obvious vandalism, like section blanking and adding nonsense words and bad language, and then they attract people who just make stuff up which is sometimes harder to catch in articles that really don't use a lot of sourcing because they use the games as a source. I'm not quite sure what a good solution is. I don't like permanent locks, but as long as I've been editing the articles there's been vandalism I think every day.

<dd>As far as my research has revealed, there are no differences between the Australian and the North American release. The seasons in the Australian release are Northern Hemisphere centric and the game contains references to thanksgiving, which we don’t celebrate in Australia. Also, I have no idea why a game developer would have the poor people eating cheese in one country and dirt in another. Considering how much cheese America eats, I doubt it would be presented as the lowest form of nutrition.</dd>

<dd>First, please see the dirt v. cheese section below. Dirt is correct. In fact there are apparently a whole series of jokes in the dirt thing. second, that's correct--there really are no differences between versions game wise. For example in the GC version I believe the Australian version lacked the little E-reader thingy in the post-office because the game lacked e-reader support, but it's differences like that. For each game there is a Japanese version (or many Japanese versions) released first, and then an English version. There are no changes to the game for the various different English releases. They don't do different hemispheres, different holidays, British English v. American English. The only things that ever differ are different technological things sometimes. Also, additional game stuff will be released differently. This is especially true with wifi as it's especially easy for Nintendo to do with wifi--so special items are unlocked different places. But the games are the same and Boondox residents eat dirt in a cornucopia of varieties. And yes, you should. Why haven't you? Non-username editors always seem sorta shady. Mainly because it is so easy to get a username. It's like their hiding something. Except you know, where they log on from. <b><a href="../../../t/s/t/User%7ETStein_937b.html" title="User:TStein">TStein</a> 01:45, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</b></dd>

<p>People who have changed grilled cheese to dirt have been right in doing so. In the game, the town of Boondox is so poor that all they can afford to eat is DIRT. Why would poor people only eat cheese? Isn't cheese a little expensive? I just donated some money to Boondox myself and Pelly said they would be eating 'dirty rice'.</p>
<p>It is even stated in a guide on gamespot.com, under donating to Boondox.</p>

<p>-If this Boondox issue is so big of a problem and is not resolved soon, why not just reword that section of the article? All of this argument over four lines.... There are many ways to say that the town is poor rather than saying exactly what they eat. I, as an avid ACWW player, don't know which statement is right myself, though I'd think "grilled dirt" makes more sense. Also, I've gotten all the feathers and therefore most of the letters from Boondox, and I don't recall a "grilled" anything statement - perhaps the things said in letters are random for different players? - and it isn't at all significant to the game or to gameplay. Also, when the article talks about "surly" residents, does that refer to cranky-personality neighbors? Are they really the only ones who mention it? And is the fund really called the "Boondox Flavor Fund"? Maybe I'm just not very perceptive of the finer details, but I don't remember that. <a href="../../../t/o/a/User%7EToadette_Fan_618e.html" title="User:Toadette Fan">Toadette Fan</a> 05:19, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The 'Boondox Flavor Fund' refers to them eating dirt. You see dirt has no flavor and if we give them money they can buy food that tastes better. They could buy something with lots af flavor that they couldn't usually afford, like... cheese.</p>
<p>What ever they eat in Boondox, it always contains dirt. Red Pooka may of seen something like ‘on special occasions they eat grilled cheese on dirt’ and didn’t take in the running joke on dirt. Please go to the post office now and donate one Bell to Boondox and I assure you Pelly will mention DIRT and not CHEESE.</p>
<p>Some AC:WW residents criticize the Boondox donation fund as fraud and claim that the money goes into the Mayor’s pockets.124.184.25.217 09:13, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Darn, I did go donate more, but Pelly is only mentioning how that after donating so much, Boondox becoming so well-off that "THEY should be donating to US" (which brings up another fact to put in the article - once enough Bells are donated, the town's name is changed to Boondopolis). However, I found a source for the "dirt" thing (as well as the Flavor Fund - I guess I did just miss that while playing, sorry!), though only a walkthrough. Would it work? From <a href="http://faqs.ign.com/articles/681/681130p1.html" class="external free" title="http://faqs.ign.com/articles/681/681130p1.html" rel="nofollow">http://faqs.ign.com/articles/681/681130p1.html</a>: 'Have you heard of the town of Boondox? It lies far north of here. Life in this remote town is very modest. One might even call it meagre. Of course, they live without the flashy clothes or music that we take for granted. But the saddest aspect of life in Boondox is the flavourless diet. The townsfolk there eat nothing but grilled cheese morning, noon and night! But the real tragedy is that they have no cheese! Or bread! So they are forced to eat <b>grilled dirt</b>, or, on special occasions, scrambled dirt! WITHOUT KETCHUP! Oh, have you ever heard of anything so terrible? Wouldn't you like to treat the Boondoxians to pastries and cinnamon toast? I thought so. That's why your help in the Boondox Flavour Fund' is so crucial! It will bring flavour to this otherwise flavourless town. Please help.

<dd>I asked on a forum (I asked for direct quotes and screenshots if available). So far I've gotten the following answers:
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>"they eat Dirt. They are dirt farmers.. Poor guys.."</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>"I gave $ today and it said "dirty rice"."</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Ok people? Until proven otherwise it's dirt, NOT cheese, because while they eat grilled cheese morning, noon and night, they don't have cheese to make the grilled cheese with so they clearly are not actually eating cheese! They don't have bread either, so they don't eat grilled cheese sans cheese! They eay dirt. Apparently they can afford a grill and a frying pan, but let's not quibble people. After all, you can register for everything for the kitchen except the food. <b><a href="../../../t/s/t/User%7ETStein_937b.html" title="User:TStein">TStein</a> 09:38, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</b></dd>

</dd>
<dd>So, they go from grilled dirt sandwhiches (sans cheese sans bread), to dirty rice (made with dirt instead of spices) to pastry. Hopefully they aren't dirt-filled. <b><a href="../../../t/s/t/User%7ETStein_937b.html" title="User:TStein">TStein</a> 06:00, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</b></dd>

<p>Okay it's going to sound like I'm an idiot, but I read through this whole article and I have no idea what this game is about. I've never heard of this series before, and the article seems aimed at people who have played various other Animal Crossing games before. I think this article could improve on some general background of the play enviroment, what players do to interact with the world, what players "typically do" when they play, etc. I fully understand from reading it that's an open ended game, but that doesn't tell me what gameplay is like.</p>
<p>For one strict example, one thing I understand after reading this is apparently it's possible to visit other people's "houses" or something. But then what? Do you communicate with others, play games with each other, etc.?</p>
<p>Perhaps some screenshots could help the article. But in summary, it just needs SOMETHING to help those who have NEVER played any of these games before! --157.234.254.6 18:02, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
