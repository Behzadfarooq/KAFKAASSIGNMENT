<p>Please consider this inital issue to be a prototype; as always, any comments and suggestions are quite welcome, and will help us improve the newsletter in the coming months.</p>

<p>Salut! Cred ca ai vazut si tu ce face idiotu' ala de Jayig la articolul despre <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanians.html" title="Romanians">Romanians</a>, la sectiunea Canada. Inca n-am vazut la nici un articol pe site-u' asta asa ceva, sa fie scris numarul de persoane cu single sau mixed origin. Am incercat sa-l opreasc sa faca asta, da ma blocat un administrator care cred ca tine cu iel. Trebe sa punem inapoi cum a fost acolo, adica 131,000 off. - 400,000 est. Tu ce zici de asta?

<dd>Pai chestia e ca au modificat intelegerea noastra care am facut acolo, adica sa lasam numarul oficial de 131,000 si sa punem estimarea de 400,000, dar el a modificat-o dupa stilul lui bun de nimic. Cand am modificat pagina cum a fost inainte, am fost blocat de un administrator. Adica vreau sa zic ca pur si simplu nu ne pasa daca sunt de mixed sau single origin, vrem numarul "intreg", cum tot cuprins, ca si cum am facut la USA. Cred ca ar trebui sa contactez mai multi administratori romani, pt ca ala care ma blocat a scris ca daca mai modifica cineva pagina aia il blocheaza.

<dd>The only things not acceptable are you and the rest of those useless housewives that only wait to have an excuse to act and provoke. You're right about one thing: I've learned nothing from you because there's nothing to learn, except that you're a scumbag. Block me for 12-hours, 12 days, or block me permanently.

<p>When the Jews of Spain were forced to leave Spain, they promised they would never return. What exactly did they say? Did they make a powerful statement?

<dd>I have no idea; I'm not even sure how one can say than an entire people "makes a promise", or whether a (possibly extorted) promise should be given any weight (especially any notion of a promise that, to be meaningful, would have to pass down the generations in a people who were, after all, being dispersed at that very moment).

<p>Anittas, the template may be updated every six hours. In reality, the frequency of updates depends on the number of nominations on DYK talk page and on the activity of updating admins. So you can never tall how long your article will be exposed on the Main Page. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">Ghirla</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo">-трёп-</a></sup> 15:02, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately, the main updating admin has been on vacations and the template has been updated very irregularly these days. Last week, the template wouldn't be updated for a day or more, which led to the nomination page becoming quite a backlog, with some nominations going stale. Therefore, I asked Cactus.man to make an update yesterday evening, in order to save your own nominations from being discarded as too stale. Today, the regularly updating admin finally appeared and, deciding that your and other articles had had sufficient exposure on the Main Page, updated it. As his update came after six hours after the previous one, his actions were perfectly legitimate. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">Ghirla</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo">-трёп-</a></sup> 15:02, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Anittas, I am actually glad to see that there is less tolerance in Wikipedia nowadays than it used to be towards the badmoutning. I don't know either whether Deng was particularly bad although he is sort of a short-tempered guy. But since it was Woohokitty I had past discussions with on the issue, I contacted him because here we have an extreme case of a really filthy mouth. Let me just add in the end that I am glad that you and I are talking civilly. I think you were somehwat radicalized by Bonny in the past and with his influence fading away (except occasional sock outbursts) we should just work together fine, shouldn't we?

<dd>Alright, first of all: Anittas, you're going to have to put up with me until you can start following policy, simple as that. If that makes you uncomfortable, then I suggest you start treating other users with more respect as soon as possible. Secondly, to both of you, there is NEVER an excuse for making a personal attack, and that includes retaliation. If you can point me to the user who made the above comment, I will be more than happy to deal with him. Finally, again to both of you, post in english whenever possible. This is the English wikipedia, and thusly will allow for more openess and review of your posts. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 18:43, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's very true that I've noticed only the size of the page, which in my opinion is huge enough to take the decision to make an archive. I haven't look more deeper at the on-going discussions.<a href="../../../g/d/p/User%7EGDP_6fc5.html" title="User:GDP">GDP</a> 18:58, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What are you talking about? It's Bonny. If it's proven that it's not, I'll retract my words. He's been doing this for months and the admins that are actively involved in the conflict ban him on sight. AGF is not a policy, therefore, I don't have to assume good faith.

<dd>That's not how this works. If there's no proof that this is Bonaparte (which there currently isn't), you can't go around making those accusations.

<p>Is Node really a Moldovan (or of Moldovan descent)? If he really is 17 years old (like Bonny claimed), then he would have lived in Moldovan SSR for at least three years, so he would have had some command of the language before the borders opened, and his family would normally continue speaking it after moving abroad. If this is not what happened, then the claim is moot, because the Moldovan ethnicity (like the Montenegrin and Macedonian ethnicities), wasn't created (i.e. invented by a communist dictator, just like in the other two cases) until after the establishment of the USSR. --<a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelex_3d37.html" title="User:Telex">Telex</a> 20:23, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Anittas, please concentrate on the content and leave Node alone. He is whoever he considers himself and he considers himself Moldovan. The rest is none of our business. Almost none of the Soviet Jews of the post-war generation spoke any Hebrew or Yiddish and almost none ever been to sinagogue. The majority could not (sadly) tell the main differences between the Judaism and Christianity. Still, they all felt as they were Jewish which they rightfully could, especially in view of sneaky and officially denied anti-Semitism of the post-war Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The person ethnicity is what he feels first of all and in any case it's none of anyone's business. Deal with his edits and put the rest aside.</p>
<p>I suggest you don't engage into any discussion with any of the Bonny's socks and, better yet, eliminate his entries from your talk. Please help us all with more articles on medieval battles or whatever that you want to do.</p>
