<p>Does anyone rememember the tv show? I remember watching it on nick. I really think the tv show at least deserves a section or a link or something. It was part of the Animorphs. I as a fan recorded it when it came on. Dissapointed at the quality of the show, but not really my point. It was even advertised in the books. If you picked up a book it would usually say "Make sure to watch on Nick!" So it was there. I just don't know what to say about it.Bhold1 02:49, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>We have absolutly <i>no</i> proof of Jake's last name being Berenson. No last names were mentioned in the books, and, as far as my friend inside Nickelodeon knows, Applegate forbidded their use on the show. If she claimed the last name in an interview, or any other media NOT in continuity in the TV show or book series, please conferm this. Until then, I'm erasing this piece of information from the artical. --<a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWack%27d_About_Wiki_b3f0.html" title="User:Wack'd About Wiki">Wack'd About Wiki</a> 22:14, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, Jake mentions in the second to last book (#53 — <i>The Answer</i>) that his last name is Berenson. It's in the second sentence of Chapter 2.
<blockquote>
<p>My name is Jake. Jake Berenson. The days of secrecy, of lurking in the shadows are over. The Yeerks know my name. They know my height, weight, eye color, Social Security number, and favorite foods. At long last they know the word <i>Animorph</i>, Marco's word for us.</p>
</blockquote>
His last name is also mentioned in the last book (#54 — <i>The Beginning</i>) in Chapter 12.
<blockquote>
<p>Suddenly the reading of the indictment was over. The prosecution was ready to call its first witness. "We call Jake Berenson." I stood up. My legs were stiff from sitting.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the author does not use a neutral point of view when describing Taylor. Words such as "Weak" and "Misguided" are (in my experience) not usually used in a neutral point of view. An argument could be put forth that Taylor was in fact stronger than she appeared, due to the fact that she returned from a near guarenteed death, in much the same manner as Edriss 562. Could the article perhaps be changed to a neutral POV? <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrisco_1492_0140.html" title="User:Crisco 1492">Crisco 1492</a> 07:28, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm overjoyed to hear that Animorphs was the second-most successful children's book series of all time, but I think it'd be more believable if we had some sources to back it up.</p>

<p>I thank you for your comments concerning Taylor's bias. I gave Taylor her own section, and fixed the statement about Taylor's 'weakness' and 'misguidedness'. I also tried to discuss Taylor's strengths, but I'll try to add more to that.</p>

<p>Hi, I've heard that in the beginning of the books, when it says something like "I'd like to thank so-and-so for help with this manuscript" that that person actually wrote most of the book, and that Applegate just reviewed over it and maybe made some changes. I've heard that many changes were made in #32 (the Separation I think), where Mean Rachel was either made more mean or less mean.</p>
<p>Anyway, did those people really write those books? And if so, shouldn't they get proper credit in the 'List of Animorphs books' section?</p>
<p>Amphax 01:27, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Folks, as far as I know (quite a lot, if it's Animorphs we're talking about&#160;:P), the people who are mentioned in the dedication pages of books were NOT ghostwriters. They had supplied her with information regarding the book, or served as inspiration...but that's about it.

<dd>It's been stated many times that, with a few minor exceptions, the dedication "The author would like to help so-and-so with their help in preparing this manuscript" means that the book was ghostwritten. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattManic7325_0ce2.html" title="User:MattManic7325">Matt</a> 17:33, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This page seems to be little more then a hub of links to information about different aspects of the series. Should the maion page not be more of a summary of the books themselves and their place in the real world and all that?</p>
<p>Also does anyone happen to know of a summary replete with spoilers somewhere on the net? I only read to book 18 and want to know how it happened without just going and reading the last one...--<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosquius_a7b7.html" title="User:Josquius">Josquius</a> 14:08, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This page definitely needs a summary of the series as a whole, spoilers included. Anyone interested?</p>

<p>I don't think we should display the main characters' last names, because they were purposely not given until the end of the series. Under the individual characters' article is a different matter.

Wikipedia should only include major viewpoints - that is, by another source. However, Animorphs has been extordinarily low-key - running from 1996-2001, in the infancy of the Internet, not much has been published online about this series. Even if it had been published in this era, I highly doubt that any major organizations or anything would have published anything on it. I pruned out some commentary and tried to make it more factual in nature though... <a href="../../../h/b/d/User%7EHbdragon88_4994.html" title="User:Hbdragon88">Hbdragon88</a> 18:51, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've removed the following section from the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>In the last book, the hometown of the Animorphs is stated to be somewhere near <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Barbara%2C_California_69ec.html" title="Santa Barbara, California">Santa Barbara, California</a>. However, this is contradicted by the descriptions of the animals that the Animorphs acquire and encounter. For instance, Applegate depicts wild packs of wolves in forest areas in the state. However, no <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolves.html" title="Wolves">wolves</a> have existed in the wild in California since 1924 <a href="http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/cawolf.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/cawolf.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../g/r/i/Grizzly_bears.html" title="Grizzly bears">Grizzly bears</a> became extinct in the wild in 1909, and the last grizzly in captivity died around 1922 <a href="http://www.library.ca.gov/history/cahinsig.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.library.ca.gov/history/cahinsig.cfm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. After this no grizzly bear, which is Rachel's dominant morph, lived in California until 1996, the year Scholastic published <i>Animorphs</i> and likely a while after Applegate originally wrote Rachel's morph into the storyline. A mother grizzly from <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellowstone_National_Park_578c.html" title="Yellowstone National Park">Yellowstone National Park</a>, along with her two young cubs, faced <a href="../../../e/u/t/Euthanasia.html" title="Euthanasia">euthanasia</a> for coming too close to visitors. Moonridge Animal Park, a small wildlife rescue preserve in <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Bear_Lake%2C_California_3844.html" title="Big Bear Lake, California">Big Bear</a>, led a fundraising effort to rescue the three <a href="http://www.moonridgezoo.org/map/animals2.html#grizzly" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.moonridgezoo.org/map/animals2.html#grizzly" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. No other facility in California has grizzly bears to this date. Rachel acquires the grizzly morph at Cassie's mother's zoo, nowhere near the wildlife preserves.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Animorphs' <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slang.html" title="Slang">slang</a> also comes into question in terms of their location. Specifically, Jake exclaims, "That was so absolute!" in reference to how flying feels. Later in the same book, Tobias explains that it feels good to sit on the couch watching television with some "pop" (<a href="../../../s/o/f/Soft_drinks.html" title="Soft drinks">soft drinks</a>). People native to Southern California do not speak this way. Some of the jargon that the Animorphs use aligns more with East Coast and/or Mid-West than Californian. However, it is possible that some of the Animorphs were not born in this place, thus allowing such slang to be OK, or have parents who were not born in such areas, thus influencing such slang through domination of "nurture" compared to "nature" raising.</dd>
</dl>
<p>All of these supposed problems are minor quibbles that are explained in the book if you care to look.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Wolves in California:</b> Cassie specifically states that wolves were being reintroduced in their area.</li>
<li><b>Grizzly bears in zoos:</b> OK, so there were no zoos with grizzly bears in California at that time. There were no Yeerks in California either. This is a tiny thing to pick at, which does not require a huge stretch of the imagination and easily fits under poetic license.</li>
<li><b>Slang terms:</b> This offers its own explanation, and even if it were valid I don't think it's worth mentioning without the other two.</li>
</ul>

<p>I was about to wiki-link the list of ghost-written books to the books' articles when I noticed that some books have their own article, while other articles are done in sections of 10 books. Is there any rhyme or reason to this? We should have a codified way of doing that, be it groups of ten or individually. My vote is that each book have its own article, so we CAN wiki-link to the seperate articles if need be. Any thoughts before I actually change this? --<a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndlessVince_8ffe.html" title="User:EndlessVince">EndlessVince</a> 04:46, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
