<h2><span class="mw-headline">Creating Anime</span></h2>
<p>How is creating anime different from creating animation? This question is directed at the "Techniques" section. <a href="../../../k/y/u/User%7EKyuuA4_26f7.html" title="User:KyuuA4">KyuuA4</a> 09:58, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Style Section</span></h2>
<p>Can it be possible to use a list format to describe some style features found in most (or all) anime? Basically, the list would appear like the Genre section. <a href="../../../k/y/u/User%7EKyuuA4_26f7.html" title="User:KyuuA4">KyuuA4</a> 20:33, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am surprised at the lack of a critical section. This reads like an article by and for anime fans, not the general audience. As for criticisms, it is easy to think of several. Note these qualities do not have to apply to every single anime in order to be accurately descriptive of the medium as a whole. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.81.118.101 (<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.81.118.101.html" title="User talk:64.81.118.101">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.81.118.101_9ac3.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.81.118.101">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>Anime is animation from Japan... unless the criticism is about the Japanese people who make anime.. I'm not sure what you're getting at. Anime isn't a "genre". Your example shows this, that criticism is usually about individual works, but to criticize all of anime simply for the sake of having a "criticism" section is just silly. All animes are not always related, you can't generalize it like that. Anime creators have a wide range of styles and approaches and ideas. The only way this is just "pro" anime is because of a lack of "anti" anime, but we can't have "anti" anime because we can't judge it all in one shot like that. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 06:49, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've ran into a bunch of opinions on the web describing anime "childish" animation, among other things. Give me a few days, and I'll try to relocate it. But I still feel this article is biased. (i.e the creator of anime is a <i>legandary</i> artist sounds to me like an opinion, not fact). There is also alot of weasel words throughtout the article. -- <a href="../../../s/e/l/User%7ESelmo_247a.html" title="User:Selmo"><b>Selmo</b></a> 21:29, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I don't doubt that you will be able to find someone who's prejudice against anime by generalizing all of it as one entity, but those kinds of opinions are the POV we should be keeping out of this article. Putting in a criticism section in <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html" title="Anime">Anime</a> is like putting in a "Criticism of Theatre" in <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theatre.html" title="Theatre">Theatre</a> or Criticism of books in <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book.html" title="Book">Book</a>.

<dd>You are not suggesting something appropriate, and I have not deleted anything... Removing things that say "gee wizz, anime is great" would be fine by me.

<dd>Hi all, I invite both Selmo and Ned Scott to further their discussion on whether there should be a criticism section for this Anime entry on the dispute resolution page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-08-25_Anime" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-08-25_Anime" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. It would probably be better for Ned to state his case against a criticism section first, if Selmo doesn't mind. <a href="../../../j/s/w/User%7EJsw663_4769.html" title="User:Jsw663">Jsw663</a> 21:13, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>OK I didn't completely understand your POV before but I'm taking as hands-off an approach as possible. I hope Selmo replies soon though. <a href="../../../j/s/w/User%7EJsw663_4769.html" title="User:Jsw663">Jsw663</a> 05:16, 28 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think the whole mediation case is just Selmo's attempt to push his POV about a criticism section. He opens the case within three days of first complaining about the absents of criticism about anime. He didn't even try to <i>negotiate</i> as he claims in the case nor offered any help in writing such a section. Instead, he claims that the criticism is out there to be found by others and then demands that the section be written. That's dictating, not negotiation. And the fact that he rant to mediation so quickly should make his actions suspect. The fact that he opened that case without even attempting to fix what he saw as a problem really irritates the hell out of me.</dd>

<dd>Now I will say that I think the article will benefit from such a section. But as I stated above and on the mediation case, not just any criticism section will do. And I think the criteria I gave above are more then fair. But the article is better off with no criticism section then a poorly researched, poorly written, and unsourced criticism section. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">TheFarix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 15:36, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>I join Ned Scott in that. Anime is too general to be criticised as a whole. However, sourced criticism is appropriate in context in the rest of the article. Let me bring up a sentence that I would tag with "what the hell"</p>

<p>Anime is childish at times because some anime is aimed for children. Other anime is aimed for an older audience. Plain and simple. Criticisms could be aimed at the conflict of diffrence of culture, between Japan and Western Countries. Really main criticisms could come from Hentai, and it's more questionable forms. (Loli, Shota) Also it could be the frankness of Homosexual relations, which America still isn't comfortable on. <a href="../../../a/g/i/User%7EAGiganticPanda_6b82.html" title="User:AGiganticPanda">A Gigantic Panda</a> 05:52, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is Wonderful Days/Sky Blue (a Korean animated film) an anime? It sure looks like one, but it wasn't created in Japan. Oh, does it count as an anime because it's geared towards adults? I guess "kiddy" shows you see on Saturday mornings are simply cartoons, not animes, because they are geared towards a younger audience. Then I guess that makes Pokemon, Digimon, One-Piece, Sugar: A Little Snow Fairy, etc, cartoons and not animes, right? So, where do we draw the line?</p>

<p>Anime MEANS animation in Japanese, but in English it is to refer to any cartoon produced in Japan. Thus, if it's made in Korea, it's not an anime. Pokemon, Digimon, One Piece, and Sugar are all anime because they were produced in Japan. It is NOT the style of the art that makes an animation an anime. Super Milk-Chan, for example, looks little like traditional anime, but as it is produced in Japan, it is, in fact, an anime.71.100.15.139 10:46, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Which holds higher value? The Japanese meaning OR the English meaning. Obviously, TWO meanings for "anime" exists. Ironically, we are not referring to the meaning by the country it originally came from. Nevertheless, anime does have a distinct set of animation techniques. Some aspects of Japanese animation does set it apart from other forms of animation. Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the idea of Japanese animation techniques used outside Japan. <a href="../../../k/y/u/User%7EKyuuA4_26f7.html" title="User:KyuuA4">KyuuA4</a> 01:34, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Disagree. Anime is a "style". Just like manga. For your information, manga is produced outside Japan, and we've seen that happen in the form of webcomics such as <a href="../../../v/a/n/Van_Von_Hunter_a575.html" title="Van Von Hunter">Van Von Hunter</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatokyo.html" title="Megatokyo">Megatokyo</a>. They may not look like the best manga out there - unlike the material we're accustomed to seeing. At least, their products are being published and sold under manga sections in book stores. However, manga is manga regardless of who and where it is produced. Therefore, if manga can be produced outside Japan, then why can't anime be produced outside Japan? <a href="../../../k/y/u/User%7EKyuuA4_26f7.html" title="User:KyuuA4">KyuuA4</a> 05:43, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, it is not "anime" because that means "The MAXX" (based on Sam Keith's comic) would be. In the West, animation from Japan with adult content and sex are called "hentai". {<a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukikanou_6f17.html" title="User:Yukikanou">yukikanou</a> 6:07, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, an anime can also be created by a Japanese company for another country's market. For example, Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust was originally released in the United States. Same with The Animatrix (which IS an anime). Also, the upcoming Trigun film is being made most likely because of the success of Trigun overseas; Trigun didn't do as well in Japan. <a href="../../../f/i/c/User%7EFiction_Alchemist_0e1d.html" title="User:Fiction Alchemist">Fiction Alchemist</a> 16:09, 22 August 2006 (UTC) (sorry for the late sign)</dd>

<p>Anime should not be restricted to Japanese animation. Instead, more attention should be paid to the style of the animation. If need be, also look into the storyline. Is there criteria to discern animated works as being anime or non-anime? Even so, credit does go to Japan for developing the anime-style. <a href="../../../k/y/u/User%7EKyuuA4_26f7.html" title="User:KyuuA4">KyuuA4</a> 16:33, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, see the fallacy of the definition of "anime is animation from Japan". Some of this stuff looks like old Western style animation. Aww hell, some of it looks like Canadian animation. Yet, we look at them as anime, just because they're from Japan. While I disagree to quality being a factor in defining anime, we cannot exclude failed Japanese animation from being included into "anime". Or do we? <a href="../../../k/y/u/User%7EKyuuA4_26f7.html" title="User:KyuuA4">KyuuA4</a> 03:30, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Categorizing an animation as "anime" by "style" alone is not something I really want to consider; how "like" a Japanese anime would a US animation have to be for us to call it "anime"? Or would we label it "anime" if the creators claimed it was? If a Japanese animation didn't fit within whatever style parameters were were operating on, could we no longer call it anime? <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShiroi_Hane_f5af.html" title="User:Shiroi Hane">Shiroi Hane</a> 17:13, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But that is exactly what's happening when determining an anime vs a non-anime. Popular consensus labels anime to be a Japanese product. From this, it implies the impossibility of producing anime outside Japan. That is ludicrious. Oh, and yes. I was incorrect with the story-telling conventions of anime. This was due to thinking about Hamtaro which is considered an anime but does not follow typical anime storyline conventions. <a href="../../../k/y/u/User%7EKyuuA4_26f7.html" title="User:KyuuA4">KyuuA4</a> 05:50, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just my 2 cents here: I think the definiton boils down to a Japanese company distributing it.

<dd>For your information, shows from the US are brought over to Japan and dubbed on Japanese. Particularly Star Trek: The Next Generation.

<p>So what about when some of the production is done by a Japanese company, such as the case with Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker? A Japanese animation studio (TMS Entertainment) helped with the production. So is Batman Beyond: ROTJ half-cartoon, half anime? What makes something anime and something else not anime? How much must be produced by a Japanese animation studio for people to label it as "anime"? In the future, if this animation-style becomes more widely adopted by producers all over the world, what will the definition of "anime" look like then? Is anime not popular mainly because of its style (both in animation and story), and not the country from which it originated? Or am I gravely mistaken? If a French chef prepares an Italian dish in Paris, would it make any sense to label it as a French dish? 70.115.234.217 22:12, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That one is difficult, but I would say that if the writing, directing, animating, EVERYTHING is done in Japan, then it would be an anime. Thus, Batman Beyond wouldn't qualify.

<p>Anyway, moving on... I'm reading through these comments... I'm not singling out anyone in particular when I say this... The word in anime means Japanese cartoon and there's really no honest way around that. Period. Actually, I think it was a mistake for other countries to adopt the word "anime", because now people think they can get nearly anything qualified as an anime, when the word was intended as the label for Japanese cartoons. Perhaps "Japanime" sounds crude, but it sure would keep people from using "Teen Titans is an anime because of the way it looks" arguments. <a href="../../../f/i/c/User%7EFiction_Alchemist_0e1d.html" title="User:Fiction Alchemist">Fiction Alchemist</a> 04:27, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Anime means animation; or more correctly, it is how the japanese SAY animation by shortening the word(its written in <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katakana.html" title="Katakana">katakana</a> ). ANIME by the CORRECT definnition are CARTOONS. the word should not ONLY applied to cartoon that come from Japan, the correct word would be JAPANESE ANIMATION. MANGA just is the word for comic book in Japanese. An AMIERCAN COMIC could be called manga (american manga correctly). Yes i did put empthasis between america and japan.</p>
<p>Lets face it. Americans tend to twist Japanese words (otaku, manga, anime, hentai etc.) to make it only apply to Japanese pop-culture, and vice versa(I think) or simply, its a japanese word thats cool-sounding (and vice versa), but dont know the real definition, or language (to be fluent or partly.)</p>

<p>One of my favourite catchphrases on the difference between cartoons and anime:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>All anime are cartoons, but not all cartoons are anime.</b></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Avatar is not an anime, it is a cartoon produced by two Americans, in America, for Nickelodeon. Likewise, <a href="../../../v/a/n/Van_Von_Hunter_a575.html" title="Van Von Hunter">Van Von Hunter</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatokyo.html" title="Megatokyo">Megatokyo</a> are not manga, they are American comics done in a manga style, and published in digest format. Is Runaways manga simply because they publish it in digest format as well?</p>
<p>Even though "anime" is literally "animation" in JAPANESE, I don't have a huge problem with it being taken to other countries. When they overexagerate the japanese style, such as in Shuriken School, or Kappa Mikey, that goes a little overboard. But Avatar is okay, because it sticks more to the somewhat orignal style, even if the style does vary. The question "is it okay for Americans to make anime?" is basicaly the same as "Are dubs okay?" I don't like dubs, but I don't have a problem with them. Same with American anime and such. - Lightbeam911</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">History and Synonyms sections</span></h2>
<p>I was just passing by and thought I'd comment that your history section seems somewhat lacking. It goes right from the 20's to the 70's, completely skipping over the 50's and 60's, Tezuka, Astroboy, Kimba, etc. It says nothing about the various waves of popularity in America and so forth. You might want to do some expanding there.</p>
<p>Also, in your Synonyms section, since when has "Manga" been confused with "Anime?" Anime is the Japanization of animation, and Manga is the Japanization of magazine, meaning comics. Has anime fandom truly fallen into such disarray that fans have forgotten the distinctly different meaning of the two words? <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerri_Rhoades_c357.html" title="User:Perri Rhoades">Perri Rhoades</a> 05:44, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sweeping Image Revisions</span></h2>
<p>This is going to be a controversial suggestion (partly why I just didn't do it - sweeping changes tend to get off-the-hip reverts) - but consider it for a moment before replying. Right now there are a number of images in the article - that while appropriate to the overall context of the article, do not fit with the sections that they are in. Therefore, I would like to recommend the following changes; some of these make sense purely on their own so most of them should be considered on a case-by-case basis:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Cowboy Bebop image is fine as it is, however the top of the page might need a style tweak (i.e. move menu to the right)</li>
<li>The Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Shiryu images be removed as they are irrelevant in the context of genres due to the fact that links to various examples are provided. <b>Or</b>, they could be moved to the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html#See_also" title="Anime">See Also</a> section to fill some of the white space</li>
<li>The Astroboy image be moved to the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html#History" title="Anime">History</a> section as a historical representation of anime</li>
<li>The Macross 7 image is fine in it's current location as it is a good example of music in anime</li>
<li>The Lum image be moved to the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html#Commercial_appeal" title="Anime">Commercial Appeal</a> as she is a good indication of one of the commercial appeals of anime</li>
<li>The Mylene Jenius be slightly enlarged and moved down to the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html#Style" title="Anime">Style</a> section as she is a good stereotypical example of the "big eyes, small mouth" style</li>
<li>The FLCL image be removed from the page as it is not a good "overall" representation of anime</li>
<li>The Casshan OVA image is removed as a visual example of an OVA is not needed on an "overall" look and feel page. I have added it to the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_video_animation.html" title="Original video animation">Original video animation</a> page as it is more relevant on that page.</li>
<li>The School Rumble fansub image be removed as it does not enhance that small section of the article and is included on the fansub page</li>
<li>I'm on the fence about the Castle in the Sky robot image - it's not anime, so it doesn't really fit the page, but it is good white space filler for the section.</li>

<dd>I like the suggested changes. Perhaps we could try to have images of the discussed anime near the place they are discussed. The Cowboy Bebop image should be replaced with something more iconic.

<p>The Cowboy Bebop image is fine, it's representative too, you have Spike, who has a slanted-line smile, a line nose, and a long, thin face, Jet, who has a rounded face, a more detailed nose and a line frown, Ed, who has large eyes, a happy, open-mouthed expression, a triangular jaw and a lack of a nose except for a dot, and Faye, who has a small nose and a small, slightly open-mouthed expression. All four have differences in the way their hair has been done, and they have varied clothing types and expressions. There's also Ein, who is an example of how animals look in animé. This is a really good example of animé, as it encompasses different forms and styles, with clear variations between the characters.</p>

<p>What falls under the criteria of Anime and Non-Anime? As a reminder, the Japanese consider anything animated as "anime"; by which, it is synonymous to the set "animation".

<dd>The line between traditional animation and CGI has become so blurred that it's largely useless to make dictions between the two. You will essentially be arguing about degrees, such as a series that is 75% CGI and 25% traditional would be considered anime, so why shouldn't a 90% to 100% CGI series/film be considered anime as well. Or why should a film that is 100% CGI but still retains the "look and feel" of traditional animation be considered anime? Fortunately for us, CGI does appear to be included as anime. Can't say the same for stop motion since there is very little Japanese stop motion animations to begin with. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">TheFarix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 20:39, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Duuuuh Farix, The. Listen to the American Heritage Dictionary, anime is "A style of animation developed in Japan, characterized by stylized colorful art, futuristic settings, violence, and sex." Or the blatantly copied&amp;tyoped dictionary.com 'Unabridged (v 1.0.1)' version, "a Japanese style of motion-picture animation, charaacterized by highly stylized, colorful art, futuristic settings, and sexuality and violence."</p>

<p>Anime’s current popularity in the United States can best be described as a cultural <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_film.html" title="Cult film">cult hit</a>. With the exceptions of child-oriented series (some being <a href="../../../e/d/i/Editing_of_anime_in_American_distribution_ae65.html" title="Editing of anime in American distribution">highly edited</a> to conform to Americans’ standards of what childrens’ shows should be, sometimes to the dismay of fans of the uncensored version), anime remains largely unaccepted in America’s mainstream society. AnimeNation’s <a href="../../../a/n/i/AnimeNation_ff4e.html" title="AnimeNation">John Oppliger</a> had this to say on the matter:</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">The support for anime among American anime fans is very strong. The availability of anime in America is truly impressive, especially within the anime fan community. Awareness of Japanese animation in America is at an all time high. However, mainstream acceptance of anime in America lags far behind the advances anime has made in other respects. A close examination of the support for anime on American television may provide a revealing and realistic gauge of the actual penetration of anime into America and American culture. Anime may seem like it's tremendously successful in America because it's high profile, but the facts tell another story.
<p>According to AC Nielsen, Pixar's <i>The Incredibles</i> sold 16 million copies on DVD in America last year. <i>Shark Tale</i> sold nearly 10 million copies. Even the DVD release of <i>Bambi</i> sold 6 million copies in 2005. In comparison, all three <i>Inuyasha</i> movies combined have sold just over 1 million copies in the past year and a half. Evidently, the success of anime in America is very relative. American anime fans are very devoted. Through underground means hardcore American fans now have access to brand new Japanese anime before even many Japanese residents do. America's anime fan community is influential because it's affluent, intelligent, and motivated. But it's not very large.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>And I'm moving it back, since it says pretty much everything that needs to be said, from a credible source (he has his own section in a Wikipedia article). So, unless you can find some specific problem with it, keep it there. Anything else that could be added is just personal observation and would have no direct references; there aren't exactly dozens of studies on the popularity of anime. Add anything you wish here and work on it, but for now the above stays in the article.

<p>Any articles on the "anime craze" undoubtedly are discussing Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh! The few that discuss adult-oriented stuff make the people who like it seem like total freaks and perverts. Good luck finding stuff though. And the term "cultural cult hit" was taken from the book "Anime: From Akira to Princess Mononoke" by prof. Susan Napier (used as a reference elswhere in the article). Not to mention, the quote contains information from AC Nielsen. Really, it's pretty much everything that needs to be said in one quote.

<p>I think it's a very good example of the anime style, personally. It contains various different characters, each with their own distinct anime-style image. Besides, there are other images throughout the article that illustrate some of the other popular anime series.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Promote talk/section to pronunciation of "anime" (both English and Japanese).</span></h2>
<p>Sorry. Being semi-new to the Wikipedia community, I didn't mean to impose on anybody.<br /></p>
<p>But, because I've been hearing "anime" pronounced in so many various forms, I'd like to have some people devote a section to just the pronuncation of the word "anime," of which would include both the Japanese pronunciation as well as the English pronunciation. Although, yes, anime is derived from the word "animation," I feel that is justly why people should contribute to a section on how the hiragana/katagana is pronounced as well as how the English version of the word is pronounced. Besides, it'll look better than a description lumped into the introduction of the article.</p>
<p>Rather, in addition to the IPA pronunciation method (because most people don't seem to understand it), add another part of it, such as:</p>
<p>あ / ア "ah" is pronounced like . . . I don't know. the "ah" sound in "art?"</p>
<p>に/ ニ "ni" is pronounced like the word "need."</p>
<p>め/メ "me" like in "maid" or "make."</p>
<p><br />
I mean, while trying to consider everybody's respective accents, this should still come out fairly clear.</p>

<dd>I think this is unnecessary to the topic of anime - it really belongs in the category of Japanese language. "The pronunciation of anime in English differs significantly from Japanese. The first vowel is further forward in English than Japanese: [æ] is more likely than [ɑ]. As English and Japanese stress words differently, the second vowel is likely to emerge as an unstressed schwa ([ə] or [I] in English, whereas in Japanese each syllable carries equal stress. As with a few other Japanese words such as Pokémon and Kobo Abé, anime is sometimes spelled as animé in English with an acute accent over the final e to cue the reader that the letter is pronounced as Japanese [e]. However, this accent does not appear in romanized Japanese, and English native speakers may produce [eI]." seems to meander down a linguistic bunny trail. In my opinion, the section could be removed without any loss to the article, but I do believe it needs a trim-down at the very least. -- User:mfrisk:mfrisk 08:27, 18 November 2006</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Anime derivation - Language</span></h2>
<p>Just to clarify, my understanding was that 'Anime' as a term is derived from the French term for animation, which is 'anime'. This also explains the archaic tag of 'Japanime'. I do study Japanese language, although not the French, and using the term 'Aniimeishan' would not be difficult for the Japanese language, so this makes more sense</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Anime in America</span></h2>
<p>I noticed this odd sentence in the article: "In the late 1960's, the United States saw its first large-scale exposure to anime in the Speed Racer TV series, a dubbed version of a Japanese series."</p>
<p>Strangely enough, this is next to a picture of <i>Astro Boy</i> (released to U.S. in September, 1963). <i>Astro Boy</i> was followed by <i>Eighth Man</i> (US: 1965), <i>Gigantor</i> (US: 1966), <i>Kimba</i> (US: 1966), <i>Prince Planet</i> (US: 1966), <i>Marine Boy</i> (US: 1966), and <i>The Amazing 3</i> (US: 1967). In fact, of the eight anime series released in the US in the '60s, <i>Speed Racer</i> was the last. Am I missing something, or is this sentence just wrong? <a href="../../../r/i/z/User%7ERizzleboffin_0ecb.html" title="User:Rizzleboffin">Rizzleboffin</a> 19:25, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Since no one raised an objection to the above, I've re-written the paragraph stating that <i>Astro Boy</i> was the first anime to be broadcast in the US, and including a little more info about anime in the US in the '60s &amp; '70s, with the Fred Patten article as the source. <a href="../../../r/i/z/User%7ERizzleboffin_0ecb.html" title="User:Rizzleboffin">Rizzleboffin</a> 20:54, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>This nonsensical article is not NPOV. There needs to be a criticism section for it to be so. Hell, everything else has one.

<dd>It's also hard to criticize something so general as anime. The examples you provide are about specific series, which is much easier to give criticism on. I've said this many times before, but I believe the best way to make this article NPOV is to remove the overly positive POV rather than adding negative POV as a "band-aid". -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 21:02, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I start to think that we should have a Criticism section for the sake of having one since we're so often charged for not having one here &gt;_&gt; We can make something like "Anime has often been criticized for being blah blah and blah, for example *insert quotes and links here* however, these comments are often pointed at a particular genre or series. One must note that anime is a broad medium that yada yada yada and that people who criticize anime in general are ignorant pundits." <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeadkid_dk_3237.html" title="User:Deadkid dk">_dk</a> 00:57, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, maybe, if it could be sourced, but does it really make sense at all? Wouldn't it be better to just keep a note on this talk page that criticism about a specific series or genre should be placed on the relevant article and not in this article? For example <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film.html" title="Film">Film</a> does not have a section of criticism against film, even though some think that moving images are evil. There is indeed a section called <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film.html#Film_criticism" title="Film">Film criticism</a>, but that contains information about the film critic occupation, not criticism against film in general.--<a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunnarRene_e013.html" title="User:GunnarRene">GunnarRene</a> 08:28, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>The article just doesn't feel like it knows what it's talking about.</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of in-line citation is critical for an article of its length and fan-ish nature (by which I mean it needs to be shown these opinions are in hard print and not just users). Additionally, quotes and statistics are also given without in-line citations, and those are the two types that always demand an in-line.</li>
<li>Far, far too much unsourced opinion.</li>
<li>Only foreign country given any text is USA. This is bias; it needs information on how anime does in other countries. I think having a FA in Russian makes it clear that other countries are into anime as well.</li>
<li>Switches between putting anime in italics and not, not consistant.</li>
<li>Lead is too short for its size.</li>
<li>"Anime is produced by Anime companies." No shit. Prose gets redundant.</li>
<li>It kinda feels like there's too much emphasis on the word itself. Terminology feels like it should be able half as long.</li>
<li>Moé is only mentioned one as a "genre". Moé is a very important part of anime, and the industries trends of becoming more moé in most areas or more realistic in others (most Gibli) need to be mentioned. This information can be found in <i>Little Boy: The Arts of Japan's Exploding Subculture</i> by Takashi Murakami. Unfortunately, I only checked out the book so I can't add that information.</li>
<li>The culture of anime and otaku needs to be mentioned as well.</li>
