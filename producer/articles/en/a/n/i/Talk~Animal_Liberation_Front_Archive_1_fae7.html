<h2><span class="mw-headline">Incidents</span></h2>
<dl>
<dd><i>According to the U.S. Department of Justice, between 1979 and 1993 there were over 313 incidents of break-ins, vandalism, arson and thefts committed in the name of animal rights in the U.S.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>All break-ins, etc. done in the name of animal rights were not done by or in the name of the ALF. This seems like a misleading statistic to have in an article on the ALF and not on more general "animal rights movement". <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanKeshet_ba33.html" title="User:DanKeshet">DanKeshet</a> 04:04, Sep 25, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">ALF spokespersons</span></h2>
<p>I edited this paragraph: "According to media sources, ALF spokespersons refuse to condemn violence by people who have previously acted in the name of the ALF, so long as they attempt no attribution of their violent acts to the ALF. For example, when David Blenkinsop, together with two other men who remain unidentified, severely beat <a href="../../../h/u/n/Huntingdon_Life_Sciences_9712.html" title="Huntingdon Life Sciences">Huntingdon Life Sciences</a> director Brian Cass outside his home with 'staves' or 'pick-axe handles', ALF founder Ronnie Lee said of the victim "He has got off lightly. I have no sympathy for him." <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=42" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=42" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> The ALF's 'decentralized resistance' model of organisation, with no formal membership or hierarchy, thus acts as a formal 'firebreak' in issues of legal responsibility (or moral accountability).</p>
<p>It said that Ronnie Lee is ALF founder and spokesperson, but I don't think he is a spokesperson, so I removed that, which leaves the paragraph with no reference, as I believe the reference cited only mentions Lee, whose views are known to be extreme and explicit. Does the editor who added this paragraph have a source for the first sentence i.e. a source that refers to recognized ALF spokespersons? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> 18:16, Jan 21, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the steer, SV. I've added a quote from Robin Webb, which is better. The links between all these people are hard to be specific about, for obvious reasons.

<dd>Ah. So now the Webb quote turns out to have been a misattribution - thanks for the input, anon! Perhaps you can advise whether or not this BBC quote by 'Tim Daley' is legit? <i>"In a war you have to take up arms and people will get killed, and I can support that kind of action by petrol bombing and bombs under cars, and probably at a later stage, the shooting of vivisectors on their doorsteps. It's a war, and there's no other way you can stop vivisectors.''</i> <a href="../../../a/d/h/User%7EAdhib_ade4.html" title="User:Adhib">Adhib</a> 23:27, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An anon IP just inserted this into the intro: "It has been linked to <a href="../../../p/e/t/PETA_7157.html" title="PETA">PETA</a>, which has circulated some of its propaganda tapes." I'm not sure it's appopriate for the intro in any event, but if it's to go anywhere in the article, it needs a reference.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Template</span></h2>
<p>I've removed the anarchist template as the ALF is not an anarchist group (or any kind of group): activists claiming actions on behalf of the ALF come from across the political spectrum. Regarding the claimed link to PETA, that still needs a reference or it should probably be removed. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 10:07, Apr 8, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It does has strong ideological links to anarchism though - it uses the anarchist black circled A logo with the smaller letter L and F inside, and through its use of "propaganda by the deed".
<dl>
<dd>the template is off, but I agree, anarchism should at least be mentioned. I put it in the see also section.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reference required</span></h2>
<p>Plain regular ham, you keep adding: "ALF attempts to maintain an image of non-violent action, as the frequent incidents of violence accompanying their actions are always reported by ALF as instigated by their victims." You would need a reference to show that there are frequent incidents of violence committed by ALF activists, and that they claim the violence was initiated by their victims. Without a reference, it can't be allowed to stay.

<dd>You rewrote the edit to read: "However, ALF reports many violent incidents, consistently claiming that the violence was instigated by their victims." You need to find a reference that shows (a) that the ALF reports many violent incidents, and (b) that they consistently claim the violence was instigated by their victims." It's POV, which means we must attribute it. The BBC reference didn't say that, and in any event you used it to support a different edit, so I'm not sure what you mean. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 18:35, Apr 22, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reverts that are incorrect</span></h2>
<p>My edits keep getting reverted but there are multiple websites that support my claims.</p>
<p>A quick search on google will bring up the following along with many other articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2005/5/20/123821.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2005/5/20/123821.shtml" rel="nofollow">News on ALF and ecoterrorism</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Now, this page clearly needs to be NPOV. However, any attempts to show that the ALF is an ecoterrorism group get reverted. That is not right because wikipedia should provide accurate information. The ALF is discussed in other terrorism and ecoterrorism pages but those terms keep getting blocked from this page.</p>
<p>Those of you who keep reverting, stop being dumbasses and suck it up. The ALF is clearly an ecoterrorism group, especially if it's recognized as one by the FBI.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I put the fact that the US government considers the group to be a terrorist group back in the article. We'll have to wait and see if it gets reverted or not. I included a link to the testimony on the FBI's web site.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>JesseG, I reverted your edit because I think we need a quote if we're going to say that the group is a terrorist group. If you look at <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Mann_4a5f.html" title="Keith Mann">Keith Mann</a>, there is a reference to terrorism in the intro, because such references were prominent at the time of his conviction, but <i>The Guardian</i> is quoted as saying it, not Wikipedia, or unnamed critics. I've looked through the FBI reference, and I can't see where it explicitly says the ALF is a terrorist group, though I may have missed it. In fact, the FBI says in this statement that the ALF in the U.S. adheres to its policy of non-violence. Also, don't say the U.S. government if it's the FBI, unless you can find the ALF listed as a terrorist group by the State Dept, in which case we'd need a reference. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:54, Jun 26, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On July 9, an anonymous IP added a section entitled "Sites critical of PETA", with a link to exposepeta.com. Since this isn't the PETA article, it is hardly appropriate. Additionally, exposepeta.com seems to be a brand new site that nowhere mentions its affiliation, history, mission, or funding. The registration data for the site is also hidden from whois searches.

<p>Would it be worth mentioning the torture of Graham Hall by ALF members (or at least extremists who have acted in their name)? He was making an undercover documentary for UK Channel 4's Dispatches. They figured out what he was up to and set him up, kidnapped him (allegedly at gun point) and then branded his back with "ALF" in large letters. This is the first time I've even written anything on wikipedia and I'm pretty sure I'd mess things up if I tried to edit the page myself. 81.102.204.161 22:09, 20 October 2005 (UTC)Recusant</p>

<dd>Hi 81, thanks for your comment. I was thinking of adding that here, or on the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Horne_52ea.html" title="Barry Horne">Barry Horne</a> or <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Webb_9326.html" title="Robin Webb">Robin Webb</a> pages. I remember that Hall was the person who set Webb up for Channel 4, and the result was the documentary shown on British television during Horne's 68-day hunger strike, but I also seem to remember there was a suspicion that Hall had set up the attack. Feel free to add something yourself. Write it in a neutral way and link to a source about it; others can clean it up if it needs it. And welcome to Wikipedia.&#160;;-) <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:23, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it's generally accepted that the branding of Graham Hall was a hoax. He has served time for a series of burglaries and has been linked to other suspicious claims. It makes him money and the press are easy to sucker with lurid claims like this, especially when it gives them what they want to hear.

<dd>Grahall Hall cannot be regarded as a credible source, and the police took no action in response to his claims. The incident was reported by one newspaper and the BBC, so we can report his claims, but we can't state them as fact. The most we can say is that he said he was branded.

<p>But that's exactly what I said - I made no statement in the article that claimed he was branded *by* the ALF, I merely said he was branded with the letters "ALF". The brands were photographed and the pictures published in the paper. I assume you don't question the fact of the branding, just the question of who branded him.

<dd>You've written that he was kidnapped, as though that is fact. No one knows what happened to him; and the police found no evidence of a criminal attack, or at least none that they were able to pursue. Therefore, we say "he said he was kidnapped and branded." Why do you object to that? If you do object, we can make it more accurate still: he told police and reporters that he was kidnapped and branded." <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:22, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There were suggestions of that, and we have no way of judging what's true. The main source seems to have been the <i>Daily Mail</i> ten days after it happened. The Mail story was then reported by the BBC and the police didn't pursue the issue. Do you have sources showing he was well-known before the incident? The strange thing was that C4 said he was a documentary filmmaker, but I believe he worked for them during the Dispatches program as a source. It's all a bit confusing, which is why we're best sticking to the tried and tested formula of A said X, and leave it at that. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 08:23, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

However, if you'd read carefully instead of engaging in your typical knee-jerk revert, you'd have seen that I specifically went out of my to not say that they had committed the criminal act but that they had merely taken credit for it. To an extent, you are correct. It is likely that the only people who know for certain who committed this vile act are the people who actually committed it and they're unlikely to have left any evidence behind. However, just because it is unlikely that any of the scum who did this will be brought to justice, that doesn't mean the facts that are known shouldn't be reported here. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinyNorman_fe2f.html" title="User:SpinyNorman">SpinyNorman</a> 08:09, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The line <i>Some governmental agencies and private citizens label the ALF "<a href="../../../e/c/o/Ecoterrorism.html" title="Ecoterrorism">ecoterrorists</a>", while supporters consider them more akin to "<a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_fighters.html" title="Freedom fighters">freedom fighters</a>".</i> has been added to the article. Can someone please provide information about which government agencies in which countries consider the ALF to be eco-terrorists. I know the FBI has stated something about them but I have not heard of any UK agencies calling them that.

<dd>FBI, dept of homeland security, and I am pretty sure there is another. The truth is some. I don't know the exact number and honestly I don't care to know. It mentions later on in the intro about some US agencies that consider them a threat though, so it seems fine to me. I don't know anything about the UK with regard to ALF. BTW, I definitely was not trying to "inflate" the truth since I am against the usage of the term ecoterrorist with regard to eco and animal defence actions. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 03:54, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I wasn't trying to say you were trying to inflate the truth, more that the terms inflate the truth. The article should reflect a worldwide view of the ALF, so that line needs changing to reflect that. In the UK, I am pretty sure, they (government) do not recognise the ALF as a group let alone a terrorist group. If it must stay in, it needs a reference to the agencies that state they are a terrorist group and must state which countries (unless it is the majority). -<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a> <a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a> 10:49, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>According to the UK Prevention of Terrorism Act 1976, terrorism is defined as "the use of violence for political ends (including) any use of violence for the purpose of putting the public or any section of the public in fear". When the ALF firebombs people's houses or sends intimidating letters, they enter the realm of terrorism.<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobBobtheBob_3034.html" title="User:BobBobtheBob">BobBobtheBob</a> 10:40, 13 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As far as I'm aware - housefold firebombings are very few and far between and also aren't 'enacted' by the ALF rather they may be done independantly or the ARM. Also, to be classed as a terrorist <i>group</i> you must be added to the list of proscribed groups in the UK. Otherwise any such group is a perfectly legal group and only the individuals involved can be called terrorists and be charged as such. -<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a> <a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a> 10:52, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But the ALF accept actions done in their name as long as no one is physically harmed, in essence all ALF attacks can be claimed to be independent because of its uncentralised structure. Those that are listed as actions on Bite Back and the ALF Press Office can be accepted as ALF attacks where they state as such and they include acts of arson quite frequently, which are designed to inspire fear in the victim, qualifying as terrorism, as do the threats via phone and mail. Currently, all the proscribed domestic groups in the UK under the Terrorism Act of 2000 are related to Northern Ireland<a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/security/terrorism-and-the-law/terrorism-act/proscribed-groups?version=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/security/terrorism-and-the-law/terrorism-act/proscribed-groups?version=1" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, so you could technically argue that the government does not consider them terrorists. Although the UK Home Office refused entry for all but one member of a group of ALF members from the US to attend an Animal Rights Convention in 2004<a href="http://www.impactpress.com/articles/decjan05/best120105.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.impactpress.com/articles/decjan05/best120105.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.

"In April 1985, the ALF raided the University of California-Riverside laboratory to rescue Britches, a five-week old macaque monkey who had been separated from his mother and left alone in a wire cage with his eyes sewn shut as part of a maternal- and sensory-deprivation experiment." example of a POV statement, rescue or steal?

<dd>The alf are a non-violent 'front'. If you can list some examples of ALF actions that have caused violence to a living being then we can discuss it. However, violence implicitly references injury to living creatures not objects. You cannot be violent towards a wall. The statement you give is not POV - it is a description of the event and the animal. It is not an opinion (which is what POV means). It can be backed up with evidence and is. Steal is a weighted word, more so than remove - it is however a truth, the monkey was stolen - and I would not oppose using the word.</dd>

<dd>I support using the word "removed." The ALF would say "liberated" to signify that the animal was a living being, and the "other side" would say "stole," because they regard the animal as property. "Removed" is neutral between those positions. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 18:03, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My point on this word is that, legally, the word stole would be correct. Removed does not show any form of crime - which in this case there would have been.

<dd>Yes, I see your point. My concern is that the word "steal" is a legal term, and we can't say that someone has stolen something until a court has agreed. Often activists in the States use the argument that the animal wasn't stolen because s/he wasn't being held legally in the first place, so to use the word "steal" of any particular case, we'd had to check that a court had so ruled. It could also be argued that, in so doing, we're repeating the court's POV and we should therefore put in quotation marks exactly what the court said. For all these reasons, I feel it's better to use the most neutral term available. For the same reason, I don't support using "rescued" Britches. If I wrote that, my apologies. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:14, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Good points really.

<dd>(copied from above anon's talk page): I know a dictionary definition, thank you, but my point is that in US and UK law it is legal to commit a 'lesser crime' to prevent a 'greater crime'. If this is the case then the 'lesser crime' is ruled as not having been a crime - thus removing the fact that it was stolen in this case. Without such a ruling either way by a court, it is just opinion and therefore POV to use 'stole'. That is why 'removed' is being used as it has neither POV grounds nor legal grounds.

<dd>It is POV as <i>you</i> are making that interpretation of the act rather than a law court. The definition to me seems to be that an animal was removed from the lab. That cannot be denied. Yes it was taken without permission, however due to the nature of the alleged crime and the near universal denunciation of the original test + the lack of a legal ruling on the issue leads to the fact that stating it was theft is pov - your pov. The 'right' you talk of is seen by some to exist, as it is seen by some (including yourself) to not exist. Therefore a neutral term seems best - thus 'removed' seems optimal in this situation.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 00:22, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is a lot of discussion over one word.&#160;;-) I still don't see the problem with "removed." It doesn't imply the action was legal or illegal, and we don't know what the court ruled, so we can't say exactly. <s>All I can remember in the case of Britches is that it was a complex case that went to the Supreme Court.</s> As Grace Note said, "liberated" is the word the activists use, and "stolen" is the word the pro-testers use, while "removed" seems completely neutral between those positions. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:29, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So i can come into YOUR house and remove YOUR tv and not get charged with theft? Sounds like a plan. Where do you live? 134.161.137.162 19:22, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How about you tell me where you live so I can take your child and sew his/her eyes shut and torture them in the name of science. If you took him/her back, is that theft? What if random people who just didn't like the idea of me experimenting on your child took her/him, would that be theft? It's the same situation. "Stole" is just as POV (and in fact more POV) than "removed". You seem so intent on what the "truth" is and reporting this "truth" regardless of what the community thinks (as evidenced below), but in some people's opinion, the truth is the ALF liberated this animal and deserves praise for this action, not condemnation, so maybe we should rewrite the whole article to say that the ALF are saints and should be given medals of honor for their courageous sacrifices in the name of freedom. I'm sure you see how POV that is, and although some personally feel that is the "truth", we wouldn't go and rewrite the article like that because it is highly biased. What you propose is just the same. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 03:55, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh and "removed" fails to denote the fact that they were breaking the law when they stole the moneky. I remove the litter in the park, I remove the dead brush in my yard, you steal my tv when you take it, you steal my wallet when you remove it from my pocket, you commit theft when you take something that doesn't belong to you. The word "remove" would be appropriate if the criminals, instead of breaking and entering (a crime) and stealing the monkey (a crime) they had filed legal injunctions and the law came in and removed the monkye. 134.161.137.162 19:22, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You miss the point of the above argument. What you say is only true if a conviction occurs/a court rules that way. If the court ruled that the people had done right to remove the animal then it is not in fact theft. You are not being unbiased on this issue - Removed is a neutral word (it does not cover the legal aspects of the action but covers the fact that the animal was removed from the room) whereas 'stolen' would bring your analysis that it was a crime - without a legal ruling to back it up.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 19:32, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I know innocent until proven guilty and all.... but to say it was not theft is biased. It doesn't take a court ruling to see that the monkey did not belong to them. Would my taking your tv not be theft until AFTER a court decides it was? what would you say ont he police report? I came and removed your tv and you would like a court ruling to see if ti was theft or not? 134.161.137.162 19:37, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To say it is theft is also biased. It does, in an encyclopedia, require a court ruling or other such evidence. Otherwise it is just your view against the view of, as you so nicely put it 'crazy' animal rights people. You seem to not understand that we must have evidence to back up everything on this site. 'Removed' is provided for (as it was removed, there is no denying that) however we do not have any evidence of a court process that stated it was 'theft'.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 19:42, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So why did the lab have the ALF's monkey? why did ALF have a monkey in the first place? I thought they were against pets... so why did they have one.. which they loaned to the Lab (which did animal testing even!) and then why did the lab not give ALF's monkey back to them when ALF wanted it back? since you know, it was not theft or anything.134.161.137.162 19:46, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You still miss the point. The community has (see above) decided that removed is the better word - as it is neutral and does not require evidence further to that already shown. It does not matter that it was not the ALF's monkey etc... This is just your bias showing through. You have to provide some legal evidence to back up that it was theft, else it is just your analysis of the matter - which is opinion and is not admissable on the site.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 19:54, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi 134.161, activists often use the argument in court that the animal they're charged with removing was being tortured and held illegally. In the case of Britches, this would have been a particularly strong defense, given that a number of scientists condemned the experiment too. Therefore, had the activists been tried, there's no way of knowing whether they would have been found guilty of theft or not. For that reason, the word "removed" is being used, because it is legally neutral. Similarly, in described the killing of a person, we can't say they were "murdered" unless a court has so ruled. These words — theft, murder — are legal terms and this is an encyclopedia, not a court of law. A further argument is that, even if a court had so ruled, we still shouldn't parrot the rulings of a court. That's a separate argument and I don't know whether I'd defend it, but it's certainly a valid one. The point is that, in using the word "removed," we avoid all these complications. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 09:05, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
