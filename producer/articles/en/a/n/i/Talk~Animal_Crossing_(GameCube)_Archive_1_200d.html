<p>I added information on villagers, time travel, and multiplayer play to the gameplay section. Now that I look at it, it seems terribly disorganized. I'm considering combining the "fish and insects" and "museum" sections into a single "collecting" section, and folding the "happy room academy" into "house improvments". I'm not so sure we need such a detailed explanation of the HRA, either. Are we trying to make a FAQ or provide an overview of the game itself? Any comments are welcome.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bugs and fish</span></h2>
<p>The lists of where bugs and fish are and their price is similar in theme to a FAQ or walkthrough. It should be removed, but I'm gonna wait a couple of days to do it, in case someone wants to transwiki it.

<dd>I personally would like the see this info remain, because it illustrates how detailed the game world is, and doesn't break "A general rule of thumb to follow if unsure: if the content only has value to people actually playing the game, it's unsuitable." as the value is in the illustration of the games detail. To be fair, the game is designed to be similar to life, and thus most aspects of the game would make sense to someone who's never played it, but for this to really be like a walkthrough it would need to give advice on catching bugs rather than merely listing the bugs that are featured in the game. Admittedly giving price and seasons would help players looking for the bugs, but it also shows non-players how complex the ingame ecosystem and economy are - merely stating that bugs vary at different times of year could be taken to mean something as crude as one set of bugs appearing in winter months, one in summer, with the seasons being split in half into winter/summer. --Joenixon 14:30, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

In-game information that says how to get something, how much it costs, what it is used for, when it is available or when it must be used, etc, does not fit Wikipedia. If you want to include that information, use prose.

<p>Okay, look. AMID, I'm afraid you can't just turn something into a redirect because you think it's unecyclopedic. The topic was put up to discussion, and the consensus was to keep it. If you were going to go and delete it or whatever you want to call it anyway, you might have well just not participated in the AFD. Keep in mind that</p>
<ol>
<li>Problem article covers the characters of both Animal Crossing games, and may continue to cover characters in future games as well. Redirecting to this one page is detrimental to the encyclopedia effort.</li>
<li>Just because an article is <b>currently</b> unencyclopedic does not mean that it will never be.</li>
<li>List pages tend to be mores suitable for the information covered in Problem article than article-type pages. It is more encyclopedic to have a list of characters with short descriptions than it is to put a list into a more formal article. Yes, you may think that everything that does not fit into the main article is not noticable, but everyone is not you. It is preferrable to have a small amount of information, placed properly, than to have no information at all.</li>

<p>Hi, sorry to revive the discussion, but I really think that Animal Forest and Animal Crossing should be merged as they are essentially the same game and two articles will just be repeating the same information. A better solution would be to have a section in one article describing the differences between the two versions. If you look at the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_Forest_b9a7.html" title="Animal Forest">Animal Forest</a> article, it is just a confusing stub with inaccurate information. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimkovski_9be6.html" title="User:Timkovski">Timkovski</a> 17:45, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Tom Nook is a Tanuki, I don't care what the english translation says. That is just a translation, it doesn't change the actual fact. Changing tanuki to "raccoon" for english translations is quite common, probably because most english speaking people have no idea what a tanuki is. But a translation change or oversight does not change the simple fact that he is, indeed, a raccoon dog. Even his name "Tom Nook" is a play on the word "Tanuki" ("Tomnooki"?)<a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiccoloNamek_1430.html" title="User:PiccoloNamek">PiccoloNamek</a> 05:34, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There isn't an "actual fact". In the Japanese version, he's a tanuki. In the English version, he's a raccoon. Since we favor naming most familiar to English-language readers (as this is en.wiki, after all), he's a raccoon in this terse list. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 05:49, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
