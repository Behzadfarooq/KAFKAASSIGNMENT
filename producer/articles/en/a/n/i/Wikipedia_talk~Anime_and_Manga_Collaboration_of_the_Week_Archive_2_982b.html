<h2><span class="mw-headline">anon votes counted?</span></h2>
<p>I can't find a rule about anon users. Can they vote or not? Its better to explain this in <b>Voting</b>. Currently there are two anon votes for Naruto.--<a href="../../../u/g/u/User%7EUgur_Basak_b749.html" title="User:Ugur Basak">Ugur Basak</a> 21:02, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's a collaboration, every user on wikipedia is able to help edit the successful articles, so why shouldn't nominating and voting for articles be allowed for every user? This is a project to improve articles, we should assume good faith, it's hard to cheat with approval voting anyway. Even if there were a lot of anon votes for one article, most wikipedia users can sniff out a sockpuppet pretty easily. If you believe that there is a reason to add a rule not permitting anonymous users, then what about users that are registered and have no contributions? What about the users with less than 25 contributions? Where do you draw the line? - Squilibob 14:19, 29 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I ask it because in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_Improvement_Drive_cef6.html" title="Wikipedia:Article Improvement Drive">Wikipedia:Article Improvement Drive</a> there is a rule about it (<i>To vote or nominate you have to be a registered user</i>). By the way i don't say "anons must not vote" or else. Thanks for your answer--<a href="../../../u/g/u/User%7EUgur_Basak_b749.html" title="User:Ugur Basak">Ugur Basak</a> 21:54, 29 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I read the talk page for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_Improvement_Drive_cef6.html" title="Wikipedia:Article Improvement Drive">Wikipedia:Article Improvement Drive</a> and they are debating whether that rule should be removed. It was mentioned that they had problems with sockpuppets in the past as well. If this collaboration ever encounters the same sort of problem, it will help to look at how they handled their problem. - Squilibob 06:46, 30 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree with you. As i want to ask in above <i>Its better to explain this in <b>Voting'</b>, its better to write in voting anon users can vote. So nobody will be confused. I see Anime collaboration's link from Article Improvement Drive's page. Anyway, it will be better to explain they can vote.--<a href="../../../u/g/u/User%7EUgur_Basak_b749.html" title="User:Ugur Basak">Ugur Basak</a> 11:47, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</i>
<dl>
<dd>So something like <i>Anyone may nominate or vote</i> I guess. - Squilibob 09:48, 3 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is better Squilibob, it clarifies everthing about nominating and voting.--<a href="../../../u/g/u/User%7EUgur_Basak_b749.html" title="User:Ugur Basak">Ugur Basak</a> 11:11, 3 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You have raised a valid point about sockpuppets. It may be a good idea to have an appeal system for nominations that attract a lot of anonymous and new user votes. An appeal system would not harm anons and new users from nominating and voting but would also safeguard against sockpuppets. Any ideas anyone? - Squilibob 07:39, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Squilibob, this collaboration votings are really difficult. There is a rule on Wikipedia:Deletion_guidelines_for_administrators. May be, we can set a rule like <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_guidelines_for_administrators_a507.html#Rough_consensus" title="Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators">Wikipedia:Deletion_guidelines_for_administrators#Rough_consensus</a> <i>Such "bad faith" opinions include those being made by sock puppets, being made anonymously, or being made using a new userid whose only edits are to the article in question and the voting on that article.</i> can be uncounted. But we must be careful about, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_bite_the_newcomers_633c.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't bite the newcomers">Wikipedia:Don't bite the newcomers</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a>. If we use the rule above, the problem will be this "who will say these rules must not be counted". We must not harm the attraction of new users to this project. What is your opinion about these? May be we must wait for a few weeks, what is going on. And analyze votes, what percent of them (wpot) are fron anon users, wpot are from users that only contribute on voting etc. --<a href="../../../u/g/u/User%7EUgur_Basak_b749.html" title="User:Ugur Basak">Ugur Basak</a> 11:32, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You've made three excellent references here and I agree with you. Watching for a few weeks and seeing the percentage of anonymous voting and those that only contribute on voting etc. is a good idea. I think some of what you wrote, especially the links you just gave can be included on the project page to prevent sockpuppets if needed because of bad faith. For us to be talking about prevention before anything has happened means that we are prepared if we do encounter such bad faith. So while we continue to assume good faith we can also make a <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defensive_design.html" title="Defensive design">defensive design</a> just in case. Thanks for your opinion on the matter so far, btw. - Squilibob 13:45, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dt>a rough analysis, for past winner Naruto. 15 votes (16th vote added after it won)</dt>
<dd>3 active %20</dd>
<dd>6 semi-active %40 (those new or old users who don't have much edits)</dd>
<dd>5 new-user or (just edit for nomination) %33 (new users or just edited a few)</dd>
<dd>1 anon %0.06</dd>
<dd>As seen above, for Naruto only 3 votes are from active users. The worrying part is %33 of votes are from new users. Lets wait next winner.--<a href="../../../u/g/u/User%7EUgur_Basak_b749.html" title="User:Ugur Basak">Ugur Basak</a> 00:39, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok guys, after giving anonymous voting a chance, which was the right thing to do IMO, I agree with you all that anonymous voting should no longer be allowed. I feel that we should vote to decide this however. I think a week is long enough to decide on this, since it's a weekly collaboration - Squilibob 03:26, 8 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hi, I'd just like to put my two cents in. Although I agree that anonymous voting should not be allowed, there is a question of how new users can help to contribute. I actually created a Wikipedia account with the primary purpose of contributing to the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Portal%7EAnime_and_manga_f484.html" title="Portal:Anime and manga">Anime</a> components of wikipedia, but being new to both anime and wikipedia, I wasn't certain how to contribute. I've only voted once, for the List of English Dubbed Anime and did not contribute because I wasn't sure what was going on. I'm still not certain some of the times what is going on, but would like to contribute somehow. It's only recently that I've found time to learn a little more wiki, so am a little more confident in this realm. As such, I don't believe you should exclude new users (like myself). Just wanted to voice my thoughts, thanks. --<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Ethereal_9efd.html" title="User:Miss Ethereal">Miss Ethereal</a> 15:21, 11 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well the following vote is drawing the line at Anonymous voting. If you have made an account then we won't <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">BITE</a> you. All users are created equal, edit counts do not matter as long as you contribute. - Squilibob 02:23, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Squilibob 03:26, 8 March 2006 (UTC) - My reason is we've given anonymous voting a chance and we have not had sufficient contributions to the nominated pages from the anonymous voters. That is, anonymous users are voting and then not contributing, they're <i>inactive collaborators</i>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../t/c/d/User%7ETcDohl_da1b.html" title="User:TcDohl">TcDohl</a> 03:32, 8 March 2006 (UTC) - Same reason as above. What we do need is more people that are willing to put in the work for the things they vote for, not just votes for the sake of "<a href="../../../t/a/c/Tactical_voting.html" title="Tactical voting">not letting the other guy win</a>" or voting for the sake of voting.</li>
<li>I don't think it's important that a person who votes also contribute to the article; i.e. I think it's OK if people vote simply if they think a certain article deserves more attention (but can't actually contribute to it themselves). However, I still <b>oppose</b> because anonymous users are generally unfamiliar with Wikipedia policies and don't read FAQs, including the details of this project, which means they will likely choose inappropriate articles to vote for. In addition, it is standard throughout Wikipedia that anon users can't vote. Registering isn't that hard, anyway. -- <font face="wingdings">Y</font> <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> <font face="wingdings">Y</font> 16:32, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/h/o/User%7EPhorque_0d47.html" title="User:Phorque">Phorque</a> 05:43, 13 March 2006 (UTC) - My reason is that anons probably vote because they'd like to see the article improved, not because they'd improve it themselves which is what a vote should really mean (for anyone that voices support).</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Some comments</span></h2>
<p>I haven't noticed this project since it seems to have been formed when I was away. I apologize for not reading the project page or the talk page, but I have a limited timeframe at the momemt. If some of my suggestions are already in place, please excuse, otherwise please explain why you think the suggestion would not be a good idea. They are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anon votes should definitely not count.</li>
<li>Only one article should be nominated at a time, not all articles related to an anime/manga series. For example, in the Bleach nomination someone said that the zanpakutō section needed cleanup, obviously they were referring to the zanpakutō <b>article</b>. This means the nomination apparently applies to all 60 or so Bleach-related articles. Who will have time to even read them all, let alone edit? And don't forget that other than grammar errors, only people who know about Bleach can actually verify the minor details.</li>
<li>In addition to the above, only articles that need help need to be nominated. They should be either stubs, not exist at all, or be completely poorly written. The articles on Naruto, Bleach, FMA, etc. fit none of these categories and it's a shame to have manpower wasted on articles which are already decent rather than create new important articles, such as the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_manga.html" title="History of manga">History of manga</a> (which should be the obvious COTW without even voting). This isn't just my suggestion though, it's a guideline for both the regular WP:COTW and the Article Improvement Drive. Nominating articles which are good doesn't help. In fact, since Bleach (manga) was nominated, the article actually became somewhat worse IMO.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than that, I support the project and think it could pick up, since tons of anime and manga fans frequent Wikipedia.</p>

<dd>About your first point, We'll vote on this in the above subsection about Anon voting.</dd>
<dd>Your second point: <i>"Only one article should be nominated at a time, not all articles related to an anime/manga series"</i> Add this rule to the page? I can't see why not</dd>
<dd>Lastly, we've given the project some time with broad guidelines until now. We've adopted a wait and see approach. Now we see what has happened in the past, there is a pattern emerging that nominated articles that don't need that much attention aren't really improving. Therefore we can now set stricter guidelines. Remember it is a collaboration, we can look at what other collaboration have done for inspiration. Like the Anonymous users voting issue we can set a proposal for changes and then vote on whether it should be implemented. The problem is, and I've said this in the past, where do you draw the line? We have to decide this for voting and nominations. How do we word it on the project page and how do we dispute nominations that do not qualify?</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the reply. Unfortunately, as I was going to nominate History of manga a minute ago, I noticed that the project said <b>anime</b> only. Is that final? Because anime only doesn't seem like a broad enough scope to me. Why not include manga as well? -- <font face="wingdings">Y</font> <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> || <a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a> <font face="wingdings">Y</font> 05:19, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also another comment: I think articles which have a ton of sub-articles (e.g. Bleach (manga)) should not be nominated by default. The reason is that they can not achieve featured article standard - featured articles must have all the information on a topic AFAIK. Please correct me if I'm wrong. I just selected a few random articles from <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">Wikipedia:Featured articles</a> and none of them had any sub-articles. -- <font face="wingdings">Y</font> <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> || <a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a> <font face="wingdings">Y</font> 05:56, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, so perhaps we should manage an anime article peer review so that we can improve good articles to featured articles. We should have a list of articles we consider close to feature (ie. peer review candidates) and maybe a list of some articles to demonstrate what a good anime article looks like. - <a href="../../../p/h/o/User%7EPhorque_0d47.html" title="User:Phorque">Phorque</a> 08:24, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I like the idea, but IMO we must first assess the manpower available and then think what projects we can and cannot start. Because, even though the project anime and manga now has a ton more participants than a few months ago, I doubt many of them are more than symbolic participants. And many, such as myself, are also knowledgeable in just a few anime/manga series, basically the popular ones. Considering History of manga was a 'todo' for months and still hasn't been written, I'd say it's a problem to start a bunch of other projects. -- <font face="wingdings">Y</font> <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> <font face="wingdings">Y</font> 04:55, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is true.

<dl>
<dd>I don't understand completely. The current guideline is <i>Please only nominate Anime articles which need serious work, such as stubs or articles that do not exist.</i> So are you saying that a non-existant article should first be created and made into a stub before nomination? That's fine IMO. Also would apply to articles that need serious work, as they should also be stubs anyway. Correct me if that's not what you imply as including in <i>only allow anime stubs</i>. Or do you just mean large more complete articles should not be allowed? --Squilibob 05:06, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reinstating</span></h2>
<p>I have been monitoring the page and found that, if a nominee has 6 votes, it is already reinstated until it's eight vote stage. Now, until the two weeks are up, it is NOT reinstated. Just trying to get my message across. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatanin_2b3e.html" title="User:Katanin">Katanin</a> 21:53, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ever since the collaboration started it has worked this way. For what reason do you want to change it? The rule states clearly <i>For every two votes that a nomination attracts, the period will be extended by another two weeks.</i> So by saying <i>until the two weeks are up, it is NOT reinstated</i> does that mean you want this rule changed? Any rule changes should be proposed and voted upon. - Squilibob 00:14, 10 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, that means that I want the rule changed. An article is reinstated every two weeks since it's nomination. If an article recieved... let's say 16 votes in two weeks (even though it's somewhat unlikely, it's still probable), will it be reinstated eight times and then have it's voting period extended for a few months (as that's approximately the amount of time 16 votes will give a nominee)?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>And so, I officially propose the rule change <i>until the two weeks are up, a nominee is NOT reinstated</i>.</p>

<dd>No, I don't think you understand the concept of the rule. The rule won't change how long a nomination is active; Just that it could only be reinstated when the two weeks are up and not before. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatanin_2b3e.html" title="User:Katanin">Katanin</a> 12:21, 11 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Which means that, even if the nomination gets enough votes on the first day, it would have to wait 2 weeks to be reinstated, and then 2 more weeks before it can be taken off. This means that every nomination that passes the initial vote quota will remain for at least 4 weeks, isn't that right? -- <font face="wingdings">Y</font> <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> <font face="wingdings">Y</font> 12:36, 11 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But that's what's happening anyways! Let's say that a nominee, on it's first day, get's 2 votes. It's voting period is extended for two weeks <b>from the day it was nominated</b>, not from the day it recieved the votes. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatanin_2b3e.html" title="User:Katanin">Katanin</a> 20:09, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The way it currently stands is that when a nomination gets 2 votes it gets extended two weeks from the nomination date immediately setting a new deadline for two more votes to again extend this deadline. If a nomination gets a lot of votes in the first two weeks its deadline gets extended for many weeks. The way this vote will affect this is that if a nomination gets many votes in the first two weeks then it only gets extended another two weeks regardless of whether it got 2 votes or 200 votes. The <i>current</i> rule keeps a struggling nomination alive for months which is the issue, this new rule would stop that from happening. There is a disadvantage in that if a nomination gets a lot of votes in one fortnight and then less than two the next fortnight, it will be removed. That's what we're voting on. - Squilibob 00:50, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The considerations for nomination section in the project page says:<br />
<i>If you believe that the article is close to featured status but would fail a peer review then this is also grounds for nomination.</i><br />
I have a serious problem with this. It means that good articles will be nominated just to 'improve' them to featured article status, but they will neither improve nor benefit in any way (I think this was proven in <i>Bleach (manga)</i>). An article close to featured <b>does not</b> need a COTW, it needs one user who have good knowledge of both the article's subject and featured article requirements, and has time to improve the article by him/herself.

<p>I've briefly proposed this before, but it didn't seem to gain much attention so I'm making a new talk section.

<li>The scope of anime only is very small and therefore manpower is even more limited - and we really don't have much manpower</li>

<li>Squilibob - Why not have two collaborations, one each for anime and manga? They are two entirely different forms of media, print and animated. Pages that have enough information on both anime and manga of the same topic won't be stubs and can't be nominated anyway. I suggest trialling a separate Collaboration and if either one does not gain enough support to continue running, <i>then</i> merge anime and manga into one collaboration. --Squilibob 05:32, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article nominations</span></h2>
<p>Does it only limited to articles about a particular anime and manga or can it be an anime or manga related article? The reason I ask is because I would like to nominate <a href="../../../a/n/i/AnimeNfo.com_408e.html" title="AnimeNfo.com">AnimeNfo.com</a> as a candidate, but not sure if that will fall within the scope of this COTW. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">TheFarix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 02:12, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The way we currently have it worded is that the article must be directly related to anime or manga. You could argue that animenfo is directly related so I can't see why you can't go ahead and nominate it. I think that a general "anime database and review website" article could be made that included several of these types of websites and the features of each could be listed. The article would have a decent amount of content, potentially and it would definately be directly related to anime and manga. There isn't an AniDb article that I could find and <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime_News_Network_d66a.html" title="Anime News Network">Anime News Network</a> is just as small as animenfo. --Squilibob 02:30, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Most manga-only series are not very popular, and there will probably be very few such nominations (if any). The reason I suggested for it to be part of the collaboration was because anime and manga are almost inseparable subjects and running a Japanese animation collaboration, which is almost entirely based on manga, involves a lot of cherrypicking. It also gives the impression that articles should be nominated for their sole anime value, while in practice, most (or all) our manga-based anime articles include canon from the manga which did not make it to the anime. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> 07:46, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Anyone got any ideas on how we can attract more people to the project? We haven't been gaining any new interest lately --Squilibob 07:23, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps the problem isn't the lack of collaborators, rather the lack of commitment from collaborators. (Though the lack of collaborators isn't encouraging either.) For the past two collabs I've been cycling through the collaborations, and though I don't mind doing it at all, my main concern with this is that it was after the week's been up. When I archive the articles that were collaborated on, I also noticed that oftentimes the individuals who nominate the articles don't collaborate on them at all. I would have assumed that if you nominate an article, that you would at least make an attempt to improve it. All the anime series that have been nominated so far, I've never seen, though I may have nominated it because I thought it required more attention than other nominated articles. But I've tried to contribute to most of them. I also thought this was the main reason that this collaboration elected to have only registered users nominate/vote on articles - to eliminate the unknown user who would not contribute. I don't have any suggestions for how this collaboration can garner more interest, but it would be better if people who nominated the articles would contribute if they can. -- <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Ethereal_9efd.html" title="User:Miss Ethereal">Miss Ethereal</a> 15:16, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with you. I guess we should allow for it, however, because sometimes an article doesn't get succeed straight away and a person who nominated an article two weeks ago is likely not to notice it was elevated after such a gap in time. --Squilibob 00:49, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Moving to left</i><br />
There are a couple things which need to be taken into account first:</p>
<ul>
<li>COTWs in general are suffering, look at <a href="../../../c/o/t/WP%7ECOTW_227d.html" title="WP:COTW">WP:COTW</a>, it's probably worse off than it was at its beginning stages.</li>
<li>Many voters vote only because they think the article should get more attention than other nominated articles, and want it to become the collaboration, not necessarily wanting to contribute to it at all. I sometimes do this, and personally have a principle against extensively editing on a subject I have no idea about, so you won't see me contributing to the collabs much. Other than occasional proofreads and such.</li>
</ul>
<p>And while I don't think we can come up with some miraculous way to uplift the collaboration, I do have a suggestion: the nominator, or someone else who knows a lot about anime websites, should review each collaboration and come up with a few websites which may have info on the nomination. Moreover, links to some general anime info sites should be posted on the project page. This will help users who would otherwise not contribute due to a lack of knowledge actually add information.</p>
<p>Just my 2 cents. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> 08:55, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A stub is an article that lacks essential information. When you look at an article ask yourself "What essential information should be in this article?". For Midori no Hibi I would say a Story synopsis, which it has, a character profile for the main characters, which it has, and I'd touch on the love triangle between the main three characters, which the article has done. Disagree with me if you think it really is a stub. Read <a href="../../../s/t/u/WP%7ESTUB_7484.html" title="WP:STUB">WP:STUB</a> for the Wikipedia guideline. --Squilibob 22:21, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
