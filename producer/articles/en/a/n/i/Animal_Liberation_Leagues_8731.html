	    <p><b>Animal Liberation Leagues</b> were a network of animal rights organizations active in the UK in the 1980s. Whereas the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_Liberation_Front_22fb.html" title="Animal Liberation Front">Animal Liberation Front</a> specialized in clandestine activity, mainly masked, at night, and involving small numbers of people, the Animal Liberation Leagues consisted of coordinated raids by a large number of people, mainly carried out during the day.

<p>The <b>Central Animal Liberation League</b> (CALL) was an <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_rights.html" title="Animal rights">animal rights</a> organisation based in central England that was active during the 1980s. Over a hundred animals were taken by this organisation, mainly from centres of <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_experimentation.html" title="Animal experimentation">animal experimentation</a>. They also took documentation and video footage. The slogan of the CALL was "Through The Door When They Least Expect It".</p>
<ul>
<li>A fifteen-year-old <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rhesus_monkey.html" title="Rhesus monkey">rhesus monkey</a> called Beatrice was the only monkey ever to be taken from an UK laboratory, by CALL. She had been used in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthritis.html" title="Arthritis">arthritis</a> research.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Guinea pigs used in burn experiments were taken from a laboratory in Birmingham by CALL activists posing as window cleaners.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A raid on the premises of Animal Supplies London Ltd netted vanloads of documentation and found a fridge filled with decapitated monkey heads and bats.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <b>Eastern Animal Liberation League</b> (EALL) was based in the East of <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>.</p>
<p>The main action of the EALL took place in August 1984. <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unilever.html" title="Unilever">Unilever</a> research laboratories in <a href="../../../b/e/d/Bedford.html" title="Bedford">Bedford</a> was stormed by over two hundred <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_rights.html" title="Animal rights">animal rights</a> activists and the same time as a legal demonstration was taking place at the front. 25 people were later convicted of conspiracy to burgle and sentenced to a total of 41 years.</p>
<p>One of those convicted was <a href="../../../j/i/l/Jill_Phipps_f3af.html" title="Jill Phipps">Jill Phipps</a>, who was killed in 1995 during a demonstration, when she was run over by a lorry carrying calves for the <a href="../../../l/i/v/Live_export.html" title="Live export">live export</a> trade. Jill's mother, Nancy Phipps was also convicted.</p>
<p>These heavy losses to the animal rights movement led to the winding up of the EALL and a change in tactics.</p>

<p><b>The Northern Animal Liberation League</b> was active in the north of <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>. It specialised in mass daytime invasion of places such as animal laboratories to obtain photographs and other information, and in some cases animals were also removed.</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1980, over a hundred <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_rights.html" title="Animal rights">animal rights</a> activists invaded <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babraham_Institute_831c.html" title="Babraham Institute">Babraham Agricultural Research Centre</a> in Cambridge. They witnessed sights such as pigs with electrodes in their brains, cows with windows on the side of their stomachs and goats with udders grafted onto their necks. Eighteen people were arrested.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Several dogs were removed from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Sheffield_dc51.html" title="University of Sheffield">University of Sheffield</a> by the NALL in 1980. In the publicity that followed, one dog in particular known as Blackie was recognised by her former owners and reunited with them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In April 1984, three hundred NALL activists stormed the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Chemical_Industries_df64.html" title="Imperial Chemical Industries">ICI</a> laboratories at Alderley Edge in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheshire.html" title="Cheshire">Cheshire</a>.

<p>The <b>South East Animal Liberation League</b> (SEALL) existed in the southeast of England. It specialised in mass daylight raids of places such as animal research laboratories.</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1983 there was a mass invasion of the <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wellcome.html" title="Wellcome">Wellcome</a> laboratories at <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dartford.html" title="Dartford">Dartford</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kent.html" title="Kent">Kent</a>. Offices were broken into and documents removed, but because the company wanted to avoid further publicity, no one was charged.</li>
<li>In August 1984, sixty SEALL activists carried out a daylight raid on the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_College_of_Surgeons_of_England_bdbe.html" title="Royal College of Surgeons of England">Royal College of Surgeons</a> (RCS) at Buxton Brown Farm, Downe, Kent. They uncovered details of dental and diet experiments being carried out on monkeys and other animals. Information obtained led to the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_College_of_Surgeons_of_England_bdbe.html" title="Royal College of Surgeons of England">Royal College of Surgeons</a> being prosecuted by the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Union_for_the_Abolition_of_Vivisection_7c6c.html" title="British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection">British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection</a> for causing unnecessary suffering to a ten-year-old <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macaque_monkey.html" title="Macaque monkey">macaque monkey</a> called Mone. They were fined £250. In order to obtain the prosecution, activist Mike Huskisson had to admit to being present on the day and witnessing the documents bing removed. He was sentenced to prison for eighteen months. The RCS's conviction was later overturned on a technicality.</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/h/a/Shamrock_Farm_ced8.html" title="Shamrock Farm">Shamrock Farm</a>, which imported <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primates.html" title="Primates">primates</a> for experiments was the focus of a SEALL campaign.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Surrey_26d7.html" title="University of Surrey">University of Surrey</a> was raided by SEALL, but the only conviction was of a woman who had taken out a dog from the laboratory.</li>
<li>In October 1984, SEALL carried out three simultaneous raids on animal laboratories in <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hampshire.html" title="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>. Due to their previous successes, the police had the group under surveillance and were more prepared. Activists turned up at APT Consultancy, Cottagepatch Kennels, and Wickham Laboratories. It achieved widespread press coverage and nineteen people were arrested and charged, dubbed the "Wickham 19". Seven of them were later imprisoned, for sentences of up to three years. This caused the SEALL to disband.</li>
