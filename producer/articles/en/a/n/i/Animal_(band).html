	    <p><b>Animal</b> is an instrumental rock band based in Brooklyn, NY. Formed in the summer of 2004, the group began in San Francisco. Moving between New York City and San Francisco, Animal began to develop a unique brand of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Math_rock.html" title="Math rock">math rock</a>. In the fall of 2005, Animal was signed to <a href="../../../u/n/f/Unfun_Records_1af4.html" title="Unfun Records">Unfun Records</a>, an independent music label from Berkeley, CA. Recently affiliated with the Lumberjack Mordam distribution group.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2006 Animal toured the West Coast of the U.S. with Archaeopteryx, also of Brooklyn, NY. The groups went from Seattle, WA down to San Diego, CA. In August, Animal toured as they drove back to New York City. Animal has played with numerous other notable bands in the independent music world, including the <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two_Gallants_dbbd.html" title="Two Gallants">Two Gallants</a>, Knot Feedere (ex <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Caballero_1720.html" title="Don Caballero">Don Caballero</a>), Dirty Projectors, Paradise Islands (ex <a href="../../../e/r/a/Erase_Errata_7643.html" title="Erase Errata">Erase Errata</a>) and others.</p>
<p>The group consists of Patrick Higgins on guitar (ex/ Mayfair, Inner Struggle) and Alexander Perrelli on drums (ex/ Sidekicks, Miso Militia). Working within the constraints of the duo format, Animal has extended and elaborated on the traditional possibilities of the two-person band. Using complex layering, looping, phasing and improvisation, coupled with frenetic drumming and fluid time signatures, Animal's music recalls many elements of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_jazz.html" title="Free jazz">free jazz</a> and the <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avant_garde.html" title="Avant garde">avant garde</a> while still commiting itself to the <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-rock.html" title="Post-rock">post-rock</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-hardcore.html" title="Post-hardcore">post-hardcore</a> aesthetic. Some of the bands' influences are <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hella.html" title="Hella">Hella</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Caballero_1720.html" title="Don Caballero">Don Caballero</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battles.html" title="Battles">Battles</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/i/Ruins.html" title="Ruins">Ruins</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lightning_Bolt_a65f.html" title="Lightning Bolt">Lightning Bolt</a>, and a compendium of <a href="../../../e/x/p/Experimental_music.html" title="Experimental music">experimental music</a> composers.</p>
<p><b>What some others have said:</b></p>
<p>"Improvisational, intellectual post-rock two piece from New York. Key Markets in metropolitan cities, San Francisco and New York. All recording and effects performed and processed live, bridging the gap between recordings and live performances. Summer '06 Tour with Archaeopteryx includes a nationwide performances from New York to San Francisco. For fans of Lightning Bolt, Hella, and Don Caballero." -interpunk.com</p>
<p>"Animal are a 2-piece currently living in New York. It bums me out to say the New York part because they frickin' rule and want to see them again! Multiple times, if possible. When you hear it you will understand what I'm talking about. You'll probably hear people referencing Hella when they discuss this band. That will be an oversimplification. Yes, I thought about Hella when seeing them, but I also got a distinct experimental/noise/jazz feel from them. This band has a distinct personality in its music that doesn't make them easy to peg. Besides, be careful what you read into reviews. Opinions are like assholes. I highly recommend you check their website out and see them [live]... I've been your test-monkey. Just frickin' click it and check'it. They rule."</p>
<p>-Lars, pbase.com/pistolswing</p>
<p>"...enjoyed Animal very much too. my first time seeing them. i met them a while back and after hearing their mp3 (follow link to their web page on the right), i wished there had been more experimental rock bands at Columbia when i was there (Fenster Hall, raise the roof!). anyway, they're a duo: Patrick is guitar, Alex on the drums. Patrick builds up these big tapestries with tons of loops; his jazzish techniques are pretty bad-ass and he uses tapping and a whole lotta other snazzy ways of playing the guitar that just sound good. Alex is busy as shit but also tight and when they kick into a groove it's pretty righteous. i look forward to hearing more of this stuff. if i haven't done my job, Battles is a point of reference." -Hank Shteamer, Time Out NY</p>
<p>"The Animal LP is composed around a central group of melodic and harmonic motifs, which are explored, transformed, and pulled apart throughout each of the tracks. Despite the composition of specific motifs and patterns, Animal uses an improvisational method in the arrangement and realization of each piece. The duo have created a sound that uses both subtle and drastic shifts in tone, tempo, and intensity, while maintaining an aggressive edge and drive. The LP has over an hour of intricate guitar tapestries and frenetic drumming, off-set with thickets of noise. The record was recorded by Paul at Capture Sound Studios in Williamsburg, Brooklyn in April of 2005. Mastering by Brandon Abhorrance at Thrashmasters.com in Santa Cruz, CA." -amazon.com</p>
<p>"Animal play intricate, noisy, beautiful music that will make you take your pants off and think about your mother's best friend from high school. enjoy[ed] this record... Rating: 5 of 5 Stars!" -Customer Review from unfunrecords.com</p>
<p>"At last here is the long awaited Avant-Crazy Animal explosion. The self titled album, LP out on UNFUN is the combined efforts of Patrick and Alexander, both destroying the minds of NY gangsters and NYU dropouts with their improvisational fury. The two piece features a barrage of guitars from Pat, and Hella-esque ranting drum beats by Alexander. All proceeds of this album will benefit the bands conquest of the Americas as they plan their Summer 2006 tour. Tracks on this album range from conceptually frustratingly, to intensely trippy. Not for the weak or immature musical taste." -Johnny of Un-Fun Records</p>
