<dd>Anti-Shechita Campaigns</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In recent years, the Jewish practice of shechita, or ritual animal slaughter to obtain kosher meat, has met fierce opposition and has even been banned in a handful of European countries. These debates often have anti-Semitic undertones. Some attacks come from animal rights activists who accuse Jews of cruelty because animals are not stunned before being slaughtered. Anti-Shechita critiques also tie into older stereotypes of the bloodthirsty Jew (deicide, profanation of the Host, Lex Talionis, blood libel) and to contemporary vilifying of Israeli leaders as butchers.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If animal rights activists are known to campaign against the practise then it has everything to do with animal rights. <a href="../../../f/a/r/User%7EFarnsworth_J_07bd.html" title="User:Farnsworth J">Farnsworth J</a> 02:05, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The problem is that you've lifted this section from another article, and so it wasn't written with this article in mind. Are you also going to write a section on every single other thing animal rights activists campaign against? If so, it's going to become a very long page. It's better just to provide a link somewhere to the article on shechita. There's no issue involving shechita in particular that AR activists focus on; it's the meat industry in general that is criticized. And anyway this isn't an article about animal rights activism. See <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_liberation_movement.html" title="Animal liberation movement">Animal liberation movement</a>. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:13, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Then rewrite it but please don't remove it since it's clear that animal rights activists have protested against shechita in Europe and America. Here is another source "Observant Jews should only eat meat or poultry that has been killed in the approved way, called shechita. This method of killing is often attacked by animal rights activists as barbaric blood-thirsty ritual slaughter."<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/ethics/animals/judaism2.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/ethics/animals/judaism2.shtml" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>"The Farm Animal Welfare Council in England is scheduled to present a report in June to the British government recommending that all animals be stunned before being slaughtered. Jewish authorities unanimously stated that this is unacceptable. In fact a group of Jewish leaders walked out of a meeting with the FAWC in March when discussions broke down."<a href="http://www.kashrusmagazine.com/magazine/115/europe.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kashrusmagazine.com/magazine/115/europe.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>"German animal rights groups, the German Animal Protection League and the Union Against Abuse of Animals, maligned the ruling permitting halal slaughter and said that they would continue their quest for a European ban on all forms of ritual slaughter which they consider cruel to animals. They vowed to take their campaign across Europe and to the European Union."<a href="http://www.kashrusmagazine.com/magazine/115/europe.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kashrusmagazine.com/magazine/115/europe.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a><a href="../../../f/a/r/User%7EFarnsworth_J_07bd.html" title="User:Farnsworth J">Farnsworth J</a> 02:22, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't know why you reverted me since I did what you asked, I rewrote the "plagiarized" sentence on Richard Wagner and I've given you citations to show that schechita is something animal rights activists talk about. Can you please write something about schehita based on the above sources? <a href="../../../f/a/r/User%7EFarnsworth_J_07bd.html" title="User:Farnsworth J">Farnsworth J</a> 02:48, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please answer:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1) Could you please say (third time of asking) what ritual slaughter has to do with the <b>concept of animals rights</b>, as opposed to (some) animal rights activists?</dd>
<dd>2) What does the banning of ritual slaughter by some govts have to do with the <b>concept of animal rights</b> (or even animal rights activists)?</dd>
<dd>3) Are you going to write a section about everything animal rights activists campaign against, and if not, why single out that one? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 03:57, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Perhaps you should ask animal rights groups and activists why they campaign against ritual slaughter? Why do you think the German Animal Protection League and the Union Against Abuse of Animals are campaigning to ban all ritual slaughter in Europe? Xenophobia? A belief that foreigners and their practices are barbaric? A belief that the religious practices of others can easily be "updated"? A belief that animal rights trump those of ethnic minorities? Or that banning some forms of slaughter can help move society, step by step, to an ultimate total ban? Or just that ritual slaughter is cruel and even if we cannot ban slaughter altogether we can at least make it more humane?</p>
<p>It is quite clear that animal rights activists have much to do with the banning of ritual slaughter in several countries since they urged such a ban and the section on animal rights and anti-semitism says some interesting theoretical points about the intersection of animal rights and racism so it has everything to do with animal rights activists and, historically, with at least one school of animal rights thought, the far right nazi school.</p>
<p>As for your third question there is, I believe, some link between far-right anti-immigrant activism and some militant animal rights activists, those in the "deep ecology" and human population reduction movements. I could write something about that if you like. I don't think there is enough on wikipedia (hardly anything, really) about animal rights and fascist/far right thought - instead there's an emphasis on the animal rights movement as warm and fuzzy idealists. That element of fascist thought that is anti-modernist, anti-industrialist and harkens back to a medeaval pastoralism is a major influence in the animal rights movement and animal rights thought and was, some would say, the dominant strain until just a few decades ago. <a href="../../../f/a/r/User%7EFarnsworth_J_07bd.html" title="User:Farnsworth J">Farnsworth J</a> 04:51, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why is there no information on fascist theories of animal rights in the article?</p>
<p>There is quite a lot of literature on fascist theory and animal rights. See for instance</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Although this widespread overlap between animal liberation politics and the xenophobic and authoritarian right may seem incongruous, it has played a prominent role in the history of fascism since the early twentieth century. Many fascist theoreticians prided themselves on their movement’s steadfast rejection of anthropocentrism, and the German variant of fascism in particular frequently tended toward an animal rights position. Nazi biology textbooks insisted that “there exist no physical or psychological characteristics which would justify a differentiation of mankind from the animal world.”18 Hitler himself was zealously committed to animal welfare causes, and was a vegetarian and opponent of vivisection. His lieutenant Goebbels declared: “The Fuhrer is a convinced vegetarian, on principle. His arguments cannot be refuted on any serious basis. They are totally unanswerable.”19 Other leading Nazis, like Rudolf Hess, were even stricter in their vegetarianism, and the party promoted raw fruits and nuts as the ideal diet, much like the most scrupulous vegans today. Himmler excoriated hunting and required the top ranks of the SS to follow a vegetarian regimen, while Goering banned animal experimentation.<a href="http://www.social-ecology.org/article.php?story=20040611140817458" class="external text" title="http://www.social-ecology.org/article.php?story=20040611140817458" rel="nofollow">Ambiguities of Animal Rights</a>.</i></dd>

<p>Your full question was "2) What does the banning of ritual slaughter by some govts have to do with the concept of animal rights (or even animal rights activists)?" I've already answered it several times, numerous animal rights activists and groups have advocated the banning of ritual slaughter thus animal rights activists have everything to do with the ban. If you want to know what the ban has to do with animal rights you'd be best to ask the groups what their motivations were. I've provided some ideas on that question already. <a href="../../../f/a/r/User%7EFarnsworth_J_07bd.html" title="User:Farnsworth J">Farnsworth J</a> 05:20, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, I'm going to ask the question for a fifth time. This time I will split it into two parts so you can address both:</p>
<p>1) What does the banning of ritual slaughter by some European govts have to do with the <b>concept of animal rights</b>, which is the subject matter of this article?</p>
<p>2) Why do you believe that animal rights activists had anything to do with the European bans, given that European govts routinely and steadfastly ignore the animal rights movement? Please provide a source showing the connection between the movement and the bans.</p>
<p>And the other question again (third time I've asked this one):</p>
<p>3) Are you going to write a section on everything the animal rights movement campaigns against? If not, why not? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:54, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>1) If the banning of ritual slaughter has nothing to do with the "concept of animal rights" why do various animal rights groups campaign against it<a href="http://www.viva.org.uk/campaigns/ritual_slaughter/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.viva.org.uk/campaigns/ritual_slaughter/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>? I've asked you this several times, you've yet to provide an answer. It's quite obvious that some of them are campaigning on this question because they are trying to reduce the perceived harm to animals. However, given the aformentioned evidence of fascists in the animal rights movement there may be some ulterior motives.</p>
<p>2) "Switzerland's government recently abandoned a proposed law that would have legalized ritual animal sacrifice.</p>
<p>"Ritual animal slaughter has been illegal in Switzerland since 1893. The change in the law was supported by Jewish and Muslim leaders who expressed disappointment at the abandonment of the law.</p>
<p>"<b>The government's about face came after animal rights activists began campaigning against the law earlier this year</b>". "Bill legalising ritual animal sacrifice." Luke Coppen, <i>The Times</i> (London), March 16, 2002.</p>

<dd>I think we need to calm down a bit here. Slim's questions are valid and serve a purpose.</dd>
<dd>I think maybe all we need in this article is a small mention of ritual slaughter being opposed by animal rights groups and maybe a link to another article on the matter. As Slim says, if we include a detailed look at this area of protesting, why not include one on the hundreds of other areas of similar scale - this would lead to a huge article. Instead the article should cover the <i>concept of animal rights</i> and have links to other areas.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 18:19, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's different from what SlimVirgin has been doing which is removing <i>all</i> references to the modern movement against ritual slaughter in the mistaken belief that opposition to it has nothing to do with animal rights.

<dd>Perhaps I'm obtuse but I didn't see the point of the third question. It was not my intention to introduce a laundry list of everything the animal rights movement opposes, instead, I'm interested in aspects of the animal rights movement which have or had not been touched upon such as the links between fascist or right wing anti-modernist thought and the animal rights movement. Thus, the animal rights movement's role in opposing ritual slaughter is interesting. I also think that the Eurocentrism and xenophobia of aspects of the AR movement have not been considered in this article and it would be valuable to look at the AR and its relationship to indigenous peoples and practices so perhaps a look at the anti-fur and anti-sealing campaigns would be interesting. In short, I'm not interested in writing a section on everything the AR movement opposes but simply in examaming two or three things they oppose and how this relates to fascsism, xenophobia, Europcentrism and/or cultural intolerance. <a href="../../../f/a/r/User%7EFarnsworth_J_07bd.html" title="User:Farnsworth J">Farnsworth J</a> 21:22, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd like to remind people again that this article is note solely on the "concept of animal rights" but on the animal rights movement. The first sentence of the article reads "Animal rights, animal liberation, or animal personhood, is the movement to protect animals from being used or regarded as property by human beings." Therefore discussion the relationship between the movement and anti-Semitism, xenophobia, fascism etc is within the purview of the article as long as the information is sourced. Since this information is sourced there is no acceptable reason to conintually remove it from the article and I ask that this behaviour cease. That the animal rights movement, or parts of it, campaigned against ritual slaughter has been demonstrated quite clearly so it should not be removed even if there is a personal POV that the ritual slaughter question is outside of AR.<a href="../../../f/a/r/User%7EFarnsworth_J_07bd.html" title="User:Farnsworth J">Farnsworth J</a> 21:27, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On this note, I would like to suggest that maybe the article be split into 2. One being a discussion of animal rights philosophy/concept and the other being the movement.

<dd>If you keep it on-topic and stick closely to what the sources are saying (but don't copy them), it should be fine. The problem with your ritual slaughter section is that you copied it out of another article, so it wasn't really suitable here, and animal rights activists don't only campaign against ritual slaughter. It might be better in <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_liberation_movement.html" title="Animal liberation movement">Animal liberation movement</a>; only put it here if it's about the concept of animal rights.

<dd>Please see the first line of the article, it's explicitly about the animal rights <i>movement</i> and obviously the idea of fascist and xenophobic influences on animal rights practices is germane to the concept of animal rights.

Obviously, those in the animal rights movement who oppose ritual slaughter think it has a lot to do with the concept. As for having nothing to do with fascism or xenophobia, that's your opinion. Like it or not those views are held by some animal rights activists, particularly in Europe and I think you'd be hard pressed to argue that the historical relationship between fascism, xenophobia and the animal rights movement has no influence on the modern movement or do you view Briget Bardot and David Icke as aberrations?

<dd>Nrets, the material is regarding animal welfare. Could you explain how <i>+ In the 1930s and 40s, the anti-vivisectionist movement saw vivisection as "the extreme expression of European rationalism," says Kete. "It represented the evils of modernity. In some circles in Switzerland and Germany, an earlier representation of modernity and its dangers — the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jew</a> — merged with the image of the scientist.

<dd>If you look at the History section, there are passages there that describe how some of the early animal rights movement stems from the animal welfare movemnt and is related to opposition to vivisection. While yes, this passage does seem more realted to animal welfare (as defined by SV), it does deal with some of the historical roots of the animal rights movement, thus it is very relevant. One thing which I've done, is to move this to the history section, where it fits better and has a little more context. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets"><font color="red"><u>Nrets</u></font></a> 17:15, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The recent addition about ritual slaughter is far too specific for a general article, especially one that's already way too long, and especially because that particular campaign is not nearly the most important AR campaign of all the ones that could be included, not by a longshot. I suggest that that material be moved to another, separate article. -<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelbluejay_da97.html" title="User:Michaelbluejay">MichaelBluejay</a> 07:37, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. The issue of "links" between animal rights and racism should be a small and should be written in an NPOV way as part of a "criticism of animal rights" section. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeHobday_b9ab.html" title="User:MikeHobday">MikeHobday</a> 09:38, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I'd agree, and I'd also like to point out that it makes little sense to include the section under animal rights, as (to my understanding) proponents of animal rights would oppose animal slaughter in whatever form. As such it makes as little sense to note the opposition to kosher/halal methods of slaughter in an article on animal rights as it would to mention opposition to the gas chamber in an article on opponents of the death penalty. <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_welfare.html" title="Animal welfare">Animal welfare</a> would be a far more suitable location (as it would be possible for an animal welfare advocate to accept certain forms of animal slaughter while opposing kosher or halal means in a way it really isn't for animal rights advocates) but even then it's really a side issue, and would only warrant perhaps a sentence or two. The articles on the relevant food laws would seem to be a much more sensible location for a more detailed analysis. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi"><font color="Brown"><b>Daduzi</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/a/d/User_talk%7EDaduzi_7219.html" title="User talk:Daduzi"><font color="green"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 10:46, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However I think there are two issues here. One involves the current campaign against Kosher practices and the second, the historical use of AR arguments by the Nazis to further their antisemitic agendas. The first, I agreed that is limited in scope and does not refelct the current movement. While the later, does fit well in context in the history section of the animal rights movement and does not belong in the activism article as SV suggests. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets"><font color="red"><u>Nrets</u></font></a> 18:27, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Surely the issue of the adoption of AR arguments by the Nazis would be more at home in the <a href="../../../n/s/d/NSDAP_6abb.html" title="NSDAP">National Socialist German Workers Party</a> article than in the animal rights article. It seems to me that one can comfortably have a full understanding of animal rights, both in terms of concept and movement, without necessarily knowing all of the parties and or movements that have adopted the ideas, though if the concept of animal rights was a core ideology of the National-Socialist movement then mentioning the fact in the relevant article would help to develop a fuller understanding of the movement. If you look at the issue of Darwinism, for instance (surely a more central belief to the Nazis than AR), the influence of Darwin's thought on Nazi ideology is dealt with in depth on various pages related to Nazism, but merits only a sentence on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>, and it's hard to argue that adding more would help those interested in learning about Darwin and Darwinism.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi"><font color="Brown"><b>Daduzi</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/a/d/User_talk%7EDaduzi_7219.html" title="User talk:Daduzi"><font color="green"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 22:07, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree (also my username is localzuk), this article has too much information regarding activism in it as it stands and it needs reducing as we currently have an article that is too large.

In the 1930s and 40s, the anti-vivisectionist movement saw vivisection as "the extreme expression of European rationalism," says Kete. "It represented the evils of modernity. In some circles in Switzerland and Germany, an earlier representation of modernity and its dangers — the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jew</a> — merged with the image of the scientist.

<dd>Anyway, that section does not cover a historic part of the concept of animal rights more a different form of activisim - using the laws in nazi germany.

<dd>I think a "History of Animal Rights" article would make sense. Is anyone willing to do more research on the fascsist angle? I listed a few sources above but there are more, particularly if one looks at articles on Ecofascism. However, there is also a contemporary link (see Searchlight) which needs to be developed in the main Animal rights article. Incidentally, IronDuke's reversion of a reference to David Duke because of <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poisoning_the_well.html" title="Poisoning the well">Poisoning the well</a> is erroneous since poisoning the well refers to pre-emptively biasing an audience by saying something negative in order to negatively predispose an audience to what someone is going to say. <a href="../../../f/a/r/User%7EFarnsworth_J_07bd.html" title="User:Farnsworth J">Farnsworth J</a> 00:02, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>David Duke's relationship to the AR movement is not a notable part of the past or present of that movement. The grafs in question do not have to appear at the beginning of the article to constitute well-poisoning; the "pre-emption" consists of introducing a reader who may not be familiar with AR to tangential facts which can only serve to prejudice the reader against AR. However, we can call it <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argumentum_ad_hominem.html" title="Argumentum ad hominem">argumentum ad hominem</a>, <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guilt_by_association.html" title="Guilt by association">guilt by association</a>, or even, my personal fave, <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argumentum_ad_nazium.html" title="Argumentum ad nazium">argumentum ad nazium</a>, if you prefer. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke"><font color="green">IronDuke</font></a> 01:47, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Certainly there should be a section under "Philosophy" on the fascist school of thought in animal rights theory given the amount of evidence that exists on this. That animal rights advocates have removed any reference to the far-right from the article is unfortunate and needs to be corrected if the article is to be NPOV. You seem to now be arguing that we can never mention fascism or nazism in an article no matter how well the citation is sourced. Certainly we should not be disproportionate but neither should we whitewash the article to purge the topic of any embarassing references or topics. <a href="../../../f/a/r/User%7EFarnsworth_J_07bd.html" title="User:Farnsworth J">Farnsworth J</a> 02:07, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Staudenmaier is in some sort of dispute with supporters of Peter Steiner and Waldorf education. I'm not sure if that in and of itself disqualifies him as a reliable source even if the pro-Steiner people think it should. Nevertheless, he is only one of the people I have cited. There is also Kete, the New Left Review article, Searchlight (which has been used as a source on fascism elsewhere) and Arluke and Sax as well as lots of material on eco-fascism. Are you asserting that there is no fascist school of animal rights? If not then the regulars on this page should try to "write for the enemy" and contribute something even if it goes against the political goal of promoting animal rights as a progressive theory. <a href="../../../f/a/r/User%7EFarnsworth_J_07bd.html" title="User:Farnsworth J">Farnsworth J</a> 21:54, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>JF, Sorry it took so long to get back to you. I see that you have renewed your attack on my ratiocinative capabilities without actually countering the arguments I bring up. That you are wrong about what poisoning the well means in this context (deliberately, I hope), is not the issue. Rather, the focus is on your attempts to insert material linking the Animal Rights movement with Nazism. It is reminiscent of the tactics <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._Edgar_Hoover_ecb6.html" title="J. Edgar Hoover">J. Edgar Hoover</a> employed when reminding America that <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communists.html" title="Communists">communists</a>, too, supported <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Rights_Movement_%281955-1968%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Rights_Movement_%281955-1968%29" rel="nofollow">civil rights</a>. While he was technically correct, the participation of communists in that struggle is not notable enough to be part of the main article (though there may be excellent citations for it). <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke"><font color="green">IronDuke</font></a> 02:23, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It would be legitimate to mention in the civil rights article that Communists were involved in the movement. NPOV would mean, however, that this fact not be given disproportionate weight and that the article not imply that all civil rights activists were Communists or that the Communists enjoyed a level of control over the movement that they, in fact, did not have but were simply one element among many in the movement. In the same vein it is not legitimate to censor the role of fascism in the animal rights movement in the 1930s or today though mentions of such should not distort the role.</p>
<p>As for <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poisoning_the_well.html" title="Poisoning the well">poisoning the well</a>, please consider the definition of the concept as "adverse information about someone is pre-emptively presented to an audience, with the intention of discrediting or ridiculing everything that person is about to say", the operative word remains "pre-emptively". <a href="../../../f/a/r/User%7EFarnsworth_J_07bd.html" title="User:Farnsworth J">Farnsworth J</a> 23:01, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I believe that the views of other cultures have been totally ignored in this article and this may be because users do not want to accept views of others outside their culture and religion and would like to remain in their predetermined states. I have added the views of Sikhism to the article and these have been reverted without discussion, which I feel is probably due to a prejudice against views of other cultures on this matter. I have posted detailed questions to the user who reverted these views without any details discussion and I awaits answers to the queries listed below. I would ask other users to consider the points list below and give their views as may be I am missing something here. Your help would be most appreciated.</p>
<p><i>To User:xxx "You have reverted my contribution to the above article without any discussion. So I have to assume that there was something grossly wrong with my entry. Naturally, as a long term (over 2.5 years) and avid contributor (Sikhi section) of this site, I would appreciate more details of why you have reverted my contributions to the above article, especially without any discussion. A bland pointer to various tags is of little help. It would help if you give a little more details and examples so that changes can be made. A frank and open approach would be appreciated. I don't have any emotional axe to grind but I feel that this point is a valid one to make. What do religions have to say about this right? I have made contributions to many other rights – like women rights, rights of other to worship, right to wear turban, etc. Aren't the view of others important to this site? or do you wish to just promote "your" perceived view only. I believe that by adding my contribution, we achieve a better global view of what various cultures have to say about this issue and do not restrict it to a "western" view only – I could say that you have made the article biased to a POV.</i></p>
<p><i>OR: I do not believe that this is Original research as various quotations from a text almost 500 years old are given to support the views. All these facts can be found on the internet. What is original in this section – please elaborate so that I can show you that it has existed for 100's of years. It may be "new" to you but its not new to the world and so it is not OR.</i></p>
<p><i>NPOV: The article is factual and is not a personal POV. You can only violate this rule if you state a personal POV.

<p><i>NOT: How is anything here a violation of these rules. Which section has been violated? Please give details.</i></p>
<p><i>I believe that you have been very unfair and are taking a very "narrow" view of the issues and are "stuck" in your predetermined attitudes to this subject matter. I would appreciate a honest and detailed discussion of the reason for your action.</i></p>
<p><i>Further, aren't the views of Sikhism (fifth biggest organised religion) important to articles on this site. Or are you only interested in the narrow view of the west and a view-point that suits you in the west? I hope this action is not based on a prejudice against other cultures and their views? If it is not, then I expect a detailed reply to my query.</i></p>
<p><i>I have been contributing to various wikis for several years (and am an administrator at one) and have authored 1000's of articles - the first on Wikipedia on 11 March 2004, a little longer than you have and I have OR and NPOV marked as links on my user page as I thought I would study them regularly.

<dd>Hi Harisingh, what you're adding is not connected, so far as I can see, to the modern concept of <b>animal rights</b>, which is what this article is about. If you can find someone who writes about Sikhism in terms of that concept, by all means add something, sticking very closely to what the sources say. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:27, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How do consider this a modern issue? - Various cultures have given animal certain rights for a very long time. Nowhere does it say in the title of the article or in the article introduction that the article only deals with animal rights in the modern age only. If what you say is correct then should the article not be named something like "animal rights in the modern age". Calling it "animal rights" point to the generality of the coverage in respect of time and scope.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In fact the historical section reads: <b>"….In the 6th century BCE, Pythagoras, a philosopher and mathematician, urged respect for animals because he believed in the transmigration of souls, while Aristotle, writing in the 4th century BCE, argued that animals ranked far below humans in the Great Chain of Being, or scala naturae, because of their alleged irrationality, and that as a result animals had no interests of their own, and existed only for human benefit."</b> This covers the period from the 6th century BC.</dd>

<p>I don't believe that anyone person has a monopoly on the content of this article or any other article. The article is simply entitled "animal rights" and anything relevant to do with this subject matter can be added to the article as long as it conforms to the rules of Wikipedia. The header states that <b>"This article is about the concept or philosophy of animal rights"</b> and not as you state to do with animals as "having rights as individuals" and having the "same consideration as those of human beings". Which countries provide these rights and how is this reflected in the title?</p>
<p>In many eastern cultures, animals are given certain rights. Whether these are individual or group rights is something that can be narrated in the article. Sikhism is a religion not a state or nation – It provides individuals with spiritual and moral guidance and does not set legal laws or enforces them. It is like saying that Christianity can set laws and prosecute them as well. I think you fail to grasp the difference between a religion and a state and the fact that this has no relevance to the issue of rights. In other issues of rights, for example, Guru Nanak was a proponent of Women's rights and this fact features on this subject and is an important fact that needs to promoted and should feature on all modern encyclopaedias.</p>
<p>There is a section on "Abolitionist view" - does this culture give a "rights as individuals, which they believe should be enforceable in law" to animal? – If they don't then why, in your opinion is this section in this article. Do all the other sections conform to your strict requirements outline above? If not, then they need to be removed.</p>
<p>Further, I made several small changes to the top of the article which I believe that you have unfairly removed. I list these below. Could you please give reasons why these have been removed as well:</p>
<p>The history of animal rights is said to stretch back to before 450BC <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[5]</a></sup> and the time of Empedocles of Acagras in Sicily, c. (492-432 BC) <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[6]</a></sup> who was a philosopher and poet.</p>
<p>The rights of animals have been given consideration by various cultures and religion over many centuries. Various ancient rulers have also stipulated certain rights for animals. <a href="../../../a/s/o/Asoka.html" title="Asoka">Emperor Ashoka</a> (304 BC–232 BC) who was ruler of India proclaimed these regarding animals in his various edicts that "no living beings are to be slaughtered or offered in sacrifice" <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[7]</a></sup> and in Edict 11 that ".. kindness to living beings should be made strong and the truth should be spoken" and finally "The Dhamma regulations I have given are that various animals must be protected." <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>I believe that this matter is not being dealt with fairly and that a narrow restricted POV is being propagated. I will gather more research before I return to deal with this matter. In the meantime I ask for your reply to the question posed here.

<dd>Hari, by all means start an article on Sikhism and and its view of non-human animals, but this is an article about the modern concept of animal rights, which is well-defined by the scholars who write about it. That is the definition we are working within: animal rights as defined by <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Singer_cbda.html" title="Peter Singer">Peter Singer</a>, Tom Regan, Gary Francione, and all the animal rights legal scholars, the animal rights law courses, and the animal rights groups. See <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.

<dd>I want to stress that I'm not trying to obstruct a section on Sikhism. I'm just trying to make sure it's relevant. If you can find sources to support what you're saying — sources who explicitly talk about it in terms of animal rights, or in terms of some degree of moral equality between human and non-human animals — that would be fine, but the sources would have to be authoritative, and it would need its own section; or if it's just an historical view you're taking, then it should go in the history section. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 06:13, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, I am sorry but I either do not agree with your stand or may be I do not understand your exact reasons for the stand that you have taken. I can't understand how an article with a generalised name like "animal rights" ("AR") can have restriction imposed on what can be entered into that article – All views which have something important to do with AR and obeying the normal WP rules must be allowed to appear. If for example in 350BC King Ashoka said something like "No one in my kingdom is allowed to kill animals or be cruel to them" then I think this is relevant here and some aspect of this has to appear in the article. I think the world would be interested to know that as long ago as that - someone had recognised that animals had some rights and that they needed to be treated in a certain way. To restrict the subject material because XYZ has defined a general term of this nature cannot apply here – not to an article with title of this nature.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What I understand is that you do not wish old Indian or recent Sikh views included here because XYZ western authors "have defined this term". (<i>" we are working within: animal rights as defined by Peter Singer, Tom Regan, Gary Francione,"</i>) I do not think this is acceptable to WP. You cannot restrict content based on "perceived" guideline by a small group of authors. AR has been dealt with at some level for 1000's of years. They may not have called it AR but they were dealing with the rights of animals. How can you justify leaving all this out? If you take this argument to the n'th degree, it boils down to a violation of NPOV as you are using clever mechanism to restrict the views of others on this subject and preferring the views of XYZ only; ignoring various valid and confirmed historically facts; disregarding widely available data on the net and historical records – and only allowing a narrow restricted view-point - this I think is unacceptable.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You say: <i>"If you can find sources to support what you're saying — sources who explicitly talk about it in terms of animal rights, or in terms of some degree of moral equality between human and non-human animals…"</i> Sources have been included for all the statements that were made. In fact everything I said was based on sources. Why should the sources specifically mention "animal rights"? What if they only mention "creatures" or "living beings" or just animals? Why does this preclude them? Why should they have "…some degree of moral equality between human and non-human animals". Why should they compare animals with humans? If the statement just say something like: "Do not harm animals or kill them else you will suffer in hell. Treat them just like your own…" – Why and how can you exclude this from the article if this statement was made by a prominent person like an emperor or prophet of the time and had an impact on the region and the history of the area.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>you also say: <i>"….but the sources would have to be authoritative, and it would need its own section; or if it's just an historical view you're taking, then it should go in the history section."</i> The sources were the Sikh holy book and confirmed and widely available documents about King Ashoka. I also have further quotes from Bhagavad Gita, which is the Hindu scriptures from 2500BC and respected by over 800 million followers. Most of this information was in a sub-section on "Eastern Views" with small modification to the introduction as this intro is clearly not correct – It is just a "western" view of this subject matter not a global view.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think I have dealt with all your queries in great detail and I would request that you kindly re-evaluate this article bearing in mind the points that I have made. May be we should have a generalised article on AR with all the views included and a narrow one with a title like "AR in the modern context" or "AR in the west" (of course, this is a fork and not allowed under the rules). If you give an article a general name like AR, then any important fact related to this topic needs to be included to make the article NPOV – It is imperative that all relevant views are included here and not just a restricted "western" view only. Please look at this <a href="http://www.animalrightshistory.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.animalrightshistory.org/" rel="nofollow">site</a> which is only one of many sites which has huge amount of material that is lacking on WP. How can this situation be justified? WP should be a summary and true reflection of all the facts available in the world on any given subject.</dd>

<dd>Hari, you're engaged in original research. Please review <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>. You're trying to compile an animal rights argument (your own argument) based on ancient primary sources such as the Sikh holy book and the Bhagavad Gita. That would be like an editor using the Torah to show that Judaism does or doesn't support animal rights, or the New Testament to show the same about Christianity. We should base articles as far as possible on secondary sources. The concept of animal rights is a new one, a modern one. It's not about not being cruel to animals, or about looking after them. It's not about animal welfare. It's about awarding animals legal rights, the right not to be used by human beings and not to be regarded as property.</dd>

<p>The issues outlined are not original research as all the facts that have been mentioned are recorded and these are confirmed historical facts. OR is when new material is introduced for the first time. The facts quoted are not "new material". Whether a holy book supports or opposes a view is rigidly set and is a fact – It is not original research.</p>
<p>If you look at my userpage you will notice that I have WP:NOR, WP:NPOV and WP:V hyperlinked – so I am very familiar with these pages – I do not need to review them. The rules say: <b>"Citing sources and avoiding original research are inextricably linked: the only way to demonstrate that you are not doing original research is to cite reliable sources"</b>. I have cited many sources which you can easily check on the net as they are very widely mentioned and verifiable. Could you please give me examples of OR in the section that I wrote?</p>
<p>Also the rules say: <b>"All articles in Wikipedia should be based on information collected from published primary and secondary sources. This is not "original research"; it is "source-based research", and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia."</b> The information given by me is a secondary source as it is presented in a coherent and independent form. The quote make the point without any input from me. A primary source would be a photo or a field observation and I would have to explain what this primary source proved, etc. A secondary source does not require input from the writer. Please explain how you refer to my work based on these historical facts as OR? Please give quotes from the rules to support your assertions.</p>
<p>The concept of AR is not new. The rights of animals have been referred to for thousands of years – They did not have a label for them and these rights were simply referred in the ancient texts without a particular label – we have now invented a label for this right – that does not mean that this right was not recognised and practiced by our ancestors. Eg: King Ashoka ("KA") declared in about 250BC that: ""No living beings are to be slaughtered or offered in sacrifice" (The Fourteen Rock Edicts, 1) That gives all animals a right to live; also "….(KA has ) , made provision for two types of medical treatment: medical treatment for humans and medical treatment for animals." Gives animals the right to medical treatment when ill. How can you say that AR is a new thing when these rights were given to animals by a very powerful Buddhist ruler over 200 years before Christ? And they are widely documented!!</p>
<p>I am not referring to animal welfare and how to look after animals – I am referring to the rights, liberties and the sort of treatments that was approved for the animals. If the state says that "Prisoners cannot be tortured" – that gives a right to the prisoners of non-torture. The rights of animals can be stated in various ways and it does not have to be a legal way only.</p>
<p>"The fundamental principle of the AR is that nonhuman animals deserve to live according to their own natures, free from harm, abuse, and exploitation." – So any text legal, religious or otherwise that has a bearing on the points mentioned here gives rise to the creation of a right or to an abolition of a right.</p>
<p>You have failed to address the various points outlined before – I will be much obliged if you could properly address all the queries that I have put forward now and before. Your detailed reply would be most appreciated even if it takes more time. I hope you have noticed that I have dealt with each point that you have made in great depth while most of your replies are just a short paragraph. I would appreciate if you could address the points I make with care and due consideration which I hope you will agree they deserve in light of the amount of time and energy that I have expended.

<dd>OR is not only when new facts are introduced. It is when any fact, opinion, argument, analysis, or synthesis is introduced that is not supported by reliable published sources and which serves to advance a position. Primary sources may not be used to make interpretive claims. You must find reliable <i>secondary</i> sources who say what you are saying. Then I'm happy for you to add this to the history section.

<p>Hari, I'm not sure Slim would agree with me, but my take on the article is that it's primarily about the modern animal rights movement, and the history section provides a background for the modern, western movement. I don't believe that Sikhism influenced anyone in the modern movement, or any of the philosophers who influenced the modern movement. (I might be wrong about that -- please show me if I am.) This is not to say that the information you're supplying isn't valuable: I believe there must be a place for it somewhere, perhaps a religious views of animals article, or some such.</p>
<p>We just can't put in every statement made about anything that could be construed as relating to the rights of animals throughout history into this article: it would be way too long if we did. We just had this discussion recently with someone who wanted to put in some Catholic stuff about animals. It was interesting, but not germane. It really feels to me like an article on religion and animals might be the way to go (if it's not been done already). <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke"><font color="green">IronDuke</font></a> 15:11, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

This page would remain for all general views relating to AR, which is the way things should be.

<dd>The only problem I have with Nrets' version is that there is no such thing as Ancient animal rights movement (or any variation thereof) against which to contrast a modern movement. What we <i>do</i> have is a lot of religions with various opinions on the matter, and they could all be grouped in an appropriate article. I think by and large that writings on the religious aspects of animal welfare is not so voluminous that they would require separate articles for each religion, but articles could be spun off if necessary. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke"><font color="green">IronDuke</font></a> 23:34, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well no, I wasn't suggesting an Ancient animal rights movement article. Maybe the main article could provide a general overview of the history, philosophy, activism, etc. of the animal rights movement, including the modern view, but then spin off larger articles to the different aspects: history, AR and religion, modern movement, activism, welfare, etc. If you look at the archive of this talk page, several other valid views have been excluded based on the fact that they do not represent the modern movement, but clearly several people think they should fit within the scope. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets"><font color="gray"><u>Nrets</u></font></a> 00:12, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see why we need an "Ancient animal rights movement" article as well. AR should cover the broad aspect of the rights of animals and include all the views about this from the year dot. Within this article would be short sections on many things relating to AR and then there would be links to things like Modern understanding of animal rights, "History of rights of animals", "Religious views of animal rights" and so on as the article grew and as the need to keep the article manageable became important. As it is stand at present, AR does not mean rights of animals but means "Modern view of animal rights" – I don't believe this is desirable or the correct way to arrange an encyclopaedia. If you look at <a href="http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9384263" class="external text" title="http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9384263" rel="nofollow">Britannica's</a> coverage of this subject, you will see that it covers many aspects of AR and is not restricted like WP. Surely that's the way to go. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarisingh_c8a5.html" title="User:Harisingh">Hari Singh</a> 00:08, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, I may not have been as clear as I wanted to be. I'm not suggesting we have an Ancient animal rights movement article: I was pointing to the impossibility of such an article. AR is a <i>modern</i> phenomenon. Think of <a href="../../../r/e/p/Reproductive_rights.html" title="Reproductive rights">reproductive rights</a>, pehaps, as an analogy. It is true that in many societies in the past women were afforded varying levels of protection with regard to reproductive rights. But the nomenclature/concept as such did not exist then. It is <i>modern</i>, just as AR is used here as a modern term. Is that clear, or am I making things muddier?</dd>

<dd><u>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No need to apologise</u>, IronDuke. We have discussions to sort out our ideas/views and try to understand each others POV – so no problem.<br />
I don't think it is right to say that the "rights of animals" have never before been recognised. That is not correct as I pointed out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Animal_rights#Reply_to_user:Slimvirgin" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Animal_rights#Reply_to_user:Slimvirgin" rel="nofollow">here</a> and said: <i>" The history of animal rights is said to stretch back to before 450BC <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[9]</a></sup> and the time of Empedocles of Acagras in Sicily, c. (492-432 BC) <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[10]</a></sup> who was a philosopher and poet."</i> I agree with you that the term is new but the concept has existed for a very long time. If you look at this article on <a href="http://www.animalrightshistory.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.animalrightshistory.org/" rel="nofollow">AR history</a>, I hope you will agree with me that AR as a concept is not new at all and that many humans cultures have recognised the need to provide some rights to animals rather than treat them as just a resource or commodity. Their "special-ness" has been recognised for a very long time.<br />
Again with reproductive rights, I would say that the concept and practice were probably there but the term was not. We, these days have coined many new terms. This is a on-going exercise which adds a few new terms probably everyday to the English language but in many cases these terms are just referring to something which may be very old in practice.<br />
The reason to include the Britannica article was<br />
a). because it is well-known and<br />
b). to just show the global coverage of the article.<br />
I am not suggesting that we use it as a template but as a comparison of the "coverage", "scope" and the "angle" taken by the article. It is an article which covers a wide variety of very different issues in brief and then points to more detailed pages for specialist treatment.<br />
Incidentally, the book version of Britannica (1990 edition) that I have does not even have an entry for AR. Just goes to show how the language is changing all the time.<br />
I don't know if this gives you a better idea of what I am saying or perhaps I am not making any sense??? --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarisingh_c8a5.html" title="User:Harisingh">Hari Singh</a> 00:12, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This has been discussed to death throught the animal rights articles. A 'criticism section' is a bad idea as it is inherently POV (we don't have a promotion section). It leads to POV fork articles which are also bad. It leads to POV trolling and unsourced additions. The policies and guidelines ask for such criticisms to be weaved in with the rest of the article instead, where poinient.

<dd>It may be POV to basically say "I endorse the following criticism of the Animal Rights movement," or to present the cirticisms as simple facts, but it in encyclopedic and NPOV to provide verifiable sources to show that there are those (some scientific and medical researchers, some religions who wish to sacrifice animals, some in the agricultural field) who have criticisms of, say, the tactics of PETA, or of some of the demands of animal rights advocates. Many Wikipedia articles have such a criticism section, and are better for it. To forbid its inclusion, period, is inherently POV. It is improper to demand the criticism be proved true in debate here before they are included in the article; it is sufficient to show they are being made, by reference to reputable and verifiable sources which quote them, as outlined in my first sentence. It may not seem so the the proponents of animal rights, but in general the entire article is a "promotion section."<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 20:35, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please not ehte common presence of Criticism sections, despite what some some few editors may have placed in a "Policies" page. The article <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_testing.html" title="Animal testing">Animal testing</a> has a 1580 word "Controversy" section, then a 695 word "Arguments in brief" section with arguments pro and con. Many articles about controversial subjects have a "Criticism" section and are better for it.

<dd>Yes, I know what that page says and I also said that it was an essay... Please give me some reasons why a criticisms section is good. Another reason why it is bad is that it is a bad article structure. Someone looking at a fact in an article with such a section has to look in 2 places in order to get the full picture.

<dd>Localzuk, For example look at the animal testing article. Not all the arguments in the pro and con sections directly address each other. Some are even just a matter of opinion (eg. "no degree of animal suffering is worth any possible benefit to humans"). Thus, if I want to know what the anti-animal research lobby has to say I can simply look up that section. I agree with SV about the sections being troll magnets, but as far as organization goes, I do think it makes more sense. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets"><font color="gray"><u>Nrets</u></font></a> 17:23, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Someone has added that Julian H. Franklin's book is "ground-breaking."

<dd>I think I'm using that too. What happened was that I saw columns fine until a few weeks ago, when suddenly I started seeing footnotes that had been listed in columns as all over the place in terms of numbering. The first footnote would be 99, the second 100, the third 2, the fourth 3, the fifth 101, and so on, and when I looked in the notes section, most of the footnotes had doubled i.e. were listed twice (although strangely not all of them). That continued for a few days, and then it went back to normal, except that I couldn't see columns anymore. I didn't change anything on my computer that I'm aware of while this was going on. It doesn't really bother me.

<dd>I'm confused, you're not disputing the neutrality of any part of the article so why did you add the tag? Also, what do you mean by "POVish Image on intro"? I'm not very familiar with the broader concept of AR, but it seem to me that the Great Ape Project is as good representation of it as any.

<dd>Agree. This is a complex article and just wandering in and saying 'it is POV' without providing decent reasoning is as bad as not providing a reason at all.</dd>
<dd>Note, the article is about the <i>concept of animal rights</i> and not <i>animal rights activism</i> so there will be less criticism of the concept than the activism. I do agree, however, that we need to look at the external links section as many are not relevant to the concept but are to activism.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 13:43, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>POV tags have to be accompanied by specific suggestions for change that are actionable within the policies, not just vague hand-waving.

<p>Similar attributions of POVity have recently started sprouting up on several AR-related article talk pages, such as <a href="../../../e/t/h/Talk%7EEthics_of_eating_meat_9861.html" title="Talk:Ethics of eating meat">Talk:Ethics of eating meat</a>. I suppose it just means that some people don't like any pro-animal voices to be publicly heard.</p>
<p>There are countless articles on WP that are uniformly POV <i>against</i> animal rights. For example, all the articles about how to chop up this and that variety of animal corpses, such as <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicken_%28food%29.html" title="Chicken (food)">Chicken (food)</a>; which speak about animals as if they were pure commodities, with no mention of the fact that many people think otherwise. Amidst all this anti-animal POV, it is only fair that a page about animal rights should simply explain what AR is, and what our arguments are.</p>

<p>In support of the OP, the external links section is AR biased. There are links to a site set up in memory of a convicted arsonist, paramilitary organisations and myriad anti-vivisection groups, however few anti AR sites are listed (eg. the research defence society's page is not listed - soon to be rectified) As the purpose of the external links section is to provide further information, not to further an argument, I propose that more of the websites of the opposition are included, and that vandalism of that section, as seems rife (the centre for consumer freedom link has had an anti-CfCF link added - please keep your AR links out of that section) is prevented as much as possible. The above poster misunderstands what wikipedia is about. It is not a forum for argument, nor a recruiting tool for individual causes. You have the right to amend any of the "against animal rights" articles you like to show that there is opposition to those practices. You do not have a right to monopolise a Wikipedia page for your own ends. I will not post on this page again, as non AR views are clearly not welcome. 88.105.181.28 15:40, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm having trouble with consistency in the disclaimer at the top that this is about concepts and philosophy, and including criticisms on methods such as the PETA-holocaust controversy, and the sentence from Tony Blair on the silent majority, belong on Animal Liberation Movement or <a href="../../../p/e/t/PETA_7157.html" title="PETA">PETA</a> or both but not here.

Since Sztybel is not a big-name animal ethicist in the league of Singer and Regan, should he even be included in this article?

<p>AR, can you say what "moral intuition is superior, and that it can be dissuaded with facts" means? Do you mean dissuaded by? Superior to what? Also, what are "considerational differences," and does Posner use that term? And what does Posner mean by "soft utilitarianism."

<dd>It's still not clear.

I can't think what "adherence to the ethical logic embodied" means.

<p>The article is totally eurocentric. Animal rights have been accepted and recognised in east far more than west in past and present. From the discussion, I can see there was an attempt to remove this bias, but was summarily dismissed presumably by a bunch of arrogant westerners.

<dd>Hi, you are indeed right that this article is western biased. Feel free to add information, but keep in mind that the article's focus is on the concept and philosophy of animal rights (I am sure this won't be a problem, as the 'activist' side of things is a lot different in non-western countries).

<dd>This is a good subject for additions to the article, as it has been a substantial topic of ethical argument in research by top ethicists. But Michaelbluejay is right, this page is about discussion of additions/deletions/edits to the article of material already created and relevant to philosophy of animal rights. So if you are concerned, find articles and arguments by prominent ethicists, and add cited verifiable references and arguments from those articles to the main WIKI page. --Animalresearcher 10:57, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>MichaelBlueJay, I would like to point out that the Animal Rights movement revolves around getting animals equal rights as people, which would imply that they are people enough to have rights. So while nobody says this directly, it is what is implied. Animalresearcher, I agree.

<dd>I don't think your supposition is true. Most animal rights seems to attempt to argue that humans should be morally above the status of being a predator/user of other animals (although I agree the variety of arguments DEFINITELY confuses the layman). The fact that many of their arguments logically lead to necessity to protect natural prey from natural predators is a related point of debate, although I do not think you will find proponents of animal rights who agree, just as you will not find opponents of animal rights who agree that rights for marginal humans but not animals necessarily implies illogical discrimination comparable to racism or sexism. --Animalresearcher 21:39, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are many human concepts but I'm sure you agree we need to discuss them in their appropriate articles. The animal rights movement is a political movement which may gather its material from many sources, but it is POV to include those sources in a manner designed to influence the reader to draw conclusions about them. I don't see any great effort here to include other historical concepts which might show a different POV, such as the Buddhist debate regarding plant sentience and the need for human compassion toward plants.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Discussing this further, in the paragraph starting with <i>The 20th century debate</i> we see an opinion which is defended with a possibly recursive reference to another encyclopedia discussion. To keep this paragraph you'll need to show a valid primary source for the described events but more importantly you'll need to show a source which supports the assertion that the argument was about animal rights per se and not what it might appear to be to persons with other POV, such as a religious warning by Pythagoras.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The next paragraph, starting with <i>In the 17th century</i> is referenced to a Wikipedia article which does not support its assertions. There are quotes which are not found in the reference. Further, there is seen a POV leap of faith where the article writer apparantly patches together a snippet from <a href="http://www.constitution.org/jjr/ineq.htm|Rousseau's" class="external text" title="http://www.constitution.org/jjr/ineq.htm|Rousseau's" rel="nofollow">discourse</a>. Well, Rousseau clearly demonstrates in the preface of that article that he is using observations of equality between animals in nature to make conjectures about equality in human relationships. <i>It is easy to perceive that it is in these successive changes in the constitution of man that we must look for the origin of those differences which now distinguish men, who, it is allowed, are as equal among themselves as were the animals of every kind, before physical causes had introduced those varieties which are now observable among some of them.</i></dd>

<dd>I've restored it because there's no reason to remove it. For example, you wrote: "in the paragraph starting with <i>The 20th century debate</i> we see an opinion which is defended with a possibly recursive reference to another encyclopedia discussion," and you say we need a primary source. But in fact, secondary sources are preferable to primary sources for the most part (see WP:NOR), and the EB counts as a reliable source for WP. I'm not sure why you would call it "recursive." Anything with a fact tag can be removed, of course. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:07, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK one more time. If this were a subject which is concrete then possibly factual references back and forth between encyclopedias might be appropriate. But if a subject is predominantly a secondary abstraction then recursive references take on a quality of overabstraction. (Basically it doesn't work to support an assertion of opinion by citing another encyclopedist's editorial opinion.) It is purely POV until proven otherwise. The other paragraph cites a Wikipedia article which does not substantiate the assertion. Neither does the original Rousseau source does not substantiate your assertion.</p>
<p>One can read a lot into things if they have a strong POV but we're editing an encyclopedia article here and not trying to construct a history which doesn't exist.<a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobitealive_2843.html" title="User:Trilobitealive">Trilobitealive</a> 00:38, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We're talking about the history of the concept please and not the discussion about the modern movement. My purpose in doing the edit was to give this a clearer and less equivocable starting place.</dd>
<dd>Looking at this article as an outsider with no major opinion one way or another the first thing which strikes me is that the section we are discussing is not a history but an opinion which reads as a modern speculation (POV if you will) about past events and writings which do not objectively support it. For instance Rousseau was clearly discussing a need to shape human interactions in a manner similar to the way he conjectured animals in a state of nature interacted without laws nor rules.</dd>
<dd>Looking at the article as a whole it seems that it is a well written and well managed exposition of a belief system, nothing more. As such, even a superficial deconstruction leads one to the realization that many of its assertions have interlocking internal rhetorical support but are not supported by any consensual language to the point where a nonbeliever can see objectivity.</dd>
<dd>If we can come to an understanding I believe I can help make this an article which is more neutral but I fear that without input from persons such as me it will not achieve its possibilites.</dd>

<dd>Actually, I don't agree this is a well-written article, whether you call it the exposition of a belief system or anything else. Apart from the lead, which I like, I see it as poorly written and poorly researched; I've been wanting to clean it up for almost two years, but can't face the reading I'd have to do. You're therefore more than welcome to try your hand at improving it as far as I'm concerned. My only beef is that it should be done within the content policies. If the EB says that the concept of animal rights can be traced back to the earliest philosophers, then that counts as reliable material for Wikipedia, and it shouldn't be removed over another editor's objections. I see you've not been editing for too long, so perhaps a review of the three core content policies would be helpful. They are <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.

<dd>I believe it is well written as an apology (in the classical sense) for the viewpoint of the writers but not as an encyclopedia article. Like you I don't have the time nor energy to wade through such a low signal to noise ratio in all the material written on the subject in the past 10 years. So I'm going to leave your last edit alone for the time being and add the appropriate dispute flag. I would hope you to be so as to understand that <b>a dispute remains</b>.<a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobitealive_2843.html" title="User:Trilobitealive">Trilobitealive</a> 01:23, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Back to the specific disputed content, I need to point out that EB references were not all the ones questioned. Even if their validity is conceded the other material is still disputed. (I don't concede that point as the EB is not original source material nor is it verifiable that it quotes the original works in context.) Rousseau's discussion about animals, in addition to being merely illustration for his discussion of human rights, was actually a dissent against Aquinas, apoint which is not mentioned.</dd>
<dd>I agree the need for reading .V.'s essay on NPOV would be a good starting point for more than one of the editors of this particular article. Regards<a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobitealive_2843.html" title="User:Trilobitealive">Trilobitealive</a> 01:21, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>SlimVirgin, perhaps it would help if I broke this down into parts. If you want I can continue to explain a little bit along over time until my points become clearer or I can take it in whatever order you like. Here is one support for my apprehensions regarding use of Encyclopedia Brittanica: It is a quote from <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a> <i>Tertiary—Summarized material drawn from secondary sources, as in general encyclopedias.

<dd>Hi Trilobite, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a> is just a guideline, not policy, and it's a guideline that many editors don't rely on as a guideline; in fact, there have been several recent attempts to have its status removed because of the kind of editing that has gone on there. So it has no authority. The policy is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and I don't think it says anything about encyclopedias. Also, it obviously depends which encyclopedia we're talking about; the EB is regarded as a reliable source for Wikipedia.

<dd>Answering your question first, I don't see the section contributing any <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empirical.html" title="Empirical">empirical</a> support for the idea. Using another encyclopedia for illustration purposes I'd invite you to read the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on Pythagoras.<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pythagoras/" class="external autonumber" title="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pythagoras/" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> In it you will find a more detalied discussion on the basis of Pythagoras' concern for animals: through transmutation of soul he considered individual animals to be a developmental stage of individual human beings...it says nothing about animal rights nor even their welfare, just mentions his concern about them as being reincarnated friends and family. The article also states that he wrote nothing, nor was any of his work recorded by contemporaries and that material attributed to him was often forged.<a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobitealive_2843.html" title="User:Trilobitealive">Trilobitealive</a> 02:47, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I gave consideration to your conception that the EB is sufficient source for such a contested article. Even though the person who cited it did not leave an online link I was able to find an article which contained some of the material in the first paragraph. <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9007642/animal-rights" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9007642/animal-rights" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> After reading it I concluded that the Wikepedia paragraph is very close to plagiarism, but is possibly not because its key assertions were entirely unsupported by the EB article. Perhaps you'd like to read the EB article to determine in your own mind 1)whether plagiarism exists, 2)whether you can find any actual support for the Wikipedia section's opening statement 3) whether by comparison you can see the relatively strong POV shown by the Wikipedia article? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobitealive_2843.html" title="User:Trilobitealive">Trilobitealive</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobitealive_ac84.html" title="User talk:Trilobitealive">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Trilobitealive_23d1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Trilobitealive">contribs</a>) 02:44, 9 January 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>You're engaged in original research. WP is a tertiary source. We repeat what reliable published sources have said. If the EB says we can trace AR back to the earliest philosophers, and you think that's wrong, you should write to the EB and ask them to correct it. Or you should look for a source that categorically says AR cannot be traced to the earliest philosophers and we can include that opinion too. What you can't do is look around for other material to reinforce your own opinion and use that to exclude what a reliable source has said.

<p>Hi. Looking over this page carefully for the first time, it seems that, in particular, Cohen's position is not represented particularly well. Additionally, is there some sort of rationale for including strict utilitarian/Regan's specific rights view/an abolitionist view and not some others? There are other, "softer" utilitarians who hold an animal rights position, "rights" folks who have markedly different conceptualizations of rights, and consequentialists who also are in favor of animal rights, at least if Singer can be said to be in support of "rights." I don't think we ought to include every little neuance, but perhaps major streams of thought might be worthwhile. Just wondering what's been happening; particularly since this is an area that I'm currently working in.--<a href="../../../c/2E/l/User%7EC.lettinga_b2f4.html" title="User:C.lettinga">C.lettinga</a> 23:46, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"The animal-rights debate, much like the abortion debate, is complicated by the difficulty of establishing clear-cut distinctions on which to base moral and political judgements. The default human/non-human animal relationship is deeply rooted in prehistory and tradition but arguments for animal rights are flawed by the basic human inability to understand the subjective state of animals in question. [30]" The citation for this claim does not seem to support it. The final paragraph in the paper explains that given the difficulty in reading animals' minds that the precautionary principle should be more central to the discussion of rights than most people take it to be. This paper is clearly NOT a claim that arguments for animals' rights are uniformily flawed. (I wonder whether the author of the paragraph actually read the paper they cited?) Also of interest is another paper by one of the authors.

</blockquote>
<p>This was inserted into the history section for the purpose of equating animal rights with Nazism. It seems absurd, particularly as the Nazi anti-vivisection legislation was the same as the British legislation of 1875. Does anyone object to its removal? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 06:47, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Object. If the Nazis are one of the first to enact animal protection rights, then the information should be included. You shouldn't censor Wikipedia like what you did there. The paragraph in no way states animal rights is Nazism. That paragraph seems well supported as well.--141.213.198.142 04:13, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Plants, like animals, don't want to be killed for their lands and nutrients. Shouldn't there be an article on Plant rights? For example, it will forbid the removal of trees from lands for houses when apartments could be built to house more people. People who love life and support animal rights but neglect plants are hypocrites.

<p>There should also be an article on Plant welfare for those who believe plants can be cleared from lands for housing, and for other good intentions such as removal of invasive plant species, but unnecessary removal or damage to single plants or plant parts for aesthetic values such as mowing the lawn or removal of weeds on sidewalks should be forbidden.--141.213.198.142 04:10, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First of all this is not the place for orginal research - if the term "plant rights" really exists, then give a link and we'll talk about it. Secondly, if you actually <i>read</i> this article you'll see terms like "sentience" which is largely defining <b>why</b> plants are excluded from rights.

<dd>It's not original research. Look <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=plant+rights&amp;rls=com.microsoft:en-us&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;startIndex=&amp;startPage=1" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=plant+rights&amp;rls=com.microsoft:en-us&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;startIndex=&amp;startPage=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?q=plant+rights&amp;rls=com.microsoft:en-us&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;startIndex=&amp;startPage=1</a> There's also a "plant pain" and a thing called "plant intelligence."

<p>I've replaced the anti-environemntalist description of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Bidinotto_1f02.html" title="Robert Bidinotto">Robert Bidinotto</a> with his job, writer. I want to make it clear that I am not advocating his opinions or beliefs, but in general this kind of editing is exactly what <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is supposed to address:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Fairness of tone</b> If we are going to characterize disputes neutrally, we should present competing views with a consistently fair and sensitive tone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the label of anti-environmentalist is applied to a person, it essentially says "don't listen to him/her they hate the environment."</p>
<p>This article makes it seem as if there are only two options; treat animals as equals or treat animals as the Nazi's did people.</p>
<p>Respectfully, I can't agree with all of the ideas of the Animal Rights movement because animals won't acknowledge any policy (they can't) and if I emancipatd my dog I'd have to open the front door and let him roam as he pleased probably never to return. If I had a dog like a <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pit_Bull_86d7.html" title="Pit Bull">Pit Bull</a> there would also be the possibility of someone getting hurt or killed by my former dog. However I think that there is a lot that could be done to improve animal rights in a more reasonable way. Therefore I feel there is midle ground here, so I'm just saying that we should acknowledge that there are more than two ways to see this. For the basic sake of fairness, let's not use labels like anti-environmentalist (or terms like tree hugger for those inclined the other way). <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 11:27, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It might be useful to bring more consistent terminology into this article. Sometimes the term "animal" is used to refer to all animals (Kingdom: Animalia), while other times it's used to refer to all animals except humans. Perhaps the former is more scientifically accurate, and can be defined in the intro as such, and then when specifically referring to all other animals species except humans, use the term "non-human animals". The term or "other species" should refer to all living things, not just animals. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.163.178.143 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__68.163.178.143_cb9a.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 68.163.178.143">contribs</a>) 2007-04-04 15:41:45 (UTC).</small></p>
