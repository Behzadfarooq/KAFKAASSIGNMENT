<h2><span class="mw-headline">animal/amimalia</span></h2>
<p><i>Very little of what's on that page [i.e., <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">Animalia</a>] is taxonomy - it's mostly an overview of the group, a discussion of what distinguishes them, and some notes about their origin. I know it's a little technical but that's mainly because I wrote it in excitement over finding out what unites sponges and metazoa; I'm not sure what the purpose of dividing pages like this would be.</i></p>
<p>"Animal" is quite obviously a natural topic for biology! You might want to say <i>something</i> on the page called "animal," in less technical terms, and otherwise point to the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">Animalia</a> page. Similarly, Wikipedia is not going to go through life never having a <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plant.html" title="Plant">plant</a> page <i>(Yes, it now has one)</i>. There is no good reason to use the Latin words <i>exclusively,</i> is there? If only to avoid redundancy, well, of course you can avoid redundancy by monitoring what is put on the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">animal</a> page and what is on the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">animalia</a> page. <i>Maybe,</i> you'll simply want the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">animal</a> page point to <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">animalia</a>. --<a href="../../../l/m/s/User%7ELMS_bc9d.html" title="User:LMS">LMS</a></p>
<p>I think the last is probably the best. Or maybe <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">animalia</a> should point to <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">animal</a>, I'm having a tought time figuring that out. See <a href="../../../l/i/n/Talk%7ELinnaean_taxonomy_cd63.html" title="Talk:Linnaean taxonomy">talk:Linnaean taxonomy</a>...also note that a flat list of animals like this is going to die hard if more people ever take an interest in them.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">suggestion from <a href="../../../l/m/s/User%7ELMS_bc9d.html" title="User:LMS">LMS</a></span></h2>
<p>I suggest that the biologists develop biology articles in whatever format they find most simpatico, and after that we can construct a page in ordinary English that points to the Latin pages. (You might want to state your intentions on <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">Animal</a> in order to make this unconfusing to the casual reader.) --<a href="../../../l/m/s/User%7ELMS_bc9d.html" title="User:LMS">LMS</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">animal in the sense of mammel?</span></h2>
<p>I don't think animal is ever meant in the sense of mammal. Certainly when people give examples of animals, they choose them from that order, but that is no different than <i>aleph</i> not coming to mind when you give an example of a letter. Certainly whenever non-mammals are at all considered the word animal is assumed to include them - for instance, <i>fish and animals</i> is a construction which is just plain wrong.</p>
<p>This same sort of trouble seems to me to come up on <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fish.html" title="Fish">Fish</a>, too - the word is often used for things like jellyfish and shellfish, but if it ever came down to the question "are these fish?" the answer would be a definite no.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Whilst I'd disagree with the exact wording of the entry, I'd also disagree with your statement. Most people would consider it, in the common sense of the word, to include fish, birds and reptiles, they'd probably not include insects quite so readily. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_McKee_8c31.html" title="User:Dave McKee">Dave McKee</a></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">animal/animalia again</span></h2>
<p>Why in the world is there separate articles for <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">animal</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">animalia</a>? Following wikipedia naming conventions there should be just one article named <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">animal</a> with the Latin term redirecting there. Any difference in useage would be an interesting thing to discuss in the article itself. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">maveric149</a></p>
<p>Naming conventions aren't set in stone, mav.&#160;;-) From the above discussion, <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">animal</a> is intended for general information, while <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">animalia</a> is reserved for more technical information. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Gilbert_b934.html" title="User:Stephen Gilbert">Stephen Gilbert</a></p>
<p>Well there isn't much here anyway and both of the articles are about the same thing, so I am going to perform a merge of content. No need to have duplication of effort. This type of needless duplication has already been discussed elsewhere. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">maveric149</a></p>
<p>I don't see any duplication of effort, and the articles aren't about the same thing. The <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">animalia</a> page is dense, full of technical information that the average person isn't looking for when they look up <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">animal</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">Animalia</a> is about scientific classification; <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">animal</a> is for general information. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Gilbert_b934.html" title="User:Stephen Gilbert">Stephen Gilbert</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>As I have stated in other places, I'm not a fan of splitting content along lines of common vs. scientific usage -- even though I am a biologist. A good encyclopedia article on animals would not be so technical as to not be accessible to non-scientists. Using the Latin name only encourages technically-inclined people to write for, what much of the public at large (esp. in the US) views as the "scientific priesthood" by using technical jargon (no wonder much of the general public feels this way -- also no wonder why the vast majority of them are scientifically illiterate). The difference in usage alone would make for an interesting paragraph (see <a href="../../../j/e/l/Jellyfish.html" title="Jellyfish">Jellyfish</a> discussion about the the Portuguese man-of-war). However, in most contexts the two terms are near perfect synonyms. If <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">animalia</a> is too technical, then it needs to be copyedited for that (maybe moving more technical discussions to sub-articles). --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">maveric149</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, I'm not convinced about the merger, but you seem to feel more strongly about than I, and you're a biologist, so I'm not going to undo it or anything. However, I do encourage you to keep working on the article and spin the more detailed stuff into sub-headings and/or sub-articles. --Stephen Gilbert</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">list content dispute</span></h2>
<p>A list of animals is nice, but this one, saying the animals are "well-known" adds nothing to the article. I had never even heard of an <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angula.html" title="Angula">angula</a>, and I wouldn't rank buffalo, elk, lynx and salamander in there as well.</p>
<p>What would be useful would be some examples of well-known animals from each of the subkingdoms or ven the phyla. We could also have a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_animals.html" title="List of animals">List of animals</a> article, if that's necessary. <a href="../../../j/h/e/User%7EJheijmans_2d7f.html" title="User:Jheijmans">Jeronimo</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">nervous system?</span></h2>
<p>I don't know enough about phylogeny and what makes animals animals to really argue hard for the addition I suggested and tweaked in response to criticism:</p>
<p>"An early adaptation and distinguishing feature of animals, with the exception of sponges and Placozoa, is the nervous system."</p>
<p>It just seems to me a small token to the common sense of "animal," which would be very satisfying to the reader who comes to this article with only that common sense of it, and which to naive me has merit even just as an assertion about phylogeny/evolution, which not to mention is accurate. The remark about muscle and nerve below as incidental to cell differentiation to me calls little attention to these things and to me doesn't make my sentence redundant (although I didn't notice it at first). <a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168....html" title="User:168...">168...</a> 17:58 Feb 16, 2003 (UTC)]</p>
<p>Ok. I simply didn't think it belonged at the top, because treating metazoan characteristics as if they were the normal for all animals, while standard, really obscures why things like sponges belong in the group. I've tried blocking off the metazoa, and making the nervous system a little more prominent there, as a compromise.</p>
<p><a name="locomotion.3F" id="locomotion.3F"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">locomotion?</span></h2>
<p>What animals are incapable of locomotion? Not sponges, at least, according to my recent Web surfing. <a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168....html" title="User:168...">168...</a> 04:05, 26 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>If locomotion has anything to do with moving from one location to another, than any of the various animals that live attached to some substratum, sponges included. If locomotion simply means rearranging some cells or wiggling some extremity, possibly none, but by those standards most plants are capable of locomotion as well.</p>
<p>O.K. That sounds like an excellent point. Maybe those scientists touting their discovery of sponge movements were just grasping for some undeserved limelight by calling it locomotion. I haven't read the studies and didn't realize (assuming it's true) that sponges spend their entire adult lives anchored to one spot. Anyway, I guess I know anenomes and corals do, and if I'd just remembered I wouldn't have neglected to qualify "locomotion" as a less than universal characteristic of animals. I'm glad you agree that its sub-universality doesn't make it unimportant to the concept of animals. <a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168....html" title="User:168...">168...</a> 05:18, 26 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>At the list of animals, some were capped, and others weren't (most weren't). So I uncapped all of them. ("Human" was capped...seemed possibly anthropomorphic...j/k, sort of...)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Animals and other kingdoms</span></h2>
<p>I've removed the following section:</p>
<p><i>Until the discovery of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protoplasm.html" title="Protoplasm">protoplasm</a>, and the series of investigations by which it was established that the cell was a fundamental structure essentially alike in both animals and plants (see <a href="../../../c/y/t/Cytology.html" title="Cytology">cytology</a>), there was a vague belief that plants, if they could really be regarded as animated creatures, exhibited at the most a lower grade of life. We know now that in so far as life and living matter can be investigated by science, animals and plants cannot be described as being alive in different degrees. Animals and plants are extremely closely related organisms, alike in their fundamental characters, and each grading into organisms which possess some of the characters of both classes or kingdoms (see <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protista.html" title="Protista">Protista</a>). The actual boundaries between animals and plants are artificial; they are rather due to the ingenious analysis of the systematist than actually resident in objective nature.</i></p>
<p><i>The most obvious distinction is that the animal cell-wall is either absent or composed of a nitrogenous material, whereas the plant cell-wall is composed of a <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbohydrate.html" title="Carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a> material—cellulose. The animal and the plant alike require food to repair waste, to build up new tissue and to provide material which, by chemical change, may liberate the energy which appears in the processes of life. The food is alike in both cases; it consists of water, certain <a href="../../../i/n/o/Inorganic.html" title="Inorganic">inorganic</a> <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salts.html" title="Salts">salts</a>, carbohydrate material and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protein.html" title="Protein">protein</a> material. Both animals and plants take their water and inorganic salts directly as such. The animal cell can absorb its carbohydrate and protein food only in the form of carbohydrate and protein; it is dependent, in fact, on the pre-existence of these organic substances, themselves the products of living matter, and in this respect the animal is essentially a parasite on existing animal and plant life. The plant, on the other hand, if it be a green plant, containing <a href="../../../c/h/l/Chlorophyll.html" title="Chlorophyll">chlorophyll</a>, is capable, in the presence of light, of building up both carbohydrate material and protein material from inorganic salts; if it be a <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fungus.html" title="Fungus">fungus</a>, devoid of chlorophyll, whilst it is dependent on pre-existing carbohydrate material and is capable of absorbing, like an animal, protein material as such, it is able to build up its protein food from material chemically simpler than protein. On these basic differences are founded most of the characters which make the higher forms of animal and plant life so different.</i></p>
<p><i>The animal body, if it be composed of many cells, follows a different architectural plan; the compact nature of its food, and the yielding nature of its cell-walls, result in a form of structure consisting essentially of tubular or spherical masses of cells arranged concentrically round the food-cavity. The relatively rigid nature of the plant cell-wall, and the attenuated inorganic food-supply of plants, make possible and necessary a form of growth in which the greatest surface is exposed to the exterior, and thus the plant body is composed of flattened laminae and elongated branching growths. The distinctions between animals and plants are in fact obviously secondary and adaptive, and point clearly towards the conception of a common origin for the two forms of life, a conception which is made still more probable by the existence of many low forms in which the primary differences between animals and plants fade out.</i></p>
<p><i>An animal may be defined as a living organism, the protoplasm of which does not secrete a cellulose cell-wall, and which requires for its existence protein material obtained from the living or dead bodies of existing plants or animals. The common use of the word animal as the equivalent of mammal, as opposed to bird or reptile or fish, is erroneous.</i></p>
<p><i>The classification of the animal kingdom is dealt with in the article <a href="../../../z/o/o/Zoology.html" title="Zoology">zoology</a>.</i></p>
<p>This material seems to me strongly predicated on the old two-kingdom system, even though it mentions Protista. Biologists <i>do</i> think there is a genuine separation between the animals and plants, based on evolutionary relationships. In that case, most of the material above is irrelevant. It doesn't matter that plants make cellulose cell walls, for instance, because that isn't part of what distinguishes animals. Lots of protozoa don't have cell walls, but are no longer considered animals. Fungi don't have <i>cellulose</i> cell walls, and have <i>never</i> been considered animals. The final definition easily includes both, so I am treating this discussion as somewhere between obsolete and mistaken. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Grosse_d1d0.html" title="User:Josh Grosse">Josh</a></p>
