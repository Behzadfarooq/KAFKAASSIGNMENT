<p>Hi Anittas, this page doesn't quite belong to the main namespace. I think you should move the contents to your user space, then list it for speedy deletion. <a href="../../../k/i/s/User%7EKissl_4f16.html" title="User:Kissl">KissL</a> 15:18, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Why?</p>

<p>Because it is about you and something you wrote, so it's not an encyclopedic topic. See <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">this Wikipedia guideline</a>, esp. the paragraph before the last.</p>
<p>If you move the page to a subpage of yours, everyone interested will still find it (the only real link to it is on your user page anyway - all the rest were intended to point to <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECriztu_08a8.html" title="User:Criztu">User:Criztu</a>), and it will be in the right place there. The original article becomes a redirect in such a case, which you can then list for speedy deletion because you are the only contributor; this can be done by adding {{db|moved to user space}} to the beginning of the page.</p>
<p>You <i>could</i> list the redirect on <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERFD_9e02.html" title="WP:RFD">WP:RFD</a> instead, but then it would require the involvement of others. If you just add the above template, an admin will soon find it and remove it without further ado. <a href="../../../k/i/s/User%7EKissl_4f16.html" title="User:Kissl">KissL</a> 07:44, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

Ugh, dude, too much technical talk here. If you really want the page gone, you put it for a delete. I have the poem saved and I'll add it to my user page. Sorry for being a shirk, but you presented too many options to me and I don't want to chose. But tell me: what did you think of the poem?&#160;:D --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Anittas</a> 17:17, July 12, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK, I moved it to a subpage of your user page, fixed the link on your user page to point to the right location, and listed the redirect (created at the old page) for deletion. To be frank about the poem, I just don't understand it, it seems to refer to events, or style, or other things I don't know about. <a href="../../../k/i/s/User%7EKissl_4f16.html" title="User:Kissl">KissL</a> 11:41, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It doesn't sound like there is a copyright issue as that would be in the public domain, however the question is whether posting a whole speech is encyclopedic.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hittite names</span></h2>
<p>Please see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Ancient_Near_East_e174.html#Orthography" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Ancient Near East">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Ancient_Near_East#Orthography</a>. We can discuss this convention of course, but so far all Hittite names are given in the stem form. This is preferable, since if the name occurs in the oblique (as in "X paid homage to Anitta", it would be awkward: You would either have to use Hittite inflection (which would be quite confusing), or you'd have to use the Nominative incorrectly, "paid homage to Anittas"). Similarly, we have <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitra.html" title="Mitra">Mitra</a>, not Mitras for the Hindu god. If you want to change this convention, you'd have</p>

<p>Okay, let's use Anitta; but then I wonder why Anittas is being used at all. And also, if you know, what's the etymology of the name? I mean, this name, or other forms of the name, is still popular. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Anittas</a> 23:54, August 15, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Anittas is the Nominative form. Check the Anitta text; the name occurs a couple of times in the Nominative, and a couple of time in its stem form. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 18:29, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>== <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Rovine_9b08.html" title="Battle of Rovine">Battle of Rovine</a> == (<i>removed some of my comments</i>)</p>
<p>1.Please use edit summaries. 2.Why did you remove the correct formatting from the date?</p>
<p><i>I corrected the formate. You don't write 17 May; you write May 17. And you seem to have agreed with this, because you kept it that way. If you want to have it wrong, then change it back as you did with the rest of my edits.</i></p>
<p>"May 17" is U.S., "17 May" U.K., and there are other conventions; that's not the point — you removed the Wikipedia coding (the square brackets), which make the date show in the format selected by the reader. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 14:02, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>3.Why did you remove the perfectly acceptable description of the Danube as a river?</p>
<p><i>For starters, if you write a river's name, you use capital letters for the word 'river'. Secondly, Danube is too famous to be called a river. For example, you don't have to say River Rhine; you can say just the Rhine. You don't usually say that Caesar crossed River Rubicon; you usually say that he crossed the Rubicon. You don't usually write their 'title', unless it's a part of their name, like: Mississippi River. If you insist in writing River Danube, at least use capital letters.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Sometimes you use should a capital (if "River" is part of the name), sometimes not. In this case, the word was descriptive, so didn't need a capital "R". --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 14:02, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>4.If you prefer "significant" to "important" then fine, though I don't really see the point of changing it.</p>
<p><i>Yes, I preferred to use the word 'significant' in this context.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>And the reason? --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 14:02, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>5.I've kept the only useful edit ("Valachian" to "Wallachian"). --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 09:58, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>You kept two edits: the format of the date and the Wallachian correction.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>As I say, you seem not to have noticed the important point about the date. In fact, if you look at the edit screen, you'll see that it's written as: [[17 May]]; you see it as "May 17" because that's how you have your preferences set. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 14:02, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Sorry, but you don't come here and talk to me using this tone. I know what you did, when you reversed the article. I know the procedure. I asked you for the reason. The guy who wrote that stuff contributed with interesting information -- an interesting information that you could have kept -- and improved. Instead, you reversed the article. Then you reversed my edits. I don't even know what kind of business you have there, in that artcle. You haven't contributed with anything, except deleting other people's material.</i></p>
<p>Please, don't lecture me again. I don't care if you're an admin or the Pope, or whatever. If you want to correct things, or have your say, do so; but be humble and kind. <i>--<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Anittas</a> 15:33, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>I left a perfectly civil message here, and you responded by lecturing me rather dogmatically about things concerning which your knowledge is limited (formats of dates, use of capitals when writing about rivers, etc.). Some of that is clearly the result of English not being your native language (though that should make you less, not more confident when lecturing others), but I'm surprised that after some time here you were unaware of how we format dates, and why. I have no idea which other article you're talking about, though. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 18:24, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Listen, you; what I said about the river name was correct - and you were wrong. If you say River Danube, you always write it with a capital letter. No exceptions. Sure, if you say, for example, that you're going to a river, called Danube, then yes; you don't write it with capital letters.</b></p>
<p>But when you say River Danube, you must always write it with capital letters. River Danube, River Rhine; the Carphatian Mountains [not Carphatian mountains]; and so on.</p>
<p>Where was I wrong about the date? You asked me this:</p>
<p>"Why did you remove the correct formatting from the date?"</p>
<p>I answered your question. I forgot to add the double brackets. Is that why you're upset? That can't be it, because your problem was the format of the date that I used. And now I see that you're on a crusade, picking on my other articles and being finicky. You could, instead, edify other people by using your so-called intellect. After all, you claim to be a professor of Oxford.</p>

<p>I don't need to read crap. It's pretty obvious that personal attacks are not allowed; those kind of rules are applied in most forums - or other kind of on-line communities. This is my personal page and I feel I have the right to repel rudeness. I have the right to make observations, just as you have the right to make observations.</p>
<p>I knew full well what those dashes do. You don't have to go to Oxford to learn how to click on links and learn where they lead to.</p>
<p>And actually, Wiki policy says that the author keeps the copyright, but also that the author agrees to release them. That's not the point. I don't want to own anything that I write here and I didn't order you to do anything. I asked you to keep away from me. I don't like you. I don't like snobs. You may want to honour my plead, or be a prick and continue your harassment.</p>

<p>Anittas, you would do well to consider Mel Etitis' objections, Oxford or no Oxford.

<p>Hello Anittas. <i>Hey, do you know where I can report abuse committed by an Admin towards me?</i> I'm assuming you're talking about <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">User:Mel Etitis</a>. However, judging by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3AAnittas" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3AAnittas" rel="nofollow">the logs</a>, Mel did not use any of his administrative powers against you, and therefore could not have abused them. However, if you would like to resolve a dispute with another editor (for example, Mel Etitis), please follow the steps outlined in <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">Wikipedia:Dispute_resolution</a>, as Dbachmann mentioned.

<dd>I appologize, I missed that note. However, it did seem like the relevant discussion was here, which is why I left the response here. I fail to see which administrator tool he abused.

Okay, no problem. He vandalized my articles - and he continues to do that.</p>
<p>1. He challenged me on citation (see <a href="../../../b/a/t/Talk%7EBattle_of_Vaslui_6548.html" title="Talk:Battle of Vaslui">talk:Battle of Vaslui</a>) when he himself has none, while I have, at least, a few good articles that I posted;</p>
<p>2. He reverted my own, personal, talk-page. I like to think that this talk-page should be under my sole authority, and not to be touched by any fool on any given day;</p>
<p>3. He harasses me by following me around (my articles) and insulting my skills of the English language.</p>
<p>Isn't that enough? Because that's all I have on him ,and, I feel that it's more than enough. He didn't kill anyone that I know of, if that's what you're asking. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Anittas</a> 23:22, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>He is most certainly here on Wikipedia to terrorize the site and its fellow users. Did you know that he's opposing songwriting regulations? In English, "With" is lower-cased, but in songwriting (due to its awkward appearance as a lower-cased letter), it is capitalized. But he... just does not seem to believe this. So I asked one of my English professors (I'm an English major at a college) to clarify this, and he said that "With" along with four other words are capitalized in songwriting. Mel continues to oppose this. I'm just unsure if I can cope with his behaviour anymore... <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinnermario_90f7.html" title="User:Winnermario">Winnermario</a> 20:05, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is what happens when kids are spoiled with money and good education, without having to do any honest work, and be 'taught' by their parents to be kind, philanthropic, and humble. It's also shameful that the people who have seen these violations occur, chose to stay quiet, or even worse - take his side. Is it a lack of <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_courage.html" title="Civil courage">civil courage</a>, or are they saving their credit points to spend in case they need them for themselves? I don't know the answer, because this Wiki community makes no sense to me, but we shouldn't waste braincells on this nihilistic snob.</p>

<p>Bună Anittas. Nu ştiu dacă ai mai fost pe la wikipedia moldovenească sau dacă încă te mai interesează subiectul. După cum se ştie, unicul sysop acolo este Node ue, un românofob convins care în tot timpul când a fost administrator acolo, s-a comportat într-un mod neprofesional şi jignitor la adresa românilor sau a moldovenilor românofoni care aparau interesele româneşti.</p>
<p>Între timp se va organiza un vot pentru că printre altele, Node ue nu a fost nici o dată ales democratic de cineva, deşi este singurul sysop la mo.wiki (pe care o conduce ca un tovarăş prim secretar de partid fără a asculta sau consulta opinile altora). Pentru că ţi-ai mai expus părerea ta despre această wikipedie, ai fost şi tu nominat să votezi.</p>
<p>A apărut un contra-candidat, Jeorjika care nu numai că ştie limba (spre deosebire de Node ue care nu vorbeşte româneşte deşi e sysop acolo), dar pare şi mai deschis şi mai profesional. Mai mult, Jeorjika şi-a expus chiar el problemele legate de această wikipedie şi a promis ca va organiza numaidecât un poll nou pe tema existenţei wikipediei moldoveneşti. Am avea sansa din nou sa ne facem auziti si sa ne expunem parerea si in mod sigur de data asta vom putea discuta cu cineva mai flexibil( decat Node ue).</p>
<p>De aceea te rog, dacă te mai interesează subiectul, să-i acorzi şi acestui Jeorjika o atenţie. Votul este pe data de Oct. 1. Pagina este aceeaşi</p>

<dd>Now, as domnul Goie has said, Jeorjika promised to organise a new vote. <b>However</b>, everybody is <i>always</i> allowed to start a vote on the Moldovan Wikipedia. This means you can start a vote <i>right now</i> on whether it should be deleted. You don't need to be the sysop for that.</dd>

Whatever your personal opinions are about Mel etitis, I don't want to get involved, but please remember that associating with known vandals will not give you a very good reputation in the wikipedia. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 19:39, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I went on to search for people who have been harassed by Mel. That guy is one of them. I found about a dozen of them, who have all been ridiculed and harassed by Mel. One of them was an Asian guy who didn't speak English too well. This is what Mel had to say to him:</p>

<p>I left that page in disgust, but I also left a message - a message of hope. I don't know what Envi did, but I doubt it's any worse than what Mel has been doing. As for my reputation in Wiki: I came here to learn and to contribute with the little I know. I didn't expect to be harassed and laughed at. I was hoping that other people would stand up for the injustice that Mel inflicted on me, but none of them did; quite the opposite - they took his side (read above).

<dd>Annitas, I don't want involvement in this conflict between you and mel and I can not speak on the behalf of those who defended Mel. Please go through the proper stages if you have something against him, but do not gather a group of vandal/abusive editors (who I can tell you are a billion times worse than Mel) to gang up on him. Also if you stop these personal attacks against Mel, this will help your case. Once again gathering people who Mel "harrassed" will not help. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 19:54, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How would I know who is 'abusive' and who isn't? I just left a message on their talk-page. I don't have the time, nor the energy, to research every single member he has abused to see if they are in 'good standing'. And speaking about abusivess, what do you call this?</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/a/t/Talk%7EBattle_of_Vaslui_6548.html" title="Talk:Battle of Vaslui">talk:Battle of Vaslui</a></p>
<p>And he already recruited one member to work against me. That member reverted my user-page two times, while Mel reverted my talk-page one time. I don't want to gather people to gang up on him, but like you said: I should go through the proper channels. Well, if we're more, our voice will be louder, and our credibility stronger.</p>
<p>I will also write an article about Mel and his abusive behaviour on Wiki, and put it on my user-page. Yes, Mel, you may correct my horrible English that you, unfortunatelly, must witness. Life is a bitch, isn't she?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mel Etitis</span></h2>
<p>I have seen your message.</p>
<p>Well, I have left wikipedia for a considerable period of time, although I do come back intermittently. As I have said, my leave has more to do with my personal life than this highly-active admin Mel Etitis.</p>
<p>In a way Mel did harass me, but I believe that there must be reasons. Firstly, I must be in the wrong. Note <a href="../../../z/a/n/Zanskar.html" title="Zanskar">Zanskar</a>? I regretted that I handled <a href="../../../m/o/u/User%7EMoumine_6854.html" title="User:Moumine">User:Moumine</a> too high-handedly, saying that his grammar is atrocious when I actually was the one. I realised my fault some time later, for you must understand that my command of English goes up and down from time to time, especially during the holidays when I have less school books to practice on.</p>
<p>Secondly, I must apologise that I am a person diagnosed with a very mild form of <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schizophrenia.html" title="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a>, or some kind of mental fit, which makes me a person being not able to elaborate my feelings very well. I am also a very lazy person, and I do not like to hunt down on "wikipedia court cases", for I prefer to edit than to confront with Mel Etitis. However, perhaps either by my own stupidity or by his sheer ulterior motives, or perhaps even his overworking on wikipedia that might have made him becoming increasingly <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychotic.html" title="Psychotic">Antisocial personality disorder</a> in some way or another. Yet, on the other hand, he did get along with many Users very well, most notably <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabartus_bae5.html" title="User:Fabartus">User:Fabartus</a>, <a href="../../../j/m/b/User%7EJMBell_ef2e.html" title="User:JMBell">User:JMBell</a> and a few others. Together with the group, I have heard that they have discussed my behaviour with Jimbo Wales some time ago, in which I will have to type out a long list of explanation to Wales.</p>
<p>Thirdly, if I'm not badly mistaken, Mel have made accusations against other users left and right. I do not understand why, in what way, I am <a href="../../../e/t/t/User%7EETTan_11ce.html" title="User:ETTan">user:ETTan</a>, in which he had posted a message some time ago on my talk page stating that I am ETTan, and saying something else that harbour very stark and nasty. You can acess my talk page history shortly after 30 July 2005, the date he probably posted the message, if I had remembered correctly.</p>
<p>Fourthly, I would like to elaborate something which I was unable to elaborate well by saying something like "stalking on me wherever I go". I would like to take this opportunity to say that, Mel Etitis has been editing validated sets of articles that I have edited. What I mean was, Mel Etitis would edit the same number of articles that I have edited shortly the time before I made the edits. Mel had said that he was editing on articles that I have edited because my "recent" edits contained heaps of gramatical errors. Initially I had repelled him, but I realised my mistake and apologised. This peculair behaviour of his, at the beginning, he did so at the sensitive period when we had a bad confrontation over Zanskar, in which I wrongly claimed that it contained gramatical errors. But why couldn't he do it at a later period of time, rather at that edgy moment? This led to my misunderstanding that he is trying to harass me. And our troubles built on.</p>
<p>Fifthly, I believe that you must have a similar encounter of seeing Mel making comments in his summary when he make reverts, such as "Reverted edits by Anittas to last edition by Mr Tan". While somebody had criticised him of doing this that will make interest disputes worse, he defended it by saying that he finds untangling the edit done by the previous user as bad in someway or another.</p>
<p>I would like to voice out my objections here. The reverts he made are reverts on fairly minor edits. In fact, one of the edits made by me was reverted by Mel as I made an edit adding a fact to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maria_Vladimirovna_of_Russia_6061.html" title="Maria Vladimirovna of Russia">Maria Vladimirovna of Russia</a>, he reverted it. When I demanded a proper explanation from him on why he reverted at the expense of some gramatical mistake that I made whlist adding the fact, he claimed that it was too troublesome. I was very angry.</p>
<p>The fact that my edit, which contained a considerably short sentence-long edit to the article, which was then reverted by Mel Etitis by claiming that it was too troublesome to spot out. I was baffled by such an attitude. From this attitude, my negative feelings towards him grew even deeper.</p>
<p>Sizthly, I would like to elaborate further the second time I edited <a href="../../../z/a/n/Zanskar.html" title="Zanskar">Zanskar</a>. As I had said, I had used Zanskar/temp to make a thorough edit on <a href="../../../m/o/u/User%7EMoumine_6854.html" title="User:Moumine">User:Moumine</a>'s gramatical "mistakes", but the second time was that when I wanted to make a design remake by putting up the cleanup tag, in accordance to wikipedia's guidelines on articles. You see, ain't the design and outlook of the article very awkward as compared to other articles? The pictures all aligned in one row, rather than "scattered" around or grouped according to picture content and its respective categories. Also, the big, gigantic paragraphs in the article looks monotonous to many, I even suggested breaking up one big paragraph into two or three smaller, yet reasonably sized paragraphs.</p>
<p>Overall, that was my motive for editing Zanskar--to edit Zanskar by refurbinishing its design, but I just couldn't elaborate it as my brain is quite slow. I had wanted to make some outlook redesigning edits for Zanskar, but in fear of his reverts, I edited in a plan draft. Concerning this issue, you may want to refer to User:Mr Tan/plan draft and <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_writing_better_articles_3c0a.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles">Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles</a> for your own personal information.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, I must say that Mel is a little impatient. As you can see, although he may be a professor of the English language, as he has claimed, that doesn't warrant him to make dash-around-edits without giving other Users some preliminary edits to try to improve their edits, even though in the process they may make some mistakes. Again, Mel is a person who is very inconsiderate of one's brain's reactions to a crisis. I do acknowledge that I'm a bit like Mel in this way, but I never intervene into other's prelimnary edits too much, as one's ideas may differ from another. Mel's behaviour has caused heavy friction between me (Mr Tan), <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegaWikipedia_90c1.html" title="User:OmegaWikipedia">User:OmegaWikipedia</a>, you and <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinnermario_90f7.html" title="User:Winnermario">User:Winnermario</a>, all in the same group. I don't really know why you are in conflict with Mel, but I do not wish to find out about it.</p>
<p>Mel's behaviour also starkly constrasts to my true intention of wikipedia. To me, wikipedia is meant for me as a favourite pastime, not for such long-term conflicts. Mel himself has exhibited a great deal of contradictions against my own ideas. This has caused emotional stress, deprovement of my school work and peer pressure. Had Mel been more forgiving, less enthusiastic and more willing to help others, such a terrible long-term incident would not have happened. All I have to say that my reputation is gone, partially due to my stupidity and probably his ulterior motives that he might have harboured. Anyway, I wish you good luck in your dealings with Mel Etitis, and do post this to <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Mr Wales</a>. I have more to say, but real life is catching with me up and I have little to spare over such trival internet matters with Mel Etitis, a person that I hardly know of and of little interest to me even we might meet in person one day. Forgive and forget if you can, and hopefully Mel will lose interest on you and find something else to do, or learn from him if you can, if he is willing to teach English, something that will be beneficiary to my Synthesis and Transformation on sentences in my English exams. Perhaps you can try to engage more of your time in real life rather than wasting your time away on wikipedia with such people who are very to work with. Good luck!</p>

I'm starting to believe that Mel is a Darwinist who believes to have the right showing his supremecy onto others by insulting and harassing them. That's sort of ironic, since the job of a professor, and as he also claims to be - a philosopher, would be to edify others; but then again, as Socrates pointed out, even a dog is a philosopher.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if your English sucks; he shouldn't harass you for that. We're all good and we're all here to learn. Mel doesn't just edit bad grammar; he also edits information from which he demands citation for. Believe it or not, but I was impressed by the guy. He actually managed to upset Bryan Adams. Yes, the singer and song writer, Bryan Adams. He got into an argument with Bryan's assistant (she confirmed to me by email that she really is Bryan's assistant) and he keeps asking for a source for pseudo information. How can you ask for a source on made-up information? You can, if the rumours are popular and covered by the press, but from what I know, the one to make the claim, should prove it - not the other way around. This guy, no matter what diploma he holds, is a nut - period. He spends so much time on Wiki, that you start wondering on the kind of social life he lives. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Anittas</a> 19:02, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Anittas, I haven't followed the details of your conflict with Mel Etitis, but I must warn you that many of the comments you are making are not appropriate for Wikipedia. Comments such as "<b>Listen, you Oxford wanna-be snobb</b>" and such are considered <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>, and there is no place for them here. Please discuss your differences with other editors with civility and respect. We may not all agree, but we can disagree in a courteous manner. Also, there are many Wikipedia editors for whom English is not their native language; while we don't expect everyone's writing to be perfect, editors should not take offense if their writing is corrected. Particularly, your claims above that <i>river</i> should always be capitalized when describing a proper noun is not consistent with conventional English usage. Words may be part of a title, such as the <i>Hubble Space Telescope</i>, in which case they are capitalized, or they may be describing the proper noun but not part of it, such as the "space probe <i>Voyager</i>". Feel free to ask me if you have any questions, but please tone down your language. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 19:32, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>River Danube was part of the name; it's like saying Danube Delta - the word delta also being a part of the name. That's what I meant to say: when the word is a part of the name, you capitalize it.</p>
<p>I don't mind people correcting me, as long as their intentions are honourable. That person is not honourable. When I called him a wanna-be snob, I didn't know what he was about. Now when I do know, I regret giving him that compliment. He is nothing but a troublemaker, and he even managed to upset Bryan Adams (the singer). You people value him because he nitpicks on articles, adding a comma here and there; but I would say that the price for his contribution is too high. Perhaps he wants to be viewed as a critic with a very observant eye, but if I were a paper editor, I wouldn't hire him. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Anittas</a> 19:43, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are correct that when a word is part of the name, it is capiatlized. However, the Danube is usually referred to by just the single-word name, "Danube", although it can occasionally be the "Danube River". I would say, though, that the name of that river is just "Danube". Now, when one is referring to a proper noun, one may wish to add a descriptor if it may not be obvious what that object is. For instance, I might write "...After the vote was completed, board member Michael Smith suggested that further discussion be..."—in this case, Michael Smith is a board member; however, it is not part of his name. He is not "Board Member Michael Smith"; rather, the writer wishes to convey that he is a board member. Or another example would be "See that bright red point of light near the moon? That's the planet Mars." Again, the planet is not called "Planet Mars"; rather, the name is Mars and the descriptor <i>planet</i> is simply there for clarification. These types of descriptors are used when one feels that the reader/listener may not be familiar with that which is being referenced; as descriptive adjectives, they are not part of the title and should remain in lower case. I must again point out that your comments about Mel Etities are not appropriate. <i>Please</i> read <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a> before you further discuss this matter. As its second sentence reads, "Comment on content, not on the contributor." Please refrain from saying things like "This guy, no matter what diploma he holds, is a nut - period...That person is not honourable...He is nothing but a troublemaker". If you continue in this manner, you will likely find yourself blocked; you have plenty of warning. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 20:04, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't like to be given ultimatums. If you're going to block or ban me, do it, and get on with it. And about the Danube: you're basically making my argument more valid, because that's exactly what I had said, too.</p>
<p>I will prove this to you. See the history of the article:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Rovine&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Rovine&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Rovine&amp;action=history</a></p>
<p>Click on my edit from <i>23:45, September 14, 2005 Anittas</i>.</p>
<p>It say: <b>"Then the Romanian cavalry charged and routed the Ottomans, who fled in disorder across the Danube."</b></p>
<p>Before I made the edit, this is what it said: <b>"Then the Romanian cavalry charged and routed the Ottomans, who fled in disorder across the river Danube."</b></p>
<p>I, too, argued that it wasn't necessary to say River Danube, because Danube is known; but I also said that if you choose to do it, then capitalize it, because it becomes a part of the name. River Danube, the Carphatian Mountains, etc.</p>
<p>I said all of this (<b>NOTE: ALL OF THIS</b>) in my discussion with that person whom you seem to like. Just scroll up and read. Or allow me to help you.</p>
<p>"For starters, if you write a river's name, you use capital letters for the word 'river'. Secondly, Danube is too famous to be called a river. For example, you don't have to say River Rhine; you can say just the Rhine. You don't usually say that Caesar crossed River Rubicon; you usually say that he crossed the Rubicon. You don't usually write their 'title', unless it's a part of their name, like: Mississippi River. If you insist in writing River Danube, at least use capital letters."</p>
<p>That's what I replied to him. Thats is what you replied to me. We seem to agree. But Mel doesn't agree. He reverted the article (again, see the history) and now it's back with "river Danube".</p>
<p>And this is not this sole mistake. He also went on to terrorize my other article, for which I worked hard for: <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Vaslui_4a27.html" title="Battle of Vaslui">Battle of Vaslui</a>. I don't claim to own that article, or else I wouldn't have posted it here, but I do care about its context, because I worked for it. Not Mel. He doesn't even care about the subject. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Anittas</a> 20:28, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><a name="On_your_previous_reply" id="On_your_previous_reply"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">On your previous reply</span></h2>
<p>Thanks for your quick response to the previous message.</p>
<p>I agree that chances of Mel being more or less psychotic is very high, in view of the number of hours he spent on wikipedia everyday, and adding on to the fact that he is a professor-philosopher. He must have largely neglected his work and is probably now a loafer, poking his nose here and there, though.</p>
<p>Never mind about that. I feel that you should accept some of his edits, but in comparison to the articles that he has copyedited, say, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Songsten_Gampo_2b38.html" title="Songsten Gampo">Songsten Gampo</a>, <a href="../../../z/a/n/Zanskar.html" title="Zanskar">Zanskar</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Kuan_Yew_c963.html" title="Lee Kuan Yew">Lee Kuan Yew</a>, name a few, he has done gramatical ammendments which I am very happy to accept, but I cannot understand on one hand, he has no comments on the poorly-orientated article with gigantic paragraphs, yet it is correct gramatically---the article <a href="../../../z/a/n/Zanskar.html" title="Zanskar">Zanskar</a>. I wanted to change its design in order to standardize its style so that it can blend well with the design of the other article, but hard-brained as he was, I find it a great agony to persuade and explain to him on my reasons.</p>
<p>I believe that you do might a similar encounter from Mel like me, in which he often replied to me that either he doesn't "understand" what I am talking about by saying that my English is atrocious, occasionally giving a reply message, in which content tells me on how I should have typed that message correctly, or on my rude behaviour. I am glad to accept his teachings, but the rely message, as I have said earlier, often does not contain the replies that a person usually expects upon asking a question. Sometimes, I tried asking him again, politely, but he does not even reply. I say, am I talking to a wall or what? Even if one doesn't seem to understand the opposition's language, he should try to make an effort to understand what he is talking about. Mel seemed to have read the message once and threw everything back at me, without making any efforts to analyse my message content.</p>
<p>However, I would also like to reiterate that I was rude to Mel Etitis because he had dragged on the problem too long, deeper and deeper, and this causes one to lose his own patience and throw offensive remarks. I have heard that you have been throwing some (mild) offensive remarks on Mel Etitis, just like what I did in a fit of rage. I understand that you are under his peer pressure, but I would advise you that perhaps you could apologise, and try turning around the issue to evaluate his cons. The apology may or may not work, but it may help to regain your reputation in contrast to the other users. I myself had apologised countless times to Mel for my personal attacks, but it seems that he is immune to my apologies most of the time.</p>
<p>Now, I would like to talk briefly about your work on the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Vaslui_4a27.html" title="Battle of Vaslui">Battle of Vaslui</a>. I have seen your explanations on your edits, claming that Mel Etitis has often been making reverts for no specific reasons. I have encountered mass reverts, like you, from him. Worse, during a specific period of time, he made mass reverts to a validated set of articles that I have edited on. This really enrages me.</p>
<p>Coming back to the point, I would suggest a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comment</a> on Mel Etitis if you like. But I'm sure you won't like it, even typing such a thing against Mel Etitis will take up a lot of time. Perhaps you may want to keep yourself in stangant water, and let the "Mel Etitis" hurricane go away first. I will try to chip in some help wherever I can, but I will avoid endangering myself so much that my good time is wasted. I love your content of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Vaslui_4a27.html" title="Battle of Vaslui">Battle of Vaslui</a>, though. You may want to state your sources from where you obtain the content, or make an explanation that your content is being backed by an external source. Also, do take at <a href="../../../t/s/u/Tsushima_Island_4974.html" title="Tsushima Island">Tsushima Island</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/i/Baitou_Mountain_ffb0.html" title="Baitou Mountain">Baitou Mountain</a> on the Korean name issue, a discussion which I have dropped off halfway due to my personal problems. I want to revive the discussion, but I do not have the courage to do that in view of the tremendous pressure that Mel Etitis and his company can bring upon me if I ever do that.</p>
<p>Well, I"ll have to go now. Typing a message of this length can consume forty-five minutes easily, and you can imagine how brain-racking and how long it can take to write a complaint on Mel Etitis, if you want to. I will find time to meet and discuss with you again if I can. Goodbye! <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Tan_d5d8.html" title="User:Mr Tan">Mr Tan</a> 18:12, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bună Anittas,</p>
<p>Văd ce eşti unul din utilizatorii care au fost chemaţi să voteze. În primul rând vreau să-ţi atrag atenţia că node ue nu ţi-a vorbit in română ( în afara celor 2 fraze pe care le-a copiat de la Domnu Goie). Asta ptr. ca Node ue nu ştie româna. Cred ca este destul de important ca să cunoşti limba wikipediei a cărei sysop vrei să fi.</p>
<p>La întrebarea ce sunt eu - român sau moldovean îţi răspund sincer. M-am născut în Moldova, in suflet mă simt român. Node ia ce am zis eu în afara contextului. Deşi spune că eu nu sunt român, el în schimb susţine o teorie Stalinistă, şi anume cea a "Moldovenismului" sau cum îi zicea Snegur "Moldovenismului Primitiv". Cred că este clar care dintre candidaţi nu este român.</p>

<p>De asemenea nu uita să te registrezi pentru vot sub „REGISTRATION FOR THE ELECTION”. Este f. important ca să te registrezi până cel mult miercuri pentru că deja pe 1 oct. votăm.</p>
<p>Între noi vine vorba, cred că ştim amândoi unde vrea să meargă Node cu mo.wiki. Sincer să fiu, nu cred ca este interesat în progresul acestei wikipedii cât este interesat în a întării noţiunea “Moldovenismului Primitiv”, care cred eu: ne-a umilit destul. Măcar aici pe wikipedia să spunem oamenilor adevărul despre noi şi limba pe care o vorbim. Dacă vei fi de accord, aş iniţia un poll in primele doua săptămâni de la alegere ca să vedem care este opinia tuturora cu privire la existenţa acestei wikipedii.</p>
<p>Registrează-te sub „REGISTRATION FOR THE ELECTION” până miercuri. Dacă mergi pe pagina de mai sus, şi "scroll" până jos o să vezi că Mihaitza a făcut un subiect nou, „REGISTRATION FOR THE ELECTION”.</p>
<p>Şi nu uita: votează pe 1 octombrie.</p>
<p>Toate cele bune,</p>
<p>PS: Ateţie, se pare că fiecare avem 2 voturi deci poti să le foloseşti cum vrei tu. Poţi acorda un vot la 2 candidaţi sau 2 voturi la unul singur. Îţi zic nu ca să te influenţez ci doar pentru că nimeni nu ţi-a spus.</p>

It does seem that your experience at Wikipedia is causing you a lot of frustration, and I'd like to help you if I can, especially as I became involved in it, through reverting some of your edits – something I stand over, by the way.</p>
<p>Could part of the problem be that you're imagining that Mel is insulting you when he does a copy edit on an article you've been working on? (See, for example, comments I wrote <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Vandalism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=24605024" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Vandalism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=24605024" rel="nofollow">here</a>.) I don't know anything about Mel, apart from what's on his user page. It's quite possible that your English is much better than his second language. Your English is very impressive. It's very native-like. But it's not always <i>competely</i> right, and Mel, as a native speaker, is doing a service to Wikipedia in tidying up the language of something which you did a service to Wikipedia by contributing.</p>
<p>Also, you seem to think that several Wikipedians are joining Mel in harrassing you because they're friends of his. Mel is an administrator. That means a lot of people voted for him. That means he's well respected. That probably means he has generally behaved in a way that is worthy of respect. I respect him, too. When I joined Wikipedia, he sent me a welcome message, encouraging me to ask questions on his talk page if I needed any help. I did turn to him for help with some minor queries a few times, and he answered promptly and courteously. But we're not friends in the sense of sending each other frequent messages, editing the same articles and agreeing with each other all the time. I'm sure if someone asked Mel tonight to name the fifty Wikipedians that he knows and trusts most, my name wouldn't be among them. We don't really know each other. Yet, when I supported Mel's edit, you seemed to think that I was trying to harrass you, and that I was doing it because I was a friend of his! You've also written on your talk page that Mel had recruited another member (presumably me) to work against you, and that that member had already reverted your user page twice. Anittas, Mel did not recruit me. I have had no contact with him about you. I reverted your userpage because your edits were in violation of the <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">Personal Attacks</a> policy. If you are so mistaken about that, might you not also be mistaken in your other beliefs about Mel watching you and recruiting others to harrass you?</p>
<p>Anyway, I don't know if I'm making things better or worse by sending this message. You may feel it's none of my business. You and I don't seem to be interested in the same articles, so we're unlikely to run into each other too often. However, I can see that this has been upsetting for you. My own experience at Wikipedia has generally been very enjoyable. Although I've taken part in some articles where there was a lot of nastiness, it was not normally directed at me.</p>
<p>I'd be happy to help you if I can. But I don't think you'll get very far in your efforts to fight him. I certainly won't support you. And it will look bad that you engaged in personal attacks against him on your user pages - attacks which he, by the way, has ignored! Also, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Vaslui&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=23380997" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Vaslui&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=23380997" rel="nofollow">this edit summary</a> won't help your case. If Mel inadvertantly introduced an error about the spelling of Suleyman while he was doing a copy edit, wouldn't it have been better simply to have told him that, rather than reverting the whole thing back to your version?</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be better just to drop the whole thing, remove references to Mel from your user page, and just move on? I think if you did that, you'd find your experience here would become more enjoyable. Do think about it. I'm going to bed now. Regards, Ann Heneghan <sup>(talk)</sup> 01:35, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You bring a lot of points in your post. For that reason, I will reply to them in chronological order. I usually don't like doing that, since it makes the post look dry, but it will be easier if I do.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I explained this a few times before: this has nothing to do with Mel, or anyone else for that matter, wishing to help. I've started several articles where people have helped - either by adding new info or by correcting grammar and spelling. There was no conflict. I mean, that's the whole point with this Wiki - to have everyone contribute with what they can.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I agree that Mel is doing Wiki a great service. I've checked his contribution. He fixes a lot of things. I also agree that Mel is being respected by many people here. Good for him. Altough I'm not here for a popularity contest, if being respected by so many people could help him in a dispute, then logically, receiving criticism from other people should also count for something. On paper, none of this should matter, since everyone should stay objective.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Okay, I take back what I said about him recruiting you. It just seemed a bit odd that of all articles out there, you found mine where Mel and I were fighting. Perhaps you monitor his contributions and had a look at the article.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For starters, he is no position to ignore my attacks on him. They are there because of his 'attentive' nature. Had he ignored me altogether, there wouldn't have been any attacks. Secondly, he doesn't ignore them. He does react to them, sometimes. Thirdly, even if he would have ignored them, he would still have read them - and even if he hadn't read them, others whom were meant to read them, would have read them. That sounds weird, but my point is that I made those attacks to get my point across to certain people and not necessarily to have him see them. I do, however, want him to read them; plus, it makes me feel good to attack him. :D</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I don't usually revert pages simply because I disagree with minor things, such as the various spellings of a general. But this is Mel. He did this to me for no good reason. I did the same. Examine the history of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Rovine_9b08.html" title="Battle of Rovine">Battle of Rovine</a>. He was wrong on the Danube conflict. Ironically, Knowledge Seeker came here to defend him and made his case on that argument, without realizing that he was in fact, supporting my argument. When I pointed this to him, he didn't reply back. The conflict started with Battle of Rovine, with Mel going on an inquisition on my talk-page, and continued to Battle of Vaslui.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I'll be happy to go back to status quo and forget about this whole deal. I'll remove some of the nastier things I've said.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Generally speaking, "Get a life" is an insult rather than genuine, heartfelt advice and will almost universally be taken as such. If you really meant that kindly, I would recommend that you say so to him, because I doubt he took it that way. As for introducing myself, I'm sorry if that caused offense, but it's not normal to introduce youself here before talking to people (kinda what user pages are for). I apologize for not doing so, but understand that what you're asking for is not common. My name here is Blackcap, I've been an editor here for a few months, and I'm an American identifying strongly with my Irish heritage.

<p>Dear Anittas, after reading thoroughly the commendable message that Ann sent you two days ago, and your reasonable response, I can't quite understand why you maintain a hostile position against Mel Etitis. I, for once, cannot help but to conclude that you simply lied to Ann when you asserted that you'd be happy to forget about the whole thing. Your reverts of his edits continue, and I see that you have also created a page on "Comments on Mel", which despite being empty yet, I'm sure it's not meant to be filled with exaltation poems on his figure.</p>
<p>I have no doubt whatsoever that you're a brilliant person; one only has to read your contributions and your excellent mastery of the English language to conclude that. As a non native English speaker myself, I'd like to point from my own experience that the copyedit and proofreading of a native speaker, far from being an intrusion, is an invaluable help. Please, don't feel he was insulting you; rather, think of it as a collaboration for the best of your own contribution. This is English Wikipedia after all, and we are welcome here; why not provide readers with the best quality material we can all produce? I've written several articles myself, and asked other users to review them from me. Why would this diminish the quality of my work, or yours, by the case? I've only ran across Mel ocassionally, but take it from the heart, from someone whose sole interest in the matter is the best coexistence in this place: Mel is trusted for a reason, and that is, he is a person with whom dialog can be established easily and friendly. I've witnessed it. Trust me, Anittas: nothing positive can be gained through a fight. You are yourself an obvious asset to the community through your knowledge. Let us continue to enjoy your work. Move on, it is for the best not only for you, but for us all. Help us build, don't destroy; I know you can and you want. It saddens me when a see a brilliant person fall into the swamp of personal attacks. Please, you have the talent to be better than that. Next time you feel angry, take a deep breath, come to my Talk Page and throw the worse insults you feel like shouting to me. I swear it will have no consequences. Or simply drop by and talk to me, about whatever you wish. And after you've cleared your mind and feel better, continue to write the excellent articles you're qualified to. Nothing will make me feel better, believe me.

<dd>Hey, Shauri; thanks for your compliments - even though they are meant to make me soft :p</dd>
</dl>
<p>What I said still stands: I'm ready to go back to status quo with Mel, if he's prepared to do the same. From what I've read, he's not prepared to do so; in fact, he wants to build a case against us. That's why I created that page - so that I, and others, can build on our defence against him. I doubt that Mel wants peace. I even doubt he is sophisticated enough to be able to love or feel compassion. I saw that other SysOps have issues with Mel, which means that it can't be all me that is wrong in this. Both you and Ann want me to take the initiative and make peace, even though it was Mel who started this all. Well, okay, fine. Mel, do you want us, and all parties involved, to discuss peace talks? If you do, give us a sign, please. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Anittas</a> 23:17, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Anittas, thank you for your information. I have visited the page, and found that the debate is on one particular dispute relating to music. The points raised are quite technical, and I am unable to participate meaningfully as I am not a music enthusiast. However, I personally feel that Mel does not have the temperament to be an administrator for a community portal. An administrator in a community portal must be empathetic and nurturing, with good EQ, not just an English and MoS expert. Mel should start his own encyclopedia, LOL.</p>
<p>Your post was very helpful. I had another Al Capone on my back. At first, I thought that "Phronima", also from Oxford, was Mel, using another pseudonym. Their temperaments are so similar, but later, I found that the writing style in the articles that they had contributed, were different. After your post, he has stopped. I guessed you must have frightened off with your post. Thanks for your help in this one, LOL. — <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPM_Poon_6c1e.html" title="User:PM Poon">PM Poon</a> 16:16, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Disruption</span></h2>
<p>Anittas, if you continue to make personal attacks on other editors, you're likely to be blocked for disruption. Based on the contributions of yours that I've seen, you do very little editing to the encyclopedia, but instead spend your time on talk pages being insulting. This is unacceptable and not what we're here for, so I'm asking you to forget about the people you've been attacking and to move on. Also, please review <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">Wikipedia:Civility</a>, and <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hey What's Up</span></h2>
<p>Thanks for helping me out while I was "exiled". I appreciate it, and it is especially surprising since you're a fellow Romanian and I figured most Romanians would say, "Screw him. He's giving us Romanians a bad name with his obscene rantings."---Which is precisely why I write that kind of stuff, to do my part in getting (older) Romanians used to that kind of stuff: <i>it's 2005 for God's sake. That's how shit is now.</i> You don't hear Americans saying "<a href="../../../e/m/i/Eminem.html" title="Eminem">Eminem</a> is giving us Americans a bad name with his foul lyrics."</p>
<p>Anyway, I will take time out to help find references for your article, even to the extent of hitting the local libraries. Peace. -Alex 03:19, 12 October 2005 (UTC) (I'm 'bout to create a new account and redirect my old User Page and Talk Page to it, so I'll have a new talk page soon)</p>
<p>Hey, no problem. As for Romanians complaining about obscenities; they shouldn't, since they listen to manele crap. It wasn't a Romanian who banned you, though. Watch out for the Anglo-Saxon conservatives. You don't play around with these guys. They will bury you.</p>
<p>I think it will be very difficult to find those sources. I found a couple of names that I could follow on, but I barely find anything on them - or the things we need to find. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Anittas</a> 03:56, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yup. The American conservatives have carrots up their ass to. Hey, I'm through with all that kind of stupid shit anyway. New account, new methods. And now I have a License to Kill. You're right about the references: local libraries most likely won't have them, and the internet is a mess.</dd>

<p>Pe frontul de est nimic nou. Se pare ca Node ue desi a pierdut votul, s-a propus ca administrator si in acelasi timp a mai propus inca 2 rusi ca sa devina administratori numai ca Jeorjika sa ramana singurul pro-Roman acolo.</p>
<p>Numai ca: ei s-au votat unii pe altii. Vino aici si voteaza contra lor:</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Rfc on Mel Etitis</span></h2>
<p>Very good. I"ll go right over and have a look, and I"ll post my comments, together with his past atrocities, (sort of), on the Rfc.</p>
<p>I do not quite understand your previous reply to my message because it is in a form of poem, and my English literature is not very good--I usually got fifty to sixty marks out of a hundred for it. Anyway, if I'm not mistaken, you must be telling me not to crack up myy brains sort of things.</p>
<p>I must apologise for my delayed response and my disabilituy to help you because my personal problems are growing increasing difficult to deal with. Of late, I'm a bit ill. I would try to come back to wikipedia to supress Mel Etitis' controversies and his quaint fanaticism as much as I could.</p>
<p>Right, I'm going to have a look at the RfC now. I"ll keep in touch with you.</p>

<p><br />
Wait a minute, the RfC on Mel seems to be over now. Should I expose him or keep my mouth shut first and wait until he restarts his disruptions? Sooner or later, I'm going to clear my reputation, based on the past messages that contained my explanations I have gave you and the RfC. The real truth must be revealed and not let the distorted truth overshadow my true intentions.</p>
<p>Until then, cool down, and don't get so hyperexcited. I deal with his past step-by-step. Good luck!</p>
