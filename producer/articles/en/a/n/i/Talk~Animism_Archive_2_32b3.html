<h2><span class="mw-headline">Animism in USA</span></h2>
<p>The presence of the Hmong community in Minneapolis/St Paul affords an occasion to meet persons raised in animism. Many have been attracted to or converted by Christian Churches. The same area is home to some recent Korean immigrants who have no recognizable religious affiliation, often a puzzle to those wondering which church they should be referred to in their new neighborhoods.</p>

<p>Hi, I'd like to try to find a way to keep the essence of the article, but remove the overall sense of civilized superiority that exists in many parts, no doubt as a result of the inclusion of stuff from 'brittanica'. A good example is "Education has brought with it a sense of the great gulf between man and animals; but in the lower stages of culture this distinction is not adequately recognized, if indeed it is recognized at all. The savage attributes to animals the same ideas, the same mental processes as himself, and at the same time vastly greater power and cunning", which reminds me of 1950's documentaries about the quaint nig-nogs in africa and elsewhere.</p>
<p>It seems a bit rude to just start hacking away without talking about it first, hence this posting. I read about NPOV and it sounds a good idea to me.</p>

<p>Well, clearly somebody thought polytheism came from animism. Thats an important idea, regardless of its acuracy. Besides, this portion ads far more value than its claim, it links to helpful articles like <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Barleycorn_f528.html" title="John Barleycorn">John Barleycorn</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maize_mother.html" title="Maize mother">maize mother</a>. <a href="../../../e/x/a/User%7EExample_2365.html" title="User:Example"><i>Example</i></a> (<a href="../../../e/x/a/User_talk%7EExample_2c24.html" title="User talk:Example">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Example_b69c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Example">contribs</a>) 20:38, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The author contradicts himself, though. Pointing to polytheistic <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deities.html" title="Deities">deities</a> without any sort of contrast, he undermines the definition given earlier: animism concerns <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul.html" title="Soul">souls</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirituality.html" title="Spirituality">spirituality</a>, not <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a>. The inclusion of this paragraph blurs that distinction, suggesting the author might not know what he is talking about and probably doesn't care that he disparages animism in placing the focus on polytheism. <a href="../../../e/e/q/User%7EEequor_b13d.html" title="User:Eequor">‣<font size="+1">ᓛᖁ</font></a><span class="venus"><a href="../../../v/e/n/Image%7EVenus_symbol_%28blue%29.gif_4db5.html" class="image" title="♀"><img src="../../../upload/shared/1/1b/Venus_symbol_%28blue%29.gif" alt="♀" width="9" height="12" longdesc="../../../v/e/n/Image%7EVenus_symbol_%28blue%29.gif_4db5.html" /></a></span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../e/e/q/User_talk%7EEequor_c7a5.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../e/e/q/User_talk%7EEequor_c7a5.html" rel="nofollow"><font size="+1">ᑐ</font></a> 21:10, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some of the many things I like about 1911 brittanica is that it is rambling, confusing and opinionated. Its our job to utilize our futuristic group editing process to refine these diamonds in the rough&#160;;) The connection between animism and development of polytheism is common in anthropology BTW, altho I can't cite anything or explain it easilly. <a href="../../../e/x/a/User%7EExample_2365.html" title="User:Example"><i>Example</i></a> (<a href="../../../e/x/a/User_talk%7EExample_2c24.html" title="User talk:Example">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Example_b69c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Example">contribs</a>) 21:16, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Deletionism is anti-wiki! Please stop hacking out chunks of the article for me to restore. There is clearly not concensus for such massive removals, and besides, information is good, thats why we edit an encyclopedia instead of burning banned books at KKK rallies... I'm not sure why you dislike the 1911 encyclopedia so much, but I am essentially an animist (I believe everything, from our universe to individual cells and quarks is conscious, alive and possessed of a soul) and I think its dandy.

<p>I think we can sum up the 1911 britannica authors POV quite neatly:</p>
<ol>
<li>Savages (indigenous people specifically, early man, and perhaps animists generally) are stupid and backwards.</li>
<li>Animism was the first step towards religion, religion being something which evolved from one form to another in steps.</li>
</ol>
<p>These POV's are just fine, so long as we make it clear that <i>some</i> hold these POV's, and perhaps others do not. I think most of us probably don't agree w the 1st POV, and that most experts <i>do</i> agree w the second. Contridictory opinions are fine as well, so long as they also are clarified as such. Once we get past this POV issue, I think we can begin to focus on things more amiably, like moving portions of the orgins section into new subsections.

<p>I decided to look into other encyclopedias, and I discovered something facinating. Tyler was the primary proponent of this term, and in some ways the last person to give it a great deal of use.

<dd>Tylor published the third edition of <i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Primitive_Culture_07ef.html" title="Primitive Culture">Primitive Culture</a></i> in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1891.html" title="1891">1891</a>, confident of having proved the evolution theory as to the origin of our civilization from a savage condition, the savage belief in souls and spirits as the germs of religion, and the continuity of this belief in its progressive forms of development up to Monotheism. Yet the hope was short-lived. More scientific research and severer criticism have deprived this theory of its former wide influence.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>(1) The assumption that the lowest savages of to-day give approximately a faithful picture of primitive times is not true. Savages have a past and a long one, even though not recorded. "Nothing in the natural history of man", writes the Duke of Argyll, "can be more certain than that morally and intellectually and physically he can and often does sink from a higher to a lower level". Max Müller assures us that "if there is one thing which a comparative study of religions places in the clearest light, it is the inevitable decay to which every religion is exposed. . . . Whenever we can trace back a religion to its first beginnings, we find it free from many blemishes that affected it in its later states". Even Tylor admits that animism is everywhere found with the worship of a great God. Brinton holds that the resemblance of the savage mind to that of the child is superficial and likens the savage to the uncultivated and ignorant adult among ourselves.</dd>

<dd>(2) It is opposed by the Philological and Mythological schools. Thus Max Müller explains much in animism by superstition, a poetical conception of nature, and especially by personification. He says that inanimate objects were conceived as active powers and as such were described as agents by a necessity of language, without, however, predicating life or soul of them; for human language knows at first no agents except human agents. Hence animism was a stage of thought reached slowly, and not by sudden impulses. "What is classed as animism in ancient Aryan mythology", he writes, "is often no more than a poetical conception of nature which enables the poet to address sun, moon, rivers and trees as if they could hear and understand his words." The same truth finds abundant illustration in the Psalms. "Sometimes, however," he adds, "what is called animism is a superstition which, after having recognized agents in sun, moon, rivers and trees, postulates on the strength of analogy the existence of agents or spirits dwelling in other parts of nature also, haunting our houses, bringing misfortunes upon us, though sometimes conferring blessings. These ghosts are often mixed up with the ghosts of the departed and form a large chapter in the history of ancient superstition." The ghost, or ancestor, theory received a fatal blow from Lang's "Making of a Religion ", where it is shown that the belief of the most primitive savages is in a High God, Supreme God, and Moral God. Lang thus confutes Tylor's contentions:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>that man could not have possibly started with a belief in a Supreme Being;</li>
<li>that religion and morality must have separate origins.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Even in China, where ancestor-worship prevails, we find it distinct from the worship of gods, and there is no trace of an ancestor having ever become a god. Again, soul-worship and ancestor-worship are not identical, and with many tribes much attention is paid to conciliating the souls of the dead where ancestor-worship is unknown. Brinton holds the former to be older and more general. The aim is to get rid of the soul, to put it to rest, or send it on its journey to a better land, lest it trouble the survivors. Karl Mullenhöff maintains that folk-lore has no independent value and as a source of mythology is of only secondary importance.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(3) Animism is not the sole and chief source of religion. De la Saussaye says that the belief of the early Teutons consisted only to a small extent of animistic ideas concerning souls and spirits. Prof. F. B. Gummere teaches that in Teutonic mythology animism has not succeeded in annexing nature-mythology. F. B. Jevons holds that the religious idea is no part of animism pure and simple, and to make the personal agents of animism into supernatural agents or divine powers there must be added some idea which is not contained in animism, and that idea is a specifically religious idea, one which is apprehended directly or intuitively by the religious consciousness. E. Mogk, whose inclinations lean to Tylor, is yet constrained by a scientific mind to recognize nature-worship and the great gods as original; and he warns the student of Teutonic mythology that he must not allow himself to be seduced into disregarding the fact that the worship of the God of Heaven is one of the most original elements of the Teutonic belief. De la Saussaye and Pfleiderer hold that the supposition according to which every conception of an object--e. g. tree, sun, moon, clouds, thunder, earth, heaven--as a living being has an animistic character is undemonstrable and improbable. They show from Teutonic mythology that the power and beneficent influence of these objects of nature and their symbolic conception belong to another sphere of ideas and sentiments than that of animism.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(4) Prof. W. Robertson Smith and Prof. Frazer conclusively prove that the animistic religion of fear was neither universal nor primitive. According to Prof. Frazer, the primitive reason of sacrifice was communion with God. Even worship of the dead cannot be entirely explained animistically as the cult of souls. Animistic conceptions may enter into the worship of ancestors and heroes; but other ideas are so essential that they cannot be regarded merely as modifications of soul-worship.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(5) It is not primitive nor specific. Prof. Brinton says, "There is no special form of religious thought which expresses itself as what has been called by Dr. Tylor Animism, i. e. the belief that inanimate objects are animated and possess souls or spirits." This opinion, which in one guise or another is common to all religions and many philosophies, "is merely a secondary phenomenon of the religious sentiment, not a trait characteristic of primitive faiths". De la Saussaye holds that animism is always and everywhere mixed up with religion; it is nowhere the whole of religion.</dd>

<dd>To make Tyler's POV the focus of this article would be to diminish it to an etymology. An encyclopedia is an encyclopedia because it is comprehensive and etymology is only one aspect of a topic. Because Tyler apparently invented the term doesn't mean he invented that which the term attempts to point at. I think you're right in that we need to pay much attention to the fact that this term has been invented by one culture to describe something in another culture but we also need to make clear the shortcomings of this very process (see Daniel Quinn's comments below). -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristiaan_20a6.html" title="User:Christiaan">Christiaan</a> 14:08, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Making article less anachronistic</span></h2>
<p>I was surprised to find how anachronistic this article is on animism. It's not what I've come to expect of wikipedia. Author <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Quinn_f7de.html" title="Daniel Quinn">Daniel Quinn</a> has some interesting thoughts on animism which could be used to help to broaden out this article and give more of a NPOV. Check out his <a href="http://www.ishmael.com/interaction/qanda/qanda.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www.ishmael.com/interaction/qanda/qanda.cfm" rel="nofollow">FAQ</a> by choosing topic Animism. Here're a couple of his answers to questions that will give you a sense of where he's coming from:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Animism has no dogma, no set of universally-accepted beliefs. You have to remember that if you were to visit an aboriginal people and ask them about animism, they wouldn't know what you were talking about. My description of animism (like every other description of it) is an abstraction of what I see in the attitudes of Leaver peoples scattered all over the world--peoples who aren't in communication with each other and who generally feel no need for precise theological answers. Although most that I know of are more or less constantly interacting with the spirit world (in a very casual way), I've never encountered any with elaborately developed notions of an afterlife as such."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"The religions of our culture (which your "religious processes" seems to refer to) are the religions of our culture because they support the mythology of our culture ("the world was made for man and man was made to conquer and rule it; there is one right way to live, and we have it; everyone in the world should be made to live the way we do). If this mythology ever disappears, then these religions will disappear as well. The assault on animism is of course being carried out primarily by Christian religionists working among aboriginal peoples, who (as a by-product of their work) bear the message that ours is the one right way to live and everyone should be made to adopt it, thus destroying native cultures wherever they find them. The destruction of these cultures is irreversible, of course; once they're gone, they're gone, just like extinct species. Animism itself is indestructible, at least as I've defined it. Anyone who views the world as a sacred place (and humans as worthy of a place in a sacred place) is an animist."</i></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Differences between animism and religion?</span></h2>
<p>From article: <i>Animism is commonly described as the most primitive form of religion, but properly speaking it is not a religion at all, for religion implies, at any rate, some form of emotion.</i></p>
<p>Animism <i>is</i>, of course, a religion in the sense that it is a sum total of answers given to humankinds relationship with the universe, which is religion in its broadest sense. That animism is a religion is also reflected in the fact that it is listed on <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">Religion</a> as such.</p>
<p>continues: <i>Animism is in the first instance an explanation of phenomena rather than an attitude of mind toward the cause of them, a philosophy rather than a religion.</i></p>
<p>Except philosophy generally asks questions while religion generally answers them. In this sense animism is most certainly a religion.</p>
<p>continues: <i>The term may, however, be conveniently used to describe the early stage of religion in which people endeavour to set up relations between themselves and the unseen powers, conceived as spirits...</i></p>
<p>Or rather between themselves and the Universe.</p>

<dd>See the two sections prior to this. Animism is neither a religion nor a foundation of modern religions. It is a particular <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiritual.html" title="Spiritual">spiritual</a> and <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophical.html" title="Philosophical">philosophical</a> standpoint which is often poorly distinguished from <a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythology.html" title="Mythology">mythology</a>. However, these passages are POV nonsense.</dd>

<dd>Animism is also not a unique shared belief system. There are many groups of people who hold animistic beliefs, but they do not practice a single religion called Animism.

<dd>Regarding the capilisation, yes I think you're right but I copied and pasted that from the article so you might like to fix the article. Regarding animism not being a shared belief system I think you are confusing "shared" with "organised". The very fact that <i>something</i> is shared by animists is the very reason for giving it a name in the first place. That whatever is shared is not organised does not preclude it from being a religion as this is not the definition of religion. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristiaan_20a6.html" title="User:Christiaan">Christiaan</a> 14:45, 31 Dec 2004</dd>

<p>I am afraid you guys are missing the context. Obviously this discussion hinges on how one defines religion (does it involve emotion or not?) When Taylor introduced the term animism, it was in the context of arguments among Western scholars over <i>how</i> to define religion. those who defined religion in terms of emotion (e.g. Marrett) dismissed Taylor, but Taylor was claiming that animism is the origin of religion which proves that religion is not necessarily about emotion. Today most scholars accept that religion <i>may</i> function as a way to express feelings (following Marrett) <b>or</b> <i>may</i> be a way to explain things (following Taylor). I'd say the article needs two parts -- one section on how the concept of animism arose in the late 1800s, providing all the context Sam Spade provides above; and second, a section on how people use animism today. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> 19:54, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd><i>"Though it is based on better sources than Edward Tylor had at his disposal in 1871, my take on animism (summarized elsewhere on this discussion page) is still just my take. I'm not an authority on animism. All I've done in my own writing is to replace Tylor's definition of animism with my own. I can get away with this because there is no one to challenge me; just as I am not an authority on animism, neither is anyone else. One can become an authority on Methodism, Islam, or Roman Catholicism because the beliefs of Methodists, Muslims, and Roman Catholics are codified--systematized and authoritatively formulated in a definitive manner, which the beliefs of indigenous peoples never are. When I say that 'Anyone who views the world as a sacred place (and humans as worthy of a place in a sacred place) is an animist,' no one can say I'm wrong; but it's equally true that no one can say I'm right. So the question becomes, if there is such a thing as an animist worldview, which definition of it makes better sense--seems more credible--Tylor's or Quinn's?</i></dd>

<dd><i>"Personally, it seems to me a mistake to equate animism with indigenous spirituality in general. The spiritual universe of indigenous peoples includes many elements that have nothing whatever to do with animism (however defined)--shamanism, totemism, spirit worship, fetishism, and so on. If I were doing it, I'd bundle all these things together in the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_Peoples_ad3b.html" title="Indigenous Peoples">'Indigenous Peoples'</a> article (along with a discussion of animism) and replace the current article on animism with a cross-reference to this section."</i></dd>

<dd>Hmmm. I still think there is material, not so much about animists themselves but about anthropogists and their <i>use of the term</i> animism, that better belongs here than in some article about Indigenous Peoples.

<p>I agree with both Quinn and Jmabel. "Animism" is not -- for the anthropologists who originally coined the term -- the name of a religion (like "Judaism," "Christianity," "Islam" etc.); it is a heuristic device used to classify a broad range of beliefs and practices found in many different cultures. Anthropologists need such heuristic devices in order to make comparisons or general claims about "human nature" (or in this case "religion"). As Quinn points out, doing this -- coming up with some abstract concept for the purpose of cross-cultural analysis -- necissarily means taking beliefs and practices out of their context, and also over-simplifying variation within any one culture. Clearly, anthropologists like Taylor thought they had good reasons for doing this -- they thought it would give them genuine insight into the nature of religion and the evolution of culture, and help Westerners understand non-Western religions. In other words, such anthropologists would claim that "animism" can really help them better understand another culture. But some anthropologists disagree. I <i>do</i> think this article can be very clear about "animism" as an analytical category in anthropology; say something about debates within anthropology over "animism" and thus over "religion;" and say something about <i>how</i> animism <i>may</i> help us better to understand non-Western cultures (or even our own -- the WWII myth of the gremlin that kept causing mechanical problems in aircraft is an example of animism). But we have to be careful to make clear that "animism" is not a "thing" in the same sense as apple pie or even Hinduism. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> 18:10, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree, but that's not to say that animism is not a religion, just that it's not a religion like the major religions of our culture(s). It is a religion in the broad sense that it is a sum total of answers given to humankind's relationship with the universe. To clarify Quinn's POV, another answer on his <a href="http://www.ishmael.com/interaction/qanda/qanda.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www.ishmael.com/interaction/qanda/qanda.cfm" rel="nofollow">FAQ</a>:</dd>

<dd><i>It's easy to distinguish animism from paganism. Paganism is a farmer's religion ("pagan" means "of the country"). There were no farmers here until about ten thousand years ago. Before that, the religion of humanity was animism (and it still is among tribal peoples). It's not, in fact, a religion in the way most people think of religion. It's based on no "religious" belief. Rather, it embodies a worldview: the world is a sacred place, and humans belong in that sacred place. The religions of our culture (the "major" religions) perceive the world to be a place of illusion and evil--not a sacred place, but rather a place to to be escaped from in order to reach some "better" place that is our true home. At the same time, the religions of our culture perceive humans to be fundamentally flawed, so that if the world were a sacred place, humans wouldn't belong in it. In the view of our culture's religions, humans are miserable creatures living in a miserable place. When people ask me to explain animism, I tell them that if they're really interested, they should read The Story Of B. I wrote that book to explain animism.</i></dd>

<p>No, I disagree -- perhaps you miss my point. I certainly believe that different non-Western peoples like the Utku or&#160;!kung have or had their own religions. And anthropologists refer to these as animistic religions in order to classify them. But "animism" is an <i>invention</i> of the Western imagination. What Quinn writes is a fiction as well. Now, these fictions can have valuable uses -- they can make us question our own beliefs, or help open our minds to others' beliefs. But to claim that animism is a "real" religion <i>in any sense</i> is to suppress and damage the beliefs and practices of indigenous people who have been colonized or marginalized by the West. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> 20:52, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm still missing the point maybe, because it seems to me you are contradicting yourself. You say it shouldn't be referred to as religion in any sense and then you explain why it's useful to refer to it as religion. I didn't call it "real" religion. I called it religion. The difference is important, as you imply. Quinn also refers to it as religion (<i>"Before [agriculture], the religion of humanity was animism"</i>). I don't think it would be useful to call animism <i>not</i> a religion (and remove it from <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">Religion</a> for instance). I think it would be useful to refer to it as religion but to qualify this label in the same way that Quinn has (and yourself). <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristiaan_20a6.html" title="User:Christiaan">Christiaan</a> 01:22, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do <i>not</i> say that it is useful to refer to animism as a religion. I say that scholars of religion use "animism" as a heuristic devise to <i>classify</i> a variety of different religions. Animism is not a religion, period. It is a way that some people in the West talk about a huge number of non-Western beliefs and practices, which <i>may</i> have certain elements in common but are in other respects different. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> 17:57, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes that's why I said you <i>explained</i> why it's useful rather than <i>said</i> it's useful. You've also used the term "animistic religions" yourself. Again, I think it would be useful to refer to it as religion but to qualify this label in the same way as Quinn. I think to say it is not a religion would be misleading in regard to the broad definition of religion. Maybe you could elaborate on what is different about animism and why these differences disqualify it from being referred to as religion. I'm not sure, either, that you've responded to the argument that it's a religion in the sense that it is a sum total of answers given to humankind's relationship with the universe. And I don't know how to respond to "animism is not a religion, period." <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristiaan_20a6.html" title="User:Christiaan">Christiaan</a> 11:03, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>People use the word "animist" to classify together different beliefs and practices of different societies. If you take people from two different societies, and ask them if they have the same religion, they will say no. If I then say, "but both of their religions are animistic," it means that the two different religions have something in common that is interesting or important to me. An analogy: Christianity, Islam, and Judaism are three monotheistic religions. Monotheism is <i>not</i> a "religion ("period"), it is a kind of religion. The proposition "I am a monotheist" is not comparable to the proposition "I am a Christian." When I say, "I am a monotheist" I am not naming my religion, I am saying that my religion, as yet unnammed, has something in common with some other religions. When I say "I am a Christian," <i>then</i> I am naming my religion. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> 22:20, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, I apologise, I believe I'm on the same wave length now. You are saying it is not <i>a</i> religion, however you are not denying that animism is religious in nature. Is this correct? <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristiaan_20a6.html" title="User:Christiaan">Christiaan</a> 14:28, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Not quite -- "animism" is an abstract concept, a word; as such I am not sure it has any "nature." However, you can argue reasonably that it is "religious" in nature in that Taylor, when he first invented the word, was also developing a theory about the evolution of religion. Thus, beliefs and practices that he considered examples of "animism" were -- so he argued -- religions. So yes, you can argue this too. But please donot mistake the English <i>word</i> "animism" for beliefs and practices of thousands of different societies. Take for example the Zulu who, when sneezing, believes he is in close contact with spirits and thus often makes a wish (this is one of Taylor's examples). This is (or so Taylor claims) a real belief that is exemplified by real actions. But is this an example of religion? Taylor says yes it is -- an example of a primitive form of religion he calls animism. Others, however, consider this belief to be an example of "magic" which they do not consider religion. Others say it is a primitive example of science. So there are debates about whether this is religious or not. What do the Zulu think? That is a good question and I do not know. But Taylor uses "animism" to talk about hundreds or thousands of different cases in as many cultures. Some of those cultures may not even have a category "religion." Or they may have a notion of religion, but one that is different from what Taylor calls "animism." So I think it depends. But to figure out on a case by case basis, you have to distinguish between actuall events (including what people say) and our abstract words we use for talking about what other people do. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> 18:22, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
