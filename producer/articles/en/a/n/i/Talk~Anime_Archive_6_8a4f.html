<h2><span class="mw-headline">The definition of anime as "Japanese animation": what is anime again?</span></h2>
<p>Anime is a "style" (or a medium); and it should be defined as one. Just like manga. For your information, manga is produced outside Japan, and we've seen that happen in the form of webcomics such as <a href="../../../v/a/n/Van_Von_Hunter_a575.html" title="Van Von Hunter">Van Von Hunter</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatokyo.html" title="Megatokyo">Megatokyo</a>. They may not look like the best manga out there - unlike the material we're accustomed to seeing. At least, their products are being published and sold under manga sections in book stores. However, manga is manga regardless of who and where it is produced. Therefore, if manga can be produced outside Japan, then why can't anime be produced outside Japan? <a href="../../../k/y/u/User%7EKyuuA4_26f7.html" title="User:KyuuA4">KyuuA4</a> 05:43, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What falls under the criteria of Anime and Non-Anime? As a reminder, the Japanese consider anything animated as "anime"; by which, it is synonymous to the set "animation". Of course, we in the west make a distinction between anime vs non-anime. So, what defines the sets "anime" and "non-anime"? Can an animated product be both "anime" and "non-anime"? <a href="../../../k/y/u/User%7EKyuuA4_26f7.html" title="User:KyuuA4">KyuuA4</a> 06:04, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm trying to head off a revert war at <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_Dynamite_98d8.html" title="Miss Dynamite">Miss Dynamite</a>. What is the WP stance on <i>non-Japanese</i> productions that self-identify as anime? The standard Western definition of anime has been, from the late 1970s until recently, strictly "Japanese animation". Similarly, manga is strictly "Japanese comics". Of course these distinctions do not exist in Japan where the words simply mean "animation" and "comics" respectively.</p>
<p>Starting in the late 1990s, more and more works outside Japan are self-identifying as anime and manga due to being inspired by the styles prevalent within those media (IMHO to call anime and manga "genres" is as spurious as calling Hollywood and Bollywood "genres" of film). While there are convenient names for Korean and Chinese comics (manhwa and manhua respectively), American manga-inspired works (<a href="../../../a/m/e/Amerimanga.html" title="Amerimanga">amerimanga</a>) (which I heartily encourage the use of), and even American anime-inspired animation (<a href="../../../a/m/e/Amerime.html" title="Amerime">amerime</a>), not all these terms are widely used. Do we bend the definition of anime to include works with little to no Japanese involvement in the production like <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totally_Spies%21_a3fc.html" title="Totally Spies!">Totally Spies!</a> or <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samurai_Jack_b751.html" title="Samurai Jack">Samurai Jack</a>?</p>
<p>I disagree with some of the self-identification here, and I don't think self-identification is the be-all, end-all of classification. It would seem to me a lot like remaking <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manon_des_Sources_%28film%29_bfa5.html" title="Manon des Sources (film)">Manon des Sources</a> in the California countryside without a single French cast or crewmember, and insisting it's still a French film ... or for that matter, calling <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kimba_the_White_Lion_d7f8.html" title="Kimba the White Lion">Kimba the White Lion</a> a Disney film because it's inspired by Disney and has talking animals in it. But if WP consensus would prefer to classify amerime and amerimanga as subsets of anime and manga, then consensus wins.</p>
<p>Please, discuss!</p>

<dd>No one outside a small set of very deluded people in the US considers any of the apery going on over there as manga. American comics have a long and worthy history, the sooner these people forget about trying to be Japanese and just go back to being creative and original, the better it'll be for 'em. --<a href="../../../z/i/p/User%7EZippedmartin_fad3.html" title="User:Zippedmartin">zippedmartin</a> 20:45, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll agree with some of that sentiment, even though my personal opinions on the American comic industry probably have very little to do with WP naming taxonomy! ^_^ If people are inspired by manga, who's to prevent them from making comics, right? That I think demonstrates the need for terms like amerimanga (I like the ANN descriptor "world manga"). Even the Philippines has a perfectly valid term for native comics (<i>komiks</i>) ... say, there's a missing WP article right there!</dd>

<dd>At the same time, there's <i>plenty</i> of apery going on in mainstream Western comics ... much more of that oeuvre is DC/Marvel superhero-of-the-month than it is Elfquest or Preacher or Transmetropolitan. (Or, sum up as: Rob Liefeld is still employed.) So I think pointing the blame squarely at amerimanga creators for the dearth of creativity in the American comic industry may be a bit oversimplified. I think the entire reason much of the work being passed off as "manga" is self-labeled that way is simply because manga sells. -- <a href="../../../m/i/w/User%7EMiwasatoshi_bb6e.html" title="User:Miwasatoshi">Miwa</a> 21:41, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>well, manga is actually simply something that came from the japanese not having money to make actual movies, and the art style came from looking at mickey mouse and suc from dizney, along with some older cultural influences, but mangaitself was origionally sorta like showing motion and such in still frames, anime on the other hand has simmilar history, and anime also has a history in japan of being a way of geting around the censors, such things like Hentai, while not for everyone , came from attempts at cultural freedom of expression, and defiance of censors. while it is true that anime comes form japan nad the orient, I still dont see the problem with some americans trying to get in on a good thing, except that they cant keep kidding themselves, they can call a series like avatar&#160;: the last airbender anime all they want, but its anime STYLE, nothing that isnt from japan, or at least the orient, can be alled anime without lying through ones , possibly misinformed teeth. well, thats all i have to say on the subject for the moment.<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKaraveks_voice_1821.html" title="User:Karaveks voice">Karaveks voice</a> 20:51, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just noticed the debate going on in the Miss Dynamite article as well as here, and in the hopes of providing some direction, let me point out a few things. In Wikipedia, we are concerned entirely with what is, <i>never</i> with what should be. This is the essence of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Therefore, if there is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable evidence</a> that indeed non-Japanese publishers have successfully co-opted terms like "manga" and "anime" to describe their own products, then we cannot forbid such uses here. How we may feel about the issue is utterly without relevance. Personally, I think manga and anime are still largely used to describe Japanese creations, and therefore it's better to use terms like "manga-inspired", but I doubt that will be true for much longer. I've noticed Megatokyo is often shelved in the Manga sections of bookstores these days, and whether we like it or not, we must pay attention to that public perception. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 14:14, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The reason that some comics like <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatokyo.html" title="Megatokyo">Megatokyo</a> and Sorcerers and Secretaries are filed under manga is probably because of who publishes them (MT is under DC's manga imprint and S&amp;S is published by Tokyopop) and probably the format they're published in. And Zippedmartin is right, I could link to random policies too, like, oh, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias</a> --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 04:24, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What about things that fans identify as manga or anime, or manga or anime styled? For example, many people consider Stan Sakai's comic Usagi Yojimbo to be manga, yet Sakai himself doesn't. Also, about the whole "death of creativity in American comics", well, that's only true if you glance at the racks for five seconds and consider everything in the superhero genre to be automatically "uncreative". But I digress. People can hate on Teen Titans the cartoon all they want, but the fact remains that, for better or for worse, anime and manga have made their mark on other cultures, and I believe this should be mentioned here. I guess my point is, this whole discussion subject seems to me like yet another attempt, thinly veiled or not, to somehow cite the "superiority" of anime and manga and set them at odds with their non-Japanese equivalents. Comics and cartoons are comics and cartoons whether they come from Japan or not. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterGrazzt_3852.html" title="User:MasterGrazzt">MasterGrazzt</a> 08:03, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can say this. In the Japanese language, "anime" refers to all works animated. "Manga" refers to all works comics. So it would be appropriate to call everything "anime" and everything "manga" in a loanword way of using words. At the same time, I personally find that non-Japanese works that self-identify as "anime" tend to be the least worthy of being called "anime," while there are less pretentious works that intentionally or unintentionally fit better into the anime "style." Now, think about what makes a movie a Hollywood movie. A movie is Hollywood when it's financed by a Hollywood company. Likewise, if you want to make a distinction between anime and animation, an objective rule of thumb can be to decide by whether a particular title has Japanese financing. This makes sense, as I wouldn't call American animated shows that were farmed out to Japan "anime" in the discriminating US-English way, and that goes back to these shows being financed with American money. Likewise, the Disney shows that were made at the Disney Japan studio would not be "anime," even though a lot of famous Japanese animators worked there. To wit, what would you call the animated segment in Kill Bill or the animated work that is The Animatrix?--Outis 12:21, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As far as American-made shows using anime style (Totally Spies! and Samurai Jack as mentioned above), I prefer the term "americanime". 69.158.141.33 08:13, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In art forms such as animation, art &amp; comics you must remember that origin does not matter. The defining point of an art is, style, if a show or comic is drawn in America or Japan the style of the show or comic will still be the same as the artist makes it. ~~Seve</p>

<dd>I disagree. Nobody calls <a href="../../../w/o/n/Wong_Kar_Wai_5fa5.html" title="Wong Kar Wai">Wong Kar Wai</a>'s work French even though it's heavily influenced by French film (the guy got invited to Cannes to judge, for goodness sakes!) And I realize there are heavily elements of Chinese culture in his films, but American culture is heavily featured in American comics based on Japanese manga/anime styles, so the difference is, again? --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 05:08, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some artists may use animation as their means of expression, but the form of animation that fans want to call anime is not art. Anime is popular enternainment. While popular entertainment and art are not mutually exclusive, art is only an element that embelishes anime. Origins and who finance an anime title certainly matter, as long as you prefer to narrow the scope of what anime is. If you don't like that, use the word "anime" interchangeably with "animation," as it's used in the Japanese language.--24.5.125.75 23:06, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Actually, I'm more worried about the stereotyping that's going on in the Miss Dynamite "manga" (which looks nothing like manga from Japan - it looks more like North American comic strips than anything). Just having a Japanese woman (who isn't even really Japanese - Chin is not a Japanese name.), especially a heavily stereotypical one, doesn't make it "manga", no matter how much the author wishes it. --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 04:58, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">I want to Move the Cowboy Bebop image</span></h2>
<p>I want to move the Cowboy Bebop image further down the article, into the Characteristics section above or below the Dragon Ball Z picture as an example of space opera, drama and action. In its place can go the Atomic/Astro Boy or another suitable picture. The Cowboy Bebop picture along with the Anime and Manga portal link creates a lot of whitespace at the head of the article on quite a few different monitor resolutions. I and several other editors have tried formatting the page around the picture but after many different revisions I believe it is the picture itself that is the problem. I know that this is the sort of change that you propose first and change later to prevent arguements so comments and objections please! --Squilibob 10:55, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There were a couple of reasons that this move was made. It was a format problem with a large image that created whitespace because it was used in conjunction with the Table of Contents, instead the smallest image on the page was moved there - Atom from the history section (that immediately succeeds the lead section anyway, it was only moved up a short distance). The other reason was that I wanted to use Cowboy Bebop was to become an example of genres. That is why I have now moved it back into the genres section. I'm sorry you object, but there was a consensus for this weeks ago. --Squilibob 00:47, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is a large white space even with the smallest image. You need to find another image to use as an example of genres. And theres no clear consensus to move the picture. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolverOcelotX_fe1a.html" title="User:RevolverOcelotX">RevolverOcelotX</a>

<dd>The idea is to reduce the whitespace and that was addressed. Why do I have find another image to use as an example? Give a reason. If the support of Nihonjoe and DenisMoskowitz wasn't given, then I wouldn't have changed the page, but it was. That was consensus which I didn't need but asked for anyway. I don't understand why you are changing this back when it has been like this for many weeks. I'm not going to revert it again as I don't want to start an edit war, but I would like other people to voice their opinion. --Squilibob 10:00, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is ALOT of whitespace even with the smaller pic so it doesn't make much difference. The smaller picture is at best sub-par. We could probably get rid of most of the whitespace by resizing and re-positioning the Cowboy Bebop picture. And there are better pictures to use to represent example of genres. Perhaps a good mecha/sci-fi picture? The image at the top should be perfect. I believe the picture at the top should be intelligible, technically good, showing a typical anime face, and representative stills from different kinds of anime and the Cowboy Bebop picture fits the bill. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolverOcelotX_fe1a.html" title="User:RevolverOcelotX">RevolverOcelotX</a>

<p>We currently have four users agreeing to the proposal and one against. If anyone agrees with RevolverOcelotX's arguements against moving the Cowboy Bebop image and the Atom Boy image back to where they were please speak your case. I will be moving the image if there is no further resistance because the Cowboy Bebop image again takes up too much space and RevolverOcelotX has reverted Shiro Hane's attempt to fix the problem where the image's size causes text to wrap inconsistantly at low resolutions. --Squilibob 14:30, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

Does it appear in anime sections of retail stores? Is it listed in several popular online anime encyclopedias?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">POV Note</span></h2>
<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>First of all, great job with the article. I like how anyone who has never heard of anime can read this article and understand the basics of anime by the time they get to the end.</p>
<p>I placed a POV note on top of the page because I feel that the article is biased. As a former anime fan (I had been a fan for at least five years.), I understand that the anime community is mostly anti-American and pro-Japanese, and I know how hard it is to deviate from this standard. However, this is Wikipedia, and we are supposed to present an neutral point of view.</p>
<p>Here are my comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "Western Distribution" section seems to be biased against Western audiences; it seems like it is saying 1) Westerners only do it for the money, 2) Western dubs are no good, and 3) Japanese anime is better than Western ones.</li>
<li>The entire article seems to say that only Japanese anime counts as "anime", as there are no references to anime written in other nations. Some people believe that only Japanese works can be "anime" but others don't; it would be great to have some information about both views in the articles.</li>
<li>From "Animation Style": "Many non-Japanese cartoons are starting to incorporate mainstream anime shortcuts and symbols to appeal to anime's tremendously growing fanbase and cut costs." Ouch. So every group who is trying to go cross-genre is doing this for money? Maybe the superhero comic book artist is an anime fan herself, and she is drawing anime-style because she loves anime.</li>
<li>Again from "Animation Style": "Osamu Tezuka adapted and simplified many Disney animation precepts to reduce the budget costs and number of frames in the production, though it should be noted that Disney films made in the west are not anime." Remove the last clause. It's understood that Disney films are not anime if the distinction as said earlier in the article is that anime is meant to be made efficiently and Disney films are meant to be made with detail. Also, it unnecessarily jabs at the West as being "not good enough". Compare this to a neutral point of view sentence in the same section, "The most common is the large eyes style drawn on many anime characters, common mainly due to the influence of Osamu Tezuka, who was inspired by the exaggerated features of American cartoon characters such as Betty Boop and Mickey Mouse and from Disney's Bambi."</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for listening to my concerns. See you around Wikipedia.</p>

</dd>
<dd>Saying non-Japanese works can be anime is not an opinion. It is factually wrong. In my clumsy words, Anime is animation created by Japanese, which reflects Japanese culture &amp; Japanese sensibilites, or in the apparent absence thereof, the Japanese point-of-view of non-Japanese culture (i.e. Cowboy Bebop is American culture filtered through a Japanese lens). This last point is what differentiates anime from animation simply <i>produced in Japan</i>, i.e., the difference between <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelion.html" title="Evangelion">Evangelion</a> and <a href="../../../d/u/c/DuckTales_9a5d.html" title="DuckTales">DuckTales</a>.</dd>

I don't know how many times this has to be repeated, but anime is not just big eyes, sweatdrops, and super-deformed characters. It's a reflection of the deepest, most innate sensibilities of the Japanese people. This is an undeniable truth. It sounds somewhat elitist, I know, like saying "you have to have been an old white guy who lived 200 years ago to write <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chamber_music.html" title="Chamber music">chamber music</a>", and it's not implying that non-Japanese animators are inferior or incabable. It's just that I have yet to see a piece of animation with the true soul of anime from somone who was not raised Japanese. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcg106_96c3.html" title="User:Marcg106">Marcg106</a> 04:39, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think the use of "Eva vs. DuckTales" is a gross oversimplification -- Japan produces its fair share of crap, and I'd wager that the biggest reason we don't see more groundbreaking animation from America is that networks aren't willing to risk funding something that breaks the mold, not because creators are lacking in talent compared to their Japanese counterparts.</dd>
<dd>That said, I'm personally of a mind that "anime" should refer only to cartoons (<i>yes</i>, I said the "C" word&#160;:P) made in Japan for Japanese audiences. The distinction is based simply on geography, not quality, IMO.

<dd>Well, it seems that with my edit, that all of the POV concerns mentioned have been addressed by the wiki users. So, I removed the POV tag. My entry may need some cleaning.

<p>Just wondering, how come the following are no longer present in the article:</p>
<ul>
<li>proper fansubs and speed-sub comparisons.</li>
<li>types of subtitling.</li>

<dd>There is a separate article for fansubs that the Anime article links directly to from that section. The fansub section is supposed to be a short introduction and the Fansub article should be the place where all the <i>details</i> are given to the reader. Imagine how long the article would be if every detail of the history of anime, licensing of anime and fansubbing was included. Comparisons and types of fansubs must go in the fansub article itself. --Squilibob 14:09, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Short (5-10 minute) animes</span></h2>
<p>I sometimes stumble upon anime series where each episode's duration (including opening and ending sequences) is only 5-10 minutes, such as: Oruchuban Ebichu, Dameko Doubutsu, and Panda Z. Is there a special category for these short animes? And are these "real" series, or are they simply produced as fillers? Thanks.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, they're real series alright; some, like <a href="../../../d/i/_/Di_Gi_Charat_6d88.html" title="Di Gi Charat">Di Gi Charat</a>, are even fairly popular. But no, I don't think we have separate categories. Not that many of them, and so far as I know, they range up from the mere minutes to fill 20 minute series, so where would one draw the line? --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">maru</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marudubshinki_980c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki">contribs</a> 16:08, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Images on the page</span></h2>
<p>I would like to raise the point about images again. Most of the images are 300px wide. I have resized the two Macross pictures before but editors have reverted it. Can we have a fixed width for all the images please?</p>
<p>There are two Macross images. I've tried to remove the Mylene one twice and it keeps being reverted. Can we have some diversity please? The Macross image in Music is good and we have Lum as our example of female depiction. Do we need this Mylene image?</p>
<p>Two of the images raised in question last year (<a href="../../../a/n/i/Talk%7EAnime_Archive_2_cb17.html#Not_all_images_used_are_optimal" title="Talk:Anime/Archive 2">Talk:Anime/Archive_2#Not_all_images_used_are_optimal</a>) are still there. I would like to keep a Cowboy Bebop image and an image of Lum as they are good examples, but when this was raised there were some good points made. The current Cowboy Bebop picture isn't even used on the <a href="../../../c/o/w/Cowboy_Bebop_0f4a.html" title="Cowboy Bebop">Cowboy Bebop</a> article as of writing and as mentioned previously, the Lum .png has two people in it. --Squilibob 10:59, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
