<p>This article has a lot of POV issues, foremost being that it lumps all hoarders together -- <i>Hoarders keep abnormally large numbers of animals for whom they do not provide even the most basic care. The sometimes hundreds of dogs or cats kept by a single hoarder generally show signs of abuse such as severe malnutrition, untreated medical conditions including open sores, cancers, and advanced dental and eye diseases, and severe psychological distress. In 80 percent of the cases studied, authorities found either dead or severely ill animals in hoarders' homes</i>. Many hoarders make a serious effort to provide care, basic and otherwise. And "hundreds"? That's a gross exaggeration -- those numbers are extremely rare. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 22:53, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not sure who wrote this page, but it is factually correct, and shows a strong understanding of the problem. Whatever effort hoarders make, is not nearly enough to take care of the numbers they keep. Hoarders "collect" as many animals as will physically fit on their property. It's unsanitary.

<dd>It is <i>not</i> factually correct. As I said, it lumps all hoarders together. There needs to be some distance from this, as it's making gross overgeneralizations. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 23:54, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sure where you are coming from. The page does not "lump" anything. Hoarders BY DEFINITION will "collect" as many animals as they can. It's simply impossible to provide even basic care to the hoard. I'll go so far as to say that if someone is providing basic care successfully, they are not "hoarders" in the sense of seriously ill people who abuse large numbers of animals but "fanciers" -- who by definition groom and care for animals. I think you are confusing the colloquial term of hoarder, someone who perhaps has a large number of animals, with someone who has a problem. I think you should, as I suggested earlier, click on the links on the page.

<dd>For example, the Illinois statute cited on one of the links defines hoarding as "nability to provide even minimal standards of nutrition, sanitation, shelter, and veterinary care, with this neglect often resulting in starvation, illness, and death."

<p>Zoe ADDED the npov tag 22:52, 1 May 2006. The NPOV tag was unjustified. Zoe advised me that removing a tag repeatedly is vandalism. However, there never was an NPOV dispute until Zoe added the tag. Shouldn't that be vandalism?</p>
<p>It seems that Zoe should have added a dispute of <i>factual accuracy</i> instead NPOV. The claim appears to be that the facts are wrong. On the other hand, the sources listed are adequate as to the factual accuracy.</p>
<p>I'm trying not to be disagreeable, but I'm disaggreeing that it's even possible to disagree!!! Animal hoarding is criminal. You can't defend it, just as you can't defend murder, child abuse, armed robbery, or sexual harrassment. The notion that animal hoarding is "good for the animals" is entirely new to my ears. If anything the article should be locked to before Zoe's edit on May 1. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianbeck_d209.html" title="User:Brianbeck">Brianbeck</a> 20:06, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The NPOV tag indicates that only one point of view of the subject has been addressed. Just because there wasn't a dispute before doesn't mean that there can't be one now.

<dd>That's precisely the problem that occurs with hoarding! Did you check any of the links? Should I list the exact instances? --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianbeck_d209.html" title="User:Brianbeck">Brianbeck</a> 01:53, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's POV because presently it presents the 'point of view' that animal hoarders are bad people and that the situation always ends in disaster (while that may be the most likely outcome, it is not a certainty). --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 01:58, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The introductory sentence gives a definition of the phenomenon. "Animal hoarding is a human behaviour that involves the keeping of higher than typical numbers of animals as pets <i>without having the ability to properly house or care for them, while at the same time denying this inability</i> (emphasis mine). So as long as someone merely keeps an unusual number of pets that are properly cared for he isn't practising hoarding. I also don't see where animal hoarders are made to look "bad". It is an animal welfare issue, one that happens thankfully only rarely but is quite capable of overwhelming a local shelter. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 18:18, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, Zoe says that "Many hoarders make a serious effort to provide care, basic and otherwise." If someone knows that the situation is overwhelming he isn't by definition an animal hoarder. The POV tag is misplaced, this is at most a definition issue.
<dl>
<dd>But that's not true. Many hoarders do seriously make an effort to provide care for their animals, but they find themselves overwhelmed and their animals suffer. They're still hoarders, but they do still attempt to care for their animals. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:15, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There argument here is that it is not true (<i>that's not true</i>). First, isn't that a factual dispute, not a NPOV dispute? Second, I suspect it would be more acceptable to <i>show</i> that the facts are disputed, rather than to say that it just <i>isn't true.</i>--<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianbeck_d209.html" title="User:Brianbeck">Brianbeck</a> 21:27, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Don't know. One occasionally reads press releases from the RSPCA or other charities, saying that so-and-so many pets have been recovered from somewhere and that they are in poor condition. However, the sheer scale of the problem should be enough to open anyone's eyes and seek outside help, unless they are seriously <a href="../../../o/b/s/Obsessive-compulsive.html" title="Obsessive-compulsive">obsessive-compulsive</a>. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 19:02, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Listen, here's my solution. We understand that the definition includes harm coming to the animals. If we don't understand that, we need to read the article again and again until we do. Now, if someone wants to argue that neglectful harm to animals is a *good* thing, go right ahead. Otherwise the NPOV tag is preposterous. You can't argue about a tangent that's NOT INCLUDED in the definition of the term... <a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERainman420_d39e.html" title="User:Rainman420">Rainman420</a> 03:42, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The NPOV tag is unwarranted, as we're describing a behavior. Animal hoarding is collecting more animals than can be cared for, so whether the person tries to accomplish the impossible has little bearing on the eventual outcome, which is bad. Good people can do bad things, everyone knows this, we don't need to go through every article on every bad thing and explicitly state it.

The same group will often raise <a href="../../../l/i/v/Livestock.html" title="Livestock">livestock</a> which is also to be differentiated from <a href="../../../c/o/m/Companion_animals.html" title="Companion animals">companion animals</a>. Then you have people who engage in <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog_breeding.html" title="Dog breeding">dog breeding</a> or <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cat_breeding.html" title="Cat breeding">cat breeding</a>. After a certain point, there is animal hoarding. The number of animals on the property are so great, and the capabilities of the owner with respect to supporting the pets so minimal, that it is hard to categorize this type of ownership on the same spectrum with other forms of pet ownership. Yet the occurence of this phenomenon is not isolated. The people who engage in it are found to share a number of common characteristics, <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symptoms.html" title="Symptoms">symptoms</a> if you will. Animal hoarding should be reserved <b>only</b> for this category of "pet ownership" (I hesitate to use the term). When does pet ownership become hoarding? It's pretty obvious. To paraphrase <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potter_Stewart_d5d7.html" title="Potter Stewart">Potter Stewart</a>, you'll know it when you see it. And btw an animal hoarder probably would classify herself as a breeder. Finally, should not the fact that this is a problem already recognized by the <a href="../../../v/e/t/Veterinary.html" title="Veterinary">veterinary</a> community mean anything? That is gaining widespread recognition in the <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychiatric.html" title="Psychiatric">psychiatric</a> community as well?--<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianbeck_d209.html" title="User:Brianbeck">Brianbeck</a> 21:27, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Especially pathognomic is the recidivism rate. One of the papers up at the Tufts site says that it is almost 100 %. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 22:19, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article is very heavily focused on the phenomenon of animal hoarding in America. Which is quite understandable, considering that it is not a very important topic and most of Wikipedia's editors are American. I don't feel as though I have the relevant expertise to try and discuss the problem of animal hoarding in other countries and legal issues, but I'd certainly suggest it for anyone who has the time and inclination.
