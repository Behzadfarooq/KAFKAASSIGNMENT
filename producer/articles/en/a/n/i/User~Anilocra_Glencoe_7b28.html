<p>In <a href="../../../1/6/8/1688.html" title="1688">1688</a>, William took the thrones of <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> and Scotland from <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_VII_of_Scotland_e6f1.html" title="James VII of Scotland">James VII (II of England)</a>. In <a href="../../../1/6/8/1689.html" title="1689">1689</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Graham_of_Claverhouse_bfb7.html" title="John Graham of Claverhouse">John Graham of Claverhouse</a>, Viscount Dundee, led <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Highlands_5738.html" title="Scottish Highlands">Scottish Highlanders</a> in the <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacobitism.html" title="Jacobitism">Jacobite</a> uprisings in an attempt to return the throne to King James. Dundee was killed at the battle of Killiekrankie, however, the rising continued until the Jacobite defeat at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Dunkeld_9d46.html" title="Battle of Dunkeld">battle of Dunkeld</a>, and final crushing of the rebellion at the Haugh of Cromdale.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/6/9/1691.html" title="1691">1691</a>, King William offered an amnesty to the Highlanders who had participated in the Jacobite Uprising on the condition that they swore allegiance to him by <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/6/9/1692.html" title="1692">1692</a>. Nearly all did, but Alastair MacIain, 12th Chief of Glencoe, waited until the last day before setting out to take the oath. The MacIains of Glencoe were a sept of <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clan_Macdonald_6658.html" title="Clan Macdonald">Clan Macdonald</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">December 31</a>, <a href="../../../1/6/9/1691.html" title="1691">1691</a>, he travelled to <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_William%2C_Scotland_541e.html" title="Fort William, Scotland">Fort William</a> and asked <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel_Hill_791e.html" title="Colonel Hill">Colonel Hill</a>, the governor, to administer the required oath. Colonel Hill, however, demurred on the grounds that he was not authorized to receive the necessary oath. He instructed MacIain to proceed quickly to <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inveraray.html" title="Inveraray">Inveraray</a> to make his oath before Sir <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colin_Campbell_06f6.html" title="Colin Campbell">Colin Campbell</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheriff.html" title="Sheriff">sheriff</a> of <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argyll.html" title="Argyll">Argyll</a>. Colonel Hill gave MacIain a letter of protection and a letter to Sir Colin asking that he receive MacIain's oath since MacIain had come to Colonel Hill within the allotted time. Colonel Hill also reassured MacIain that no action would be taken against him without his having the opportunity to make his case before the king or the king's privy council.</p>
<p>It took MacIain three days to reach Inverary through the winter snow and then he had to wait another three days for the arrival of Sir Colin who was absent. Upon his return, Sir Colin reluctantly accepted MacIain's oath.</p>
<p>While MacIain was satisfied that he had satisfied the spirit of the required oath, and therefore did not anticipate any action against himself or his people, some elements within the government saw an opportunity to use his failure to fulfill the letter of the requirement (by missing the deadline) to at one stroke make an example of the Macdonalds and simultaneously eliminate some enemies.</p>

<p>A plot was set in motion which apparently involved <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Dalrymple%2C_1st_Earl_of_Stair_0c37.html" title="John Dalrymple, 1st Earl of Stair">John Dalrymple</a>, Master of Stair and Lord Advocate, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Campbell%2C_Earl_of_Breadalbane_81e5.html" title="John Campbell, Earl of Breadalbane">John Campbell, Earl of Breadalbane</a>, Sir <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Livingstone_c2f3.html" title="Thomas Livingstone">Thomas Livingstone</a>, commander of the forces in Scotland, and even <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willem_III_of_Orange_be5e.html" title="Willem III of Orange">King William</a>, who signed and countersigned the orders.</p>
<p>In late <a href="../../../j/a/n/January.html" title="January">January</a> or early <a href="../../../f/e/b/February.html" title="February">February</a>, <a href="../../../1/6/9/1692.html" title="1692">1692</a>, two companies of the Duke of Argyll's regiment, around 120 men, under the command of Captains <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Campbell_0e2f.html" title="Robert Campbell">Robert Campbell</a> and Thomas Drummond were <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billet.html" title="Billet">billeted</a> on the McDonalds in Glencoe, who received them in the hospitable tradition of the Highlands. Thirteen of this force were Campbells: six were MacDonalds. Captain Campbell was related by marriage to old MacIain himself and so it was natural that he should be billeted at the Chief's own house. Each morning for about two weeks, Captain Campbell visited the home of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_MacDonald_fe68.html" title="Alexander MacDonald">Alexander MacDonald</a>, MacIain's youngest son, who was married to Campbell's niece, the sister of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Roy_MacGregor_8473.html" title="Rob Roy MacGregor">Rob Roy MacGregor</a>. At this stage, it is not clear that either Campbell or Drummond knew the nature of their mission - ostensibly the purpose of collecting taxes instituted by the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Parliament_4b1f.html" title="Scottish Parliament">Scottish Parliament</a> in <a href="../../../1/6/9/1690.html" title="1690">1690</a>. The planning was meticulous enough that they were able to produce legitimate orders to this effect from the very Colonel Hill who had tried to help MacIain complete his oath in the first place, thus dispelling any suspicion the Macdonalds might have felt, although it was also Colonel Hill who issued the orders to begin the massacre two weeks later.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_12.html" title="February 12">February 12</a>, Captain Campbell received the following instructions from his superior officer, a Major Duncanson:</p>

<div style="border: 1px dotted black; background: #efefef; padding: 5px; font-weight:bold;text-align:center;width:570px;">
<p>Ballacholis<br />
Feb. 12, 1692<br /></p>
<p>Sir:<br /></p>
<p>You are hereby ordered to fall upon the Rebels, the MacDonalds of Glencoe, and put all to the sword under 70. You are to have especial care, that the Old Fox and his Sons do upon no account escape your Hands, you are to secure all the avenues that no man can escape: this you are to put in Execution at five a Clock in the Morning precisely, and by that time or very shortly after it, I’ll strive to be at you with a stronger party. If I do not come at five, you are not to tarry for me but fall on. This is by the King’s Special command, for the good and safety of the country, that these miscreants may be cut off root and branch. See that this be put in execution without Feud or Favor, else you may expect to be treated as not true to the King or Government nor a man fit to carry Commission in the King’s Service. Expecting you will not fail in the fulfilling hereof as you love yourself, I subscribed these with my hand.<br /></p>
<p>Signed Robert Duncanson<br />
For Their Majesties Service<br /></p>
To Captain Robert Campbell of Glenlyon</div>
</center>
<p>He spent the evening playing cards with his unsuspecting victims and upon retiring, wished them goodnight and accepted an invitation to dine with MacIain, the chief, the following day.</p>
<p>MacIain himself was killed while trying to rise from his bed but his sons escaped as initially did his wife. In all, 38 men including were murdered either in their homes or as they tried to flee the glen. Another 40 women and children died of exposure after their homes were burned. Elsewhere, various members of the two companies found ways of warning their hosts. Some took insubordination further - two lieutenants, Lt. Francis Farquhar and Lt. Gilbert Kennedy broke their swords rather than carry out their orders. They were arrested and imprisoned, but were exonerated, released and later gave evidence for the prosecution against their superior officers.</p>
<p>In addition to the soldiers who were actually in Glencoe that night, two other detachments each of four hundred men were, according to the plan, to have converged on the escape routes. Both were late in taking up their positions, by design or incompetence. It is possible that the snowstorm made arrival on time quite difficult - especially for those approaching over the <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil%27s_Staircase_bc14.html" title="Devil's Staircase">Devil's Staircase</a> from <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinlochleven.html" title="Kinlochleven">Kinlochleven</a>, while it is equally possible that they simply did not want to play any part in what they knew to be a heinous crime.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnilocra_Glencoe_7b28.html" title="Edit section: Inquiry">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Inquiry</span></h2>
<p>Under Scots law there was a special category of murder known as "murder under trust" which was considered to be even more heinous than ordinary murder. The Glencoe massacre was a clear example of such, and the results of the inquiry into it draws parallels with the <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nuremburg_Trials_cef5.html" title="Nuremburg Trials">Nuremburg Trials</a>.</p>
<p><i>Though the command of superior officers be very absolute, yet no command against the laws of nature is binding; so that a soldier, retaining his commission, ought to refuse to execute any barbarity, as if a soldier should be commanded to shoot a man passing by inoffensively, upon the street, no such command would exempt him from the punishment of murder.</i></p>
<p>The challenge to the inquiry which had been established was to apportion blame on those responsible for the massacre, and yet the orders which lead to the massacre were signed by the King himself, who could not be seen to be responsible. By <a href="../../../1/6/9/1695.html" title="1695">1695</a>, the Duke of Argyll's Regiment had surrendered to the French in <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flanders.html" title="Flanders">Flanders</a>, putting Campbell, Drummond and Duncanson beyond the reach of Scots law. The conclusion of the commission was to exonerate the King and to place the blame for the massacre upon Secretary Dalrymple. The Scottish Parliament, after reviewing the commission report, declared the execution of the MacDonald men to have been murder and delegated the "committee for the security of the kingdom" to prepare an address to the king which included recommendations for the punishment of the perpetrators of the plot and compensation to be paid to the surviving Macdonalds. As far as is known, these recommendations were never acted upon except for the imprisonment of Lord Breadalbane for a few days in <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> castle because he had opened himself to a charge of high treason.</p>

<p>The Glencoe massacre became a propaganda piece for Jacobite sympathies which were to come to a head in the next generation in the Rising of 1745. In the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_era.html" title="Victorian era">Victorian era</a> interest was revived by historical novelists and artists and romanticised. The massacre became translated from a government action to a clan fight in which - because of Argyll's regiment happening to be involved and with Glenlyon in command, the ancient MacDonald-Campbell rivalry was remembered.</p>
<p>Memory of this massacre has been kept alive by continued ill feeling between Macdonalds and Campbells — in the late <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a> the Clachaig Inn, a hotel and pub in Glencoe popular with climbers, had a sign on its door "<i>No Hawkers or Campbells"</i>.</p>
