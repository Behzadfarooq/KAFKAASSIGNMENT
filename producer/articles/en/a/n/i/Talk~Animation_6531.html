<p>I hate to complain, but this article needs a lot of work. It has obviously not been written by an animator or anyone with sufficient knowledge of the subject. For example, traditional animation is given a single paragraph, while computer animation is makes up the bulk of the article. This hardly seems right given that traditional animation comprises dozens of techniques and has been around for a century, while computer animation has only been around for a few decades. Then there is a number of things in the article that are just plain wrong. Such as saying the the cutout animation found in South Park evolved from drawing and painting and is a new technique. Lastly, there's a complete overlooking of important animation figures such as Cohl, Mesmer, Svankmajer, Avery, Jones and a great deal more. At present this is a poor article. But not to just complain, I will definately lend a hand in fixing up this article at a later date.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, pleae help expand if you can. However, this article is just a starting point - see all the links to other articles such as <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditional_animation.html" title="Traditional animation">traditional animation</a>, the many "see also" links, etc. Isn't it better to keep this general article short and concise, and expand the topics in their own articles? --<a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanke_505b.html" title="User:Janke">Janke</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/n/User_talk%7EJanke_6585.html" title="User talk:Janke">Talk</a> 18:26, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Indeed, you're quite right. Also, the other pages on specific animation topics appear to be pretty excellent. I think now that the page has been reworked it gives a much better overview and makes it easier to find those other pages on specific types of animation. - Patronise, 14:36, 20 October 2006</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/i/Talk%7EAnimation_6531.html" title="Edit section: More comprehensive history">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">More comprehensive history</span></h2>
<p>I thought I would take a stab at outlining a more comprehensive history of animation, since right now this page is just a lump of names with no clear story. I just put down what I thought were key points in the history in some rough historical period, based on my fanatic devotion to the subject. Suggestions and contributions are, of course, extremely welcome.</p>
<p>- Shoehorn</p>
<p>Looks good so far! Animation history is such a vast subject that we might want to consider breaking it into several different sections, each with their own Wikipedia article. Perhaps separate articles for "History of theatrical (movie) animation" and "History of TV animation?"</p>
<p>Do we really have to call the current cartoon revivial a "Renaissance"? I think there's a lot of interesting stuff going on, but I think it is better to say "here's what happened most recently" than to gush about how fantastic shows like, uh, well whatever cartoon-of-the-week you like have brought about a Renaissance. We don't yet have the historical perspective to say this. - Shoehorn----------------------------------------</p>
<p>Well, first of all, the fun of Wikipedia is that you can edit anything you want; if you don't like it, then feel free to change it. And what I've been trying to do is provide <i>examples</i> of the various "important steps" in the history of animation. Steven Spielberg's collaboration with Warner Bros. to make <i>Tiny Toons</i> and <i>Animaniacs</i> was important, because it revitalized Warner Bros.' animation studio. <i>Duck Tales</i> was important, because it paved the way for high-quality animation in TV cartoons, thus escaping the crap of <i>G.I. Joe.</i> And so on, and so on. It's not just the "cartoon of the week;" it's cartoons that have had an effect on the industry, such as <i>The Simpsons</i> and <i>Toy Story</i> and <i>The Little Mermaid.</i></p>

<p>This "History of animation" essay keeps getting bigger and bigger, though I do believe some progress has been made so far. Nevertheless, I am asking for (begging for!) input from the Wikipedia community. These things need editing, especialli in the case of repetitive grammar, inaccurate facts, and the like. Also, I realize that all I've done so far is talk about the history of <i>American</i> animation. What about the history of <i>anime</i> in Japan? Animation in Canada? Animation in England or France? We need some input on Nelvana and the Canadian Film Board, on <i>Danger Mouse,</i> on <i>Asterix and Obelix,</i> on <i>Astro Boy,</i> and on many others! -- <a href="../../../m/o/d/User%7EModemac_38eb.html" title="User:Modemac">Modemac</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>The articles look excellent from my point of view, but the titles will have to change; it is indeed only about American animation and should therefore be called that (or "US animation"), with the "Animation History" section reserved for the history in general, global terms. You could probably lose the "Part &lt;x&gt;" bit if you're worried about the title becoming too long. You could of course also work in the other countries' animation, but they wouldn't necessarily have developed similarly, plus it would become an even longer essay...;) -<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScipius_3475.html" title="User:Scipius">Scipius</a> 01:37 Dec 15, 2002 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am assuming by "actor," you mean <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voice_actor.html" title="Voice actor">voice actor</a>. In that case, it's typically #2; male children are often voiced by adult women, because adult men usually can't get their voice in the right range for a boy. If the production has a decent budget, they will hire actual boys to voice young male characters (see <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lion_King_5b05.html" title="The Lion King">The Lion King</a>, in which young Simba was voiced by <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Taylor_Thomas_ad7a.html" title="Jonathan Taylor Thomas">Jonathan Taylor Thomas</a>, who was thirteen at the time); however, it seems that child labor laws and/or <a href="../../../s/a/g/SAG_ad82.html" title="SAG">SAG</a> rules make it prohibitive to use actual children for productions on a tight schedule and/or low budget. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarrett_Albright_e60b.html" title="User:Garrett Albright">Garrett Albright</a> 07:22, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was right, a list of names was deleted in version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Animation&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=12571084" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Animation&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=12571084" rel="nofollow">oldid=12571084</a> and never restored.

<p>I'm relatively new to Wikipedia, but what the heck is with all the vandalism? Is the subject of animation popular enough that people find it funny, or is this typical with most Wikipedia articles?

<p>This page is getting uglier and uglier - those unwieldy lists of names and studios are really bad looking. <b>Suggestion:</b> How about making separate pages for the lists of animation studios, and notable animators/directors? These lists could then be in a single column, not breaking up every time someone adds a name. We could then link to the lists from this page. Also, the external links should be looked over - there are too many, some go to sites with ads, some to blog pages, etc. Only those really pertinent and helpful should be listed.

<p>This is only one of many good articles on aspects of Animation, all of which tend to be suffering from omissions and duplications, as well as misconceptions over what constitutes CGI for example, as opposed to, computer animation, and whether CGI is a 'film technique'.</p>
<p>I've solved a similar dilemma on other topics by introducing the concept of a '<a href="../../../r/o/o/Wikipedia%7ERoot_page_ba9d.html" title="Wikipedia:Root page">Root page</a>', in this case <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animation.html" title="Animation">Animation</a>, and a hierarchy. I suggest that CGI is computer animation, is animation. If anything, CGI is 'hi-end' computer animation, meaning probably hi-res 3D rather than 2D, but the distinction is disappearing. CGI cannot be a 'film technique' as fully animatied 'movies' like Toy Story are now about to be delivered to cinemas digitally without ever seeing 'film' even as 'videotape'. Avatars and games come 'highest' in the hierarchy, as they involve real-time CGI.</p>
<p>The newcomer to CGI, or to Computer animation, may need to have animation explained, hence the need for hierarchy, with the '<a href="../../../r/o/o/Wikipedia%7ERoot_page_ba9d.html" title="Wikipedia:Root page">Root page</a>' listed at the top of 'see also' and described as such. The Root page should list all key associated pages in the hierarchy first.</p>
<p>I agree with creating separate pages for lists of studios etc. I think I would also create a separate page for the history. There's a tendency with many topics to treat them as history, with too little detail of what they are about --<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELindosland_587d.html" title="User:Lindosland">Lindosland</a> 11:29, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Animation techniques: “Pixar's work is a testament to this. The goal of an animator is not simply to "copy" the real world, but to enhance and to take the essence of the motion that is there, and this is how animation can be elevated to the level of art.” Does anybody else feel that this is a personal opinion? After all the question here is not what is ‘art’ and what is not. Or how to elevate a piece to become art. But what are animation techniques.

<dl>
<dd>well, the first one is made with watercolours I think... there was a rather famous animator in China who used it in the 1960s or 1970s, but I can't recall his name just now... I do know that a special edition DVD was recently released with his works (with English subtitles) to celebrate the man's 80th (maybe 90th?) anniversary. The others are "sand animation" and "oil paint animation".

Here's a reposted record of our conversation that happened at his user page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'd like to know your reasons for thinking why, if someone typed in "<a href="../../../a/n/i/Animated_feature.html" title="Animated feature">animated feature</a>", they'd be looking for a general article on what animation is rather than an article which explains what an animated feature is AND gives a list of them. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 01:07, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But "animated film" and "animated feature" are NOT the same thing! To quote <a href="../../../r/_/_/WP%7ER_3abc.html" title="WP:R">WP:R</a>, <i>"We follow the "principle of least astonishment" — after following a redirect, the reader's first question is likely to be: "hang on ... I wanted to read about this. Why has the link taken me to that?". Make it clear to the reader that they have arrived in the right place."</i> The point of a redirect should be so that the reader finds the information that he is looking for as quickly as possible. If a reader enters in "animated film", the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animation.html" title="Animation">animation</a> page is the page that will answer his questions the quickest. If he enters in "animated feature", he is obviously looking for information on animated <i>feature</i> films, not just <i>any</i> animated films, and probably a list of them too. In that case, the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_animated_feature_films.html" title="List of animated feature films">List of animated feature films</a> is much more appropriate. The "animation" page doesn't even describe what an animated feature film IS, and the only thing someone who is looking for that information could do is click on the "list of animated feature films" link at the bottom of the article. Isn't this terribly inefficient? <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 21:13, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Who the heck changed this section? Why did they not keep the same divisions as existed before? Everything is a mess now. There are THREE main types of animation: traditional, stop motion and computer. These are further subdivided into many different sections (for example, <a href="../../../c/u/t/Cutout_animation.html" title="Cutout animation">cutout animation</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clay_animation.html" title="Clay animation">clay animation</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/p/Puppet_animation.html" title="Puppet animation">puppet animation</a> are all types of stop motion animation). Then there are a few other types which do not fit into those categories: <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sand_animation.html" title="Sand animation">sand animation</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/r/Direct_animation.html" title="Direct animation">direct animation</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/i/Paint-on-glass_animation.html" title="Paint-on-glass animation">paint-on-glass animation</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinscreen_animation.html" title="Pinscreen animation">pinscreen animation</a>. Now, there is no sense or order at all, and there is a long list under "other approaches" which is just a big glut of seemingly random links that nobody will ever click (and many of them are listed several times). In fact, I am tempted to think that this article has been vandalized.</p>
<p>This cannot stay. By all means expand the sections on the types of animation, but don't throw order out the window! <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 01:32, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

But we must look at the Oct.19 edit and see in what ways it was better, because some good things were changed. Perhaps it's a good thing to describe the different animation types on the main page, but on the other hand maybe we should ALSO bring the old "styles and techniques of animation" section back, because it made finding things a lot easier. It was only a collection of links, but it was a well-organized one - certainly better-organized than the current collection of links. Anyway... I'll see if I can make things a little better... though I'm kinda busy over the next few days, really. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 09:33, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, I've changed it so that it is at least somewhat organized and more clear which types are subcategories of other types. I'm not sure if it's better this way. I had to remove the "further information" links because they took up too much space, and the headings are now the links. Again, I don't know if this is the best solution... but I do think that it's better than what was there before.

<p>Should the animated short from 1974 called Hunger (by Peter Foldes) be called traditional animation or computer animation, or does it belongs in a category on its own? "In 1974, the first computer animated film called Hunger was produced by Rene Jodoin, and directed and animated by Peter Foldes. This effort was a 2 1/2 D system that depended heavily on object interpolation techniques."</p>
<p>There is also another version of sand animation that I once saw. Instead of using backlight, they are filming it from above, and adding sand in different colors to make it more cartoony. It reminds most about paint-on-glass animation, where wet paint is replaced with sand. Another version I have heard about is to use soft plasticine instead of paint. I guess there is many alternatives and possibilities when it comes to this form of animation. 217.68.114.116 08:25, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I suggest a new page listing animation genres for links that don't discuss animation technology or historical breakthroughs. The <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adult_animation.html" title="Adult animation">adult animation</a> link in the "see also" section would be an example of an animation genre. Otherwise, people will just keep listing animation genres here and the article will get diluted with subjective trendy personal taste issues instead of appreciation for the overall art of animation. The new animation genres could be included in the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genre.html" title="Genre">genres</a> page on the wikipedia. <a href="../../../o/i/c/User%7EOicumayberight_a327.html" title="User:Oicumayberight">Oicumayberight</a> 19:55, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the attempt to create an all encompassing list of animation techniques in the main article exceeds the scope needed for an informative and effective article. It makes the article seem disorganized and choatic. However, I am not suggesting that we throw them out altogether. My proposal is that we revert back to a basic summary of the three major types of animation and a fourth grouping for combined technique. A more comprehensize list of animation techniques will be formed as its own page with links to appropriate wikipedia articles. Any thoughts? --CFiorello 20:07, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Your proposal has merit... however, would it not mean perhaps creating too many sub-pages? There would be a separate page for the "types of animation", and in turn each type of animation would also have a dedicated page. What would the "types of animation" page look like - would it be merely a list? Anyway, if it is done, I believe that the summary on this page should be very short but shouldn't be misleading or leave crucial information out (for example, it should say that while traditional, 3D and stop-motion are the major categories, there are also other techniques outside of those categories which are used less often as well as combinations of techniques).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, something just struck me. If we put the techniques information in a separate article, <i>this</i> article will be a short one indeed, since both of its major sections will be summaries of longer articles. I'm not sure if this is a bad thing, just pointing it out. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 20:46, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I hate to be critical over this Wiki animation page, but saying that there is no one creator is all wrong. Stuart Blackton experimented with the old cameras and cartoon pictures by making them on a chalkboard, making the pictures look as if they were moving. The name of the feature was, <i>"Humorous Faces of Funny Faces"</i> Wasn't that the first? 134.241.194.133 20:02, 3 February 2007 (UTC)Grandkaioshin</p>
