<dd>Which makes them much like many other people. It eoulfd be highly desireable to footnote or otehrwise reference this article better, IMO, and to clariofy the useage of words like "belived". If you like, if you provide the facts i will do the footnote formatting. Or you can do both if you prefer. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 19:21, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I'll put the cites in the references section, and you can footnote the article. The newletters don't have versions and they are written in Syllabary (most folks can't read them probably). But there is some english text in them that headline events.

<p>The information regarding the AniKutani is interesting however I see no point of reference. As a Keetoowah person and Historian, I would like to point out an historic reference that places the "Destruction" of the anikutani beginning in 1760. A trader- John Long- (Journal available) notes the morning mist brought with it an attack on the town he was residing in, (Chestua), rabbit town, a Yuchee/Cherokee town, and the "Cherokee" warriors swept through the town destroying the "priest" etc. This coincides with oral history in my family that indicates that the Christian Cherokees (ofthe newly reorganized Cherokee lower towns Government), began destroying any and all AniKutani throughout Cherokee country. Further, that the AniKutani (phonetic- Ani K'u tani--meaning of high knowledge) were also seen among other nations e.g. Iroquois, Algonquians -Muskogee etc and known to those as Inihi- Micco etc. My family record also states re Cherokee that Cherokee is not as is assumed, of Muskogee language derivation but is, from- Cheriaki anhaka, and Cheriaki targhe (Variously seen in early Spanish Journals), freely understood- (those of) the Fire. Acherra is the Keetoowah reference for Fire as is also Ocherra in Mohawk, (a related language). Three things must occur in placing a "word/ term", A. Location- (geographic) B. Time-and C. Intent. Asseen in Traditional records ofthe related Nations, Cayuga, Mohawk, Onondaga, Senneca, Oneida, (and Wyandotte), the "Cherokee" were traditionaly known and freely refered to by all surrounding Native Nations as the "People of the Fire". In the case of Cheriaki anhaka, the reference is originally to the Central Fire. The location of the Central / Principal seat-Fire of the Cherokee. This location is seen on a British War department map -c. 1755 The map is "The British Colonies in America": and clearly shows the great Ohio Valley region and the Appalachians and specifically the Cumberland’s of E Kentucky. Along the Cumberland’s is written "Ouscioto Mountains". Ouscioto is translated as Was Cherra Oto. Understood as (the) Central Fire. Oscioto being an adapted British form of Wascherra oto. More literally it is aWasCherra- (primary/ core/ Fire- and Oto "Lodge". Various references of the Lene Lenape circa 13-1500's identify this geographic as the center of the Alligewi (a term used by Lenepes to define those of the cave country) The Keetoowah. Time (C13-1400s &amp; 1755) Geography-Map Cumberland’s -and Intent-the "intention of the term as a describer of (a) central Fire all come together to define Ouscito as the ancient (pre 1492) central home/ fire of the body later known commonly as Cherokee. That this body was (over a 350 year period C.1300s to 1600s,) driven from the central home lands to more southern reaches by a combined Wyandotte and Lene Lenape push from the North, seems to escaped the notice of contemporary history. Also not seen is any indication that any descendants of AniKutani survive, and I assure you, they do. Staiyu', Wahya, AniKituwagi.</p>

<p>The citations regarding the killing of men, women and children are disputable. While Cherokee priests may have killed men, women and children, there is no reliable record of these killings. The legends were probably stories exaggerated by European settlers whose racism, cultural dominance and ignorance of the native population lead ultimately to their demise. No full-blooded Cherokee live today; even the tribal elders are 50% or less Cherokee blood. The stories are shrouded in mystery; their origins, as well, seem to lack precise citation in this article.</p>

<p>There is simply no convincing evidence as to the truth of this article. Stories about a pre-Sequoyah writing system, for instance, are not supported by any serious scientific evidence.</p>
<p>Much of this sounds like "New Age" revisionism of traditional Cherokee culture.</p>

<p>For the "claimed historians" the preceeding sections on this talk page demonstrate A) the person commenting is not a Native Speaker of Cherokee. (Wahya is not spelled this way in phonetics or syllabary) and B) they have little or no contact with the Aniyvwiya or Cherokee Society and are quoting out of the same inaccurate books (which do not even mention the AniKutani). There are sections on Cherokee Mythology listed here and the existence of this mythology is verifiable and meets WP:RS and is accurate.</p>
<p>I do agree that the comments about baby killing are unsourced -- and have been removed. TsiGeGa 23:37, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would say that this article is a "New Age" hoax and distortion of a Cherokee myth or legend. It appears that the distortion is driven by a desire to high jack the Cherokee. Also are there any state or federal recognized cherokee tribes in the state of Missouri? Just asking. I have added to this article what I can validate from the Cherokee history written by James Mooney., <a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELoveMonkey_2979.html" title="User:LoveMonkey">LoveMonkey</a> 04:37, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
