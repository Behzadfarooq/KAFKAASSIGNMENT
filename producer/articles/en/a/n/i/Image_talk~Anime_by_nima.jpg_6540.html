<div style="border: 1px solid #aaaaaa; background-color: #fff; margin: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2em; padding: .2em;">A “derivative work” is a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. A work consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship, is a “derivative work”.</div>
Fan art is most certainly a "form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted"; the image in question is based on various copyrighted works featuring the character.
<p>It absolutely does <i>not</i> have to be a "close copy", it just has to be based (even loosely) on the works, which it is. See, for instance, <i>Dr. Seuss Enterprises, L.P. v. Penguin Books USA, Inc.</i>: the work in question was just based on Dr. Seuss's style, not anything resembling a close copy of any particular work, and it was found to be without question a derivative work; the only point of contention was whether it was valid fair use as parody (it wasn't). Even loose derivation is sufficient to constitute a derivative work. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 03:13, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It doesn't have to be a copy of anything specific. It needs to be based on a general idea or style, or (in this case) a specific character. That's sufficient. I mentioned <i>Dr. Seuss v. Penguin</i> above; let's add <i><a href="../../../s/t/e/Steinberg_v._Columbia_Pictures_Industries%2C_Inc._f5fb.html" title="Steinberg v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.">Steinberg v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.</a></i>, where someone who copied the <i>general idea</i> of a work was found to be infringing copyright.
<div style="border: 1px solid #aaaaaa; background-color: #fff; margin: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2em; padding: .2em;">The definition of "substantial similarity" in this circuit is "whether an average lay observer would recognize the alleged copy as having been appropriated from the copyrighted work."&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.
<p>.&#160;.&#160;. it is now recognized that "the copying need not be of every detail so long as the copy is substantially similar to the copyrighted work."&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>
<p>Defendants argue that their poster could not infringe plaintiff's copyright because only a small proportion of its design could possibly be considered similar. This argument is both factually and legally without merit. "[A] copyright infringement may occur by reason of a substantial similarity that involves only a small portion of each work."&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is generally recognized that ".&#160;.&#160;.&#160;since a very high degree of similarity is required in order to dispense with proof of access, it must logically follow that where proof of access is offered, the required degree of similarity may be somewhat less than would be necessary in the absence of such proof."&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>
</div>
No one makes fan art without having watched the show or whatever; proof of access is indisputable. If the work depicts a character from an anime show such that the character is recognizable as being the same, obviously the copying work must be somewhat similar—otherwise the copied character wouldn't be recognizable as the same. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 03:43, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jayjg, copyright issues here are generally not resolved by copyright lawyers, as you should know. If you can find one, good, go ahead, but I've just quoted the US Code and case law and you've responded with nothing. And the idea that Wikipedians who happened to arrive here via IRC rather than, say, <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> or <a href="../../../p/u/i/WP%7EPUI_d69d.html" title="WP:PUI">WP:PUI</a> are somehow an irritant or unjust is completely ridiculous. Contributors' actions outside Wikipedia are also completely irrelevant.
<p>Are you willing to discuss the underlying copyright issue or will you continue to just call us names and accuse us of various not related to the copyright status of this image? —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 03:43, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

As for the "strong claim", the person who <i>created</i> this work, handpainted it, in fact, a work which is <i>not identical to any other work</i>, has released it for use, yet some here are still claiming that it is a copyright violation.

<p>In my opinion, this image is either a derivative of the original (as linked above), or falls just short of being considered derivative. The picture elements are identical to the original (aside from a mirror reflection); the only differences are in the color of the hair and of the dress, and in the background. The only mitigation is that it's manga/anime, which is so formulaic that <b>all</b> of it could be argued as derivative. Given that this image serves no encyclopedic purpose, I must recommend that it be deleted. While I am not a copyright attorney, I am rather more clueful about copyright than most others on Wikipedia, having actually taken the time to study it. If you don't like my opinion, take it to Brad Patrick and let him decide.</p>
<p>As to all the yammering above about IRC and enemies and what not: Enough. There is a legitimate issue here, and trying to divert that by discussing personalities is both unhelpful and uncivil.

<dd>I'm doing fine managing myself; just wondering whether there's any point in continuing with this project. Some sort of symbiosis seems to have developed between IRC and Wikipedia Review, with Mistress Selina Kyle and Blu Aardvark both posting to IRC and having a bureaucrat unblock them, days after Snowspinner is reported to the police, private images of you are posted, someone tries to lose Kate her job, Tony's sexuality is discussed, and I am called a c*** for the 500th time, on a website they are both responsible for. Then an image on my user page by Zereshk is threatened with deletion (again!) by someone who posts both to IRC and Wikipedia Review, and who has previously supported Wikitruth and the LaRouchies; and then other IRC people turn up to help. LOL!! I can surely be forgiven for wondering whether this really still is a project to build an encyclopedia, or whether it has at last buckled under the weight of the lunatics and trolls. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 04:52, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Copyright violations. I don't like them. That's why. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 05:32, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>An innocuous, non-commerical image, that <i>just may</i> be a copyvio, used on one user's page. The response is out of proportion to the issue. Clearly there's something more going on here, and it's transparent what it is. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 05:43, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A little too opaque for me, alas. Perhaps we use a different kind of transparency in Godzone; to better protect us from the stronger rays of the Sun, perhaps? Who can say? Please don't just <i>hint</i> at these things: if you want to say something nasty, either <i>say it</i>, or <i>keep your mouth shut</i>. This sort of vagueness serves nobody. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">befuddle me!</a>) 06:03, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Innocuousness is irrelevant to copyvios. Non-commerciality is irrelevant, because commercial providers must be able to rehost our content (including userpages). The response to this copyvio was to try recategorizing it, then to discuss the issue on the talk page, and mention it on IRC.
<p>I personally strongly believe in copyright law, and strongly believe that Wikipedia needs to be <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libre.html" title="Libre">free</a>. I had little to nothing against SlimVirgin prior to this incident; as a review of my edit history will show, I routinely list even "innocuous" copyvios for deletion, and this is no exception. I can't speak for Ashibaka, but SlimVirgin's repeated accusations of grudges with no evidence presented to back them up, combined with disparaging remarks directed at all IRC users, statements that Ashibaka was "attack"ing her, insinuations regarding Ashibaka's contributions to other sites, and accusations of trolling, when Ashibaka has not made a single statement in any way derogatory toward SlimVirgin or anyone else except insofar as stating that things like "If you continue to post about it, I'll assume it's trolling" violate Wikipedia guidelines . . . all that makes me consider it very unlikely that Ashibaka is the one in the wrong.</p>
<p>Regardless, motives are quite simply irrelevant. Ashibaka, for whatever reason, brought up a legitimate copyright question. Even if he did that just to cause trouble for SlimVirgin, given that the question was not groundless, the project is benefited by it. Far better to bring up legitimate issues out of spite than to act illegitimately when wronged. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 06:06, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The request was made on IRC, as noted above; it tends to generate interest. (And to take on a life of its own, beyond whatever the original dispute may have been.) As to why Soufron is interested, Jay stated above that no one here was a copyright lawyer. Soufron is, in addition to being a WMF legal officer; if anyone can state a position here that all sides would be expected to accept (and for the love of Pete to please bring this argument to an end as soon as possible), he can, and so I asked his opinion.</dd>
