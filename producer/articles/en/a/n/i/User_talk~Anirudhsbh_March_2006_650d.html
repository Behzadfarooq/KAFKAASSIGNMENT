<p>Hi. With what do you need help? --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 04:40, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi there. I didnt know that Wikipedia had users who'd respond this fast. I had only placed the tag a few moments ago.</p>
<p>The problem is that: I am using Mozilla Firefox. There is a tool available on the Wikipedia portal itself which can be downloaded and used as an add-on with this browser. I have the latest version of Mozilla that is not compatible to the toolbar (which seemingly requires an older version). Can you tell me what I should do?</p>
<p>Maybe, I would just need to learn the tags all by myself, by browsing through pages and viewing their sources.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnirudhsbh_d34a.html" title="User:Anirudhsbh">Anirudh</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>If we're talking about the same Wikipedia Toolbar, I'm afraid there's not an official version that works with FireFox v1.5 yet. But there is a test/preview version, which you can download here: <a href="http://wikipedia.mozdev.org/history.html" class="external free" title="http://wikipedia.mozdev.org/history.html" rel="nofollow">http://wikipedia.mozdev.org/history.html</a>. It may have some bugs. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 04:50, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thanks. And more, if you could tell me, why arent all the tags that I have placed in my babel not appearing on my page?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I went ahead and fixed it, it's probably just easier to look at what I did. You need to use a specific babel template based on how many boxes you're using. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 05:08, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>How do I sort out the babel at the bottom of the page? It does not seem to be in order...</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hello, Anirudhsbh, I think I fixed the problem with your userboxes. You can look at the code and see how to do the wiki-table that I put them in. I removed the {{helpme}} request for now, but let us know if there's anything else you have trouble with. — <b><i><a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture__f15d.html" title="User:Freakofnurture/"><font color="#006000" title="User:Freakofnurture">F<small>REAK OF</small> N<small>UR<sub>x</sub>TURE</small></font></a></i> <small>(<span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#006000" title="User talk:Freakofnurture">TALK</font></a></span>)</small></b> <small>07:59, Jan. 30, 2006</small></dd>

<p>"If some of the content of a page really is an infringement, then the infringing content should be removed, and a note to that effect should be made on the talk page, along with the original source. If the author's permission is obtained later, the text can be restored."</p>
<p>i don't think we should be copy/pasting a whole section of the article on ahmedabad from the gujarat goverment website. the whole section just read like an advertisement.. so i removed it.</p>
<p>regarding copyright paranoia - i think the following comment in that same page sums up my views to this issue - "Quotation, even without attribution, is specifically allowed in international copyright law, and single sentences are generally not protectable." Not protectable, but taking sentences verbatim, or lengthy unattributed paraphrase, is for better or for worse considered academic dishonesty of the first degree and often punished with the academic equivalent of the death penalty. While I don't think we should delete entire articles that such material is inserted into, it would be extremely bad for the project's credibility to tolerate these to remain. --w:User:NTK</p>
<p>i still think that we should rewrite the section (copyright or no copyright), or make a separate article on the sabarmati river front project.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Query about citations</span></h2>
<p>Dear Phroziac,</p>
<p>This is Andy123. I was talking to you on <a href="irc://irc.freenode.org/wikipedia" class="external text" title="irc://irc.freenode.org/wikipedia" rel="nofollow">#wikipedia</a> the other day. I have a query.</p>
<p>It is about citations. Some controversial articles to which NPOV standards are rather difficult to achieve might require <i>many</i> citations and authorities from various sources over the internet. Is it necessary that the links be placed on the page of the article itself? I think that would be a degrading thing to do with the format. The external links should be placed at the bottom of the page, if they can justify the content of the article. I will be watching this page, so please reply here. If you can, then reply on my discussion page as well.</p>
<p>There were some templates on my page that are not been displayed at all.</p>
<p>Template user agnostic and Template user evolution Can you tell me what happened to them?</p>

<dd>I put a blank picture just to indicate that we had no picture, and it would be better if someone could put a picture there. The problem is that all the pictures on the government of india site are copyright of the government of india. They do not fall under the right to info act. Only pictures of the government taken before 50 years fall under the indian public domain! So, I thought I would put a blank picture till we get a better photo.

<p>What you have explained here is not quite justifiable. I would like you to rethink upon it. Is there any policy on Wikipedia about it? You could have definately mentioned about the requirement of a picture on the talk page. Technically, placing a blank picture does not have a stand here. Read <a href="../../../i/u/p/WP%7EIUP_e163.html" title="WP:IUP">WP:IUP</a> for details (nothing of the sort you are talking about exists on the page). Moreover, a blank picture taking up space on an encyclopedia article looks extremely unprofessional. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnirudhsbh_d34a.html" title="User:Anirudhsbh">Andy123</a> 16:18, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Lok Sabha website does not come under the GFDL policies of Wikipedia.

The images have to be of low resolution, and used only for depiction, this would qualify for fair usage on Wikipedia.

<dd>Keep in mind that you are creating only stubs and not full length articles on Wikipedia. Such tags should be placed when the article has grown to some extent. Because the templates would only add up to the space on the page, when there is not much given about the person in the article. There are lots and lots of stubs on Wikipedia like these, and they would be quite difficult to manage if you place such templates on the whole lot of them. Furthermore, I would always suggest that you use the templates rather than images uploaded by users for such purpose. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnirudhsbh_d34a.html" title="User:Anirudhsbh">Andy123</a> 16:57, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi!

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Want to help</span></h2>
<p>Anirudh: You might visit my user page for information about me and my views. I have time and I want to help. You may contact me by e-mail or through my page. One problem. Hindu, Hinduism and Hindu Portal pages, the three pages that I have visited, say that Hinduism is based on Aryan/Vedic beliefs. As I mention on my user page, this is a deep fallacy, and only pleases the Arya Samajis or the Smartas. I also believe that Aryans were immigrants to India. I think the indigenous beliefs (Shiva and Vishnu) are being disregarded. This would delight only the Christians and Muslims, and will cause deep sorrow to all who do not think they have Aryan descent. Changes made by me were reverted. Would you please have a look? I sorta like heavy stuff, religion, sociology, culture; no light stuff and no wavering from my subjects.</p>

<dd>I personally have the Aryan/Vedic beliefs and that the Aryans came from Central Asia and settled into India, so I might not be the right person to look into this matter. However, if you can source and cite your edits with appropriate discussions on the talk page (read WP:CITE and WP:NOR policies of Wikipedia) of the relevant articles, things might work out for you. The other thing that you might do is, refer to the Arbitration Committee. --<b>Andy123</b> 12:11, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bhog</span></h2>
<p>Hi Andy, Thanks for your message and kind words. I was not aware that <a href="../../../b/h/o/Bhog.html" title="Bhog">Bhog</a> has links to the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> religion - but unfortunately, I am no expert on <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>! I have read the article and although it is 90% correct, there are a few facts that do appear totally correct:</p>
<p>1. The Akhand Paath has to take place over 2 days ie 48 hours. I have never seen any great flexibility on this timing – so where you say "…an uninterrupted and complete reading of the book. This usually takes days to complete through a relay of readers who work round-the-clock to come to its end.", I think the timing of 48 hours needs to be introduced.</p>
<p>2. You say "The Karah Prasad that is distributed at the end of any congregational service might also be termed as 'Bhog'" – I don't think this is totally correct. The Karah Prasad may undergo 'Bhog' but it is not itself termed 'Bhog'</p>
<p>3. I prefer to use the word "Paath" as this is more nearer the true pronunciation and also because this distinguishes this word from the English word "Path".</p>
<p>If you wish I will have a go at putting this right?? I hope this helps. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarisingh_c8a5.html" title="User:Harisingh">Hari Singh</a> 14:05, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

I completely trust you when you talk about your transformation, like hundreds of other Indian users. In three months time, you can try again and see the change in your RfA. It would be even better if you can join the other Wikipedians for common discussions over <a href="../../../i/r/c/IRC_b274.html" title="IRC">IRC</a>. <a href="irc://www.freenode.org/wikipedia" class="external text" title="irc://www.freenode.org/wikipedia" rel="nofollow">#wikipedia</a> --<b><a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnirudhsbh_d34a.html" title="User:Anirudhsbh"><font color="#E32636">Andy123</font></a></b><small><a href="../../../a/n/i/User_talk%7EAnirudhsbh_aeab.html" title="User talk:Anirudhsbh"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a></small> 08:36, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The block is nit coming from 172's long-expired block, but rather it's a an autobock, a side-effect of a recent block of mine. Which wouldn't show up in the block logs for the IP, and which is why it is important that when reporting htese instances of collateral damage we get all the information. Usually, we'd need the block message, something like "This IP is blocked because it was recently used by User:X. X was blocked because of 'YYY...'". In fact I'm fairly which block it is in this case, my only recent one for spamming, but that should be expired now too. Autoblocks are always for 24 hours. My block was many days ago. It ought to be unblocked by now. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 07:57, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would love to join the IRC. But I have never used it in my life! Right now I tried ti connect but "failed to connect to server", says the application. I will join later.</dd>
<dd>BTW, yes you have pointed out correctly. Thank you. <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonagachi.html" title="Sonagachi">Sonagachi</a> will be mentioned in <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolkata.html" title="Kolkata">Kolkata</a>, probably in the "Demographics". Thanks a lot for pointing out. It just never occured to us, though Sonagachi is listed there in the Kolkata-related artiocles template in the "See also" section of Kolkata. Thanks.
