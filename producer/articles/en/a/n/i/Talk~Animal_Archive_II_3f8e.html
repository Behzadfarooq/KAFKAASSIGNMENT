<p>User 142.151.177.134, please stop repeatedly changing the article to insert your point of view that humans are not animals. That you have tried it at least seven times, and each time your changes are quickly removed (by different people, too) should indicate that the Wikipedia community does not agree with your unusual point of view. Granted, the people I know are not necessarily representative, but I do not believe I have ever met someone who does not consider human beings to be animals. Also, I feel I must point out that the reason you give for these changes, <i>heresy</i> (defined by <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=heresy&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" class="external text" title="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=heresy&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" rel="nofollow">Merriam-Webster</a> to be "adherence to a religious opinion contrary to church dogma"), is <i>not</i> ground for removing or changing information. In fact, this clearly indicates a non-neutral point of view, as saying one is removing heretical material is tantamount to saying one is removing it because it does not conform to church beliefs, or specific point of view. Furthermore, much of the information in Wikipedia was once considered heresy (that the Earth is approximately spherical, that it revolves around the sun, that the laws of physics apply both to the heavens and to the Earth, and so on).</p>
<p>If even after reading this and carefully considering your own viewpoints you still very strongly about this, please discuss it here. As you can see, if you just make these sorts of changes without discussion or agreement, they will be reversed every time. I believe the article already represents the "nonhuman animal" category adequately when it mentions that colloquially people may use the term to mean nonhuman animals. Finally, I would like to point out Merriam-Webster's <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=+animal&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" class="external text" title="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=+animal&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" rel="nofollow">definition</a> of animal. The primary (1) definition is "<b>any of a kingdom (Animalia) of living things including many-celled organisms and often many of the single-celled ones (as protozoans) that typically differ from plants in having cells without cellulose walls, in lacking chlorophyll and the capacity for photosynthesis, in requiring more complex food materials (as proteins), in being organized to a greater degree of complexity, and in having the capacity for spontaneous movement and rapid motor responses to stimulation</b>," which of course is how the article treats it. The secondary (2a) definition listed is "<b>one of the lower animals as distinguished from human</b>", which is also mentioned in the article, and indeed the definition itself uses the word "animal" with the meaning given in its primary definition. (The remainder of the definitions, which you are free to peruse, are not relevant to this discussion.) — [[User:Knowledge Seeker|<a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker দ</a> (<a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">talk</a>)]] 21:17, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I completely agree that humans are animals, but see no reason why it should be explicitly stated in the first paragraph of the article. Objectively, this is no different from stating that horses or jellyfish are animals in the first paragraph, which is not what the introduction is for. I'll remove it, but if it comes back, I'll consider myself outvoted.</dd>

<dd>On the use of the word animal, it does vary from not meaning human, but I don't see this as a religious issue outside of fanatacism. The true origins of this distinction is in management, when you are dealing with humans you do different things than when dealing with almost any other animal. For instance, to reduce a population of an animal, it is best to open a hunting season if it is a large enough animal to be sporting to kill. The <i>cause</i> of the linguistic removal of humans from animals is instances like the above, not that people have souls or that people have dominion over the other animals. It isn't that someone heard the hebrew creation story, then thought to themselves 'well, if humans were made the day after animals, I'd better call them different things." Similarly, the soul or religion is not the cause of the difference between human children and animal offspring, or human food and animal <i>feed</i>. Actually, a big cause of this non-human definition of animal is that animal is an insult. A person who is an animal is crazed, if this meaning weren't attatched, maybe people wouldn't have such a problem with it. In any case, I can hardly see the sources written in the article as actual causes for why people say animal and don't mean to include humans.</dd>

<p>It's not just anon's point of view, but is widely held. I have therefore attributed it to "most people".

<p>I changed it to "many", pending evidence like a survey.</p>
<ul>
<li>While many people view animals as being distinct from human beings (see <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wildlife.html" title="Wildlife">wildlife</a>), biologists classify humans as <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mammal.html" title="Mammal">Mammals</a> and thus consider them part of the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_kingdom.html" title="Animal kingdom">animal kingdom</a> (see also <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_rights.html" title="Animal rights">animal rights</a>). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Animal&amp;diff=68624166&amp;oldid=68336536" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Animal&amp;diff=68624166&amp;oldid=68336536" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>

<dd>Hullo. The second sentence in the second paragraph didn't make grammatical sense and was heavily edited. Subsequent sentences were removed and it was all nicely synthesised and referenced to the Oxford English Dictionary. The third paragraph is redundant (given the first) and was removed. Also, humans are animals. It's just a fact. Our biochemistry is so remarkably similar to apes and, well, all other mammals, marsupials and monotremes that to think otherwise is so religious-fundamentalist as to be laughable. There is, though a need for a definition of the term which would exclude humans. The place you'd find this would be in wiktionary. If there remains disagreement, might I suggest offended religious sorts consult _any_ reputable encyclopedia. You could always check out <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humans.html" title="Humans">humans</a> - there's the full scientific name. --<a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMenswear_0290.html" title="User:Menswear">Menswear</a> 14:59, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>There seems to be an emerging consensus within the scientific community that we should reject the philosophical outlook that says humans are ‘categorically superior’ to animals. <a href="http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/article/355/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/article/355/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If this point of view is "emerging" and has yet to become a "consensus" (even within the scientific community), then clearly it's at odds with the viewpoints of many other people.</p>
<p>There's at least one researcher who opposes that outlook:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘I believe that animal research is morally justified because animals are less valuable than human beings.’ John Martin, Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at University College London (UCL), does not mince his words. [ibid]]</li>
</ul>
<p>So we should mention the dispute, rather than asserting that humans are animals. Perhaps a compromise is to say that biologists look only at the body and deliberately ignore the soul. Either to assert that we don't have souls, or more likely to assert that studying the soul (even if it exists) is beyond the bounds of biology. The bounds they've set for themselves.</p>
<p>These leads, of course to related Life Sciences like psychology. Not all schools of thought within psychology deny or exclude the soul.</p>
<p>Can we get a conversation going on this? --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 20:20, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This article should not have this kind of information in it. If we include some people's POV on what constitutes an animal, then we have to include everyone's.

<p>I don't see why being considered better or having more rights necessarily requires humans to be considered as separate from other animals. The humans race at large treats <a href="../../../f/e/l/Felis_silvestris_catus.html" title="Felis silvestris catus">felis silvestris catus</a> significantly better than <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musca_domestica.html" title="Musca domestica">musca domestica</a>, even though both are animals. (Pro-vertebrate bias? Dunno. Doesn't matter.) It is similarly not a contradiction to have a moral system which views <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homo_sapiens.html" title="Homo sapiens">homo sapiens</a> as significantly superior while still considering them animals. -- Milo</p>
<p>From a strictly scientific point of view, human beings are in fact animals.We share the same physiological systems as the mammals and we are driven by the same kinds of needs on a very basic level (such as gathering food and water, and reproducing). My belief is that all animals have adaptations, but most are physical rather than mental adaptations. Homo sapiens large brains, allow them to process cognitive thoughts well above that of any other species. It is this level of cognition which causes us to "think" that we are better than animals when in fact we share exactly the same fates. Many human beings could well be described as animals themselves, so the differences are not that great. - Ummagumma23</p>

<p>The statement that humans are animals is highly controversial and must be erased. It tramples upon religious people's dignity. Their holy scripture says God created the first humans on a different day from animals and the Father explicitly gave Adam authority over all animals in the world. The Bible explicitly said Sodoma and Gomorra residents were all exterminated for having sex with beasts, thus JHWH showed human and animal cannot mix.</p>
<p>Also Karl Marx, the great communist philosopher said humans are differentiated from animals by the means of "work, ability to think and the ability to speak".</p>
<p>I also find it troubling that no mention is made of creationism is this article, unlike evolution. Whatever you think about those religios fanatics in the U.S. mid-west, Wikipedia is supposed to have a neutral point of view. (Btw, which is silly, e.g. what about Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol-Pot articles).</p>

<dd>Hello, anonymous,</dd>
<dd>So maybe we can move humans into a <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plant.html" title="Plant">Plant</a> or a <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bacteria.html" title="Bacteria">Bacteria</a> article, maybe that will sattisfy all JHWH's and make them happy.

<p>I think it is the animals that should be offended by having humans included in the animal kingdom. I don't recall any wars waged by religous zelots, except humans. Maybe that can be the true differentiator between human and animal - the ability (or willingness) to kill the same species for a difference in philosophical thinking.</p>

<dd>I think it's disrespectful to disregard the hard work of taxonomists just trying to make sense of all the species. Animal is not an insult, while there are differences between humans and the rest of the animals, it's important for us to know that we breathe oxygen, we react to pain, and all other attributes of humans physically not related to our souls. Also, the inclusion of creationism is skewed to the American point of veiw. It wouldn't be neutral and would be unfair to all of the Christians from the rest of the world that are suddenly being accused of being antagonistic to paleoarcheology on account of a few people in the United States.</dd>

<dd>It has nothing to do with evolution vs. creation. If creationism is true, humans are not animals and if evolution is true, humans are still not animals. "animal" by definition refers to nonhumans in the kingdom "Animalia". Despite what biologists say, that's the common usage of the term. Saying that humans are animals is no more of a fact than saying that Japanese people are caucasion. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelicoptor_5a03.html" title="User:Helicoptor">Helicoptor</a> 00:53, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Common usage of the term and the scientific usage are NOT THE SAME. That's all there is to it! Why must you go on to say that one is more valid than the other? The fact of the matter is that when biologists say "animal", their definition includes humans as well as insects. When most non-scientists say "animal", the definition usually does NOT include humans or insects. As I said below, it helps if you think of them as two different words that just happen to sound the same. It would be interesting to find out how the scientific and the common definitions diverged, but that is a matter for linguists, not me. Perhaps if someone can find out, it would be a usefull thing to mention in the article. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 01:19, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All of your alleged "controversies" are only controversial among religious people who don't know a thing about science or how science works. The scientific consensus has long-ago been reached. Furthermore, the definition of "animals" that the Bible uses is different from the definition that "scientists" use; that's all there is to it. When the Bible uses it it means "every living thing except humans and plants", whereas today's scientific definition is somewhat different and is explained in the article. It may help if you think of them as different words that just happen to sound the same. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 16:25, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is <i><b>not</b></i> highly controversial. This sort of thing the same reason the userboxes have changed from "This user is an atheist" into "This user is interested in atheism". It's all political correctness. Scientists all agree that humans are animals - how can anyone not agree? - and as far as I'm concerned, it is a fact and so belongs in this encyclopedia.

Several recent papers have supported the existence of the Ecdysozoa, but other recent papers have refuted its existence as a real group of closely related animals (favouring instead the Coelomata hypothesis, which implies a completely different relationship between the major animal groups).

<dd>Animals grow by indirectly using the energy of sunlight. Plants use this energy to turn air into simple sugars using a process known as photosynthesis. These sugars are then used as the building blocks which allow the plant to grow. When animals eat these plants (or eat other animals which have eaten plants), the sugars produced by the plant are used by the animal. They are either used directly to help the animal grow, or broken down, releasing stored solar energy, and giving the animal the energy required for motion. This process is known as glycolysis.</dd>

<p>Biologically animal, I don't think anyone can disagree that humans are biologically (genetically) animal. But it is true though, that when we refer to animals very often, we mean to say others except humans. I think this is where the conflict arises, there doesn't seem to be a contradiction in term of biology but rather the uses of the term 'animal.' We often use that term do differenciate the animal kingdom from us. The solution I think would be to clarify and say that 'while humans biologically are animals, we often exclude them when we use that term.' I don't think anyone would disagree with this.
