<p><i>The game does not utilize the Gamecube's clock, contrary to popular belief, instead having its own clock independent of the Gamecube's. However, it is possible to adjust this clock in what is called "time travelling" by players of the game.</i> Later in article: <i>Animal Crossing uses the GameCube's internal clock to check the date.</i></p>
<p>Which is correct? <a href="../../../a/e/t/User%7EAEton_4429.html" title="User:AEton">AEton</a> 23:30, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The second paragraph is correct. The game can't have it's own clock because you can't put a clock into a disc, atleast not that I know of. But although it uses the Gamecube's internal clock you can have the game set ahead or behind it, the game just remembers how far ahead or behind the Gamecube's clock it is.Annoynismos <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.66.94.140.html" title="User:24.66.94.140">24.66.94.140</a> (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.66.94.140.html" title="User talk:24.66.94.140">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.66.94.140_91f9.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.66.94.140">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<dd>No!The 1st is.It reads the clock and sets it as a default time,although the clock can be internaly changed.

<dd>uh... what? it IS NOT independent of the gamecube's clock. it bases the time off of it. so if the time in the game is 3:30 and the gamecube's is 5:30, changing it to 3:30 in the Gamecube will change the clock in AC to 1:30. it's all relative. it is NOT independent. the clock isn't on the disc, or the memory card, or anything like that. it remembers how far ahead or behind it is relative to the gamecube's clock.68.107.96.136 22:07, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Who got rid of all the fansites? Different fansites have different purposes and different content, it would be nice to see them all. Instead you leave only one that's rarely updated compared to some others. This isn't fair to other sites, which in my opinion are even better than the sites you have left. Why would a fan of the game only want to see one site?

<dd>Well these aren't the only sites. I wasn't nesacarily talking about those. There are a few specific AC sites I have in mind. http://animalxing.com/ - This is an FAQ site and an AC community (forum and IRC). And another one: http://the-bell-tree-forums.com/ - This one is just a forum. It's nice because the whole site is based on the community and not an FAQ like a lot of them. There are some other I don't remeber. I know ACO is an older site, it wasn't up here before though. I also saw project hyrule being discussed above. For some reason it got denied. I honestly don't like Project Hyrule at all, but it might deserve a place here because it introduced UCs and the code generator. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.182.106.75 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.182.106.75_fdc2.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.182.106.75">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<li>ac wiki: dead link... wait are your comments above or below the link of the site? whatever...</li>
<li>ac walkthrough: wow... this site does have too many advertisements... this one should probably go because it's confusing and looks bad</li>
<li>ac advocates: What do you mean this has nothing to do with AC? Hmm... this site looks pretty nice and my opinion, I say keep this one actually. (maybe... i dunno)</li>

<p>I made some edits to this Article recently, mostly adding information. It has been pointed out to me that the information I added may not have been relevant to what a Wikipedia article concerning a video game should contain. This edit (by me) in particular I think may not be important information: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Animal_Crossing&amp;diff=63240471&amp;oldid=63237671" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Animal_Crossing&amp;diff=63240471&amp;oldid=63237671" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>].

<dd>Indeed. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">Here</a>, item 8 (as of today), it is specified that Wikipedia should not hold tutorials ("...if the player hits the rock between 10 and 15 times and their feng-shui rating is very high, a very rare piece of furniture may pop out as well."), how-to's (<i>...players go to the train station and tell the porter that they'd like to take a trip.

<dl>
<dd>This is really wrong. Tom Nook does sell Grab Bags--but they are different grab bags. This is a bonus for people who use Nintendo memory cards. The first benefit that you get is that it's less likely that your game data will randomly corrupt itself. So this is really just a cherry on top. It's NOT a bug, it's programmed specifically. Now, there may be some common bug involved with initial game Grad Bag, but I haven't heard of one, and if this section is trying to explain one, it's doing it really badly. I think I have a good solution though, I'll try and post it soon.<b><a href="../../../t/s/t/User%7ETStein_937b.html" title="User:TStein">TStein</a> 09:27, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</b></dd>

<dd>It isn't 'exactly how many bells things cost', that actually was only the amount of bells needed to pay off your first debt, which is basic general info, which I also see in game reviews and even basic info on the game. I DO see, after a second reading of it, that it does have some un-needed info though, in the form of the further expansion pricing. I didn't see all of that because I had to go to school and was in a hurry. ^_^; sorry! <a href="../../../y/a/d/User%7EYadaman_daa6.html" title="User:Yadaman">Yadaman</a> 22:13, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm doing some major cleaning of this article. There are sentences that aren't grammatically correct or make no sense, there's information about AC:WW, and lots of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Travel Cleaning</b></p>
<ul>
<li>I changed the spelling of "traveling". Yes, this section of the article has now been spell-checked.&#160;:)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I removed the first travel method. It's NOT a seperate travel method, it's part of the instructions for a complicated cheating method.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I removed links. I don't know why "train station" linked to the wiki article on train stations or why "train" linked to the wiki article on trains. Are you kidding me? I left the porter one though.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I removed information on Japanese versions of Animal Crossing on the Nintendo DS. This is the Game Cube page, not the Wild World page. If someone wants to put that information on the WW page, go ahead.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I added some information, or rephrased some information and I tried to keep in mind that this is supposed to be a Wiki article and not a gaming article.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I removed the line "Includes Nook's Cranny, Nookway, Nook'n'go, and Nookingtons." I have no idea why it was there, it made zero sense the way the section had been written and it didn't belong in the new section either. If a list of all of the Nook's isn't in the article, we'll put it somewhere it makes sense.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Since Item Trading was a subsection, I re-ordered it to make it feel like it was part of Travelling. I also added Gyroid trading to the section.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I removed the info about Action Replay in the Island section. This isn't an article explaining how to cheat--it's supposed to provide basic information on the game and how to get around buying more Nintendo equipement isn't basic information on the game.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I made other minor edits to the Island section to make it read better. <b><a href="../../../t/s/t/User%7ETStein_937b.html" title="User:TStein">TStein</a> 08:41, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</b></li>

<p>I didn't do a lot here. I removed some incorrect information about character bedtimes and replaced it with the correct information about character personalities.</p>
<p>I also changed, "For example, a cow might exclaim, "Macmoo!" to "cow might say, "moo-la-la" or "how now". I thought it would be fun to put in real examples of cow catch phrases that are cow centric. <b><a href="../../../t/s/t/User%7ETStein_937b.html" title="User:TStein">TStein</a> 09:10, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</b></p>

<p>This article uses the term "villager" to refer to non-user created game characters. But, we're using the term town, not village. I don't think we should replace the word town with village--town is the only word I've seen used. It's used in the game, it's used in the official literature and there has been no movement to use a different word in the unofficial literature.</p>
<p>But, I think it's bad to use the terms "villager" and "town" together. Especially as this is the only place I've really seen the word villager used. There doesn't seem to be a set standard for what term to use for non-user created characters, but the ones I've seen used most often are "characters" and "residents". These two terms are also often used together--"character" used in certain instances and "resident" in others.</p>
<p>I think we should make a decision as to what terminology to use. I would like to get rid of the term "villager" and replace it with "character" and "resident" as appropriate. Writing without using the second or first person has led to really clumsy language in large parts of the article and when you add imprecise language that often has to be clarified it just gets worse, often leading to long run on sentences with lots of clauses (like this one!).</p>
<p>So opinions please. Are you guys ok with "character" and "resident" instead of "villager"? If I don't get any responses I suppose at some point I'll try rewriting it and make a decision myself, but I'd like imput. <b><a href="../../../t/s/t/User%7ETStein_937b.html" title="User:TStein">TStein</a> 09:20, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</b></p>

<p>Animal Crossing is currently a disambiguation page for this video game series. It links to all of the articles on the video games and the movie. If you would like to dissolve the disambiguation page for the series and instead have Animal Crossing (Game Cube) be the be located at Animal Crossing, then that proposal should go there. I should warn you that not only is there no chance of the disambig page being dissolved, and even if there were, Animal Crossing would redirect to the Animal Crossing (Series) page, not to the Animal Crossing (Game Cube) page. There are 6 Animal Crossing games that have been released, four in Japanese and two in English. These games have been released on the Nintendo 64, the DS and both the American and the Japanese version of the GameCube. There's also an Animal Crossing movie, and two new versions of the game will be released this year for the wii. We've gotten to the point where there are enough wiki pages where this really needs a disambig page, and even if it didn't and we could still use top navigational links instead, arbitrarily choosing one version of the game makes little sense when there is a series page. In any case, this is the wrong place for the proposal. <b><a href="../../../t/s/t/User%7ETStein_937b.html" title="User:TStein">TStein</a> 10:28, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</b></p>

<dd>It is not up to you to reject a move request unilaterally. Even if the move request is very likely to fail, it should still be given due consideration and allowed to complete the process. Where the discussion is held is not particularly important either. The request submitted to <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> indicated that the discussion will be here, which is not a problem. <span style="color: #F06A0F">–</span> <small><span style="border: 1px solid #F06A0F"><a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User%7EAn%C3%BEony_a6df.html" title="User:Anþony"><b><span style="background-color:White; color:#F06A0F">&#160;Anþony&#160;</span></b></a><a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User_talk%7EAn%C3%BEony_4ae4.html" title="User talk:Anþony"><span style="background-color:#F06A0F; color:white">&#160;talk&#160;</span></a></span></small> 20:25, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>*nods* In the meantime I have changed the Animal Crossing talk page so that in no longer redirects here. Animal Crossing (GameCube) redirected here for a long time, and someone fixed the redirects on both the article page and the talk page in August. Three minutes later the same user was the one who officially switched the redirect to the series page, but forgot about switching the redirect for the talk page. And when the disambig happened, I guess people forgot then too. Anyway, things appear to be perfectly straight now--just if you do switch things about, make sure everything goes to the right places! <b><a href="../../../t/s/t/User%7ETStein_937b.html" title="User:TStein">TStein</a> 14:05, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</b></dd>

<p>This is supposed to be an article about the Animal Crossing game. It already focuses way too much on gameplay and the little bitty details. Getting to AR details is waaaaay too far. <b><a href="../../../t/s/t/User%7ETStein_937b.html" title="User:TStein">TStein</a> 08:49, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</b></p>

<p>The release dates for super smash bros are as follows:</p>
<p>Japan: November 21, 2001 United States: December 3, 2001 European Union: May 24, 2002, Australia: May 31, 2002</p>
<p>The release dates for Animal Forest/Crossing--GAMECUBE are as follows</p>
<p>Japan: 14 December 2001 North America: 15 September 2002 Japan (e+): 27 June 2003 Australia October 2003 Europe 24 September 2004</p>
<p><br />
SO, lets look at the calender.</p>
<pre>
Jap:  Nov 01 before Dec 01?  Yes.
</pre>
<p>US/NA: Dec 01 before Sep 02? Yes.</p>
<pre>
Eur:  May 02 before Sep 04?  Yes.
Aus:  May 02 before Oct 03?  Yes.
</pre>
<p>And, aside from the fact that Super Smash Bros is in fact released before Animal Crossing so the AC trophies would in fact be properly marked future release, I'd just like to point out that if they are that way in one version of the game, they are that way in another. Nintendo releases different versions of games but doesn't really change the game. It does text translation, but no gameplay changing--not really. Sometimes one version won't support a technological thing. The Animal Forest (GC) translation to Animal Crossing was a BIG deal. Creating new furniture, new characters, new holidays. It was and still is a rare translation type of translation project and I believe it may still be the biggest translation of its kind that has ever been done. And the results were so great, the new holidays, the new items, that Nintendo translated it back into Japanese for e+. But normally, no translation. The Australian versions of AC don't have the seasons set to the southern hemisphere. No one bothers with things like that. <b><a href="../../../t/s/t/User%7ETStein_937b.html" title="User:TStein">TStein</a> 14:05, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</b></p>
