<p>Cartoons were never just for children. Cartoons in the Golden Age, such as <i><a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Hot_Riding_Hood_4993.html" title="Red Hot Riding Hood">Red Hot Riding Hood</a></i>, contained topical and often suggestive humor, though they were seen primarily as "children's entertainment" by movie exhibitors. This point of view prevailed when the new medium of <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> began showing cartoons in the late <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940s</a>.</p>
<p>One of the very first images to be broadcast over television was that of <b><a href="../../../f/e/l/Felix_the_Cat_22a5.html" title="Felix the Cat">Felix the Cat</a>.</b> As TV became a phenomenon and began to draw audiences away from movie theaters, many children's TV shows included airings of theatrical cartoons in their schedules, and this introduced a new generation of children to the cartoons of the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a>. Cartoon producer Paul Terry sold the rights to the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrytoons.html" title="Terrytoons">Terrytoons</a> cartoon library to television and retired from the business in the early <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a>. This guaranteed a long life for the characters of <a href="../../../m/i/g/Mighty_Mouse_5430.html" title="Mighty Mouse">Mighty Mouse</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/c/Heckle_and_Jeckle_4d25.html" title="Heckle and Jeckle">Heckle and Jeckle</a>, whose cartoons were syndicated and rerun in children's television programming blocks for the next thirty to forty years.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Disney_627d.html" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a></b> also quickly capitalized on the medium of television with his own weekly TV series, <i>Disneyland.</i> This show, which was essentially a weekly half-hour commercial for Disney, popularized his new <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disneyland.html" title="Disneyland">Disneyland</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theme_park.html" title="Theme park">theme park</a>. It also began a decades-long series of TV broadcasts of Disney cartoons, which later expanded into the show <i>Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color.</i> However, Disney largely decided against creating original television animation, recognizing that the economics of the medium could not support his production standards. However, he ordered the creation of one character, <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludwig_Von_Drake_2554.html" title="Ludwig Von Drake">Ludwig Von Drake</a> for original animation that attempted to create seamless links to the various theatrical shorts presented as one complete show episode.</p>

<p>The first major animation studio to produce cartoons especially for television was <b><a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanna-Barbera_Productions_a685.html" title="Hanna-Barbera Productions">Hanna-Barbera Productions</a></b>. When <a href="../../../m/g/m/MGM_7545.html" title="MGM">MGM</a> closed its cartoon studio in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a>, Hanna-Barbera began producing cartoons directly for television, finding an audience in the evening "family hour" time.</p>

<p>The first prime-time <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animated_series.html" title="Animated series">animated series</a> from Hanna-Barbera were <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ruff_%26_Reddy_Show_84e1.html" title="The Ruff &amp; Reddy Show">The Ruff &amp; Reddy Show</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a>) and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Huckleberry_Hound_Show_7ad3.html" title="The Huckleberry Hound Show">The Huckleberry Hound Show</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a>), though the studio hit its stride in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> when it scored with <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Flintstones_047c.html" title="The Flintstones">The Flintstones</a>.</i> This was the first half-hour "sitcom" cartoon, and like many of its successors it was originally aired during prime time when the whole family would be watching television. <i>The Flintstones</i> was the first of several prime-time animated series from Hanna-Barbera, which included the acclaimed <i><a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonny_Quest_b0fd.html" title="Jonny Quest">Jonny Quest</a></i>, generally thought of as Hanna-Barbera's best television work; however, prime-time animation did not produce any other high-rated TV series, and Hanna-Barbera turned its efforts to the growing market for <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturday_morning_cartoon.html" title="Saturday morning cartoon">Saturday morning cartoons</a>.</p>

<p>One of the problems with producing animation for television was the extremely labor intensive <b>animation process.</b> While theatrical short subjects were previously produced in six month cycles or longer, network television needed a season of 10-20 half hour episodes each year. This led to a number of shortcut techniques to speed up the production process, and the techniques of <b><a href="../../../l/i/m/Limited_animation.html" title="Limited animation">limited animation</a></b> were applied to produce a great number of quickly-produced, low-budget TV cartoons. The mass production led to a rapid decrease in the quality of television animation in general.</p>
<p>The <b><a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Productions_of_America_331a.html" title="United Productions of America">UPA studio</a></b> was one of the first victims of the TV-animation market. The quality of the UPA theatrical shorts had decreased in quality since <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hubley_2f2c.html" title="John Hubley">John Hubley</a> left the studio, and UPA turned to television to sustain itself. This proved to be a death-knell for its animation studio. The two UPA TV series <i>Mister Magoo</i> and <i>Dick Tracy</i> were of excruciating quality, and while they retained some of the visual flair that had rocked the animation industry, the wretched quality of the stories turned viewers off and doomed the studio. UPA had abandoned animation production completely by the late <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>.</p>
<p>The <b><a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay_Ward_761a.html" title="Jay Ward">Jay Ward studio,</a></b> producer of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rocky_and_Bullwinkle_Show_e4e6.html" title="The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show">The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show</a>,</i> used limited animation in its series, but the lack of visual effects was compromised by giving more attention to the writing and witty humor.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> saw a <b>decline in the entire animation industry</b> that affected the medium as a whole for over twenty years. The cartoon creations of all the Hollywood studios seemed to be affected by an apathy that led to a general decline in quality for the industry. Creativity and originality in animation moved largely underground, to the point where quality animated films were largely produced by small, independent producers, or in countries other than America.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>, Walt Disney helped to establish the <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Institute_of_the_Arts_ca76.html" title="California Institute of the Arts">California Institute of the Arts</a>.</b> The founding of the institute was both a philanthropic gesture and a savvy investment by Disney, as the school provided plenty of creative talent for the company in the years to come. CalArts and other peer institutions would have an important role in the animation revival of the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, although <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Disney_627d.html" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a>'s films of the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> (<i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Poppins_%28film%29_6745.html" title="Mary Poppins (film)">Mary Poppins</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Jungle_Book_%281967_film%29_d915.html" title="The Jungle Book (1967 film)">The Jungle Book</a></i>) still generated hefty revenue for the studio, his empire was rocked to its core when Disney died from lung cancer in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a>. The Disney company had trouble finding a new direction to move in after Walt's death, and the production of live-action and animated feature films suffered as a result. While the studio tried to remain true to his vision (a common catchphrase of the time was "What would Walt do?"), many critics felt that the studio's best days were behind them. Additionally, many veteran animators either retired or passed away, so the studio had to find ways to replace them. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>, <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Larson_6b87.html" title="Eric Larson">Eric Larson</a> started a training program for new animators.</p>
<p>Films from this period included <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Aristocats_0536.html" title="The Aristocats">The Aristocats</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Hood_%281973_film%29_8736.html" title="Robin Hood (1973 film)">Robin Hood</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rescuers_1369.html" title="The Rescuers">The Rescuers</a></i>, as well as the featurettes <i><a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnie_the_Pooh_and_the_Blustery_Day_4f72.html" title="Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day">Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day</a></i>, <i>It's Tough to Be a Bird</i>, <i><a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnie_the_Pooh_and_Tigger_Too%21_825a.html" title="Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too!">Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too!</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Small_One_4d00.html" title="The Small One">The Small One</a></i>, plus the live-action/animation hybrids <i><a href="../../../b/e/d/Bedknobs_and_Broomsticks_1a6e.html" title="Bedknobs and Broomsticks">Bedknobs and Broomsticks</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete%27s_Dragon_b05d.html" title="Pete's Dragon">Pete's Dragon</a></i>. Eventually these films (except Pete's Dragon) turn out to be successful, much to the company's relief.</p>
<p>The arguable low point of the post-Walt era occurred in September <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a> when studio animator <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Bluth_a215.html" title="Don Bluth">Don Bluth</a> led a walkout of himself and a dozen of his supporters, including <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Goldman_0306.html" title="Gary Goldman">Gary Goldman</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Pomeroy_a285.html" title="John Pomeroy">John Pomeroy</a>. Fed up with the status quo at Disney, he and his acolytes left to start his own studio. Disney entered the 1980s facing an uncertain future.</p>

<p>Moving into feature films after attempting to save the <a href="../../../f/a/m/Famous_Studios_02bb.html" title="Famous Studios">Famous Studios</a> animation studio from being closed by Paramount, Bakshi shocked audiences by producing the first <a href="../../../x/-/r/X-rated.html" title="X-rated">X-rated</a> animated feature film, <i><a href="../../../f/r/i/Fritz_the_Cat_%28film%29_9b6a.html" title="Fritz the Cat (film)">Fritz the Cat</a></i>. The movie was a box-office hit, and it inspired Bakshi to produce a string of animated feature films (not necessarily X-rated) aimed at adult audiences rather than kids, with the most famous of these films being an ambitious animated adaptation of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_%281978_film%29_29c9.html" title="The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)">The Lord of the Rings</a></i>. It also inspired the creation of several other "X rated and animated" films, few of which were as successful as Bakshi's films. Few other animators or studios dared to follow in Bakshi's footsteps.</p>

<p>Animation on television focused almost exclusively on children, to the point where <b>Saturday morning TV broadcasts</b> on the TV networks were aimed primarily at kids. The tradition of getting up early to watch <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturday_morning_cartoon.html" title="Saturday morning cartoon">Saturday morning cartoons</a> became a weekly ritual for millions of American kids, and the networks were glad to oblige by providing hours-long blocks of cartoon shows, most of which were crudely written and poorly animated. But the children watched these shows anyway, and <b><a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanna-Barbera_Productions_a685.html" title="Hanna-Barbera Productions">Hanna-Barbera Productions</a></b> became the leader in the production of TV cartoons for children. A number of other studios produced TV cartoons, but the lion's share came from Hanna-Barbera. In spite of persistent attempts by rival animation studios <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filmation.html" title="Filmation">Filmation</a> (<i>Fat Albert, The Archies</i>) and <a href="../../../d/e/p/DePatie-Freleng_Enterprises_491b.html" title="DePatie-Freleng Enterprises">DePatie-Freleng Enterprises</a> (<i>The Pink Panther</i>) to capture audiences, Hanna-Barbera had developed a <b>virtual monopoly</b> on TV cartoons by the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>. This led to a considerable decline in quality on Saturday mornings; there was no incentive for Hanna-Barbera to produce high-quality animation because when a show was cancelled by the network, it was swiftly replaced by another Hanna-Barbera show of equally dismal quality. While some efforts at creativity were made by up-and-coming animators such as <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Evanier_96ad.html" title="Mark Evanier">Mark Evanier</a>, their efforts were lost amid a flood of cheaply-produced cartoons.</p>
<p>The only inspired animated efforts on television during the period of the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> through the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> came from <b>prime-time animated <a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_special_596f.html" title="TV special">TV specials</a>.</b> Because these one-shot cartoons were aired during prime-time hours (and thus had to appeal to adults as well as children), they had to obtain higher ratings than their Saturday and weekday counterparts. <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a> in particular allowed a large number of animated TV specials to air on its network, and several of these have become cherished classics (now available on video). The <b><a href="../../../r/a/n/Rankin-Bass_c075.html" title="Rankin-Bass">Rankin-Bass</a></b> studio produced a number of <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stop-motion.html" title="Stop-motion">stop-motion</a> specials geared towards popular holidays (including <i><a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudolph_the_Red-Nosed_Reindeer_e8f0.html" title="Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer">Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer</a></i>); while <b>Bill Melendez's</b> long-running series of <i><a href="../../../p/e/a/Peanuts.html" title="Peanuts">Peanuts</a></i> specials won numerous awards.</p>
<p>But the real creativity in animation came from <b>independent animators</b> who produced <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_animation.html" title="Independent animation">independent animated</a> short films that were rarely seen outside of "art house" movie theaters. As the Hollywood animation studios faded, a number of independent producers of animation continued to make experimental, artistic animated films that explored new artistic territory in the medium of animation. <b>Short films</b> such as <i>The Critic,</i> <i><a href="../../../b/a/m/Bambi_Meets_Godzilla_2f52.html" title="Bambi Meets Godzilla">Bambi Meets Godzilla</a>,</i> <i>Lupo the Butcher,</i> and many others were almost unknown to mainstream audiences; however, these independent animated films continued to keep the yearly category of the <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_for_Animated_Short_Film_53e9.html" title="Academy Award for Animated Short Film">Academy Award for Animated Short Film</a> alive, as well as introducing a number of new names into the animation industry—names that would begin to bring much-needed change to the industry in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friz_Freleng_45b9.html" title="Friz Freleng">Friz Freleng</a> retired. The <a href="../../../d/e/p/DePatie-Freleng_Enterprises_491b.html" title="DePatie-Freleng Enterprises">DePatie-Freleng Enterprises</a> studio was sold to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Comics_b294.html" title="Marvel Comics">Marvel Comics</a>, and it continued under his lead as <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Productions_Ltd_783d.html" title="Marvel Productions Ltd">Marvel Productions Ltd.</a> This new studio focused almost exclusively on toy merchandising, and it found a new audience among young viewers. Despite their low quality, the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Productions_0124.html" title="Marvel Productions">Marvel Productions</a> cartoons (especially <i>G.I. Joe</i> and <i>Transformers</i>) offered a change of pace from the formula writing offered by Hanna-Barbera's continuing series.</p>
