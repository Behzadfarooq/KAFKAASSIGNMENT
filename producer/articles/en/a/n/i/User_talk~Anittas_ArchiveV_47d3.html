<p>Anittas, I didn't talk behind your back at all. The very fact that you saw my comment to Oleg and responded to it means that it was very much public. Secondly, I've written to you countless times telling you how I feel about your edits. As to giving you many chances - it wasn't only me that did so, but many other admins, in the RfC. I'm not saying <i>you</i> asked for mercy, just that everytime when you made personal attacks, there was a great deal of negotiation, commenting and stuff like that, but never blocking (except for the 24h block by FeloniousMonk). I was simply making a point that Bonaparte got none of that, which isn't fair. There was never really an attempt by the community to try and solve the things he was doing and make him understand that what he was doing was wrong. In your case, it was different. And perhaps successful. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">â</a> 22:48, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Anittas, the picture you posted for the article ("Moldavian troops fighting etc.") screams copyvio (we all know the book). Besides that, it is tacky and of no informative value. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 18:01, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Anittas maybe you can use the image of the pre WWII Romanian enciclopedia (the copyright seem expired and the images from this enciclopediara are already published as thumbnail by tricolorul newspaper).

<p>I have no ideea, I know only the year of the chronicle 1488, it a great probability to be there...

<dd>Ok, I also read the copyright law of 1956, which is the one under which "Enciclopedia Romaniei" entered public domain. Where is your picture taken from? Recall that it is important which edition you are copying from. For instance, even if the work of Eminescu is public domain, the last edition from Humanitas is not. So, you are allowed to copy from the original versions, but not the recent editions. <a href="../../../d/p/o/User%7EDpotop_3508.html" title="User:Dpotop">Dpotop</a> 12:57, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No. I've written a few decent short stories, but none were published in anything more prestigious than a student magazine or a chapbook. I self-published a book of songs in 1978, but it was basically a publicity thing as a performer: at that point, one could just churn out a demo CD the way one can now. While I was a grad student I did a bunch of writing for a long-forgotten second-rate encyclopedia whose name I honestly cannot recall. I've published a good deal of technical writing (usually uncredited, because it was work for hire, but most recently including several hundred reference and conceptual topics for Microsoft), a moderate amount of travel writing (I ghost-wrote a good hunk of two Peter Verstappen travel guides to the U.S. back in the late 1970s, and have contributed on and off to <i>TravelSmart</i>); I've had a significant editorial role on several books (most notably <i>The Infamous Boundary&#160;: Seven decades of controversy in quantum physics</i> by David Wick) and there are probably a few things I'm not thinking of, because writing really hasn't been my career focus for the last 25 years, computers have. Which is to say, I am not primarily a writer, but I have a lot more first-hand experience in the publishing world than most of the people working here, and when you add that to being the son of a (now deceased) publisher and having at least a dozen friends who do make their living (or a substantial part of their living) as writers, it means I'm pretty exposed to that world. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 05:49, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

I was pretty typical of his intended audience (scientifiaclly literate, but by no means a physicist. This was one of a few times that I've helped hard-science people work out how to get key concepts across to a lay or semi-lay audience; I once spent the better part of a weekendâsort of an unofficial ten-year college reunionâfunctioning as intermediary between a group of physicists doing chaos theory and a contingent of philosophy professors, and I've had two jobs in which I was the liaison between medical personnel and computer professionals building medical records software). - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 06:54, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>in the 1390 treaty with poland, mircea was called <i>Woyvoda Transalpinus, Fogaras et Omlas dux, seurinii comes, terrarum Dobrotici despotus et Tristri dominus</i>. Omlas, Fagaras and Severin were feuds given by the hungarian king to mircea. in the <i>hrisov</i> of 1387, he mentions along his possesions <b>ÐºÑ Ð¢Ð°ÑÐ°ÑÑÐºÑÐ¼ ÑÑÑÐ°Ð½Ð°Ð¼Ð¸</b> (hope i got it right), translated by most romanian historians as <i>pÄrÅ£ile tÄtÄreÅti</i> ("tatar parts"). probably this was reffering to territories in southern moldavia, bessarabia and, maybe, northern dobruja. iorga said tht he found a map of wallachia from 1780 that shown besarabia proper (today's bugeac) as part of wallachia. from what i know, hungary never ruled bessarabia after year 1000 (hungarian tribes probably lived in the region before migrating to pannonia). i think you're talking about the port of killia, which was indeed ruled for some time in the 15th century by hungary and wallachia. the border is almost a straight line because nobody knows how much of moldavia did mircea rule. the border on the map is based on Petre Dan's description in <i>Hotarele romÃ¢nismului Ã®n date</i> (Litera International, ChiÅinÄu, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 973-675-278-X</a> -- <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 9975-74-902-X</a>) "Sud Cetatea AlbÄ, Nord Cahul, Nord Tecuci, Sud Pasul Oituz" (south of <a href="../../../c/e/t/Cetatea_Alba_e4f3.html" title="Cetatea Alba">Cetatea Alba</a>, north of <a href="../../../c/a/h/Cahul.html" title="Cahul">Cahul</a>, north of <a href="../../../t/e/c/Tecuci.html" title="Tecuci">Tecuci</a>, south of Oituz mountain pass. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonimu_9d7a.html" title="User:Anonimu">Anonimu</a> 17:02, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Caffa &amp; Theodoro</span></h2>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>1) About maps. Unfortunately there are no good maps on Crimean history on the web. There is... m-m-m... not map - only a scheme, I've made just now. It shows the situation in Crimea before the Ottoman invasion in 1475. <a href="http://www.ljplus.ru/img/d/o/don_alessandro/Theodoro_and_Caffa.PNG" class="external free" title="http://www.ljplus.ru/img/d/o/don_alessandro/Theodoro_and_Caffa.PNG" rel="nofollow">http://www.ljplus.ru/img/d/o/don_alessandro/Theodoro_and_Caffa.PNG</a></p>
<p><b>red</b> - Genoesian colonies, <b>green</b> - the Principality of Theodoro, <b>blue</b> - the Khanate of Crimea (Haci Giray).</p>

<p>If you want more information on Crimen history, I'll try to answer.</p>
<p>2) About Stephen III the Great and his relationships with Theodoro.</p>
<p>I know really few facts. Stephen married Maria Gabras - the dauther of Prince of Theodoro. The House of Gabras was related both to the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comnenian_dynasty.html" title="Comnenian dynasty">Comnenian dynasty</a> and to the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palaeologan_dynasty.html" title="Palaeologan dynasty">Palaeologan dynasty</a> and by that time Stephen was a great success in his war against the Ottomans. So this marrige gave him rigths to clame the throne of Constantinople (if he would win Constantinople from the Turks). Alexander Gabras was Maria's brother, and Isaac was their uncle. Sthephen wanted to create a coalition against the Ottomans - Moldavia, Theodoro and Caffa. But Isaac Gabras was very pro-Ottoman ruler. So he call Alexander, who lived in Moldavia in exile, gave him 300 men and a ship and sent to Crimea. Alexander was a success - he replaced Isaac on the throne of Theodoro. But in 1475 Ottoman general Gedik Ahmet PaÅa conquered both Caffa and Theodoro. Caffa capitulated immedeatly, but Theodoro under Prince Alexander opposed the Ottmomans for half of a year. Alexander was enslaved and died in prison in Istanbul in spite of the attempts of Stephen to liberate him.</p>
<p>3) Please, excuse my awfull English.</p>

<dd>Great info on Alexander, but where did you find these sources? I might need them for the Moldavian articles. Your map looks good, tho I can't speak for it's accuracy. You should upload it to the article. Do you know why Stephen didn't annex Theodoro? Could he annex the land at all?

<p>Anittas, nu sunt sigur daca tu deja sti sau nu, dar oricum, Mo Wiki a avut o alegere despre viiroul (daca acest wiki va continua sau nu), si din fericire, a fost multi romani (si din Romania, si din moldova) acolo care a avut habar si deci a votat impotriva projectul initiat de un american care nu stie limba. Bineinteles, el a inceput sa planga ca alegera n-a fost valabil, pentru ca a fost deschis doar pentru utilizatori care stie limba romana/"moldoveneasca", si vrea sa opreste procesul care deja a suspendat projectul lui care este jignitor pentru multi romani. Totusi, se pare ca sfarsitul Mo wiki se aproape, si stirile trebuie sa fi intr-adevar binevenite pentru tine. Daca si tu vrei sa particip la discutia actuala, am un link aici:</p>
