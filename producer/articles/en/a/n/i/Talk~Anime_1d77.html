<p>Just like movie soundtracks, music to anime can be sold as Anime <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soundtrack.html" title="Soundtrack">soundtracks</a>. They are oftentimes met with similar demand as <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chart-topper.html" title="Chart-topper">chart topping</a> pop albums. It is for this reason that anime <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music.html" title="Music">music</a> is often composed and performed by 'A-list' musicians, stars, and composers. Anime series with opening credits use the opening theme song as a quick introduction to the show. The most frequent use of music in Anime is <i>background music</i> or <i>BGM</i>. BGM is used to set the tone of a given scene, for example <i><a href="../../../n/e/o/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion_8beb.html" title="Neon Genesis Evangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion's</a></i> "Decisive Battle" is played when the characters are making battle preparations and it features heavy drum beats and a militaristic style which highlights the tension of the scene and hints at the action to follow.</p>
<p>The theme song (also referred to as the Opening song or abbreviated as OP) usually matches the overall tone of the show, and serves to get the viewer excited about the upcoming program. Insert songs and ending songs (abbreviated ED) often make commentary about the plot or the program as a whole, and are oftentimes used to highlight a particularly important scene. Opening and ending themes, as well as insert songs, are frequently performed by popular musicians or <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_idol.html" title="Japanese idol">Japanese idols</a>, so in this way, songs become a very important component of an anime program. In addition to the themes, the seiyū (Japanese term for voice actors) for a specific anime also frequently releases CD for their character, called Image Albums. Despite the word "image" in the CD's name, it only contains music and/or "voice messages" (where the seiyū talks with the audience or about herself), making the listener think that the character him/herself is singing. Another type of Anime CD release are <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audio_theatre.html" title="Audio theatre">Drama CDs</a>, featuring songs and tracks which makes use of the seiyū to tell a story, often not included in the main anime.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/i/Talk%7EAnime_1d77.html" title="Edit section: Techniques">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Techniques</span></h4>
<p>The basics of anime is based on <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditional_animation.html" title="Traditional animation">traditional animation</a>. While anime is considered separate from <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartoons.html" title="Cartoons">cartoons</a>, anime still uses multiple still images in rapid succession to produce the animated visual effect. Like all animation, the production processes of <a href="../../../s/t/o/Storyboard.html" title="Storyboard">storyboarding</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voice_acting.html" title="Voice acting">voice acting</a>, character design, cel production, etc. still apply. With improvements in computer technology, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_animation.html" title="Computer animation">computer animation</a> increased the efficiency of the whole production process.</p>
<p>Most anime drawing styles used for television is counter-productive to the animation process. The anime style emphasizes detail which subsequently creates difficulty with meeting production schedules and budgets. This is in contrast to animation styles with design ethics stressing simplicity. Thus, the anime style has a philosophy of applying more effort into each of a few drawings than less effort into one of many.</p>
<p><a href="../../../o/s/a/Osamu_Tezuka_fd57.html" title="Osamu Tezuka">Osamu Tezuka</a> adapted and simplified many <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Disney_Pictures_4561.html" title="Walt Disney Pictures">Disney</a> animation precepts to reduce the budget costs and number of frames in the production. This was intended to be a temporary measure to allow him to produce one episode every week with an inexperienced animation staff. Some animators in Japan overcome production budgets by utilizing different techniques than the Disney or the old Tezuka/Otsuka methods of animating anime. Due to reduced <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frame_rate.html" title="Frame rate">frame rate</a>, several still shots and scrolling backgrounds, more time can be spent on detail in each drawing. Animator <a href="../../../y/a/s/Yasuo_%C5%8Ctsuka_25b7.html" title="Yasuo Ōtsuka">Yasuo Ōtsuka</a> was a pioneer of this technique. Directors such as <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiroyuki_Imaishi_7e00.html" title="Hiroyuki Imaishi">Hiroyuki Imaishi</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/u/t/Cutey_Honey_3e8d.html" title="Cutey Honey">Cutey Honey</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_Leaves_12a9.html" title="Dead Leaves">Dead Leaves</a></i>) simplify backgrounds so that more attention can be paid to character animation. Other animators like Tatsuyuki Tanaka (in Koji Minamoto's <i>Eternal Family</i> in particular) use <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squash_and_stretch.html" title="Squash and stretch">squash and stretch</a>, an animation technique not often used by Japanese animators; Tanaka makes other shortcuts to compensate for this. Anime studios use techniques to draw as little new animation as possible such as using dialogue that involves only animating mouths while the rest of the screen remains absolutely unchanged, a technique familiar to Western animation styles.</p>
<p>Some higher-budgeted television and OVA (<a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_Video_Animation_4d51.html" title="Original Video Animation">Original Video Animation</a>) series are made without resorting to the shortcuts found in most other anime. Classic films, such as those produced by <a href="../../../t/o/e/Toei_Animation_adec.html" title="Toei Animation">Toei Animation</a> up until the mid 1960s, and recent big budget films, such as those produced by the enormously successful <a href="../../../s/t/u/Studio_Ghibli_469f.html" title="Studio Ghibli">Studio Ghibli</a> have much higher production budgets, due to their anticipated success at the box office.</p>
<p>Some anime titles lack a directorial system. Animation productions tend to keep to a set style by the director or animation director, but animation director <a href="../../../y/o/s/Yoshinori_Kanada_44d0.html" title="Yoshinori Kanada">Yoshinori Kanada</a> dispensed with this and allowed each animator to bring their own individual style to the work. An example of this is the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hakkenden_5506.html" title="The Hakkenden">The Hakkenden</a></i> that showed constantly shifting styles of animation from episode to episode, based upon the key animator that worked on that particular episode.</p>
<p>Some non-Japanese <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animations.html" title="Animations">animations</a> are starting to incorporate mainstream anime shortcuts and symbols in an attempt to appeal to existing anime fans, cut costs, and sometimes simply because of creators' own interest in anime.</p>

<p>Most anime can be categorized as one of three types:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Films</b>, which are generally released in theaters, represent the highest budgets and generally the highest video quality. Anime movies that have broken profit earning records include <i><a href="../../../a/k/i/Akira_%28film%29.html" title="Akira (film)">Akira</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost_in_the_Shell_7b72.html" title="Ghost in the Shell">Ghost in the Shell</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirited_Away_a468.html" title="Spirited Away">Spirited Away</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Fullmetal_Alchemist_the_Movie%7E_Conqueror_of_Shamballa_e02c.html" title="Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa">Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa</a></i>. Some anime films are only released at film or animation festivals and are shorter and sometimes lower in production values. Some examples of these are <i><a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter_Days_3ccd.html" title="Winter Days">Winter Days</a></i> and <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osamu_Tezuka_fd57.html" title="Osamu Tezuka">Osamu Tezuka</a>'s <i>Legend of the Forest</i>. Other types of films include <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compilation_movie.html" title="Compilation movie">compilation movies</a>, which are television episodes edited together and presented in theaters for various reasons, and are hence a concentrated form of a television <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serial.html" title="Serial">serial</a>. These may, however, be longer than the average movie. There are also theatrical shorts derived from existing televisions series and billed in Japanese theaters together to form feature-length showing.</li>
<li><b>Television series</b> anime is <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_syndication.html" title="Television syndication">syndicated</a> and broadcast on television on a regular schedule. <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_program.html" title="Television program">Television series</a> are generally low quality compared to <i>OVA</i> (<a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_Video_Animation_4d51.html" title="Original Video Animation">Original Video Animation</a>) and film titles, because the production budget is spread out over many episodes rather than a single film or a short series. Most episodes are about 23 minutes in length, to fill a typical thirty-minute time slot with added <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_commercial.html" title="Television commercial">commercials</a>. One full season is 26 episodes, and many titles run half seasons, or 13 episodes. Most TV series anime episodes will have <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opening_credits.html" title="Opening credits">opening credits</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/o/Closing_credits.html" title="Closing credits">closing credits</a>, and often an "<a href="../../../e/y/e/Eyecatch.html" title="Eyecatch">eyecatch</a>", a very short scene, often humorous or silly, that is used to signal the start or end of the commercial break (as "bumpers" in the United States are used in a similar fashion). "Eyecatch" scenes are often found in TV series anime and are generally similar throughout the series. The ending credits are often followed by a preview of the next episode.</li>
<li><b>OVA</b> (<b><a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_Video_Animation_4d51.html" title="Original Video Animation">Original Video Animation</a></b>; sometimes <b>OAV</b>, or <b>Original Animated Video</b>) anime is often similar to a television <a href="../../../m/i/n/Miniseries.html" title="Miniseries">miniseries</a>. OVAs can be any number of episodes in length; <a href="../../../o/n/e/One-shot.html" title="One-shot">one-shots</a> are particularly short, usually less than film-length. They are most commonly released directly to video. As a general rule, OVA anime tends to be of higher production quality than that of TV episodes, approaching that of films. Titles tend to have a continuing plot, as opposed to episodic conclusions. Opening credits, closing credits, and eyecatches may sometimes be found in OVA releases, but not universally.</li>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/i/Talk%7EAnime_1d77.html" title="Edit section: Franchising">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Franchising</span></h4>
<p>It is common for one title to spawn several different releases. A title that starts as a popular television series, for example, may have a movie adapted from it at a later date. An example is the <i><a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenchi_Muyo%21_4a59.html" title="Tenchi Muyo!">Tenchi Muyo!</a></i> series; originally an OVA, it spawned three movies, three television series, and several spin-off titles and specials. Not all successors to an anime are a sequel to the original story; prequels and alternate stories (sometimes known as <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaiden.html" title="Gaiden">gaiden</a> <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">外伝</span><span class="t_nihongo_norom" style="display:none"><span class="t_nihongo_comma" style="display:none">,</span> <i><span class="t_nihongo_romaji"><a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaiden.html" title="Gaiden">gaiden</a></span></i></span><span class="t_nihongo_help"><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese"><span class="t_nihongo_icon" style="color:#00e;font:bold 80% sans-serif;text-decoration:none;padding:0 .1em;">?</span></a></sup></span> lit.

<p>"Due to linguistics, the anime definition is subject to interpretation" is written under the definition. According to Wikiepedia "Linguistics is the scientific study of language". So what the hell does "Due to linguistics, the anime definition is subject to interpretation" mean? <small>— The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Familyman69 (<a href="../../../f/a/m/User_talk%7EFamilyman69_b476.html" title="User talk:Familyman69">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Familyman69_c463.html" title="Special:Contributions/Familyman69">contribs</a>) 14:27, 7 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>The next couple of sentences should explain that. Apparently, the meaning of "anime" is dependent on who you talk to. To the Japanese, "anime" means everything animated - which includes things like the Simpsons. The differentiation between "anime" and "cartoon" only exists in the West, particularly the United States.</dd>
<dd>In short, the language interpretation of the word differs. Furthermore, the meaning even gets more confusing when "cartoons" start mimicking things done in "anime". Several articles already exist addressing that confusion. <a href="../../../k/y/u/User%7EKyuuA4_26f7.html" title="User:KyuuA4">KyuuA4</a> 19:39, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>WHAT are the category pages? (I ask because this is the second time someone has mentioned the location of the notable list as being here.) There is no hyperlink from the main anime page from named "category." If I can't find any such page, then a casual reader, who may be interested in finding anime worth watching (or following up on), will not be aware of the existence of such a page. It should be listed in the "lists" section at the end of the "anime" entry (it is a "list", isn't it?). Of course, such a page should be based on appropriate references (critical acclaim, popularity polls, etc.), but <i>Italic text</i> its lack of objectivity does not necessarily undermine its (potential) usefulness. <a href="../../../b/f/b/User%7EBfbbrown_612a.html" title="User:Bfbbrown">Bfbbrown</a> 02:36, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was thinking this sentence "Anime is often influenced by Japanese <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comics.html" title="Comics">comics</a> known as <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a>." Would read better and be more accurate as something more like this. "Anime often draws influence from <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light_novel.html" title="Light novel">light novels</a>."</p>
<p>I don't really see the need to explain that manga is the japanese word for comic in the anime article, and this way you can also add in another major print media influence, light novels without the sentence sounding weird. Could probably go even a bit further and say it's not only influenced by, but often directly adapted from those sources.

<dl>
<dd>Yeah, there's plenty to object to that. I don't know how long you've been following anime, but anime's hardly been influenced by light novels. If anything, light novel authors have grown up watching anime, but there's hardly any anime creator who's grown up reading light novels. At most, light novels have become source material for recent anime shows, and I'll emphasize that this is a very recent trend. And it comes from major light novel publishers like Kadokawa Shoten financing the production of anime shows based on their light novel titles so as to promote the sales of books and related merchandise. You should look at who's putting up the money to get shows made before you start speculating about influences.--68.183.156.42 08:00, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I remember seeing a list of notable anime a few months back that had all of the most popular anime arranged by genre. I thought that that was a really good and effective way of presenting it, as well as something I've never seen before on any other anime site. I was thinking that this could be taken a step further for those who are interested:</p>
<p>Why not have a similar list of notable anime per genre, but also have it arranged by release date? Not only that, but let there be an "expand option" that lists not only the most popular anime, but all anime of that genre.

<dd>It was deleted because it was an attempt to recreate the deleted List of anime through the back door. On top of that, an anime wouldn't have an article in the first place if it wasn't notable.

<p>I must say that I also found the page of notable anime useful (in the extreme, actually). Although it is contentious by nature, I think that it should be recreated, albeit under a different title (critically acclaimed anime). Entries included should, of course, provide sources. Just becuase it's contentious by nature, doesn't mean it shouldn't exist. Perhaps it should exist, but with a tag warning of subjectivity at the top of the page. <a href="../../../b/f/b/User%7EBfbbrown_612a.html" title="User:Bfbbrown">Bfbbrown</a> 02:37, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Loveless is given as an example of yaoi in the "Anime" article. But in the Loveless article it is called shonen-ai.

<p>Under this heading I was expecting to find Akira and Ghost in the Shell at least, maybe even Ranma 1/2, Tenchi Muyo, or Vampire Hunter D. (No, I'm not an obsessed bitter fan of all these) The first two specifically, and others released in the States by Manga, Pioneer Video, ADV, etc. are primarily responsible for the recent Anime explosion that has been going on that many mistakenly believe started with Pokemon. It just hit the mainstream with Pokemon. All these had video releases and spread pretty much word of mouth as they had very little if any television airing. Why leave out these out? Surely wiki authors here know that anime in Japan is not "just for kids" or young adults, despite sex and violence being more accepted in kids shows, but another medium. So why are they left out? I'm not asking for every title to be listed: Battle Angel, Patlabor The Movie, Ninja Scroll, Armitage III, etc... Akira &amp; Ghost in the Shell were very fundamental in the growing acceptance of anime in the US and worldwide. GitS has even influenced the creators of The Matrix movies they admit. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeriGGlater_a558.html" title="User:VeriGGlater">VeriGGlater</a> 01:04, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Probably because they weren't "early". None of those were released in the States until 1990 or so, and there are many, many series which were released in the States before that: Speed Racer, Astro Boy, Gigantor, Star Blazers, Voltron, and so on.

<dd>But the ones mention by the article were on television (in the States anyway) as 'regular' cartoons. It was not until the 90s that anime started to be released as 'cartoons from Japan' AND with options of the original language with subtitles. Thus the realization that these cartoons came from Japan. But my main point is that Akira &amp; GitS were THE two that really got the ball rolling on 'cartoons from Japan' i.e. anime in the States and subsequently hit mainstream with Pokemon. At this point everybody knew it (Pokemon) was from Japan. That may be a result of a more general 'things from Japan are cool' and/or the video game, but the fact of the matter is, the 'early' anime in the US, as listed in the article so far, were viewed as just another cartoon outside of small populations with connections to Japan. <i>Outside Japan, the term most popularly refers to animation originating in Japan.</i> Likewise the use of the term "anime" outside Japan was not used except for relatively small populations with Japan connections. Maybe I have a US centric point of view on this and maybe Speed Racer, Astro Boy, etc. in say, Turkey, were called anime when (if) they were aired around the time they first came out. I understand the term "anime" (in the States) originating around the of Akira, GitS, et al. If we use the term "anime" as it is used outside Japan, Akira &amp; GitS, specifically the former, really made Japanese animation, anime, into a world-wide phenomenon and most definately marking points in the history of the medium. Therefore, I believe, this chunk of "early anime in the US", as I believe I tried to give some further definition to above, is noteworthy. <b>Sailor Moon, Dragonball Z, Pokémon, Yu-Gi-Oh, and Gundam Wing are all listed under the heading in question</b> and these are late 90s, early 2000s past Akira, GitS, et el. Also under the heading is the line <i>A great many anime films and feature-length TV series compilations were also released direct-to-video in the U.S.</i> Perhaps the history making Akira, GitS should be mentioned here. Does that make any sense to anybody other than me? I clicked on the titles listd under <i>direct-to-video</i> and the seem to all be rather obscure titles. I do not understand why Akira and GitS are not mentioned here? They are not any more risque than uncensored versions of other titles mentioned in the article. Not that that would/should be a factor since animation in Japan, anime, is not "just for kids" or young adults, but another medium entirely. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeriGGlater_a558.html" title="User:VeriGGlater">VeriGGlater</a> 01:48, 3 Febuary 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Admittedly there are some opinions in my above post on this talk page. But one cannot deny that the word anime did not enter US vernacular until Akira, GitS era, early to mid-90s. This is also the time that anime started to be released in the US with original voices/subtitled making it notably animation from Japan. Lastly, that Akira is primarily responsible for making anime a world-wide phenomena is also not mere opinion. That is widely understood. Read any book published in English on anime and I doubt if this last point would not be mentioned. An interesting book on anime and its historical/sociological impact is the art book put together by Takashi Murakami titled "Little Boy: The Arts of Japan's Exploding Subculture". If one doubts the worldwide impact of Akira, one could read the several essays by multiple artists in this book which is written simultaneously in English and Japanese on the same page. A truly fascinating read even if you do not agree with me on this page. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeriGGlater_a558.html" title="User:VeriGGlater">VeriGGlater</a> 11:03, 3 Febuary 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm, perhaps I am a part of this so-called "small populations with connections to Japan" that I speak and used the term "anime" before it hit mainstream at the time of Pokemon, Sailor Moon, etc. The point on Akira &amp; GitS though, is hardly an opinion.

<dd>I am really surprised that Akira was not mentioned in the article. I'll scour all the books on anime at the public and college libraries in town and get the "Little Boy" book through interlibrary loan (a library in the neighboring county has a copy of it) so it may take a while - give me three weeks, but I am sure every book on the topic would note its significance. Unless you've come into anime in the later 90s, it is difficult for me to understand how this has been passed up. I only own the dvd and two issues of the Akira manga, so I'd hardly call myself a crazed fan. Crazed and a fan perhaps, but not a crazed fan. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeriGGlater_a558.html" title="User:VeriGGlater">VeriGGlater</a> 15:34, 3 Febuary 2007 (UTC) I would like to note that I hope this does not sound like I'm saying, "I was here before and therefore you must just not get it."

<p><i>A great many anime films and feature-length TV series compilations were also released direct-to-video in the U.S., and were often available for rental at mainstream video stores.</i> The article notes, and then lists a whole slew of little known titles(in the US at least). (I know that just because I've never heard of any of them doesn't mean they are unknown. Others such as Atom and the White Lion many have heard of, the one's listed, I'm not sure I can find many who have). Listed here should be the Akiras, the Ghost in the Shells, and the Vampire Hunter Ds (which I personally didn't care that much for). Just about every video rental place in town had these, but the ones listed..., maybe they were placed in the children's section because they certainly weren't in the "Japanimation" (as it was more often called than "anime" back then) section of our town's video stores. I'm still waiting on the "Little Boy" book, btw. But have picked up other books and they all seem to note Akira's significance. Just no stats of sales, which would a piss poor way to measure the significance of something. Akira did not do very well in its native Japan, but was huge throughout the rest of the world. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeriGGlater_a558.html" title="User:VeriGGlater">VeriGGlater</a> 14:57, 12 Febuary 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>You are probably right. I was just surprised there was such a gap in the history and I truly believe anime would not be as big as it is today (in the States) were it not for the likes of Akira and GitS (and specifically those two). My opinion perhaps, but oh well.

<dd>What exactly do you mean by the term "gourmet" though? As far as I know I have never heard of it as an actual genera, but usually only in the context of "must see", "classic", or "top shelf" anime.

<dd>Maybe we shouldn't have a list of genres on the page at all. We certainly don't need examples of each genre since the pages they are linking to should be giving that sort of information.

<dd>I disagree, the section with the genres is relevant to the overall introduction to the subject of anime and the genres that are listed should be unique to anime as a style of animation. I have gone ahead and removed MeruPuri (perhaps the original editor was thinking of something else?) and the rest of the titles should be checked at some point to ensure that they are accurate representations of the genre they are associated with on the page. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkstar949_7f19.html" title="User:Darkstar949">Darkstar949</a> 12:51, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I suppose, right? How hard could it be to find such a source? Just about every person from Japan that I've ever met has all but acknowledged this in writing (I'm talking from the mid-90s on mostly, but some post Pokemon period as well) and none of them necessarily consider themselves Otaku or big fans. The reason I wish we could get this is in the States it seems some people (actually a lot, too many)(in the US) despise the animation medium as children's stuff. But then again, those people I meet (US people) aren't really the types to be into foreign films either. Also, 60% of all books and magazines sold in Japan are comic books, aka manga, according to Murakami in a book he edited "Little Boy". What are the figures for animated programs, movies, etc...? <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeriGGlater_a558.html" title="User:VeriGGlater">VeriGGlater</a> 13:47, 21 March 2007</dd>
