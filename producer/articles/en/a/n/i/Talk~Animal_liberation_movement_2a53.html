<p>I've restored that the UK is seen as the "Afghanistan" of the animal rights movement, because this is a widely held belief (all the animal rights books acknowledge it, most of the leading activists are there, and the ALF was founded there, as well as groups like BUAV), and I've supplied a reference to a BBC interview. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:36, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just a quick note as to the loaded term 'Moral'. Moral implies the politics of god, whereas ethics are logic based. Most AR activists I’d say are asking animals be brought into ethical consideration.<a href="../../../x/a/n/User%7EXanax_04fb.html" title="User:Xanax">Xanax</a> 04:19, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Once again just some thoughts to provoke some productive discussion. Violence seems to be a recurring theme in all the AR pages, and yet I can think of only less than 10 physically violent attacks on people, albiet all very recently. Where as AR activists claim to have members killed <a href="http://www.arkangelweb.org/barry/violence.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.arkangelweb.org/barry/violence.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.arkangelweb.org/barry/violence.shtml</a>. There are however huge ammounts of threats made by ARM or ALF, but very few seem to be actually followed up, and when they are its usually with what the eupthamistically call 'economic sabotage'. Arguable of course propety damage is a form of emotional abuse towards the victims. I think we have to be very careful to establish a NPOV on this one as we have people screaming terrorists on one side and people screaming murderer scum on the other!

-What about Animal Right's violence against......animals?

<dd>The claim that "animal rights" is less POV than "animal liberation" is in my mind ridiculous. Suggesting that animals have rights is about as POV as suggesting animals should be liberated. Regardless, a cursory glance across Google and some encyclopedias (for example <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/65/an/animalri.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bartleby.com/65/an/animalri.html" rel="nofollow">Columbia</a>) seems to suggest that "animal rights" is more common than "animal liberation". —<a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabbe_a391.html" title="User:Gabbe">Gabbe</a> 12:04, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I understand that the idea of "animal rights" is framed around the same premises as "<a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights.html" title="Human rights">human rights</a>", namely that animals are endowed with an inherent dignity that must not be violated. The term "animal liberation" was coined by the ethicist <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Singer_cbda.html" title="Peter Singer">Peter Singer</a>, whose ideas I'm familiar with through second-hand accounts only. As far as I know – SV, please correct me here – his work is built around the theme of social interaction and self-awareness, that is the idea of "animal personhood" adequately expressed by "animal rights". <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 16:25, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another note on usage: the OED says about <i>animal liberation</i>: "animal liberation, the act or process of freeing animals from exploitation (e.g. in laboratory experiments) by man; applied chiefly attrib. to groups dedicated to this, as Animal Liberation Front; hence animal liberationist" <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 16:28, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Singer is a utilitarian, meanly broadly that he believes a good act is one that leads to the greatest happiness of the greatest number. This means he is a consequentialist, arguing that the value of an act lies in its consequences (although it's more complicated than that), and that acts do not have a value in and of themselves, which is called the teleological view. He therefore supports animal liberation, not from a rights perspective, but on the basis of the amount of pain that is caused, arguing that the most important interests of millions of animals are routinely sacrificed to protect the most trivial interests of our own; for example, cramming chickens into spaces so small they have no room to move, in order to make Chicken McNuggets as cheaply as possible; herding buffalo into small spaces so that rich tourists can shoot and pretend to have hunted them. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 16:34, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks. That was me aiming beside the point then (discussing the issue instead of the movement).

<dd>We're not here to parrot the BBC. The AL movement is how they refer to themselves and largely how academics refer to them.

<dd>"Animal rights movement" is the commonly encountered term, even if it mischaracterizes the motivations of its members. <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAME_8ce9.html" title="WP:NAME">WP:NAME</a> states "Generally, article naming should give priority to what the majority of English speakers would most easily recognize".

<dd>The article itself states that the AL/AR movement is not an unified movement with a common philosophy but rather a disparate group of individuals and groups opposed to the use of animals. Saying that "the movement" calls itself anything would be a bit presumptuous, considering how diverse it is. As far as the academic use of AL vs AR goes, <i>Nature</i>, the prime source for academic news and policy in Europe, has 61 occurrences of "animal rights" and 7 occurrences of "animal liberation", all referring to groups opposing animal experimentation. The Citation Index has 4 hits for "animal liberation movement" from 1984 till now and 72 hits for "animal rights movement"; the keyword "animal rights" often occurs together with "vivisection", indicating that "animal rights movement" is used to refer to groups opposed to animal experimentation. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 20:48, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's already in the article, where we say "There is evidence of prior cooperation the BUAV and the ALF: for example, BUAV used to donate office space for the use of ALF in Britain" with a ref.

<dd>AR, there's no page number so I can't see which part of the book you're referring to. Can you give me a page number so I can look it up? You're almost certainly thinking of Ronnie Lee using some office space in the 70s or so. But there's nothing in that section of the book (or anywhere else that I know of) about BUAV being involved in any recruitment. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 11:16, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is "Valerie's Story", the story by which Valerie found Ronnie Lee (of ALF) through Kim Stallwood (of BUAV), who then directed Valerie to an ALF activism camp.

<dl>
<dd>Yes, but Valerie was not recruited by the BUAV, nor did they assist with any recruitment. She told them she was doing research; I think she may have said she was a journalist and wanted to interview Ronnie Lee. That's why they put her in touch with him. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 12:19, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>AR, that's POV editing at its worst, and you know it. The BUAV guy did not know he was introducing her as an activist. The BUAV is implaccably opposed to violence or direct action. If you don't know that, then with respect, you don't know much about them, so please do some reading before jumping to conclusions. They're one of the oldest and most respected animal protection organizations in the world. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 14:55, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If they were implaccably opposed to violence or direct action they would not have donated office space to ALF, or acted as a conduit for people to communicate with ALF.--Animalresearcher 15:35, 11 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Your argument holds no ground AR. Firstly, the contact was made as they thought it was for research, which I think you will agree is not the same as supporting direct action. Secondly, the office space was donated a long time ago and is a minor example - and putting emphasis on it gives it undue weight.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 16:45, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

So what? BUAV didn't know who she was or what she wanted.</dd>
<dd>I'm disappointed in this, AR. You say you're a research scientist, but that means you're used to interpreting data and texts and understand the importance of being very accurate. We need the same commitment to accuracy on Wikipedia. You're editing the animal rights articles with the sole aim of attacking ideas and people you don't like.

<dd>Introducing someone to a covert operative is still a form of support/cooperation. I suggest if you have a hard time with BUAV's public image being consistent with their referenced former actions, you introduce new cited verifiable material that they no longer support the ALF in such a way.

<p>(unindent) It is your opinion that putting a researcher in touch with someone is support - I think it is simply putting them in touch with someone. To state otherwise is opinion. According to <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronnie_Lee_c348.html" title="Ronnie Lee">Ronnie Lee</a>, Lee and Stallwood did not agree on the merits of direct action.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 21:33, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Saying Lee and Stallwood did not agree on the merits of direct action is different from saying X helped Lee and his colleagues at various points. Here is an example to demonstrate the value of that communication. How much money do you think the British police would need to have paid X to find the ALF training camp? If the answer is zero, then the communication is worthless. I think that even if millions of pounds were offered, X would not help the police. The US branch of ALF founded by Valerie has done over a hundred million dollars of damage according to <i>Animal People</i>. --Animalresearcher 21:46, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are over-reacting. I posed a <b>clearly</b> hypothetical scenario set at a time (check the verb tense if you didn't edit it when you were putting words in my mouth) in which BUAV was providing the ALF with office space and helping potential journalists find Lee who could direct them to ALF training camps (according to Newkirk). I in no way intended to insinuate (nor did I insinuate) that ANY current member of BUAV could help the police find ANY active ALF training camp. The point had been put forth that helping a potential journalist find Lee did not constitute help or cooperation. I think it clearly does. But if you find Newkirk not to be reliable on the matter, we can omit all the things referenced in her book from that page and other pages (including <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronnie_Lee_c348.html" title="Ronnie Lee">Ronnie Lee</a>). There has been more than one suggestion that that particular segment of her book is fictional or was at least staged (ie: Valerie could have been a PETA employee at the time and afterwards and the entire training camp segment was pre-arranged - this is speculative). And in the future I would appreciate that if you insist on putting words in my mouth, you take credit for it. --Animalresearcher 01:19, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As for the edits, first of all understand that there was no animal liberation movement during the Third Reich. Kathleen Kete mistakes anti-vivisectionists for animal rights activists, when in fact many people oppose vivisection on animal welfare grounds alone. However, as Kete does make the mistake and counts as a reliable source, we have to repeat the mistake when we cite her. But we can't repeat it without citing her or citing someone else who says the same thing. Therefore, my question is: what do the following two paragraphs have to do with animal rights according to the sources?</dd>

<dd>As you have mentioned before, SV, the animal liberation movement has its origins in the animal welfare movement, so yes the anti-vivisectionist movemnt (be it on rights or welfare grounds) is related to the animal rights movement.

<dd>The crucial point is that you can't call any attempt to change conditions for animals "animal rights" or say that it came from the "animal rights movement." There are plenty of anti-vivisectionist groups who aren't AR, and that was particularly the case in Nazi Germany. There's no indication whatsoever that Germany had any AR legislation or planned to. That's why I made the point that Britain's anti-vivisection legislation was the same as Germany's. Both acted out of animal welfare concerns, and whether anyone agrees with them or not, there's no evidence at all that it had anything to do with AR. Indeed the animal rights movement didn't even exist then. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 03:41, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Localzuk, I looked again at the Animal rights and the Holocaust page, and it wouldn't be appropriate there because that's about the use of the comparison. Maybe we should just merge the Kete material in here as it is now, and anything else that's mergeable, and delete AR and AS. We could ask an uninvolved editor to supervise the merge to make sure it's done neutrally if that would help. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:23, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, the AR and the Holocaust article is not really the appropriate place.

<p>Overlooking yet another ridiculous "omg SV is evil pov warrior" screed-rant at the AN, I was flipping through the whole animal rights/welfare/liberation series of articles. I noticed that there is no section on criticisms of the animal liberation movement. Any particular reason why not? --<font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="SteelBlue">Elar</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a_7dff.html" title="User:Elaragirl/a"><font color="orange"><b>a</b></font></a><font color="SteelBlue">girl</font><small><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a>|Count</sup></small></font> 22:32, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi Elaragirl, it depends which articles you've looked at. Most of the AR articles I've worked on have criticism woven throughout the text, where the context is explained, rather than having a POV magnet section called "criticism"; see, for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=People_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals&amp;oldid=89551800" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=People_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals&amp;oldid=89551800" rel="nofollow">People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals</a>, giving you the last version I can vouch for. Or an article about an activist: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barry_Horne&amp;oldid=89552452" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barry_Horne&amp;oldid=89552452" rel="nofollow">Barry Horne</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's especially important with animal rights topics to allow the facts to speak for themselves, and not label things "criticism," because something that one person regards as criticism, an AR activist might regard as neutral or even praise. For example, PETA is often "accused" of supporting the ALF. But in fact it does so openly and proudly, and its members have written about that support themselves. So to put that in a criticism section would be to buy into the POV that support for the ALF is something PETA should be criticized for.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you were looking specifically at the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_liberation_movement.html" title="Animal liberation movement">Animal liberation movement</a> article, it's a mess and needs a lot of work, as does <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_rights.html" title="Animal rights">Animal rights</a>, which is very poor.

<dd>Hi, Slim. Please <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> before accusing me of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> in the edit summary. It's one thing to say that about an editor who does it as a habit, but I don't, nor do I have any record of doing so in the past. To address your questions, what you find "self-explanatory" may indicate your emotional investment in the article, rather than a NPOV. You admit in a previous comment above that the article needs work, yet you defend that version from improvement. I added the cite tag to the lead, as there is no source given for using the fringe term "Animal Liberation Movement" over the common, and widely used term <i>Animal Rights movement</i>. The lead also neglects to mention the common term, <i>animal rights activists</i>, even though you have forced that term to redirect here. Neutral sources are required for those two items. I've been working on countercultural social movements for some time, and have written about them for years. My research indicates that the article should be named <i>Animal rights movement</i>, with a separate article on "Animal rights activism", and either a list or a category containing <i>Animal rights activists</i>. This standard apparoach holds true for most articles on movements, activism, and activists. As for Singer's opinion about diet and activism, I would like to see the data, and I would question how stats from 1975 apply today, and whether the movement includes a significant number of meat-eaters, and conclude that the broad movement is dominated by meat eaters. You are probably aware that some of Singer's ideas have been proven incorrect since 1975, such as his assumption that <a href="../../../m/o/l/Mollusk.html" title="Mollusk">mollusks</a> can't feel pain or pleasure (see the <a href="../../../o/c/t/Octopus.html" title="Octopus">Octopus</a>). Again, please do not continue to remove cite requests. It is perfectly reasonble for you to ask why, but skeptical, critical thinkers will see many problems with this topic, so please, take a step back, and read the article with fresh eyes. I know you run the Animal rights WikiProject, and it may benefit you to make that project a direct descendent of the Philosophy project, to enable neutral editors to have more oversight on this matter. In the short term, you can also create workgroups that interface with other projects to allow for constructive criticism. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 04:48, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why do you think that animal liberation movement is a "fringe" term? It gets 38,000 Google hits. Why should the lead include the phrase "animal rights activists? It says "activists," and this is an article about the animal rights movement, so it's probably not referring to anti-abortion activists. I have no idea what you mean by your research showing etc. It sounds like your OR. We don't need a separate list of activists, for reasons that have been explained several times by several people, people on both sides of the pro- and anti-AR divide. Please provide a source for your "standard approach," because I genuinely don't know what you mean. I didn't give you information from 1975; as the citation makes clear, there was an edition in 1990. Do you have a source showing there's a significant number of meat-eaters in the AR movement? That would be astonishing. I don't run the wikiproject, and why would it have to be a descendent of any other project? We have neutral editors; we have pro editors; we have anti editors. Honestly, V, I don't know what you're trying to achieve, but I can't keep responding to these comments. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:03, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi. I think you are aware that the google test is relatively unimportant, especially when activist groups use google bombs to manipulate search results. For what it's worth, have you checked how many hits ARM receives? Neutral, reliable, published sources use "Animal rights movement" to describe this topic. The term, "animal rights activists" is a common term used to describe some members; the activists aren't called "animal liberation activists". I can't respond to the OR claim, since it seems your refusal to cite a source for the lead is just that. I made a perfectly reasonable request. Regarding the 1990 edition, do you know if that is updated info from 1975, and if so, what study is Singer using? The standard approach for categorization is well founded, and the Animal rights WikiProject does not control articles related to politics and sociology, nor has any reasonable justification been supplied for removing, redirecting, and deleting such lists and categories that help users find information. You created the WikiProject, and when I tried to communicate with other members, you took control of the discussions. You don't need to reply to my comments, but you must stop engaging in WP:OWN. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 05:22, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have the 1990 edition. It has been updated; that's probably why it was published. I have no idea what studies he used, if any. What do you think the difference is between the terms "animal rights movement" and "animal liberation movement"? And no one took "control of the discussions." People with very different views disagreed with you. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:48, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The claim in question, "The vast majority of animal rights advocates adopt vegetarian or vegan diets" should be supported by additional, neutral sources. If you have Singer's book, you could provide the context of the claim, and find any supporting footnotes. As for the difference between the two terms, that's a question you should answer. Singer used the term in the title of his book and other activists have discussed evolving animal rights into animal liberation, so the question really is, what do activists mean by it, not what I think it means. You took control of the discussion when you moved it from the neutral category talk page to WikiProject Animal rights. When replies were made under headings to particular users, you replied instead. I don't see any disagreement, only a refusal to allow activists to be categorized or put into a list, with no actual reason cited. I also see an attempt at intimidation on your part. It doesn't matter, because you don't control political and sociological categorizations, and discussion will be requested from others who have neutral views on categorization. I'm not here to discuss that subject. I'm here to improve this article. Please walk away from this subject for a while and work on other things. Like you said above, this is low on your list of priorities. If you want to engage me, leave a message here. I may not respond quickly enough (something you referred to as ignoring people, merely because I'm not online as much as you are). Just let me edit this article without having to deal with your repeated edit warring. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 06:23, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm going to ignore your intimidation tactics, which only serve to change the subject. I've already explained my knowledge of the subject previously. The onus is on you to source the lead and demonstrate Singer's sweeping claim. The requested move citations and discusssion above show there is no basis for calling ARM the ALM. And, for more information on evolving the animal rights movement, read George Cave. It is not knowledge that improves an article, but the right application of knowledge, and more importantly, a neutral, historical perspective. I hope your next act is to source the lead and to find a neutral source for Singer's claim, otherwise I will tag this article again. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 01:11, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have no idea what you're talking about. What intimidation tactics. What sweeping claim? You put a fact template after the sentence:
<dl>
<dd>"The <b>animal liberation movement</b> or <b>animal rights movement</b>, also sometimes called the <b>animal <a href="../../../p/e/r/Person.html" title="Person">personhood</a> movement</b>, is the worldwide movement of activists, academics, lawyers, campaigns, and organized groups who oppose or engage in direct action against the use of non-human animals in research, as food, as clothing, or as entertainment."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>But you didn't say which part you wanted a source for, and the sentence as a whole is so obviously true, that requesting a citation looks like WP:POINT or something. In fact, I'm going to use it the next time we have policy discussions about people misusing WP:V. You did the same after the sentence:
<dl>
<dd>"The vast majority of animal rights advocates adopt <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegetarian.html" title="Vegetarian">vegetarian</a> or <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegan.html" title="Vegan">vegan</a> diets ..."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Asking for a citation for this is almost as bad. I gave you Singer, a professor of philosophy who has written extensively about the animal rights movement, but now you say you want a "neutral" source. Neutral sources are not required under WP:V, only reliable ones, and academics in relevant fields are regarded as reliable. I'm also not sure there's any such thing as a neutral source in the area of animal rights.</dd>
<dd>You've also tried to make a distinction between the expressions "animal rights movement" and "animal liberation movement," but you won't say what the distinction is, in your view. Read what George Cave? Your half-responses aren't helping me to work out what your concerns are, and yet you regard attempts to clarify as "intimidation." I am therefore mystifed by what you're seeking to achieve. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:42, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You have repeatedly established that whatever <i>you</i> personally believe is "self-explanatory" or "so obviously true" does not require sourcing. It is not WP:POINT to gently remind you that it does, and for the reasons I have given you. And, if these things are so obvious, then it should only take you a minute to find a neutral source and cite it. Instead, you engage in intimidation, attempting to discourage me from pursuing neutral sourcing in the face of your alleged superiour wisdom. And, when you denied it, you proceeded to do it again, this time threatening to make an example of me in a policy discussion. This approach isn't conducive to WP:CIV nor WP:AGF, and you do it to intimidate and distract away from the topic. To summarize, I have requested sources for the lead section and the statement about diet. I will be requesting more. The animal rights movement is broad, and in order to define its members we must understand its boundaries. As for the sweeping claim about diet, I am again asking for the context of Singer's observation, and would like to know what study this was based upon. Of course, this claim should be attributed and put into chronological context. These are reasonable requests, all of which lead to improving the article. Your response is not one I would expect from someone interested in working cooperatively to make this article more accurate. The title is not supported, nor is the lead. There are questions about neutrality. This is not rocket science, and should be easy to solve with the addition of balanced sources. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 04:31, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Whenever I ask you a question, you say I'm trying to intimidate, which is hardly conducive to collaboration either. At the risk of intimidating still further, I have to ask you what you mean by "the title is not supported," and what "chronological context" means in the context of animal rights advocates being vegetarian/vegan. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 04:56, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have made it quite clear that your tactics of intimidation had nothing to do with any questions you asked. The title of the article is not supported, hence my request for sourcing in the lead. If we assume Singer's claim is true, we can also assume it was added in the 1990 ed, and that prior to the 90s, ARA's did not embrace veg diets in large numbers. One critical source for this claim is Carl Cohen's 1986 article in <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i>. Comparative chronology can set the tone, structure, and focus of an article, and help resolve contradictions. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 05:39, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"The title is not supported" is about as clear as possible, so I don't understand your difficulty. Naming conventions require the most common, accurate, and appropriate title, and this varies by topic.

<dd>Writers use animal rights and animal liberation movement interchangeably.

<dd>I found the Cohen article.

<dd>I remember his comment appearing at the end of the article. I'm not at home, but from memory I think I can recall his main point. Cohen argued that the tenets of the mid-1980s animal rights movement necessitated vegetarianism, and he criticized the movement for not following through, observing that only a tiny minority of the movement adhered to such a diet. His standard of evidence is on par with Singer's, so if we assume both claims are true, the ARM did not embrace a veg diet/lifestyle until the late 1980s, early 90s. It is incorrect to state that the members of the animal rights movement have always been vegetarian. Another reason I asked for a neutral source for your definition of the ARM is due to its broad scope, which may include groups who are not dedicated to vegetarianism. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 06:28, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't see anything like that in the Cohen article. Anyway, our article says "The vast majority of animal rights advocates adopt vegetarian or vegan diets ..."; it doesn't say anything about "always."</dd>

<dd>Would you please answer the question? Which groups that support animal rights do not support vegetarianism? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 11:43, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cohen was pointing out what he saw as the reductio ad absurdum in the animal rights argument: "One cannot coherently object to the killing of animals in biomedical investigations while continuing to eat them...wearing hides...employment in any industrial enterprise that uses animal parts...any commercial development that will cause death or distress to animals....Scrupulous vegetarianism...is the only fully coherent position the critic may adopt...the lives of fish and crustaceons must also be protected...very few consistent critics adopt this position." In 1989, Laurence Pringle wrote, "...some vegetarians support the use of animals in medical research. Within the animal rights movement there are many who still eat meat. Their goal is a better life for the animals they consume." Pringle goes on to cite Noel Perrin and James Cargile. He also claims that many members of the animal rights movement do not support all of Singer's or Regan's ideas, both of whom demand mandatory vegetarianism. So it appears that you are arguing for only one view of the animal rights movement, hence the need for the NPOV tag. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 11:11, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But who is Laurence Pringle? We have to use sources who know something about the movement. Of course not all members of the movement support Singer or Regan's ideas; why would they? Cohen's argument is a good one, but the words "very few consistent critics adopt this position" are not in the article, so far as I can see. Which paragraph are they in? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 11:41, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Pringle is a wildlife biologist, former editor, and writer. I only offered Pringle and Cohen for discussion; I don't intend on adding them to the article. You can find a copy of Cohen's article here: <a href="http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~norcross/Cohen.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~norcross/Cohen.pdf" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. Due to his writing style, it's somewhat ambiguous if he was referring to vegetarians in particular (or just commenting about fish) so I may have been reading too much into it. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 12:47, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cohen wasn't being serious with the last point about fish. It was (in his view, but not really) a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of the animal rights position. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:53, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, although there is also some truth to it. It's a minor point, but his opinion of animal testing is far more relevant. I took a look at the print version of the Encyclopædia Britannica today, and although it is slightly biased in favor of the AR position, it is a good example of the direction this article should be moving towards. The article should be changed to Animal rights movement, as that is the most common term. This particular article seems to focus on the <i>modern</i>, post-1975 ARM, and an effort needs to be made to integrate this distinction into <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_rights.html" title="Animal rights">Animal rights</a> or to distinguish between ARM and ALM. I am still awaiting good, neutral sources for using ALM to describe the ARM, which is inaccurate from an historical perspective. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 02:32, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wish you'd explain the distinction you're making between ARM and ALM, because I genuinely don't get it. Also, the modern animal rights movement is all there is. It started in the UK in the 70s. There are earlier animal welfare, animal protection, animal advocacy groups, but not animal rights/liberation, and not global i.e. not a movement as such. Not a coherent philosophy. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 03:09, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why is this article named <i>Animal liberation movement</i>? I'll address your other comments later. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 10:02, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think SlimVirgin adequately covered that earlier when she said <i>Writers use animal rights and animal liberation movement interchangeably. If anything, the latter is more inclusive, because although not all liberationists are rightists, all rightists are liberationists.</i> It allows the article to cover those people who support the concept of animal rights and are part of the animal liberation movement and it also allows the article to support those who are liberationists but don't support the concept of animal rights. As we both have said, your persistence on trying to remove this term simply shows that you do not know much about the movement in general. Please realise that the 2 terms are relatively interchangeable but have slight differences (as described above).-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 10:02, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think you understand NPOV nor article naming conventions. You are also confusing an article about animal liberation philsophy with an article concerning the animal rights social movement. This is not a unique instance of this type of problem, which is solved by choosing the most common name (Animal rights movement) and linking to separate articles within it. In some cases, there may not even appear to be a "main" or "top" article, if the concepts involved reciprocally link to each other in both horizontal and vertical directions. Take a minute to make a diagram of concepts this article covers, and you will see the relationships emerge as subarticles, lists, and categories, with links to related concepts branching off in more directions. Animal liberation is contained by philosophy, while animal rights movement is a form of social movement. Animal rights activism links to the activism category that in turn contains animal rights activists. Subarticles may be contained by subcats appearing within each domain and in the parent. This system works in order to help readers, not editors. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 23:32, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To give one example from the sources: Angus Taylor, who lectures on ethics at the University of Victoria, talks about the animal liberation movement, and splits it into (a) rights liberationists, who believe that animals ought to have legal rights extended to them, and who may also believe animals have inherent moral rights, and (b) utilitarian liberationists, such as Peter Singer, who argue for animal liberation only on the basis of the greatest happiness of the greatest number, or some version thereof; that is on the basis of consequences, not rights. (Taylor, <i>Animals and Ethics</i>, p. 153 ff.) From this it can be seen that the animal rights movement is a subclass of the animal liberation movement. All who believe in rights are liberationists, but not all liberationists are rights theorists. That is why the article is called the animal liberation movement. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 10:47, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I understand this POV and would like to see it represented. However, we have naming conventions for a reason, and Taylor's opinion, while important to the philosophical discussion of animal rights, is given undue weight in the naming of an article that covers a social movement. This is not a unique situation and is a common problem faced by most editors. It is always solved by using the most common name, but giving fair treatment to related concepts. You have provided a valid reason for creating a new Animal liberation (philosophy) article, but Taylor's POV does not alter or change our approach to naming conventions. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 23:42, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
