<p>Hi - thanks for the message. The article is looking pretty good. From the description, it sounds a little like <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannae.html" title="Cannae">Cannae</a> (centre deliberately giving way and encirclement). Some ideas - it would be nice to have more details on the troops - numbers of cannon and horse, types of arms (swords, spears, etc), what kind of cannon - together with a map of the area of the battle (where the forces started, how they manoeuvred, etc).</p>
<p>It would be a good idea to ask the people at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Military_history_a13e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history">WikiProject Military history</a> what they think, and to go through <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_91e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review">Wikipedia:Peer review</a> before <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a>.</p>

<p>Anittas, don't be fooled by "Julia Radulescu". I have serious doubts that she is Romanian after having read these edits made by her in April of 2005:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bogdangiusca/Archive4&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=12474742" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bogdangiusca/Archive4&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=12474742" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bogdangiusca/Archive4&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=12540669" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bogdangiusca/Archive4&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=12540669" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

<dd>To avoid possible defamation, I erased my "she may be an ex-Neo Nazi" suspicion. I did not charge that she <i>is</i> an ex-Neo Nazi, just that I suspect she may be or may have hung out a lot with them, because her behavior reminds me of a chick who used to date gangsters and now wears a t-shirt around town that says "Gangters are not cool".

<p>Hello Anittas. Although your recent comments may not have been intended to cause offense, they clearly have done so. As a sign of good faith, I strongly urge you to post a note of retraction/explanation in order to put this behind us. If you did not mean to cause any offense, it truly is not worth going through an RfC and it is much better to remain in good standing with the community. Your refusal to retract or to respond to those whose feelings you have hurt would invariably affect your dealings with other Wikipedians in the future. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamallite_7adc.html" title="User:Ramallite">Ramallite</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamallite_904e.html" title="User talk:Ramallite"><font color="DarkBlue">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 13:52, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, and you have convinced some editors involved that your remarks were not meant to be anti semitic. But you were defending your comment without taking into account the hurt feelings it caused.

<dd>I'm convinced it was not meant to be anti-Semitic because it was directed at Node, and because I see no other indication of anti-Semitism in Anittas. But that last touch that he added, "A Jewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!" is hard to ignore (though I'm pretty sure Anittas was just f**** around). If only for that, Anittas should release a general apology. What's the big deal? What's it gonna cost you? You don't have to address your apology to Node.

<dd>Yes, Ukrainian is quite similar to Russian, just like the Romance languages are quite similar and to an extent mutually intelligible. But I don't think it can be argued that they are the same language, since they're not fully mutually intelligible and have structural differences. Belarusian is actually more similar to Russian, to the point where it could perhaps be considered a dialect, in the same way that Aromanian is considered a dialect of Romanian, but they are sufficiently different, both in heritage and linguistics, to place them as two separate languages. It's true, though, that there has been quite a lot of dislike between Russians and other East Slavic people, but that's because of Russian policy in the Soviet Union, which sought to assimilate the distinct Ukrainian and Belarusian cultures. Lukashenko is still very pro-Russian, and wants economic union, but nowadays Russia isn't so keen on this union. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 23:28, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Anittas. I don't agree with your changes at <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Moldova_e6d4.html" title="Republic of Moldova">Republic of Moldova</a> regarding Eminescu. Sure, he was Romanian, but he was also Moldavian, and is thus also claimed by Moldova, which sees itself, along with Romania, as the successor of the Moldavian Principality. Combine this with common language and culture, and many Moldovans regard what is Romania to also be part of their culture (after all, Moldovans are the same ethnicity as Romanians). Now, onto the broader issue - you must understand that not everyone is a Moldovan unionist, and that while culturally and ethnically, Moldovans are "Romanians", they are a separate state, and therefore, in the political sense, they do have self-determination. For that reason, Romanian hegemonism over Moldova is not justified in the same way that German hegemonism isn't justified over Austria. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 11:43, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
