<h2><span class="mw-headline">Churchill, again</span></h2>
<p>Sorry, I should have written 'partial revert', because some of the commas and other edits (such as hyphenations) were indeed in the correct place. The initial commas looked to be misplaced, as they broke up the flow of the sentence and made the style very 'choppy': a sentence reads better if it is not broken up into small phrases. The later edits seemed correct, and it would perhaps have been easier to just edit on top of yours.</p>
<p>If you compare the versions, most of the commas I removed were after the initial phrase of a sentence which set the event at a certain date. It is for these cases that I felt that breaking the sentences at this point would make the style very repetitive.</p>
<p>For the 'Graduating ...'/'After graduating ...' change, the reason that I removed the 'after' was because the two events are interlinked and one is a natural consequence of the other. At Sandhurst, you are already part of the army and just undergoing officer training, so the phrase is constructed to let you know that he became an officer at 21. (Actually, the sentence is probably still wrong and I should have changed the 'joined' to 'took up a posting' or something.) The website that you supplied looks really useful, and if I was to choose one of the options listed as the basis for restructuring the sentence, it would probably be the last. Maybe make the sentence read 'He took a posting as a subaltern ... on graduating from Sandhurst at the age of 21.'</p>
<p>In the sentence "Churchill also devoted his time to educating himself ...", the 'to' refers to 'his time': you could change it to "Churchill spent his time in educating himself ..." where the 'in' now refers to 'Churchill'. The end of the sentence "... from books which he had sent out" is equally confusing, because you are not sure if he had sent the books out before he went out to India, or if he <b>had had</b> them sent out to India by someone else while he was already there.</p>
<p>In general, I agree that the whole thing is a mess and well done for taking the effort to try and improve it. I hope I am not talking down to you: I noticed that you were Romanian from your talk page, and so I thought you would appreciate a more detailed explanation. English is very confusing because there are too many options to choose from.

<dd>Yes, the website that I posted clarified about the dangling modifiers, and that's why I think that it might be wrong to start the sentence with the word "Graduating". I think that if you want to use the "to" in the sentence about Churchill reading books, it should read like this:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>'Churchill also devoted his time <b>to educate himself</b> from books which he had sent out', instead of as we have now, "Churchill also devoted <b>his time to educating himself</b> from books which he had sent out". Maybe I'm reading it wrong.</p>
<p>I also disagree with you removing these commas:</p>
<p>While in the Sudan<b>[,]</b> Churchill participated in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Omdurman_0073.html" title="Battle of Omdurman">battle of Omdurman</a><b>[,]</b> the last British cavalry charge in battle.</p>
<p>By October <a href="../../../1/8/9/1898.html" title="1898">1898</a><b>[,]</b> he had returned to Britain and begun work on the 2 volume <i>The River War</i><b>[,]</b> published in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1899.html" title="1899">1899</a>.</p>
<p>I think those commas should be restored, as well as the rest of the commas that were used after a date. Perhaps we should ask someone more qualified, such as an English professor. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Anittas</a> 13:47, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Rape of the Sabine Women</span></h2>
<p>Maybe you should review the above mentioned "rape". The Sabines later married their Roman abductors. In fact, the Latin word "rapere" translates to "abduct." Have a look at <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=sabine+rape&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=sabine+rape&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=sabine+rape&amp;btnG=Google+Search</a> <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberevil_fd3a.html" title="User:Cyberevil">Cyberevil</a> 04:24, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sigh, I can only assume you are a tad ignorant of Roman mythology. The quote from Britannica only proves my point. No offense meant! <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberevil_fd3a.html" title="User:Cyberevil">Cyberevil</a> 04:27, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Romans requested neighbouring Sabines to let them marry some of their women but they were refused. The Romans then invited all their neighbours to a huge religious celebration in honour of Neptune. And they came, men, women and children. In the middle of the party, the younger Romans rushed in and carried off the Sabine women who were then raped to ensure the production of offspring.</p>

<dd>The woman who compiled the essay on the link you provided misunderstood the term just as you did. I also advised you to use Google to look this up first. Seriously, these women, just as your own links say, later helped the Romans defend their cities - against their own tribe. But I assume we won't reach consensus on this.

<dd>Well, can we agree on leaving that out of the article on "Rape" as it might be unclear? By the way, seeing that you are from Romania, I have a friend from there and thanks to her I had to listen to "Dragostea Din Tei" for most of last summer. That was not quite my style of music, but it struck me that Romanian possibly is the closest still spoken language to Latin. This being off topic, but debating with a Romanian about Roman mythology reminded me of it.

<p>Hi Anittas. I'd just like to say that it would be good if you could stop making anti-gay statements relating to Node. You have alluded, in a quite sarcastic and insulting tone, many times to the fact that he is gay, and I for one thing that's quite unacceptable (it amounts to discrimination based on sexual orientation). I haven't said anything until now, but looking back, I think you have said some quite hurtful things. I really don't see the reason behind it.

<p><br />
Ronline, I really don't think it is, or has been his intention to insult Node with such remarks, it's more like some sort of playful teasing of a user he often clashes with. I know Anittas pretty well from the Romania forum <a href="http://pub18.ezboard.com/fbalkansfrm10" class="external free" title="http://pub18.ezboard.com/fbalkansfrm10" rel="nofollow">http://pub18.ezboard.com/fbalkansfrm10</a> , and he has been quite consistent in his stand against homophobia there. So, to get to the point, I find it unlikely that his wish is to discriminate or genuinly offend Node based on his sexual orientation. Also, my impression after having read some of the two users's (often amusing) exchanges, Node appears to be playing along, rather than being offended. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnclation_5bb1.html" title="User:Anclation">Anclation</a> 12:12, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, OK then. I'm not against jokes and even personal discussions on Wikipedia, but I just think that the anti-gay "teasing", which I agree is not particularly grave, is still not appropriate. If his wish isn't to genuinely offend Node, and Node doesn't get offended, then I suppose it's OK. However, other than for "fun", I still don't see the reason behind it - if you have something against Node, then argue with him on that certain point. <i>Ad hominem</i> statements don't really go that far.

<dd>Anittas, seriously - I think it's time to stop. Anti-gay statements are not tolerated anywhere, and that includes Wikipedia. Be they jokes or be they serious, they're still anti-gay statements, and they qualify as a violation of the no personal attacks policy. This is not about who's involved anymore, it's not about political stances or strategic stances or revenge on other users, it's about discrimination and insult, <i>which is never positive</i>. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 06:01, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, there is. Because laughing at anyone because they're LGBT - or because they're of a different race, gender, appearance, etc - is discrimination under the vast majority of definitions.

<dd>The <a href="../../../l/g/b/LGBT_44e7.html" title="LGBT">LGBT</a> community refers to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. As to your comment on Alex's RfA, that was quite insulting to Jews. There is nothing wrong in saying "Node is not an (ethnic) Moldovan, he is a Jew". The problem, however, is the way you capitalised Jew and then said "You do not speak Moldovan, JEW!". This indicates an offensive <i>tone</i>. Also, just because someone is Jewish does not mean they can't have another nationality. Node can be a Moldovan Jew, just like there are Buddhist Moldovans and Christian Moldovans.

<p>Thank you, Anittas. But I've seen Node recently quite well understanding a conversation in Serbian at the Serbian Wikipedia Village pump. He seemed to understand Serbian very good, almost like he was a native speaker. However, you may be right, that actually was a sort of a simple conversation... I must say I'm quite confused now. And yes, I know that Node was supporting Moldavian Wikipedia. I liked that wiki because it was Cyrillic, and I like Cyrillic script very much.&#160;:) But, of course, there is no such thing as Moldavian, Montenegrin or Bosnian language...&#160;;) --<a href="../../../%D1%92/%D0%BE/%D1%80/User%7E%D0%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%92%D0%B5_%D0%94._%D0%91%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%9B_b2c7.html" title="User:Ђорђе Д.

<dd>I'm going to try to explain it all to you in good faith again. But what you wrote about Node is not necessarily a fact, in the first place. Secondly, context matters very much. So - Node never said that "he doesn't like girls". Additionally, the context in which you said it is discriminatory and insulting. It would be just like me saying "Hi. I'm Ronline. I'm white but User:XYZ is black" or "Hi. I'm Ronline. I'm atheist but User:XYZ is Muslim". Do you see why that's discriminatory? It's picking out a user in particular for a certain trait such as race or sexual orientation, and that's discrimination. And I hope you understand why the picture of Node on your talk page is totally inappropriate. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 05:59, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But the discriminatory part is still there. As long as Node is mentioned, it remains discriminatory. As I said above, if I said "I'm white. XYZ is black", that's discriminatory, because it's singling XYZ out in an arbitrary way for no reason other than to insult him/her, or show that he is different. You're doing the exact same thing to Node.

You know that it serves no function other than to make fun of Node, and is hence an insult. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 06:33, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>I think that editors have to ask themselves whether the image serves in any way to help build an encyclopaedia or whether it is in any way damaging. I think it's the latter and I'm going to edit your userpage in accordance with that view. I urge other editors to do the same. We should not defend attacks on other editors, whether they're made with words, pictures or whatever form. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_James_2d06.html" title="User:James James">James James</a> 06:44, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. Since I'm an inclusionst, my argument is not whether the image helps to build an encyclopedia - it's on a user page, after all - but whether it insults other users. That image does insult others (in this case, Node ue) and for that reason it should be removed. This argument is not about the picture itself, but about the usage/context of the picture. Finally, and I've said this to you so many times, I don't understand what your reason for this is. By launching ad hominem attacks against Node, you're not helping anyone. If you have something against Node in terms of content disputes or differing points of view, raise this with him and use argument and fact, not personal attacks. If you feel he's behaved outside of policy, then go through the dispute resolution steps. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 06:49, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That argument doesn't hold. I can claim to be offended by a user who has a photo of a tree posted on his userpage, but that doesn't mean that he must remove it. When he released the photo, he agreed to have it released and being used by Wikipedia. When you release a photo, you agree that the photo might be used on Wikipedia - regardless of the location. If you then say that you feel insulted that the photo is used in a place where you don't want it to be...well, too bad. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Anittas</a> 06:55, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anittas, this is <i>not</i> about mercy, it's not about conspiracy or anything like that. You make it seem as if this is some kind of war, and that you're fighting some sort of noble battle against "the enemies of the state" or the like. It's none of that. All I'm asking is that you stop making any sort of significant personal attacks that actually insult people and make them feel bad. That doesn't mean I'm trying to censor your speech. Everyone here has told you this very nicely and with a lot of understanding so far. However, your attitude has been to just dismiss them and say "I can do as I want. I don't care what you say. Go and complain about me. I don't care." I think that attitude will cause problems in the future, particulary when so many users have <i>genuine, good faith</i> concerns about your activity here. I'm not starting an RfArb for the moment, for two reasons:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>You were blocked for 24 hours, and hence "punished" for at least part of the personal attacks. Hence, you can't be punished twice for the same thing.</li>
<li>You did try to understand what I was saying in terms of the "Node doesn't like girls" issue, and you did take steps to rectify that.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, I really think it's important for you to just consider your actions and whether they've been good or civil. Remember, no-one here is against you and no-one here wants to find reasons to ban you. All we're looking for is for you to stop acting inappropriately and to work more collaboratively with other users. You've been given so many chances until now. I don't know why you like testing everyone's patience and good faith. It's not nice. Finally, as I have <i>always</i> said, I don't know why you're trying to play the bad guy here, why you're continuing to be stubborn and to talk to users in the way you do. It doesn't do anything good for your image, and by extension for the very values and ideals you say you're fighting for. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 07:01, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
