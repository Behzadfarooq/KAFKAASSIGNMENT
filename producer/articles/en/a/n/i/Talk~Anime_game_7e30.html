<p>I see "eroge" more frequently than "H game" on American websites these days. Google doesn't help because it lists anything with the letter "H" and then the word "game". Neither one is an official or proper term. If no-body objects I think I will just move the article. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a>) 15:51, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Ren'ai game" seems to be most frequently used by the Lemmasoft people, so I asked them about their reasoning:</p>

<p>Basically, it seems that they like Japanese words more than English ones. But this is an English encyclopedia, so I would prefer the 300x as popular English term. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a>) 01:46, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>They're different terms! Please, don't conflate them. They are totally different things. One of them may well be more common, in the same way that "apple" may well be more common than "orange", but that doesn't mean they should be combined.</dd>
<dd>Also, the motivation now seems opposite from the previous time... obviously it depends what websites you visit, but "eroge" would seem to correspond to "ren'ai game" as the Japanese import term only used by those who're at least partially familiar with the original Japanese, while "H game" and "dating game" are the more widely understood English "equivalents" (although I disagree that "ren'ai game" and "dating sim" are equivalent). Are we working towards the Japanese-import terms or the native-English ones? (Ironically, my own preference would be for "H game" and "ren'ai game", which I appreciate is inconsistent.) --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexChurchill_813e.html" title="User:AlexChurchill">AlexChurchill</a> 13:26, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Please explain how they are different... yes, "dating sim" technically means a certain type of gameplay, but it's not used that way in practice. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a>) 04:35, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In the technical definition, very few ren'ai games involve the kind of statistic manipulation that characterises <i><a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokimeki_Memorial_322b.html" title="Tokimeki Memorial">Tokimeki Memorial</a></i> and similar Japanese SIMs. And in the more natural English interpretation, very few translated ren'ai games involve simulation of actual dates. <i><a href="../../../c/a/s/Casual_Romance_Club_72cc.html" title="Casual Romance Club">Casual Romance Club</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/r/u/True_Love_88a3.html" title="True Love">True Love</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../g/i/r/Girlfriend_of_Steel_9e28.html" title="Girlfriend of Steel">Girlfriend of Steel</a></i>, arguably <i><a href="../../../s/e/a/Season_of_the_Sakura_b69e.html" title="Season of the Sakura">Season of the Sakura</a></i> (he takes three girls out to a restaurant at one point)... but that's pretty much it. Looking down the list of English anime games available from JAST USA or Peach Princess and filtering down to those that are ren'ai games, the majority of what you see are neither dating sims in the technical SIM sense or the literal "contain a date" sense. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexChurchill_813e.html" title="User:AlexChurchill">AlexChurchill</a> 10:07, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Since these are different terms I think I will start an article about dating sims, with a list of games from JAST and Peach Princess that are described officially as dating sims. For example, <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kana_Imouto_c3b2.html" title="Kana Imouto">Kana Imouto</a> describes itself as a dating sim on the box, and it doesn't use the word "ren'ai" anywhere, so I edited that article already. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a>) 05:53, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just a note that I have yet to find a single game where the American licensor or anyone related to the company writing in English describes it as a "re'nai game". In every case it is either a "bishoujo game" or a "dating sim". I have fixed the language of many articles to reflect this. (I know that Megatokyo guy and other fandom fellows like to say "re'nai game" so I left those articles alone.) <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a>) 23:44, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>See the above for the discussion and motivation for this change. I personally dislike using "dating sim" in the technically-inaccurate way to encompass all ren'ai games and other games that aren't simulations of dating, but the fact remains that the official Western publishers of these games never say "ren'ai game", always "dating sim" or "bishoujo game". Fans like those at LemmaSoft mentioned on <a href="../../../r/e/n/Ren%27ai_game.html" title="Ren'ai game">ren'ai game</a> tend to use the phrase "ren'ai game", but the more widespread phrase (and more widely understood) is "dating sim". That's why Ashibaka made his changes to <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renai_game.html" title="Renai game">renai game</a> that you reverted and I reinstated. Please discuss the terminology here before making sweeping changes. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexChurchill_813e.html" title="User:AlexChurchill">AlexChurchill</a> 14:01, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I reverted it back. Omgwtflolz, what I'm looking for from you is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evidence that "ren'ai game" is the preferred term of people who manufacture and sell dating sims in the United States. Here are the most notable sites: <a href="http://www.jastusa.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jastusa.com/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://jlist.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://jlist.com/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.peachprincess.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.peachprincess.com/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.g-collections.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.g-collections.com/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></li>
<li>Contexts in which "ren'ai game" is used more frequently than "bishoujo game" or "dating sim". So far the only place I have seen this is on the Lemma Soft forums.</li>
<li>Any reasons why "ren'ai game" will be easier to understand than "dating sim" when we are writing for English speakers who may not know what "ren'ai" means.</li>
<li>If you disagree on some other point, let's take this to the Village Pump so other people can weigh in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks. (By the way, I am Shii on Haeleth's gemot and Lemma Soft forums, so feel free to drop me a line over there.) <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a>) 02:27, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
None of those apply, but there's one important thing that you're missing. As I've said before, applying the term "dating sim" to renai games is, for the most part, wrong. The way I see it, people using the term "dating sim" are mistaken, and should be corrected. If something's wrong, it's wrong regardless of how many people say otherwise. <a href="../../../o/m/g/User%7EOmgwtflolz_6b4e.html" title="User:Omgwtflolz">Omgwtflolz</a> 03:31, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, so if I understand you, this is "just wrong", and your opinion matters more than those of the firms who translate and publish the games, and announce their genres?</dd>
<dd>To put this in perspective, would you agree with moving <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role-playing_game.html" title="Role-playing game">role-playing game</a> to role-playing monster-killing game, or <a href="../../../a/d/v/Adventure_game.html" title="Adventure game">adventure game</a> to role-playing puzzle game, if someone considered the latter to be more technically accurate? <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a>) 04:14, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's not my opinion. It's a fact. To put this in perspective, would you agree with moving <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> to M$ TEH COMPANY TAHTS EVIL because that's what people say? Some people say that the Japanese name of the final boss of Final Fantasy VII was "Saviour Sephiroth". Are you saying that they're right? <a href="../../../o/m/g/User%7EOmgwtflolz_6b4e.html" title="User:Omgwtflolz">Omgwtflolz</a> 04:39, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You seem to agree with my opinion exactly. <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> is the name of the article because it's the name they call themselves. "Safer Sephiroth" is what that guy was called in the game because the translation team made it that way. In the exact same analogy, the American eroge publishers have dubbed their genre "dating sims" (or "bishoujo games", but that obviously refers to the BxG subset and the publishers define it as such). <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a>) 04:38, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>You say that the American publishers refer to the games that they translate as "dating sims", and that those games are therefore dating sims. You have also edited the <a href="../../../t/o/_/To_Heart_2_989f.html" title="To Heart 2">To Heart 2</a> article so that "renai ADV" has been changed to "dating sim". When has Aquaplus referred to To Heart 2 as a dating sim, then? Also, before you "fixed" the renai game article, it was about, big surprise here, renai games. Now, it links to the dating sim article, which... describes renai games. <a href="../../../o/m/g/User%7EOmgwtflolz_6b4e.html" title="User:Omgwtflolz">Omgwtflolz</a> 04:54, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe from your perspective the dating sim article describes ren'ai games, but IMHO it describes dating sims. I fixed all of the references to "ren'ai game" because it is a confusing term in another language for which a perfectly good English equivalent exists. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a>) 05:06, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Except that it isn't a very good equivalent, as has been stated countless times before. That's the whole point. <a href="../../../o/m/g/User%7EOmgwtflolz_6b4e.html" title="User:Omgwtflolz">Omgwtflolz</a> 05:19, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I am sure that it is so terrible that it has confused countless thousands of people, whereas simply using "ren'ai game" gets the idea across simply and effectively because everyone knows what "ren'ai" means.</dd>
<dd>The optimal solution would be "romance game", but of course nobody actually uses that term because fanboys seem to like Japanese words better than English. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a>) 05:22, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>I dislike the term "renai game" myself (and tend to stick to "ADV"), but it's still better than "dating sim", which sort of gets the point across, but also helps to breed misconceptions.</p>
<p>You go to the Megatokyo forums. I won't have you say that you haven't seen people discussing those horrendous Flash games on Newgrounds in the Dating Sim forum. Just how similar are those dating sims to renai games? I'm not saying that the term "renai game" should be used- I'm just saying that "dating sim" SHOULDN'T. <a href="../../../o/m/g/User%7EOmgwtflolz_6b4e.html" title="User:Omgwtflolz">Omgwtflolz</a> 07:20, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Omgwtflolz, I can see your point. I really can. My preferences are the same as yours: you can see some of my arguments with Ashibaka, Shibboleth and others on this and other talk pages, where I argue the same point as you. But, much though I hate to say it, <i>for a general audience</i>, they're right. "Dating sim" is inaccurate, <i>but it's what most people call these games</i>. Many of my friends are <a href="../../../o/t/a/Otaku.html" title="Otaku">otaku</a> well versed in Japanese culture and with speech peppered with imported Japanese words, <i>and they still call ren'ai games dating sims</i>. My girlfriend doesn't, but that's because the only contact she's had with them is via me. In general, it's *only* people who are well versed in the <i>Japanese</i> game situation (like the people you mention on the Megatokyo forums) who use the phrase "ren'ai game". And <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_7e69.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not</a> a forum for changing terms in use to ones that are somehow "more correct". We have to accept that in <i>general English usage</i>, "dating sim" *means* what we know as "ren'ai game"s. The term has changed meaning away from literally a "simulation of dating". The subculture that's well versed in the details may view that as incorrect, but it's more comprehensible to the <i>general audience</i>, which is Wikipedia's audience. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexChurchill_813e.html" title="User:AlexChurchill">AlexChurchill</a> 10:08, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Perhaps, but the problem is that the word's usage came about from a bunch of misconceptions, and helps to spread those misconceptions.</p>
<p>Isn't Wikipedia meant to be a source of information? If so, the correct term should be used, regardless of what language it's in. Or should we spread misinformation simply because it's more convenient? The dating sim article could be used to explain how the word is inaccurate, and could link to the renai game article. That wouldn't affect the general audience's access to the information, would it?</p>
<p>Also, from what I've seen, very few English-speaking people who play these games (Japanese ones, at least, and not crappy English yaruge) use the term "dating sim". <a href="http://forums.megatokyo.com/index.php?showtopic=1707099" class="external free" title="http://forums.megatokyo.com/index.php?showtopic=1707099" rel="nofollow">http://forums.megatokyo.com/index.php?showtopic=1707099</a> <a href="../../../o/m/g/User%7EOmgwtflolz_6b4e.html" title="User:Omgwtflolz">Omgwtflolz</a> 03:50, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But articles are not given their titles by the fandom: for example, <a href="../../../d/%C5%8D/j/D%C5%8Djinshi.html" title="Dōjinshi">dōjinshi</a>, not doujinshi (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">as I discussed with DopefishJustin</a>). "Ren'ai" is not an English word, and an English term already exists which is in common use outside of the fandom. Furthermore, terms don't have to conform to their literal meanings. For example, I cited <a href="../../../o/t/a/Otaku.html" title="Otaku">otaku</a> in that Megatokyo thread as an example of a word which has been far removed from its original meaning, and that moderator backed me up. As I suggested before, if we are <i>really</i> concerned about following a literal definition we might title the article "romance game". <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a>) 00:12, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Like I said, I'm just saying that "dating sims" shouldn't be used. "Romance game" would be fine, I guess, if you really have to have it.

<dd>Over the weekend I discovered the belief underneath my rationale for abhorring <i>ren'ai</i>: it's George Orwell's <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_and_the_English_Language_a910.html" title="Politics and the English Language">Politics and the English Language</a>, which I read in freshman year of high school and which has since burrowed deep into my soul. I still can't find any rational way of diagreeing with his rules, but as far as I know Orwell is not style policy on Wikipedia&#160;:) So let's say there's no decision, for now, and I won't be messing with articles any further. However, for my own sanity I do ask that you not redirect <a href="../../../d/a/t/Dating_sim.html" title="Dating sim">Dating sim</a> to <a href="../../../r/e/n/Ren%27ai_game.html" title="Ren'ai game">Ren'ai game</a> as I see this a reversal of the terms people actually use.</dd>

<p>Ugh, I totally forgot about this.

<li>This is irrelevant anyway. I can see full well that neither of us is going to waver from either of our views. But I'd like to remind you that Wikipedia is written from a NPOV, not a "fans' point of view", and no matter how <i>better</i> a term "ren'ai game" is, "dating sim" is used outside the fandom.

<p>Ren'ai games are any "love game", so bishoujo games are a subgenre of ren'ai. I won't make this change yet because I'm simply asserting my opinion and maybe the person who wrote that believes differently.</p>
<p>Here's my reasoning:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Sexual content level</b> of anime games can be <a href="../../../e/r/o/Eroge.html" title="Eroge">eroge</a> or "clean".</li>
<li><b>Romance level</b> of anime games can be <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renai_game.html" title="Renai game">renai</a>, "light" (little romance), "kichiku" (rape), or no romance.</li>
<li><b>Gender focus</b> of anime games can be a <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girl_game.html" title="Girl game">girl game</a> or a <a href="../../../b/l/_/BL_game_da28.html" title="BL game">BL game</a>.</li>
<li><b>Interactivity</b> of anime games can be an erotic game of any genre, a <b>dating sim</b> (conveniently folded into "ren'ai" by some hasty merge), a <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visual_novel.html" title="Visual novel">visual novel</a>, or a <b>kinetic novel</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the entire overlap of visual novels and H games are ren'ai, but I'm not sure how to portray this on our new linear template without confusing people. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a>) 03:53, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, at least you already acknowledge this is a mess&#160;:) I really don't think "bishoujo games" are a subgenre of "ren'ai games", in the way the terms are generally used. In my experience, amongst those native-English-speakers who're reasonably well educated about the different fuzzy groups, "bishoujo game" tends to get used as the overarching category for everything from harsh <i>kichiku</i> rape games to <a href="../../../b/l/_/BL_game_da28.html" title="BL game">BL games</a> with no female characters. <a href="../../../r/e/n/Ren%27ai_game.html" title="Ren'ai game">Ren'ai games</a> are the subset of those where romance is the primary focus (as opposed to a game like "Battle Raper", which is a bishoujo game but not a ren'ai game). Likewise, I'm sure that not all H games that are visual novels are primarily romantic: much though I'd like to pretend that the dark sadistic type don't exist!</dd>
<dd>I don't think we should be trying to make new definitions of these terms (even if the new definitions would make more sense), but just to capture the terms as they're used, and make sense out of them. But people very often use the terms in a confused way, and different groups use them in different ways, which means it's hard to tell what are the standard terms to use. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexChurchill_813e.html" title="User:AlexChurchill">AlexChurchill</a> 09:10, September 12, 2005 (UTC)

<p>I note that the page <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visual_novel.html" title="Visual novel">Visual novel</a> currently redirects here.

<dd>The English terminology over bishojo games is something of a nightmare. There are 2 problems here. One, Joe American the average English speaker has never played any of these games and has only heard of them,. So for Joe, "dating sim", "hentai game", "visual novel", "ren'ai game" are all different words for the exact same thing. Then, you have Bob Otaku who makes fine distinctions between them. To make matters worse, Bob speaks Japanese and he rarely gets to meet any other English speaker who plays these games, so he will make up his own terminology by loosely translating the Japanese terms (which are themselves rather messy). The result of all this is that everybody has their own unique idea of what terms mean what, and confusion ensues.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the case of "visual novel" specifically, I have seen the term used to mean either:
<ul>
<li>Exact synonym for "ren'ai game"</li>
<li>Ren'ai game which is somehow more "novel-like" (e.g. more first-person narration than usual)</li>
<li>Ren'ai game with text on the entire screen instead of in a text box on the bottom</li>
<li>One of the 4 games in the Leaf Visual Novel Series</li>
</ul>

<dd>Since you haven't explained, I'm not even sure what you mean by "visual novel", AlexChurchill: I wouldn't be surprised to hear you hold yet another alternative meaning!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, with all this confusion, I think we shouldn't use English terms such as "dating sim" or "visual novel" as separate article titles on Wikipedia. First, it would piss off Joe American who just wants to read about that Kanon game he's heard about, who doesn't know or care whether it strictly qualifies as a "visual novel" or "dating sim" or otherwise, and doesn't want to follow a bunch of different links before he finds the proper subgenre. Two, it would piss off Bob Otaku, who would likely consider the very article title to be POV. The only way to avoid this mess is to use unambiguous Japanese (not English or Engrish) terms as our article titles. Currently we have three main articles: <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishojo_game.html" title="Bishojo game">bishojo game</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/n/Ren%27ai_game.html" title="Ren'ai game">ren'ai game</a>, and <a href="../../../h/_/g/H_game.html" title="H game">H game</a>, which I think are the 3 major subgenres. I don't think we should fork off into more subarticles over terminology nitpicks.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That said, if you want to add more explanation of terminology as you see it, feel free to modify the articles. I tried to centralize all terminology discussion over at <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishojo_game.html" title="Bishojo game">bishojo game</a>, that's why I didn't define "visual novel" here at <a href="../../../r/e/n/Ren%27ai_game.html" title="Ren'ai game">ren'ai game</a>. The truth is that the whole debate doesn't matter that much, anyway: the most important thing is to understand that there is no "one true meaning" for terms like "visual novel". --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShibboleth_3624.html" title="User:Shibboleth">Shibboleth</a> 17:10, 1 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Heh. Well, that's demonstrated the potential for confusion at least! I was thinking of the genre of games which ranges rather wider than just those with <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renai.html" title="Renai">renai</a> elements - so it overlaps heavily with "Renai game", but neither is a subset of the other. (Where characters and locations appear onscreen, text is read and clicked through, and occasionally decisions are made in <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure_945c.html" title="Choose Your Own Adventure">Choose Your Own Adventure</a> style which may affect the plot. Similar to the most story-driven <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interactive_fiction.html" title="Interactive fiction">Interactive fiction</a> but with static visuals, really.)</dd>
<dd>I don't think I really know enough about the distinction to write the page myself, since pretty much all the visual novels I've played are ren'ai games (but not vice versa). I do see the problem, though. I guess providing a paragraph in this article would be fine, except there's the problem you mention of lack of clear consensus... Maybe there's not much that can be done for the moment. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexChurchill_813e.html" title="User:AlexChurchill">AlexChurchill</a> 09:32, Jul 14, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, you mean games like <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radical_Dreamers_2b10.html" title="Radical Dreamers">Radical Dreamers</a> or <a href="../../../g/y/a/Gyakuten_Saiban_dd6b.html" title="Gyakuten Saiban">Gyakuten Saiban</a> would also qualify as "visual novels" by your definition. Yes, that's another reasonable interpretation.

<dd>Indeed. I expanded a couple of bits of <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishojo_game.html" title="Bishojo game">Bishojo game</a>, because that's where the terminology discussion already is, including a definition of "Visual novel". Does that look okay? If so, the only other question I have is whether the redirect at <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visual_novel.html" title="Visual novel">Visual novel</a> would be better pointed at "Bishojo game" (where the definition is), or at "Renai game" (much closer in concept). Can the redirect point straight to the "Terminology &amp; genres" subheading? --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexChurchill_813e.html" title="User:AlexChurchill">AlexChurchill</a> 15:19, Jul 15, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've noticed that there are a number of stub articles for anime games. They generally get tagged with Template:Simulation-cvg-stub, but lumping them in with flight sims or <i><a href="../../../s/i/m/Sim_City_c5bd.html" title="Sim City">Sim City</a></i> has never felt quite right to me. It seems to me that the people familiar with anime games and able to fill out articles about them would not necessarily overlap much with those who know about general simulation games. Thus, I propose we create Template:Anime-game-stub, replacing the relevant stubs with that. Then it would be rather easier to decide to, say, fill out one anime game stub per week. It would like some small representative image, perhaps the face of Shiori from <i><a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokimeki_Memorial_322b.html" title="Tokimeki Memorial">Tokimeki Memorial</a></i>.

<p>Just so I'm clear on this... an "anime game" is not necessarily a game licensed from an anime (such as the DBZ, Naruto, etc. games) but <i>any</i> Japanese game with a Japanese illustration style of art? The other sub-genres, such as dating sims, eroge, bishojo, all fall under "anime game"? That doesn't really make sense to me... it seems these all fall under a general umbrella of "Japanese computer and video games". The term as it's being used now could apply to virtually every video game released from China and Korea as well. I'd like to get a handle on the scope of this article. --<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevereTireDamage_33d2.html" title="User:SevereTireDamage">SevereTireDamage</a> 08:33, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I believe this is so. The article tends to contradict itself in this that the infobox on the top-right, reflects the idea that anime games are games released entirely around story/comic book style illustration adventure games. Whereas the images and the RPG/Fighting genre aren't really reflected in this infobox either. The infobox should be expanded to include the more mainstream more interactivve oriented fighting/RPG/shooter. I think that what defines an anime game at the moment, seems to be, from my understanding of this article and it's current content, any game that is focused around japanese import/japanese-styled art of manga/anime and the licensed games of stories of the comics(manga), TV and movie series or originals that feature the japanese import/styled art.</dd>

<dd>It's a very, very broad category and I think that this article really needs expansion should it fully cover this broad genre of games.

<p>AnimePlay and Dojin soft (as a collective) are really technically publishers or brands, they aren't really "formats". Dating Sims is a format, not a genre (assuming RPG, Shooter etc are "Format"). All games of the dating sims format are in the genre of Renai games, due to the nature of "date". That's my point of view, and I'm wondering if it makes sense to other people reading this. -Afker 18:58, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Listing both "dating sim" and "renai game" is a compromise between me and omgwtfbbq. Ideally, renai game should just be a redirect <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashi</a><b><a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_b_4e96.html" title="User:Ashibaka/b"><font color="orange">b</font></a></b><a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">aka</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a></small> 19:17, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't understand. The relationship between dating sim and renai game should be similar to the relationship between "First Person Shooter" and "games where you kill stuff". You don't have to kill things via shooting. In fact, there are a LOT of games in which you kill stuff, but without the game being a FPS (pick just about any RPG game and you'll be killing stuff in it). -Afker 19:23, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In reality they describe the exact same kind of game, with disregard for whether they involve dating or not (similar to how the term "adventure game" also describes boring kinds of interactive fiction). <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashi</a><b><a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_b_4e96.html" title="User:Ashibaka/b"><font color="orange">b</font></a></b><a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">aka</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a></small> 21:08, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hmm, I would've expected renai games to overlap with "strict" visual novels where all you do is click to read story and graphics (no choices involved), whereas dating sim wouldn't include it. Does your definition of renai/dating overlap with the "strict" type of visual novels or not? I can't really tell from what you wrote above. Anyways, part of my original issue remains: "AnimePlay" and "Dojin soft" are a different type of categorization compared to "Visual novel". -Afker 22:05, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That point is correct, you can fix it.

<p>Ok, I just went through the old discussion you had with Omg-something (didn't realize it's right here up top). So now I have a better understanding, I agree with your position (I don't touch the translated-by-English-publisher games, so I didn't know they just slap "dating sims" on just about every title). <s>I think right now the <a href="../../../d/a/t/Dating_sim.html" title="Dating sim">Dating sim</a> article needs an additional section for the NON-technical definition, explaining the more common "incorrect" usage by the publishers in the US. The first sentence of that article does not read like a definition of the generalized usage, but more like an oversimplification of the technical definition. I'll ponder on how to reword that article.</s> -Afker 08:07, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>blah, nevermind, the sentence is there, at the end of the "technical definition" section, which is probably why I missed it. I'll think about if there's any way to mvoe that sentence to a more prominent location. -Afker 08:27, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An anime game is not a game that looks like an anime. The term is never used in Japan this way and it's only used in this way incorrectly outside of Japan. Calling <i>Final Fantasy</i> an anime game is as much of a mistake as calling a manga an "anime comic". Anime is not an art style, it is a just a cartoon from Japan.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.anime-games.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.anime-games.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Just look at the link on the page.</a> That's how the term is used.</p>
<p>Per discussion at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Anime_and_manga_ecff.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Anime and manga">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Anime and manga</a>, 'anime game' is to only cover games based off of anime. For <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visual_novel.html" title="Visual novel">visual novels</a> and dating sims, the overbranching genre is .</p>

<p>Okay, SeizureDog, maybe <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANIME_d1de.html" title="WP:ANIME">WP:ANIME</a> says an "anime game" is only a game with an anime behind it. Then here's something for you to chew on: What term would <i>you</i> give to describe the overlapping elements between visual novels, dating sims, and bishoujo games? <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">(tock)</a> 19:01, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, a bishoujo game is not a genre, it is simply a game with pretty girls in it. You can't have just a 'bishoujo game'. You may have a 'bishoujo puzzle' or 'bishoujo dating sim', but not just a 'bishoujo'. And as I said before, the overlapping genre is <a href="../../../r/e/n/Ren%27ai_game.html" title="Ren'ai game">ren'ai game</a>. All dating sims and most visual novels are of this genre. The naming problem gave us quite a bit of trouble, but anime game is certainly wrong. Chew on this yourself: how can a visual novel be considered an '<i>animation</i> game' ('anime' being simply short for 'animation') when it consists almost entirely of a series of still images?--<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 05:16, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Generalizing bishoujo games as anime games is as wrong as calling Ultima 6 or Prince of Persia 2 or X Wing vs Tie Fighter "cartoon games" or "comic games". -Afker 09:26, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
