<p>I daresay that the difficulty of maintaining neutrality about the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_on_your_Plate_f686.html" title="Holocaust on your Plate">Holocaust on your Plate</a> campaign has not been lessened by the (agreed-upon) creation of this spin-off page. In order to keep it from becoming a <a href="../../../p/o/v/Wikipedia%7EPOV_fork_3de8.html" title="Wikipedia:POV fork">Wikipedia:POV fork</a>, we need to keep working hard to ensure that our own pro- or anti-PETA biases do not leak into our writing.</p>
<p>One issue that comes to mind is whether comparing prisoners to pigs:</p>
<ul>
<li>elevates animals to the moral level of people (as PETA no doubt intended it); or,</li>
<li>reduces people to moral level of animals (as ADF certainly took it)</li>
</ul>
<p>Immediately I'll be accused of bias for even bringing this up, and that's okay. Even though Wikipedia is not a blog, if anyone's interested in my views you are welcome to ask me. As a member of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unification_Church_2f2f.html" title="Unification Church">Unification Church</a>, I believe in the doctrine of Three Great Blessings (sorry, I've never gotten around to writing that article; just lazy, I guess). Sneak preview: Before <a href="../../../f/a/t/Father_Moon_ab97.html" title="Father Moon">Father Moon</a> became a reverend, he was an avid observer of nature and:</p>
<ul>
<li>One day after he had prayed, it seemed as if the trees, bushes and grass began to speak: "Nobody takes care of us. We feel abandoned by mankind" Realizing that nature cried out to be loved, he felt like embracing the entire world, vowing, "I will be your caretaker." <a href="http://www.tparents.org/Library/Unification/Books/Utheo/Utheo-1c.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tparents.org/Library/Unification/Books/Utheo/Utheo-1c.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>

<p>As someone has proposed the 2 be merged, and no-one has discussed it over there, I will ask about it here. Animal rights and antisemitism seems to be the large chunk of text that someone was trying to add to <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_rights.html" title="Animal rights">Animal rights</a> a while ago. As it stands, it is entirely biased and therefore POV. I think we should summarise the text further as it seems to be an analysis of one author only, quoting lots of their text. However, it also contains some valid points.</p>
<p>We wouldn't really want to merge it into this article as it would be off topic, but should we merge this article into that one after working on it? What do people think?-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 14:21, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Note also, that it was created by Farnsworth J, a known Homey sock. It does seem to be a bit of a POV fork to me.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 14:23, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now that I look at it, I see it would be off-topic to add it here. I don't know what to do with it. It's an incredibly silly argument/page that Homeontherange added only to cause trouble. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:31, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The current edit reads:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Stuart Bender, legal counsel for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, wrote to PETA asking them to "cease and desist this reprehensible misuse of Holocaust materials."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Ingrid Newkirk apologized for the pain it had caused, writing...</dd>
</dl>
<p>The first of these incidents occured more than 2 years before the second. I believe that mentioning them consecutively implies that the apology was made soon afterwards, and is therefore deceptive.</p>
<p>The following edit of mine was reverted:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Over 2 years after the campaign began, Ingrid Newkirk apologized for the pain it had caused. On May 5 2005 she wrote:</dd>
</dl>
<p>The other editor considered clarifying the timing to be "editorializing and considering her apology late".</p>
<p>I do not indend to revert or debate the point, so I am leaving this note for the consideration of future editors. -81.79.242.103 01:19, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps a clear timeline is needed. If there are sources showing exactly when Newkirk first found out about the unexpected (by her) negative reaction, then the legal threat(s), and how she handled the situation from the beginning, then it would make sense to present the events objectively. What we should <i>not</i> do is pick items selectively. For example, if there was a lot of 'behind the scenes' activity, with Newkirk first learning about the negative reaction, then trying to explain that the campaign was promoted and supported by Jewish PETA members as well as Israeli papers (as <a href="http://web.israelinsider.com/Views/5475.htm" class="external text" title="http://web.israelinsider.com/Views/5475.htm" rel="nofollow">she explains here</a>) and this was an ongoing process, then it would be wrong to just mention the start and finish points of the process. Presenting just the start and finish could imply that no related activity was going on in the meanwhile. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 01:41, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I tried to add the date along with more context from her article, hopefully this will address some of the concerns. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 02:29, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
