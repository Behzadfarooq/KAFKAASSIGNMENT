<p>I just reverted the removal of the text "the dynamite blasts at a nearby stone quarry in Armenia, as well as" from the sentence about the ruins being threatened. This might have been an error correction, if the quarry is no longer operating or if that was never true in the first place. It looks more like whitewashing to me so I reverted. If I'm wrong, eventually someone will correct it. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 06:30, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Reply: Ani was a major Armenian city. It may be within the borders of the Republic of Turkey, but its history is Armenian. This isn't propaganda, it is fact. Turkey has a vastly multi-ethnic history and it is time to start acknowledging that.</dd>

<p>Doktor Gonzo, I fail to see why this category is not good for Ani. It is an ancient Armenian city where Armenians once thrived with 200 000 living there. The name itself Ani is Armenian. What is your point in saying that category is not suitable?<a href="../../../f/e/d/User%7EFedayee_044a.html" title="User:Fedayee">Fedayee</a> 17:57, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Former capitals of Armenia is not suitable category imho. It can be misguiding. Ani has to do with ancient Armenia so its categorization should be such. Istanbul is categorized as an ancient Greek city, not former capitals of Greece.

Because I have been to Ani several times in the last 2 years. So, if you want to keep an out-and-out falsity on the page, especially when the only source is Anatolia Travel Information, then go ahead. It's just not the truth. Just because the site says it was last updated in 2007, doesn't mean every single part of the site was.--<a href="../../../o/p/t/User%7EOptimussven_b5c5.html" title="User:Optimussven">Optimussven</a> 22:32, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I did say I would rewrite it all - and I will, eventually. And to be honest, I don't give a damn about "original research" dogma in this case. 90% of what has been written about Ani falls under these categories: mistakes, misinformation, propaganda, or lies. I will not allow anything like that to continue to circulate about Ani where it is possible to stop it. <a href="../../../m/e/o/User%7EMeowy_df2d.html" title="User:Meowy">Meowy</a> 03:07, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Your attitude highlights one of the most important points of Wikipedia "dogma". To keep people with an axe to grind from using this encyclopedia as their whetstone. <a href="../../../h/o/u/User%7EHouseOfScandal_3f74.html" title="User:HouseOfScandal">House of Scandal</a> 03:24, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I do not have an axe to grind, but I do have a problem with what I know to be out-of-date information. If Wikipedia is really about creating the most acurate articles possible, then that is what we should aim to do. The fact is that the reliability of "Anatolia Travel Guide" is not irreproachable. If I were a traveler, I would take the word of multiple guide books published published in the last 3 years over a website, even if it has supposedly been updated in 2007. I understand that this article is not supposed to be a travel guide, however, someone deemed it fit to put up information about the status of Ani today as a visitor destination. I know that the information is innacurate, so I have chosen to try and update. I have only been met with hostility. Perhaps the real question is, does information about Ani's status as a travel destination warrant inclusion in the article? If the answer is yes, then it should be the right information.--<a href="../../../o/p/t/User%7EOptimussven_b5c5.html" title="User:Optimussven">Optimussven</a> 15:09, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><i>No</i> source is beyond reproach, not the <i>New York Times</i>, not the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i> -- they are just sources and their inclusion in an article is not a endorsement of them. Why are you focusing your energy on this arguement? That is a waste of time. There is no politics here, and I am not your foe. I will even include an endnote that the text may be out-of-date. If you want to improve the article, I welcome your input via the process. <i>Find some up-to-date info and include it.</i> <a href="../../../h/o/u/User%7EHouseOfScandal_3f74.html" title="User:HouseOfScandal">House of Scandal</a> 15:53, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>This is not about politics. I am neither Turkish nor Armenian. I have nothing invested in the argument over Ani. I'd just like to see acurate information. I tried to improve the article through the editing process with references but was rebuked by others (not you) who seemed unwilling to consider my input and the references. That is why I brought the topic to the discussion page. I don't consider anyone here an enemy, I'm jsut trying to take part in the Wikipedia process so that we can create the most acurate article possible.--<a href="../../../o/p/t/User%7EOptimussven_b5c5.html" title="User:Optimussven">Optimussven</a> 16:27, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>Ditto, I have no personal connection to Ani or the people who have held it. I have, however, encountered hostility on Wikipedia from peoples on both sides of a idealogical border who have mistaken me for a foe since I was neither friend <i>nor</i> foe. I changed some wording in the article to suggest that the travel info may be past its expiration date. But the onus still lays in finding citable references to contradict it, not in convincing anyone one way or another. <a href="../../../h/o/u/User%7EHouseOfScandal_3f74.html" title="User:HouseOfScandal">House of Scandal</a> 18:18, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I found citable references from Turkey travel websites (nor more or less credible than the one currently cited) as well as ones in Lonely Planet, but those were all shot down (again not by you but rather by someone who seems to have an agenda). I'll admit that I am new to Wikipedia-editing, and thus wasn't sure how things went down at first. I'd like to become a contributing member, but this first experience has soured me a bit.--<a href="../../../o/p/t/User%7EOptimussven_b5c5.html" title="User:Optimussven">Optimussven</a> 19:08, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I empathize. If you want to post the links <i>here</i> I'll be glad to incorporate the info into the article in a way that gives troublemakers little footing to object. <a href="../../../h/o/u/User%7EHouseOfScandal_3f74.html" title="User:HouseOfScandal">House of Scandal</a> 01:00, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Thanks Meowy. That link coupled with Lonely Planet reports from 2005 should be enough (I think) to safely say that photography is now allowed.--<a href="../../../o/p/t/User%7EOptimussven_b5c5.html" title="User:Optimussven">Optimussven</a> 05:37, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>So to settle thıs once and for all I decıded to go straıght to the source. I emailed the Kars Province office to ask if permission was still needed and if Photography was still OK. Here is what they had to say. It's in Turkish, sorry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Emniyeten izin almanıza gerek yok.. 2005 yılında çıkan bir yönetmelikle artık tarihi ve turistik alanlarda gezi amacı güdülen ziyaretlerde Emniyet Müdürlüğünden izin alınması ve bazı koşullara uyulduğu takdirde fotograf çekilmesinde herhangi bir sakınca yoktur... İyi çalışmalar dileklerimizlee.. Anı harabeleri ve diğer tarihi ve turistik yerler hakkında gerekli broşür ve tanıtım kitapları İlimizi ziyaretlerinizde Kültür ve Turizm Müdürlüğümüzden temin edebilirsiniz... Kars Valiliği Bilgi İşlem Merkezi</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quick translation is that after a change of policy in 2005, there is no need anymore to obtain permission and photography is no problem. Now I realize that the problem is that this is not really citable, since it is an email exchange, and theoretically I could be making this all up, but I assure you that is a real response from the Kars Valiliği. While this can not be cited, I think it should dispell any weariness about citing VirtualAni, Lonley Planet (2005) and TurkeyTravelPlanner.--<a href="../../../o/p/t/User%7EOptimussven_b5c5.html" title="User:Optimussven">Optimussven</a> 17:56, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>The above mentioned "<a href="http://www.network54.com/Forum/146256/message/1074291346/" class="external text" title="http://www.network54.com/Forum/146256/message/1074291346/" rel="nofollow">news report</a>" is actually a posting on a message board. The <a href="http://www.arminfo.info/" class="external text" title="http://www.arminfo.info/" rel="nofollow">ArmiInfo</a> cite it links to no longer has the article. I searched for certain keywords in the article and it doesn't seem to be online. I would have included the first part of it as a blockquote, but unfortunately message bord postings are not citable (I discovered this the hard way). The letter from Kars Valiliği likewise isn't citable. All I was able to use was the info at VirtualAni which, although it doesn't explicitedly state the current conditions under which Ani may be visited, I don't expect any objections to the inference I made based on what is said there and changed the article accordingly. <a href="../../../o/p/t/User%7EOptimussven_b5c5.html" title="User:Optimussven">Optimussven</a>, as you're new to Wikipedia, I'll mention that frustratingly nothing here is ever settled permanently -- it's always a process, and the process is often a pain in the neck. Also, for what it worth, I'll say again it was never a matter of convining. I, for one, never disbelieved you. It's a matter of <i>showing.</i> <a href="../../../h/o/u/User%7EHouseOfScandal_3f74.html" title="User:HouseOfScandal">House of Scandal</a> 20:58, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>For those who are interested, the actual background to the lifting of the permit restrictions and the photography ban is said to be that the Turkish prime minister (or it may have been the Turkish president) was visiting Kars, and was asked by a Turkish journalist if he was going to visit Ani because, if so, the journalist would need to know in advance in order to get permission to go there with him. The PM expressed surprise at this, that even Turkish citizens had to get permission to go there. This (according to my informant in Kars, anyway) was the event that initiated the legislation mentioned in the news report. It might be true.<a href="../../../m/e/o/User%7EMeowy_df2d.html" title="User:Meowy">Meowy</a> 22:59, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ani still is in a military zone, but the army has exchanged the duty of guarding that part of the border with a set of employees of the Turkish Ministry of Tourism, who, in theory anyway, are meant to patrol the site. However, Turkish soldiers also still patrol there. <a href="../../../m/e/o/User%7EMeowy_df2d.html" title="User:Meowy">Meowy</a> 22:59, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Looks good. One last thing. You think I should throw in the 2005 Lonely Planet citation? I guess the whole problem with this certain part of the article is that getting any definite citeable source is extremely difficult. Begs the question whether or not it even warrants inclusion in the article, in a way I'm not sure it does. Kind of sad considering how much effort I just put into it.--<a href="../../../o/p/t/User%7EOptimussven_b5c5.html" title="User:Optimussven">Optimussven</a> 00:01, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Are you referring to the Tom Brosnahan material? The reference to that should have never been removed from the article. It is now included as a block quote which makes Ani's status as open to visitors crystal clear. I hope all are pleased. <a href="../../../h/o/u/User%7EHouseOfScandal_3f74.html" title="User:HouseOfScandal">House of Scandal</a> 00:23, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>From what I gather from studying the history of the page, two editors (one of whom is an administrator) wrongly removed <a href="../../../o/p/t/User%7EOptimussven_b5c5.html" title="User:Optimussven">Optimussven</a>'s edits which were cited just fine. While this does very much appear that they were taking advantage of <a href="../../../o/p/t/User%7EOptimussven_b5c5.html" title="User:Optimussven">Optimussven</a>'s inexperience here (as indicated by his red link and having not created a user page yet) in order to suppress the info that the Turks are being more permissive in this regard, things here are sometimes more complex/confusing than they seem. For example, during the past days' conversation I didn't know that good refs were provided and removed. Had I known I would have restored them and saved us much time. Being tempted to speak some very harsh observations about the POV practices of Wikipedia editors concentrating on this part of the globe, I'll end this message here. <a href="../../../h/o/u/User%7EHouseOfScandal_3f74.html" title="User:HouseOfScandal">House of Scandal</a> 00:45, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The past and present references are really poor though. Some of them are not even reliable. They're also not consistent and lack <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECitation_templates_28d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citation templates">citation templates</a>. You make it seem as if a perfectly referenced article was lost... I rather have an article that covers the whole subject maticulously and lacks proper references like the overwhelming majaority of Wikipedia articles than one that is inaccurate with half assed references. Considering the abundance of scholarly sources regarding Ani i'm sure that proper references can be added and sustained without omitting any major facets. We also have {{fact}} tags for controversial passages, imaginary or not.-- <big><b><a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator"><font color="#00N510">Ευπάτωρ</font></a></b></big> <sup><small><a href="../../../e/u/p/User_talk%7EEupator_d1d3.html" title="User talk:Eupator"><font color="#974423">Talk!!</font></a></small></sup> 16:01, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't see what was wrong with "pledge." All a pledge means is that someone says they will do something. It doesn't imply that it has been fulfilled or even will be fulfilled. A pledge is exactly what the Kars governor's quote sounds like to me. I agree with HOS that we need the most neutral language possible. And "claim," to me, is always a value judgement.--<a href="../../../o/p/t/User%7EOptimussven_b5c5.html" title="User:Optimussven">Optimussven</a> 23:53, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The Microsoft example refers to a legal claim. It's a technical term. As is a land claim. The <a href="../../../w/o/r/Wikipedia%7EWords_to_avoid_41db.html" title="Wikipedia:Words to avoid">Wikipedia:Words to avoid</a> explains that. This text comes directly above the Microsoft example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course, there are other definitions of claim as well. These generally don't have the same connotation, and the word can be used freely in those senses. For instance, making a claim in court or claiming a piece of land are valid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Pledge" wasn't bad (I initially wrote it), but in the most technical sense that is almost like taking an oath or at least making a very formal promise. In the interest of favouring people on neither side of the border, I changed it to the most neutral language available (say/said) rather than simply reverting <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a>.</p>
<p>I want to make the point here that it seems <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a> is trying to find the most POV word <i>allowable</i> rather than following the spirit of NPOV.

<p>I have just added a new section listing most of the monuments at Ani individually, plus a completely rewritten text for the History section. I have used most of the previous material as a basis for what it should contain, but have excluded some of that material because it was inaccurate. For example; Ani was not on a crossroads of trade routes, Ashot III was not alive when Trdat was practicing as an architect, Armenian was not devastated by the Seljuks in 922, the cathedral is not a cruciform church, Ani was not captured by the Byzantines to serve as a buffer state agaisnt the Muslim world, there is actually no record of an earthquake in 1319 (it is a later myth).

<li>HouseOfScandal, regarding your revert of my additions. Wikipedia policy suggests that you do not revert good faith edits and that you should try to improve the edit, rather than just reverting it. Also, regarding references - Wikipedia policy says that attribution is required for direct quotes and for material that is challenged or likely to be challenged. None of my additions fell under those categories. <a href="../../../m/e/o/User%7EMeowy_df2d.html" title="User:Meowy">Meowy</a> 16:00, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While I respect the policy regarding improvement versus reverting, you did a complete rewrite of a meticulously referenced article and left an unreferenced article in its place. I can't provide references for material with origin unknown to me. Therefore, I was justified in reverting. <a href="../../../h/o/u/User%7EHouseOfScandal_3f74.html" title="User:HouseOfScandal">House of Scandal</a> 19:59, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Given your above comment, I'll give it to you straight, Mr HouseOfScandal. Your "meticulously referenced article" was actually an amateurish piece of work, cobbled together from anything you could trawl from the internet. As you yourself admitted, you know nothing at all about Ani, and had never heard of the place until a month ago. Because of that, you do not have the background knowledge to distinguise truth from fiction, accepted facts from contentuous statements, essential information from worthless padding, etc. That is just in relation to the Ani material you found online. There is much more about Ani contained in the many books, articles, monographs, etc that have been written over the past 150 years - none of which you have ever set your eyes upon. I will rewrite the remaining parts of your "meticulously referenced article" in the comming days. <a href="../../../m/e/o/User%7EMeowy_df2d.html" title="User:Meowy">Meowy</a> 23:03, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>The only reason I even touched the article was to bring order to what was chaos. Take a look at what was there before my involvement. If there was misinformation in the article, it was misinformation that a reader could see where it came from. Major revisions to an article should be done in your sandbox and presented with references when complete. What you did, instead, is throw down hundreds of words and left a message on the talk page that you would provide references "a.s.a.p.". That is about as amateurish as it gets. Please note the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is <b>verifiability, not truth</b>. "Verifiable" in this context means that any reader should be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. Editors should provide a reliable source for material that is challenged or likely to be challenged, or it may be removed. (source: <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>)</p>

<p>You didn't even manage to put a comment at the right place on my talk page. You are a novice here and your ignorance of how Wikipedia works is obvious. <a href="../../../h/o/u/User%7EHouseOfScandal_3f74.html" title="User:HouseOfScandal">House of Scandal</a> 07:50, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Why does a person think he can write a competent entry about a subject when he knows nothing about that subject? In your reply to an earlier question from me, you said that you had heard about Ani for only two weeks before writing your contributions to the Wikipedia entry on Ani.<br />
I was aware of the lamentable state of the entry for Ani before you decided to add your material. Its earlier form certainly did not do Ani justice, but at the same time the entry was too small for it to contain any objectionable content. You massively increased the size of the entry, but also massively increased the level of its inaccuracy. That is why I decided to rewrite it.<br />
Everything you placed in the entry you found only on the internet and, as I had explained earlier, you do not have the background knowledge abut Ani to distinguish truth from fiction, accepted facts from contentious statements, essential information from padding. Writing about Ani from a position of ignorance is rather like blundering into the middle of a mist-covered minefield without having a map.<br />
Your ignorance of Ani is proven by your continuing insistence on citations being provided for content that requires no citations. Citations are only needed for content that is challenged or likely to be challenged. Nothing I posted falls into those categories. Your contribution was full of unnecessary citations.<br />
I’m still at a loss to understand why you decided to contribute to an entry about Ani. It must have taken you a considerable time to do it (so I do understand you annoyance at someone coming and removing most of it). However, the basic problem with your contribution is that you don’t know the subject and because of that, you don’t know how amateurish and inaccurate your contribution was. There must plenty of entries on Wikipedia that need to be brought from "chaos into order" and that will be on subjects you do know about. <a href="../../../m/e/o/User%7EMeowy_df2d.html" title="User:Meowy">Meowy</a> 16:32, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><a href="../../../m/e/o/User%7EMeowy_df2d.html" title="User:Meowy">Meowy</a>, you state above "to be honest, I don't give a damn about "original research" dogma in this case. 90% of what has been written about Ani falls under these categories: mistakes, misinformation, propaganda, or lies. I will not allow anything like that to continue to circulate about Ani where it is possible to stop it." Translation: you don't follow Wikipedia guidelines, you don't verify articles, and you seek out the 10% of sources that agree with your POV. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaundakulbara_cc51.html" title="User:Shaundakulbara">Shaundakulbara</a> 21:23, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>My words "In this case" refers to HouseOfScandal's refusal to change a clearly incorrect fact (photography ban at Ani), a fact that he knows to be wrong, for no other reason than his dogmatic following of "original research" rules. And I'll thank you not to put words in my mouth using your absurd "translating". <a href="../../../m/e/o/User%7EMeowy_df2d.html" title="User:Meowy">Meowy</a> 21:30, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>From what I see he changed that fact when a source was given. And then you replaced most of a good article with your own original research. It is you who feel entitled to throw away Wikipedia rules and for that reason you are no asset to this encyclopedia. Obviously sensible people can talk to you until we are blue in the face. It doesn't make a difference. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaundakulbara_cc51.html" title="User:Shaundakulbara">Shaundakulbara</a> 21:38, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at the order of the posts. He changed it after I had commented on it, so I don't see your point. <a href="../../../m/e/o/User%7EMeowy_df2d.html" title="User:Meowy">Meowy</a> 21:59, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>The point is he changed it after you commented on it as soon as references are provided. He follows the rules and I have seen him admit he's wrong in the past. Looking at what you are doing to the article, I'll ammend what I said about earlier and change it to "you <i>could easily</i> be an asset to this encyclopedia". Your writing is good. Also, from what I see, you are using most of the same sources as HoS was using (VirtualANI etc.). Your mistake was in not providing citations <i>with</i> your changes and also in making statements like I quoted above. I am very familiar with HoS's work from <a href="../../../d/i/d/Template_talk%7EDid_you_know_8ba7.html" title="Template talk:Did you know">DYK</a> and calling him "amateurish" is simply false...he is one of five editors I can think of whose work is amazing. It looks like this whole arguement started when he told you to cite your sources and work in your sandbox until your work was ready. I don't know why that escalated into such a mess. I can't say for certain, but I am pretty sure you have less experience on Wikipedia than some of the people you are arguing with. It probably would help you reach your potential if you'd make an effort to learn lessons that people are trying to teach about proceedure rather than take everything as a challenge. I made the same mistake when I was new. Anyways, have a good night, bye. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaundakulbara_cc51.html" title="User:Shaundakulbara">Shaundakulbara</a> 00:00, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>I apologize for that part of the statement. The ethnicities of editors involved are, of course, irrelevant and it wasn’t my place to speculate. What I should have said is “as long as <i>anyone</i> throws out good scholarship in place of bad, people who unjustly deny the realities of Armenian history will have as loud voice, and that is a <i>terrible</i> thing.” I’ll share some of my own background, since you’ve shared yours. I am of a race (<a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_people.html" title="Irish people">Irish</a>) who spent most of the last 1,000 years under the heel of another. I live in a country (<a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>) with a short history red with the blood of those who didn’t belong to the dominant social group and where evil men with dreams of conquest still murder millions for their own greed. I see too many articles about <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">Black people</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_American_33b5.html" title="Native American">Native Americans</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenia.html" title="Armenia">Armenia</a> (etc.) that have veered from the path of scholarship because of emotion. It upsets me because I feel like the true and verifiable stories of history’s underdogs get buried when a article starts to smell like propaganda or isn’t held to the highest stylistic standards . While working to keep POV out of articles, I hope to bring dignity to subjects of importance to under-represented people by choosing those subjects to cover appropriately. The glorious achievements and tragic horrors of history don’t need “spin”. The direction this article is going is a good one. I wish it could have gone in this direction without a new user attacking me for requiring references...and that’s all I did. It was unwise of me, however, to let that under my skin. Khoikhoi, you and I debated over a specific word here (“claims” vs. “says”) and I see that the non-POV word I suggested has remained in the article. I respect you for that. I will honor my earlier statement that I am done working with this article. There’s a 1,000,000 other things I want to work on (999,995 of them so absurdly trivial that no one else will even bother to add significant edits) and there are plenty of capable people involved here. But I’ll offer my perspective one very specific point germane to Ani. To me, the material about the Turkish preservation efforts (however meager) doesn’t paint the Turks as heroes, it merely says that the Armenian legacy preserved in places like Ani is so precious that even (well-educated) Turks recognize its value. I think that is profound and might make people who may be disinclined to think that Ani is a big deal rethink that dismissive notion. If you feel an urge to edge that material out of this article, please reconsider.

<dd>Ok, I think you're missing the point here. Nobody is denying the fact that the Turks are doing restoration work. It's what that restoration does that needs to be scrutinized. For all intents and purposes Turkish restoration is essentially destruction for the most part, as Steven has detailed in his site. Btw do you know that the tourist plaque that welcomes people Ani has a timeline of Ani that doesn't even mention Armenia or Armenians?-- <big><b><a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator"><font color="#00N510">Ευπάτωρ</font></a></b></big> <sup><small><a href="../../../e/u/p/User_talk%7EEupator_d1d3.html" title="User talk:Eupator"><font color="#974423">Talk!!</font></a></small></sup> 16:05, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I wrote <i>everything you placed in the entry you found only on the internet and ... you do not have the background knowledge abut Ani to distinguish truth from fiction, accepted facts from contentious statements, essential information from padding.</i> A lot of sources are either spin and propaganda, full of deliberate falsehoods, or are written by those who have been duped by said falsehoods.

<p>Or John-Smbat? As I said on the rv, Hovhannes-Smbat was his name. English Wikipedia doesn't generally change the proper names of people or places to their English equivalent unless they are household names. If there is a rule that says it must, then let me know (because someone once told me the exact opposite). Mark Whittows use of foreign names is not consistant. He converts Hovhannes to John, yet leaves Grigor as it is and does not change it to Gregory. He also seems to leave all Arabic names completely in their native form. What about all the other "foreign" names in this article. Do we change Nikolai to Nicolas? <a href="../../../m/e/o/User%7EMeowy_df2d.html" title="User:Meowy">Meowy</a> 21:56, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Problem is, this isn't exaclty <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Columbus_1595.html" title="Christopher Columbus">Cristobal Colón</a> that we're talking about here. We have somewhat of a borderline case. I personally perfer the Armenian name because this is an Armenian person, and "Hovhanness" was his name.

<dd>One could point out the article's erronious <i>in 1319 it was devastated by an earthquake</i> comment, and its equally erronious suggestion that only Armenians have said that Turkey has neglected the place (and actually Turkey has doen much worse than just neglect). Does the article express any enquiry about what a "restoration" means in the context of Ani and Turkey in general? No it doesn't, though presumably its author actually saw the state of the structures at Ani which have been almost destroyed by "restorations". Who told the author that "the site stradddles two countries"? GHF, obviously. And again its author does nothing to enquire about the possible reasons why GHF wishes to pursue that line, or indeed what GHF is planning for Ani.

<p>The article doesn't say the quarry was shut down. The article doesn't say it is still in operation. It says that <i>The Economist</i> reports that "Turks retort that Ani's remains have been shaken by blasts from a quarry on the Armenian side of the border." Does anyone refute the fact that the <i>The Economist</i> SAID that the Turks SAID this? An encyclopedia is not a court, nor an area, nor a battlefield. It is the systematic organization of source material. Do you have the opinion that the article is wrong? That opinion is <i>irrelevant</i>. Did you go to Ani and see something you didn't like?

<dd>The Danube is an internationally-known river name. Neither Arpaçay or Akhurian have that notability. Moreover, Dunav is just a variant on the name Danube. I'd guess there will be pronouncation variants through all the countries the Danube flows.

<dd>Given that it is you who appears to want to rename the river to something different than what the native population calls it and change it to what a neighbouring country calls it, I think that you should point to Wikipedia policy that says such an attitude is acceptable. Until this issue came up, the Ani entry had been mercifully free from both Turkish chauvinism and Armenian irredentism (a rare thing for Wikipedia articles connected to both Armenia and Turkey). By placing Akhurian before Arpaçay the entry is straying into irredentism. <a href="../../../m/e/o/User%7EMeowy_df2d.html" title="User:Meowy">Meowy</a> 21:42, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<blockquote>
<p>"When a widely accepted English name, in a modern context, exists for a place, we should use it".</p>

<p>No widely accepted English name exists for the river. Both Arpaçay and Akhurian are foreign language names However, Arpaçay appears to be the most common name used in English-language travel books.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"If the place does not exist anymore, or the article deals only with a place in a period when it held a different name, the widely accepted historical English name should be used."</p>

<p>The place (the river) does exist. The section of the entry that mentions the river deals with the current location of Ani, and not Ani in a time-period when the river was called something different.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If neither of these apply, the modern official name or the modern local historical name should be used, respectively."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The modern official name of the river is the Arpaçay.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Relevant foreign language names ... are permitted and should be listed in alphabetic order of their respective languages. As an exception to alphabetical order, <b>the local official name</b> should be listed before other alternate names..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The section in bold (my emphasis) makes my case. Based on the above, Arpaçay should be used before Akhurian, or any other alternative names.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If no name can be shown to be widely accepted in English, use the local official name."</p>

It is unnecessary to giving references for geographical facts that a casual glance at any map would reveal to be true. The adjoining Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition reference should also be deleted - the only information derived from its little entry on Ani is the historically dubious "Abnicum" name. <a href="../../../m/e/o/User%7EMeowy_df2d.html" title="User:Meowy">Meowy</a> 22:15, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The question should be "why was the article made protected?" rather than "why is the article still protected?". Protecting any page just because of the change in position of one word is a complete over-reaction, and I suspect that it would never have occured if it did not involve an administrator. But - to return to the subject - Aivazovsky and Khoikhoi's appear to be in the wrong because Wikipedia policy quite clearly states that local names must take precedence. To date, neither of them have responded to that point. And Khoikhoi has said nothing at all since the page was protected. That shouls be reason enough for the entry for Ani to be made unprotected. <a href="../../../m/e/o/User%7EMeowy_df2d.html" title="User:Meowy">Meowy</a> 21:27, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree. Firstly, why are you identifying Arpaçay as being Turkish and not identifying Akhurian as being Armenian. Either do both or do neither. It would be preferable to do neither, given the nationalistic fanaticism that both countries display towards names they perceive as "belonging" to the neighbouring country. The name Arpaçay should be used first, according to Wikipedia policy. It would then also match the Bostanlar / Tzaghkotzadzor name order (the former being the current local name, the latter being the original Armenian name). <a href="../../../m/e/o/User%7EMeowy_df2d.html" title="User:Meowy">Meowy</a> 21:39, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's full of errors! Ani is not in the Kars district of Arpaçay (or even in the Arpaçay district of Kars). Your first reference to the 1911 encyclopedia is wrong. The words cited were actually copied from virtualani.org by a previous contributor. Arpaçay was the name that everyone - Turk, Armenian, Tartar, Kurd, Russian and whatever - called the river until the 1920s, when the historical name "Akhurian" was resurrected by Soviet Armenia. And you are, along with Khoikhoi, going against Wikipedia policy on geographical names by using Akhurian before Arpaçay (the correct local name for the river). <a href="../../../m/e/o/User%7EMeowy_df2d.html" title="User:Meowy">Meowy</a> 02:22, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would think like that too, but I have seen several usages like <i>province</i> district of <i>district name</i>, and I am not a native speaker. Anyway, I found a website on Arpaçay, and they were mentioning as if Ani was in that district, but I might be wrong, please put the correct district name there. My changes were adding the Arpaçay district thing and saying that it is called Arpaçay by Turkish residents and Akhurian by the Armenians on the other side of the border. I don't see what is wrong with that. Also, looking at what I wrote above, I don't understand what you mean by "...by using Akhurian before Arpaçay ...". <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenizz_0c80.html" title="User:Denizz">deniz</a><sup><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenizz_ee75.html" title="User talk:Denizz">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Denizz_917f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Denizz">C</a></sub> 16:08, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In Turkey, regions are subdivided into districts, Ani is in the Kars Merkez district of Kars region. Ani is in Turkey, and the local residents there call the river the "Arpaçay". In Armenia, on the other side of the border, it is called the "Akhurian". Wikipedia policy (see <a href="../../../n/c/g/WP%7ENCGN_6405.html" title="WP:NCGN">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names)</a>) states that "the local official name should be listed before other alternate names", which means that in this case Arpaçay should be used before Akhurian. <a href="../../../m/e/o/User%7EMeowy_df2d.html" title="User:Meowy">Meowy</a> 21:25, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please take a look at it again. The first occurrence of Arpacay as a river is the in the third line, the first occurence of Akhurian (other than wikilink) is in the fourth line, 3 &lt; 4, right? <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenizz_0c80.html" title="User:Denizz">deniz</a><sup><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenizz_ee75.html" title="User talk:Denizz">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Denizz_917f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Denizz">C</a></sub> 21:47, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looking again, yes you are right (I had noted the wikilink to Akhurian came first, but I hadn't noted that you had changed the name in front of the link to Arpaçay). However, since there is another Arpaçay in nearby Naxcivan, maybe the wikilink should stay on the word Akhurian. How about this? "....and on its eastern side by the ravine of the river that is called Arpaçay in Turkey, <a href="../../../a/k/h/Akhurian_River_fa79.html" title="Akhurian River">Akhurian</a> in Armenia, and is a branch of the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aras_River_bb67.html" title="Aras River">Aras</a> that follows part of the current border between Turkey and Armenia." <a href="../../../m/e/o/User%7EMeowy_df2d.html" title="User:Meowy">Meowy</a> 16:42, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't mind moving the wikilink, but I think it would be better to keep it there. In any case I want us to keep the parts 'by Turkish residents' and 'Armenian people on the other side of border'. So, we can change it to "... its eastern side by the ravine of the river that is called <i>Arpaçay</i> by the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_people.html" title="Turkish people">Turkish</a> residents of the region, and <i>Ախուրյան</i> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/Akhurian_River_fa79.html" title="Akhurian River">Akhurian River</a>) by the Armenian people on the other side of the border", or keep it like I wrote above.

<dd>Neither of us are in a position to make generalised statements about what all "Turkish residents" or "Armenian people" call the river. Armenians also called it Arpaçay in the past, and the region's Kurdish population calls it Arpaçay to this day. I think all we can be is be specific, and say that in Turkey the river's official name is Arpaçay and in Armenia its official name is Akhurian. <a href="../../../m/e/o/User%7EMeowy_df2d.html" title="User:Meowy">Meowy</a> 00:23, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
