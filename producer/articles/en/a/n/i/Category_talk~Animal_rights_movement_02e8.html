<p>Except in exceptional cases, redundant categorization between sub- and main-category should be avoided. The activists should not be here given that a sub-category exists for them.

<dd>I'm at a loss as to understand this. The main category is activism. The sub-category is animal liberation movement (ALM), which includes activist groups, individuals, and their concerns. It's particularly inappropriate in the case of the ALM to remove the individual activists because the activists <i>are</i> the movement, and move fluidly between the "groups," which tend to be no more than activist names (<a href="../../../l/e/a/Leaderless_resistance.html" title="Leaderless resistance">leaderless resistance</a>), and descriptions of acts, rather than fixed organizations, with activist movement completely fluid between them, depending on what they're doing. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 16:24, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looking through your deletions, the other problem is that you're drawing somewhat inaccurate distinctions between people. You retain people like Peter Singer in the category, who could be described as one of backbones of the movement: not someone we could call an animal-rights activist but very important to them. But you remove Paul McCartney, and you make him an animal-rights activist, even though he isn't (not really an activist, and I have no idea whether he supports giving animals legal rights), but an important member of the animal liberation movement nevertheless (member of PETA, financial supporter of movement in general). Then you'll have a problem with people who have double roles: Steven Best, for example, is an activist (like e.g. Robin Webb) and also a theorist (like e.g. Peter Singer). The way you want to organize this would see him in one category for one thing and another for the other, even though both his roles are part of the same activity.</dd>

Some are what you might call "animal rights activists," some aren't. Some support animal "rights," some don't. Some are members of formal organizations, some aren't.

<p><a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">Wikipedia:Categorization</a> states "an article should not be in both a category and its subcategory" and later "a good general rule is that articles should be placed in the most specific categories they reasonably fit in." The activists should be placed in one or the other, not both, and the sub-cat seemed "the most specific." If you feel they make more sense here, I'd suggest simply deleting the sub-cat. Alternatively list the sub-cat in a different main category that isn't vertically related to this one, i.e., Animal rights. The double-up is then fine. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 17:40, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, first I'm not aware that what it says on the categorization page is policy. It makes no sense to me to say that items may belong in only the category or sub-category. But that aside, having an "animal rights activists" sub-category is fraught with complications, because it's a phrase they don't use of themselves, and it arguably only fits some of them, because it's far from clear what the definition is, and I can't think of what it could be that would fit them all. Animal liberation movement, however, does fit. I'm also confused as to why you went ahead and deleted the category from the activist pages rather than discussing it first. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:48, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../c/g/_/WP%7ECG_8b50.html" title="WP:CG">WP:CG</a> <i>is</i> a guideline and the specific ref is in my experience fairly well-established (like "crystal ball" say); the most recent example I can remember is on <a href="../../../e/a/r/Talk%7EEarth_2b6d.html" title="Talk:Earth">Talk:Earth</a> where I and other editors were talking to a trollish editor who wanted to re-cat the page. Absolutely, there are arguments against it:<a href="../../../a/b/u/Wikipedia%7EAbundance_and_redundancy_0089.html" title="Wikipedia:Abundance and redundancy">abundance and redundancy</a>, for instance (which I think has become sort of archaic due to little citation, but remains a good guideline). The argument in favour—that cat's in general would become unscaleable if listing in vertical-related cats were allowed—strikes me as the stronger argument. There is, BTW, an open thread on the topic on the Wiki Cat page if you want to comment.</dd>
<dd>Really, I felt this was a basic cat-sort attempt and that's why I edited without comment. If a cat is redundant with a higher order cat (particularly if they are one step-away) the less specific cat should be removed. I actually thought it more browseable: what's wrong, for instance, in removing the activists but also making a ref right at the top of this page to the activist sub-cat? 90+ is sort of longish.</dd>
<dd>"Having an 'animal rights activists' sub-category is fraught with complications..." OK, then maybe it should be simply deleted. If the movement <i>is</i> the activists, as you say, then perhaps the sub-cat actually obfuscates things. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 22:45, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If it's only a guideline, we don't have to follow it, though I confess to barely understanding it, so my sense of whether it's worth following isn't up to much. But yes, the point here is that the individual activists, writers, financiers, and the group names they act under, <i>are</i> the animal liberation movement, and to split them up into other categories would be misleading. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:58, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well now, we don't have to follow <i><a href="../../../i/g/n/Wikipedia%7EIgnore_all_rules_528b.html" title="Wikipedia:Ignore all rules">anything</a></i> at the end of the day&#160;:)—really, we don't. If I had an "Order From Jimbo" I'd cite that, but guidelines are guidelines—as best you can offer for what you are <i>supposed</i> to do. But a reasonable BOLD or IAR edit trumps even that. And to say again, I thought this your basic cat-sort undertaking <i>based on a guideline.</i></p>
<p>That caveat aside, do you wish to delete it? The alternatives I'd suggest are re-catting the sub-cat under Animal Rights or renaming it Animal Liberation Activists. In the latter case, I'd say the redundancy is even stronger and the "one or the other" would come to the fore more obviously. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 23:13, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I meant it's a guideline as opposed to policy. We're meant to follow policies; guidelines are suggestions. Personally, I see no need to have a generic animal-rights activist sub-category, but I didn't create it so I'm hesitant to suggest it be deleted, and I don't see the harm in having both. Can't you just leave things as they are? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:26, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Should places that have been targeted by the animal liberation movement be categorised here? I don't think they should, because they aren't part of the animal liberation movement. Arfan2006 21:14, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I think there may be some different opinions on this matter. You suggest not appropriate to categorize them here because they "aren't part of" the ALM. My understanding is that categories are not necessarily "true subcategories" in the sense of a logical "part of" relationship. Categories, as used in wikipedia, also indicate relationship to the subject. So if the targeted status is really significant to the subject of the article, then it should be listed in Cat:ALM -- and in a sense that makes sense, because where else would they be listed? But to avoid confusion with those who are "part of" the ALM and those who are "related to" or "targeted by" the ALM, subcategories would be appropriate -- for instance, Category:Targets of animal liberationists. However, that category might not make sense for other reasons though and might be inclined to be abused. Moreover, categorization of this category is not in consensus now, so it's not really clear how (if at all) it is appropriately subcategorized .... The upshot is that maybe a "List of targets of animal liberationists" would be better for any number of reasons; that doesn't answer whether it should be categorized in Category:Animal liberation movement; I would argue yes. --<a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">lquilter</a> 17:06, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Individual activists should be contained in a separate category to allow for easier access to information about such activists and to reference a specific animal rights activists category as a member of other categories without including the general category. For example, <a href="../../../a/n/i/Category%7EAnimal_rights_activists_0d08.html" title="Category:Animal rights activists">Category:Animal rights activists</a> (or whatever you want to call it) should be a member of <a href="../../../a/c/t/Category%7EActivists_b29d.html" title="Category:Activists">Category:Activists</a> and Category:Animal liberation movement. For one example, see <a href="../../../c/i/v/Category%7ECivil_rights_7340.html" title="Category:Civil rights">Category:Civil rights</a>.

<dd>Members of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Animal_rights_6d23.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Animal rights">Wikipedia:WikiProject Animal rights</a> have been preventing any categorization of animal rights activists. Some of their arguments may be found <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Animal_rights_cb1e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Animal rights">here</a>. I don't feel that any of their arguments are persuasive, compelling, or even address the issue. I've spent a significant amount of time searching academic databases, and the categorization of animal rights activists is fully supported. Additionally, this allows cross-references in <a href="../../../a/c/t/Category%7EActivists_b29d.html" title="Category:Activists">Category:Activists</a> and other categories. The project has gone so far as to redirect <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_rights_activism.html" title="Animal rights activism">Animal rights activism</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_animal_rights_activists.html" title="List of animal rights activists">List of animal rights activists</a>, both valid articles. Lastly, the article <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_rights_movement.html" title="Animal rights movement">Animal rights movement</a> is currently named <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_liberation_movement.html" title="Animal liberation movement">Animal liberation movement</a>, which violates naming convention guidelines.

<dd>I support taking this to CFD, however I recommend waiting until winter break is over for most students; the entire Animal rights project will probably block this CFD again, and that may be difficult to counter with fewer people participating. I suggest getting other WikiProjects involved, such as WikiProject Politics and WikiProject Sociology. Some of these activists are considered philosophers, so WikiProject Philosophy may or may not be helpful.

<p>I've orginally put the cat up for a renaming to <a href="../../../a/n/i/Category%7EAnimal_rights_movement_c8e8.html" title="Category:Animal rights movement">Category:Animal rights movement</a>, but there was already a <a href="../../../a/n/i/Category%7EAnimal_rights_groups_7267.html" title="Category:Animal rights groups">Category:Animal rights groups</a> I found out. Still "liberation" in this case is not neutral, since "liberation" in this case might mean using force against humans or property. You can share your thoughts here, or at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_ac22.html#Category:Animal_liberation_movement_to_Category:Animal_rights_movement" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion">Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion#Category:Animal_liberation_movement_to_Category:Animal_rights_movement</a>.

<dd>The cat isn't called "animal liberation," which I can see might be POV (at a stretch). It is called "animal liberation movement." That is simply the name of the movement. It contains people who agree with the concept of animal rights, and people who do not. I don't see the benefit of changing it. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:02, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I strongly disagree with the merge of Category:Animal liberation movement to <a href="../../../a/n/i/Category%7EAnimal_rights_701f.html" title="Category:Animal rights">Category:Animal rights</a>. Animal liberation is a very specific and well defined sub part of the animal rights movement, namely those who engage in <i>liberating</i> animals and employ <a href="../../../d/i/r/Direct_action.html" title="Direct action">Direct action</a> techniques to acheive those aims.

<dd>Yet again we have a poorly advertised CfD [discussion], from what I can tell there was not even a notice placed on the the category page.

<dd>From <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">WP:CFD</a> <i>Consider adding {{cfdnotice|Cfd section name}} to the main article's talk page</i> owing to the controvsy over the renaming it would have seemed apropriate in this circumstance. Again we had a CFD discussion where those who know something about the field were not involved.

<dd>Yes it was very poorly advertised. Animal rights&#160;!= Animal liberation and visa versa. I will be taking this to deletion review as people who no nothing about this area should not be able to judge on it without doing some basic research. There is a movement where people think animals should be liberated, it is called the animal liberation movement and the individuals are 'animal liberationists' - they are a subset of the animal rights movement but are not one and the same.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 18:41, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
