<dl>
<dd>His real name is Takaya Aiba, although he is more commonly referred to as Dangerous-Boy (D-Boy), his nickname. Originally on board the Argos when it was taken over by the aliens, Blade was freed by his father before the process of transformation could be completed, leaving him almost free from the Rahdam's influence. Blade swore to avenge the loss of his family and destroy Omega and the Rahdam.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Although one of the more powerful Tekkaman, Blade is disadvantaged by a number of factors: in a previous battle, Blade's crystal was shattered and he was no longer able to transform independently; having instead to rely on the robot Pegas; also, Blade cannot stay in his Tekkaman form for longer than half an hour, lest he digresses into a primal state in which he becomes uncontrollable; furthermore, Blade suffers from a severe case of amnesia throughout the series and the more he transforms into Tekkaman, the worse his amnesia becomes; in one episode, he completely forgets how to transform into Tekkaman. The transformation process itself also puts a considerable strain on Blade's body, increasing his metabolism and, later in the series, causing temporary blindness and threatening his very life.</dd>
