<dd>There's a developing article at <a href="http://www.amvwiki.org/index.php/AMV_ethics" class="external text" title="http://www.amvwiki.org/index.php/AMV_ethics" rel="nofollow">AMVWiki's AMV ethics article</a> (shameless plug, I know, but it's appropriate in this case). It's not a full discussion of all involved laws and there's a lot that could be added, but it does get the point across. Perhaps some sort of link to that article might work? -<a href="../../../y/i/p/User%7EYipdw_1ac9.html" title="User:Yipdw">Yipdw</a> 23:14, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Astonishingly, AMV/copyright discussion tends to dwell on the video clips - it is relatively unusual to mention the point that typically a complete piece of music owned by a Western copyright holder is used without permission!</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>It's a tricky subject, and one that apparently leads to a lot of heated debates and messages bouncing back and forth, I've seen.. In general, it depends on which question you're asking.. How do copyright laws concern the making of AMVs, or how do they concern the DISTRIBUTION of them? Concerning making them, there's nothing at all infringing or illegal about an AMV, provided you own the materials used to make it.. Distributing them IS another story, and that's where the debate lies..</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sure some will rise up to oppose my words here, but the legality of the video lies in who made it, has it been licensed outside of Japan (Due to a few differences in copyright law there), or has the author officially expressed permission, as some have? The audio can be even trickier.. Many AMV makers will use songs from local bands (Or some famous ones) with permission to distribute them, which makes them legal to distribute.. Some AMVs use other free-to-distribute songs.. A few of Boa's works come to mind, but anyway.. Most AMVs, however, are indeed made using songs they don't have permission to distribute.. Meaning, of course, that you can't distribute a copy of them to anyone who doesn't legally own the song.. To avoid this, I (And some others) will only distribute my AMVs with legitimate copies of the music artists' CDs.. It promotes their music and lets me get my AMVs out there without any fear whatsoever.. (I'm also choosy about what video I use)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Because the United States does technically respect Japanese copyrights, it is not legal on those grounds to create AMV. But what this article fails to state is that the Fair Use rules protect satire (parodies). The problem is whether or not the Fair Use provision protects AMVs for this purpose. Although it seems like it logically would, there have been legal threats made but no official court ruling in the US has been made. If anyone knows anything more recent please respond.</dd>

<p>As you can see it clearly says it is not a publisher of original thought. Throughout this article on AMVs I see comments on what people <i>think</i> is within the copyright laws with no references. I see people posting <i>famous</i> examples of AMVs. I see people posting a lot of <i>generalized opinions</i>. All of these things cannot be backed up or have no proper references attatched to them.</p>
<p>This article started as a simple <b>factual</b> description of what an AMV is.</p>

<dd>Actually, the "AMV creation" section seems like it should also go. To illustrate these examples, we'd really have to link to some videos that utilize those techniques, and until we find those, that section, too, is unverifiable hogwash. Yes? No? -<a href="../../../y/i/p/User%7EYipdw_1ac9.html" title="User:Yipdw">Yipdw</a> 23:20, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Listing AMVs that use these examples is very easy to find.. But I'm not sure a list of AMVs belongs on the Wiki anyway.. Perhaps a separate page on video editing techniques, and a link to that instead? (I agree it has no use here)</dd>

<p>Here's the first, obvious nitpick: Proper pluralization in English (which you SHOULD use, since you're on the English Wikipedia) is "AMVs." Not "AMV's." In a similar fashion, "criteria" is plural already. Singular is "criterion."</p>
<p>Second: The sections I removed lack any sort of factual reference whatsoever; they read like someone's brain-dump on animemusicvideos.org both in style and substance, listing not much more than personal opinion. The statements about low-quality footage reflecting incompetence, footage overuse, and categorization are great cases. The statement on AMV legality is even better, giving no real information whatsoever, except for a guess.</p>
<p>Guesses don't belong on Wikipedia. If you disagree, see Wikipedia policies.</p>
<p>Third: The section on "famous AMVs" exists solely for ego masturbation, which has no place on Wikipedia. The rule against "ego articles" makes that quite clear. -<a href="../../../y/i/p/User%7EYipdw_1ac9.html" title="User:Yipdw">Yipdw</a> 22:55, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Does anybody read this discussion page? Plenty of pages (<a href="../../../y/t/m/YTMND_ce03.html" title="YTMND">YTMND</a> notably) include 'famous' lists, and AMVs have at least <i>some</i> all-stars. Certainly (off the top of my head, as an Eva fan) you should include Jesmaster's <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion_8beb.html" title="Neon Genesis Evangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> video to Weird Al Polka, and Caldwell's Evangelion video to <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engel_%28song%29.html" title="Engel (song)">Engel</a>? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaxringold_44f9.html" title="User:Staxringold">Staxringold</a> 04:36, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think you are being entirely fair. One could make a case for not having AMV articles at all on this basis, which is of course absurd. Besides, doesn't the term "ego article" inply a personal stake on the part of the contributor? That is not the case here. I wonder if a revert might be possible until there is a consensus one way or the other? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hopcroft_b302.html" title="User:Michael Hopcroft">Michael Hopcroft</a> 06:39, 3 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><i>One could make a case for not having AMV articles at all on this basis, which is of course absurd.</i></dd>
<dd>How would that case be made? The AMV article itself attempts to describe a widespread artform. It does not (or, well, should not) glamorize any specific entity. Content of that sort seems better suited for separate (edit: that is, not here) Biggest and Best lists. (edit 2: Like the ones that already exist at <a href="http://www.animemusicvideos.org/home/home.php" class="external text" title="http://www.animemusicvideos.org/home/home.php" rel="nofollow">AnimeMusicVideos.org</a>.)</dd>
<dd><i>Besides, doesn't the term "ego article" inply a personal stake on the part of the contributor?</i></dd>
<dd>The term "ego article" does not necessarily imply a personal stake on behalf of the contributor. If the content is obscure enough, casual linking can be made to serve the ego of the creator of the material being linked -- see <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_guidelines_9511.html#Does_lack_of_fame_make_a_vanity_article.3F" title="Wikipedia:Vanity guidelines">vanity guidelines</a>. What constitutes "obscure enough" is obviously up for debate, but I clearly feel quite strongly that AMVs fall into that category. I'll admit that my initial objection was too strongly worded, though. -<a href="../../../y/i/p/User%7EYipdw_1ac9.html" title="User:Yipdw">Yipdw</a> 08:39, 3 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Exactly. Lists of 'major party' US politicians aren't ego masturbation for those parties, there are clearly defined parties that are more successful than others. Fame in the AMV world isn't quite as clear cut, but is still pretty obvious (again, the two examples I gave) <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaxringold_44f9.html" title="User:Staxringold">Staxringold</a> 10:58, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There have been rumors of a TV showcasing AMV's, so I went and check it out and there is in deed a TV show.

<dd>Most japanese AMV I have seen seems to be labelled <b>MAD</b> so maybe it's the term you are looking for&#160;? Btw the average japanese AMV seems to be of way higher quality than the average western AMV, and fans don't hesitate before creating theur own content instead of borrowing it - for example the 'Nakanai Kimi to Nageki no Sekai' for <a href="../../../h/i/g/Higurashi_no_naku_koro_ni.html" title="Higurashi no naku koro ni">Higurashi no naku koro ni</a> use fanarts and a song that was especially written and sung for this AMV.</dd>

<dd>One could argue that contributing to wikipedia entails at least SOME sort of original creative expression (putting stuff in your own words, etc.) Anime music videos, on the other hand, are simply pieced together from the artistic works of others.

<dd>By the same logic, <a href="../../../y/t/m/YTMND_ce03.html" title="YTMND">YTMND</a> is stupid - then again, there certainly is an argument for that.&#160;:/ My only counterargument is that people wish to see their favourite characters and scenes altered in parody, or to create an entertaining accompaniment for an okay song, and because anime mouth-cycles and animation lends itself to easy synchronization.

<dd>I don't think one can argue there is little creative input in an AMV. There are endless reams of songs and sources to use, to say nothing of editing and modifying the sources. It's a little like saying writing can not be very creative because all you're doing is rearranging words other people invented, y'know? -- <a href="../../../g/w/e/User_talk%7EGwern_64b9.html" title="User talk:Gwern">Gwern</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gwern_077f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gwern">(contribs)</a> 04:06, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>but isn't that the same as what your doing on wikipedia? Well some information is from your memory but most of the time it is from another website or information, also I don't think AMV can be seen as cannibalization as the fact that modifying an old creation is a type of art (EX:cutting up a piece of paper and putting it back together to make another picture) 67.81.148.142 02:00, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You see, the thing about movies and telelivsion is that it's not one art, but many arts. In a movie, theres acting, directing, writing, editing, ect. and they all help make the final product. But editing is really the only art that cant work without other arts, be them animation or cinematography, or music. Personally, I think AMVs are full of artistic expression because it's really the first time that the editing of a peice of art takes center stage, instead of supporting others.</p>
<dl>
<dd>What a load of utter tosh. In a postmodern sense, <i>all</i> creativity is cannibalism, however, all that is being done here is the creation of a montage, or musical collage. This is certainly not original and certainly not the first example of such work. This sort of thing has been a staple of Art and Film students for years before anyone ever heard of anime. Cartoons simply work well for this sort of thing because it's easier to fit lyrics to animated mouths with relatively limited expressive range. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesTheNumberless_fbad.html" title="User:JamesTheNumberless">JamesTheNumberless</a> 10:46, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It'd be nice if someone knowledgeable could add something on the history of AMVs; I suspect the practice came from Japan, but as it stands, the article doesn't seem to say anything one way or other. --<a href="../../../g/w/e/User_talk%7EGwern_64b9.html" title="User talk:Gwern">Gwern</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gwern_077f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gwern">(contribs)</a> 02:17, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

Regarding the history of AMVs, there's an interview with Jeff Tatarek at <a href="http://www.frontrowcrew.com/?p=264" class="external free" title="http://www.frontrowcrew.com/?p=264" rel="nofollow">http://www.frontrowcrew.com/?p=264</a>. -Jhar 216.255.101.58 14:04, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>The first known AMV ever created was Apocalypse Pooh, which was created in 1987, incorporating footage from the classic <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnie_the_Pooh_354d.html" title="Winnie the Pooh">Winnie the Pooh</a> cartoons with audio from the classic 1979 road film <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocalypse_Now_a6a5.html" title="Apocalypse Now">Apocalypse Now</a>.</i></dd>

<p>This was recently removed from the article. As a Google search or search of Youtube reveals, this apparently is very real, but alas, there are no solid sources that identify this as a AMV, nor that it was the very first one, either American, Japanese, or from anyone. It may well be true, but it would seem to be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">OR</a> in two ways. --<a href="../../../g/w/e/User_talk%7EGwern_64b9.html" title="User talk:Gwern">Gwern</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gwern_077f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gwern">(contribs)</a> 23:31 <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_19.html" title="January 19">19 January</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> (GMT)</p>
