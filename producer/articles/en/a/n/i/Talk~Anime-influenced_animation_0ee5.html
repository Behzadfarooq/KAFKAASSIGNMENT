<p>When did this category come about? As far as I know, this category did not exist during the 1990's - considering anime itself was growing in popularity. <a href="../../../k/y/u/User%7EKyuuA4_26f7.html" title="User:KyuuA4">KyuuA4</a> 22:01, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Avatar is animated in South Korea, so it is a combo of manhwa-yeonghwa and american writing. It doesn't seem to emulate anime, as it is genuingly drawn as a manhwa-yeonghwa. As this list is only for the visuals (ie animation), this show does not attempt to emulate anime, and if it does, then that makes every Korean animation to be emulating anime, which isn't true.24.218.65.219 16:38, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the key here is "American writing" (and art direction too). You have to think about style versus content, and the fact that almost everything is animated in SK nowadays (including "American" cartoons like the Simpsons), so style is more blurry (since it tends to travel faster than cultural content, as most writers tend to write about themselves in one way or another.) You can't say it's manhwa/yeonghwa because it was created in Korea. I think content matters here as much as style does. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 01:01, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But this is anime-influenced animation, not animated shows. This catagory is characterized by strictly art style. If it isn't (as you claim it to be), then shows like Winx and Witch shouldn't be on the list, as the only thing they have that is influenced by anime is the art style.Mishy dishy 01:03, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, apparently, anything that looks like anime but is not classified as anime belongs here. Also, the country of origin is not relevant. In my opinion, this is a very odd thing to do. It would be a lot easier to simply classify them as <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html" title="Anime">anime</a>, using the Japanese definition. <a href="../../../k/y/u/User%7EKyuuA4_26f7.html" title="User:KyuuA4">KyuuA4</a> 10:27, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For Avatar: The Airbender, this is what Sci-Fi Channel (one of the first network channels to air anime on TV) had to say: "With its long story arc, Asian-influenced designs and themes, terrific animation and zippy leaps between comedy and drama, Avatar blurs the line between anime and domestic cartoons until it becomes irrelevant. A great show is great no matter its country of origin." <a href="http://www.scifi.com/sfw/anime/sfw12366.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.scifi.com/sfw/anime/sfw12366.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>Needless to say, the line distinction between "cartoon" and "anime" is getting thinner. <a href="../../../k/y/u/User%7EKyuuA4_26f7.html" title="User:KyuuA4">KyuuA4</a> 21:45, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let alone, the true definition of anime, is that all cartoon are anime..."THROUGH FIRE, JUSTICE IS SERVED!" 03:06, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Read the credits to ANY American or Japanese anime or toon &amp; you will find that a great chunk of it was done in Korea. I'm familiar with 3 different styles of Korean anime &amp; Avatar doesn't fall into any of them. One style is the Aeon Flux/Heavy Metal type, another is the Pucca/I Love Egg type, &amp; the other looks like it was done in Japan; the Bastof Syndrome type. LikaLaruku 8:07, 26 November 2006.</p>

<p>Even if Peter Chung has participated many times in projects involving japanese companies; I'm not sure Aeon flux should be mention as an example of Amerime because it wasn't done with intentions to emulate Anime but just as an unique style for an MTV animation...and it was done before Amerime became popular between companies.</p>
<p>Any suggestions? (remember that other Peter Chung's works such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/Reign%7E_The_Conqueror_b169.html" title="Reign: The Conqueror">Reign: The Conqueror</a> (also known as "Alexander") were true Amerime because they were produced and directed in japanese companies)</p>
<p>I never thought of Aeon Flux as anime, it looks more like American animation and the creator is Korean so maybe there was a misconception with it being Korean animation-esque. <a href="../../../r/a/b/User%7ERabid_coathangers_eat_da_world_8826.html" title="User:Rabid coathangers eat da world">Rabid coathangers eat da world</a> 18:23, 14 May 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinakomel_a9a7.html" title="User:Minakomel">Minako-Chan*</a> 02:20, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It was made in America, thus it's not anime. It doesn't even look like anime, it looks like typical 80's/90's comic book art. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmibite_d059.html" title="User:Amibite">Amibite</a> 20:14, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No, I suggest a new article...this is something that has to be investigated to suggest a better name (if there is one) to Amerime...since Amerime is not real Anime (not made in japan), it shouldn't be merged into the Anime article, though it could be merge as an individual article linking to this main article, not as part of the whole Anime article. thank you. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinakomel_a9a7.html" title="User:Minakomel">Minako-Chan*</a> 04:16, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I say the name should be changed from amerime to animesque or psuedo-anime or animix. or "anime-nation" but DO NOT delete this article!!! this is the greatest debate on creative efforts for all the artists not working in japan. there are great things out there that are not anime but they are as great as japanimation. i say let all the japanese anime be called japanimation and everything else should be called anime. regards</p>

<li>Actually, what should be done is the same thing that was done over at <a href="../../../a/m/e/Amerimanga.html" title="Amerimanga">Amerimanga</a>: the fact is, Amerime is the best known name for this style/genre of animation, but also note that other names (I've heard "animesque") are also used.

<p>We cannot suggest new names to terms already existant. <b>Anime</b> is the name the japanese originaly gave to their particular style of animation and <b>Amerime</b> is the name that aparently the american comic industry gave to their anime-styled way of animating as well as the word "japanimation" which was also given by the american industry in the 80's.</p>
<p>If the history of these terms (except <b>anime</b>, which according to the wikipedia article of <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html" title="Anime">Anime</a>, it was derived from the french word for animation), please add it to this article.</p>
<p>About concidering european anime-styled animation part of <b>amerime</b>, you also have to think how the japanese see this, since probably for them; it all comes from the same place (or producer). The only way to change names is if you find information about a better name given to <b>amerime</b> and of course, give the link in the "external links" section of this article.</p>
<p><b>conclusion</b>: prove that another company has given a better name to describe non japanese anime-styled cartoons and that this name is popular among viewers. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinakomel_a9a7.html" title="User:Minakomel">Minako-Chan*</a> 01:25, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

Ok. This is about a newest growing work of art style. 
</pre>
<p>Tell me, have you seen "wonderful days"? it is a beautiful anime and similar to the artistic style of Ghost in the shell. But it is made in Korea. and there are countless other are coming. This field has just started to grow. and we just can't let few hundred 'japanimation' fans or American-anime fans to write off this style of animation as 'non anime'. This need to be baptized. This need to be clear and soon. Sure Japan and America are the biggest markets but it doesn't allow them to deny other artist's effort who is working in rest of the world man. Regards</p>

<p>I know some concider Korean animation not anime but you have to admit, it's the closest thing to anime, so it shouldn't be called inside the amerime category since they have worked in this kind of animation style for longer time that occidentals, not to mention that many games playable for the <a href="../../../p/s/2/PS2_0df1.html" title="PS2">PS2</a>/3 and <a href="../../../x/b/o/Xbox.html" title="Xbox">Xbox</a>(360°) were created by korean designers, a great example of this is Magna Carta, which character design was created by <a href="../../../h/y/u/Hyung-tae_Kim_5658.html" title="Hyung-tae Kim">Hyung-tae Kim</a> which artistic values have nothing to envy to many japanese <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga-ka.html" title="Manga-ka">manga-ka</a>.</p>

<p>Clearly it's not only american animators who are incorporating aspects of Japanese animation into their works. Can we rename this to "Anime-influenced animation" or something to that effect? Amerime can remain as a subsection or blurb since it seems to have some precendent among a small group of people(even though it was deleted for neologism three times over). As an article title, it's not appropriate because it only applies to a subset of the works being produced in this style. You can bet non-american artists aren't going to call their anime-influenced works amerime!--72.137.173.201 07:27, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree, it should be moved to <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime-influenced_animation.html" title="Anime-influenced animation">Anime-influenced animation</a>. While this article was deleted several times already and the original author even admitted in the last AfD that he intentionally created it as a neologism! The subject is notable, but the term is not. As much as I dislike <a href="../../../a/m/e/Amerimanga.html" title="Amerimanga">amerimanga</a>, at least that actually has some factual historical basis for the term, even if it's debatable how popular it is compared to say, OEL.

<p>Code Lyoko? Ying Yang Yo? Xiaolin Showdown? Megas? Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi? I'm not sure what anime you guys are watching, but I've yet to see any that look similar to these shows. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmibite_d059.html" title="User:Amibite">Amibite</a> 18 November</p>
<p>Taking influence from anime doesn't necessarilly mean the way a series looks, but the general style; storyline, action, characterisation etc.</p>

<p><font face="Tahoma">Then explain to me how <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crayon_Shin-chan_bccd.html" title="Crayon Shin-chan">Crayon Shin-chan</a> looks like any other anime. And agreed. The way a show looks does not categorize it as being anime - even though as much as I'd want to at least classify something like <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avatar.html" title="Avatar">Avatar</a> as anime. <a href="../../../k/y/u/User%7EKyuuA4_26f7.html" title="User:KyuuA4">KyuuA4</a> 16:29, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma">But aside from an overall generic art-style like Teen Titan's anime expressions, there's not really anything exclusive to anime that can't be found in books, comics, or shows from anywhere in the world. Thus the only way a show can really be anime influenced is by the art (or direct references to it, like Kappa Mikey) --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmibite_d059.html" title="User:Amibite">Amibite</a> 09:03, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</font></p>

<dd><font face="Tahoma">I think that Japanese culture and the Japanese language are exclusive to anime in terms of animated series. Both can affect the animation style. --Squilibob 12:20, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</font>
<dl>
<dd><font face="Tahoma">I don't see how you can say Japanese culture is exclusive only to anime, and it's kind of boarderline racism to think that the only reason any non-Japanese form of media would reference Japan is because of anime. There have been plenty of movies dating back to the 30s that reference or take place in Japan, long before anime was made. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmibite_d059.html" title="User:Amibite">Amibite</a> 01:53, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</font></dd>

<p><font face="Tahoma">You know, I don't see how Monev the Gale from Trigun looks anything like Venom from Spiderman, but Nightow still intended the character as an intentional refference to the infamous Spiderman villain. In other words, just because you don't see a resemblance, doesn't mean it wasn't intended. Take Code Lyoko for example, which you insist looks nothing like a Japanese animated series, yet the creators themselves admited being heavily influenced by their visual style, as shown <a href="http://www.codelyoko.net/FRA/Garage_Kids/Garage_Kids.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.codelyoko.net/FRA/Garage_Kids/Garage_Kids.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>.--Tenka Muteki 06:36, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma">Look closely at Amerime &amp; Amerimanga. AMERIME: The people who make it are copying outdated styles from the 60s, 70s, &amp; 90s. They're trying to use the looks found in Slayers, Astro Boy, &amp; Speed Racer. Comparing the anime character designs to it's manga counterpart reveals huge differences in style. AMERIMANGA: The reason these look so aweful is because the artists are using Anime-style character designs instead on Manga-style. I dare to call the Hellsing (Japanese) &amp; Labyrinth mangas (chinese artist)Amerimanga. Look at those sloppy profiles &amp; messy eyes. Just because you can draw props, hair, clothes, &amp; landscape is no excuse for such crappy character design. LikaLaruku 8:19pm, 27 November 2006</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Which brings up an interesting point, what do you call all the Japanese shows and manga that borrow elements from American stuff? Like One Piece, or Cowboy Bebop. I often see people complaining about stuff like Totally Spies, but all the anime that takes elements from American shows or comics don't ever seem to get any flak for it, or even bother mentioning it. Seems a bit hypocritical. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmibite_d059.html" title="User:Amibite">Amibite</a> 20:28, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</font></p>

<dd><font face="Tahoma">Unfortunately, at the present time, that sentiment is a one-way street. I've taken this discussion over to Anime News Network; but in the end, it was lambasted. <a href="../../../k/y/u/User%7EKyuuA4_26f7.html" title="User:KyuuA4">KyuuA4</a> 17:00, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</font></dd>

<p><font face="Tahoma">I proposed the article for deletion due to it mostly containing original research that can't really be verified, such as the background and criticism sections. The subject is also too general to justify having an article dedicated to it rather than simply mentioning it on the individual show's pages. Otherwise, we might as well create articles such "Star Wars influenced animation" or "James Bond influenced animation" and so forth for anything that might influence something else. Also, with only a handful of series listed out of the thousands there are out there, the notability is also extremely low. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmibite_d059.html" title="User:Amibite">Amibite</a> 22:27, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</font></p>
