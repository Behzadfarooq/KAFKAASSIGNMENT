<p>Moonesinghe was born in <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colombo.html" title="Colombo">Colombo</a>, Sri Lanka (then called <a href="../../../c/e/y/Ceylon.html" title="Ceylon">Ceylon</a>), on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_15.html" title="February 15">15 February</a> <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a>. A member of the family of <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anagarika_Dharmapala_c0c4.html" title="Anagarika Dharmapala">Anagarika Dharmapala</a> (who named him 'Anil Kumar'), he was brought up with <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist.html" title="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinhalese.html" title="Sinhalese">Sinhalese</a> <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalist.html" title="Nationalist">nationalist</a> values, as well as an abhorrence of the colonial power, <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Empire_782f.html" title="British Empire">Britain</a>.</p>
<p>He went to school at <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_College%2C_Colombo_6f7b.html" title="Royal College, Colombo">Royal College, Colombo</a>, an <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elite.html" title="Elite">elite</a> institution which produced many <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extremism.html" title="Extremism">radicals</a> as well as <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_servants.html" title="Civil servants">civil servants</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bourgeois.html" title="Bourgeois">bourgeois</a> politicians, where he won his colours in <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sports.html" title="Sports">athletics</a>. During the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a> he organised a brigade of boys to aid the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japanese</a> if they landed on the island and earned himself the nickname '<a href="../../../r/o/m/Rommel.html" title="Rommel">Rommel</a>' at school. Later he became influenced by <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">communism</a> (he wrote in praise of the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Air_Force_3d9e.html" title="Red Air Force">Red Air Force</a>) and specifically by Trotskyism.</p>
<p>He went on to University College, Colombo (which later became <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Colombo_4a21.html" title="University of Colombo">Colombo University</a>), where he excelled in athletics, representing his University at the All India Universities Athletic Meet which was held regularly in those years. He won an exhibition to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_London_fd08.html" title="University of London">University of London</a> and went to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>. He sailed on board a <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troopship.html" title="Troopship">troopship</a>; when the news of <a href="../../../c/h/u/Churchill.html" title="Churchill">Churchill</a>'s defeat at the general election came through, all the soldiers on board threw their caps in the air and cheered, a fact which greatly encouraged him.</p>

The group later became the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Workers_Party_%28Britain%29_d2ca.html" title="Socialist Workers Party (Britain)">Socialist Workers Party</a> (SWP).

<p>For a time he worked as an overhead crane operator at Southern Forge Ltd, <a href="../../../l/a/n/Langley%2C_Slough_2712.html" title="Langley, Slough">Langley, Slough</a>. He married <b>Jeanne Hoban</b> in 1948 and they moved into a houseboat called 'Red October', which they built together, on the Thames near Marlow. They both entered the Labour Party in <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slough.html" title="Slough">Slough</a>, on the heels of a group of the RCP, led by <a href="../../../j/o/c/Jock_Haston_d7a5.html" title="Jock Haston">Jock Haston</a>. Anil was a speaker for the National Council of Labour Colleges; while Jeanne was elected to the Executive of the Labour Leagues of Youth, later being put on the list of Labour Parliamentary candidates.

<p>His parents summoned Anil back to Colombo urgently in 1952. He was called to the Bar and practised law all over the island. He and Jeanne joined the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lanka_Sama_Samaja_Party_59cb.html" title="Lanka Sama Samaja Party">Lanka Sama Samaja Party</a> (LSSP) and worked in the Lanka Estate Workers' Union (LEWU), which organised labourers on the tea and rubber plantations. At the time the British were still very powerful on the island, in spite of Ceylon having obtained a form of independence in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>. The British planters prevailed upon the government to <a href="../../../d/e/p/Deport.html" title="Deport">deport</a> Jeanne, but she went into hiding and the LSSP fought successfully to prevent the deportation.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a> the LEWU sent him to the Mohomediya Estate in <a href="../../../a/g/a/Agalawatte.html" title="Agalawatte">Agalawatte</a>, in the Pasdun Korale (county) to organise a strike there. He was so successful that the Agalawatte Local of the LSSP asked for him to be sent as the Party's parliamentary candidate for the constituency. At the time, the seat was held by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_National_Party_fc5b.html" title="United National Party">United National Party</a> (UNP) with a comfortable majority (the plantation workers, who were a large minority of the electorate, were disenfranchised by the UNP Government in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a>). In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a> he won the election for this seat in Parliament representing Agalawatte for 11 years. He worked hard for his constituency, building roads and schools through self-help and worked for the welfare of the poorest sections, particularly for the neglected so-called lower <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castes.html" title="Castes">castes</a>.</p>
<p>He also successfully contested the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Working-class.html" title="Working-class">working-class</a> Dematagoda <a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward_%28politics%29.html" title="Ward (politics)">Ward</a> of the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colombo_Municipal_Council_dd32.html" title="Colombo Municipal Council">Colombo Municipal Council</a>, but found that working in Agalawatte took up too much time for him to devote any to his ward work.</p>
<p>Together with Jeanne, he joined Sri Lanka's first <a href="../../../c/o/-/Co-operative.html" title="Co-operative">co-operative</a> housing scheme, the Gothatuwa Building Society, founded by Herbert Keuneman, <a href="../../../s/e/n/Seneka_Bibile_2275.html" title="Seneka Bibile">Seneka Bibile</a>, 'Bonnie' Fernando and other members of the radical <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligentsia.html" title="Intelligentsia">intelligentsia</a>. This led to the foundation of the <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welikadawatte.html" title="Welikadawatte">Welikadawatte</a> housing estate, which attained some fame as an island of intellectual creativity.</p>
<p>He was elected to the Central Committee of the LSSP and then onto its Political Bureau (<a href="../../../p/o/l/Politburo.html" title="Politburo">Politburo</a>), a position he never lost until he left the party. In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a> he spoke in Parliament condemning the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_invasion_of_Hungary_cf6d.html" title="Soviet invasion of Hungary">Soviet invasion of Hungary</a>. In 1960, <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> opened an Embassy in Colombo, and he advised the new ambassador unofficially on how to operate in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a> he went to Yugoslavia for an <a href="../../../i/n/t/Inter-Parliamentary_Union_91c9.html" title="Inter-Parliamentary Union">Inter-Parliamentary Union</a> conference. There he had an opportunity to view at close hand the operation of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Workers%27_Councils_1bc5.html" title="Workers' Councils">Workers' Councils</a>. He was deeply impressed by the level of open debate that he found at these councils, and this experience was to aid him in later years.</p>

<p>At the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a> LSSP conference, he was aligned with Dr <a href="../../../n/2E/m/N.M._Perera_9c1f.html" title="N.M. Perera">N.M. Perera</a> on the question of whether or not to enter the Coalition Government of Mrs <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sirimavo_Bandaranaike_d5ea.html" title="Sirimavo Bandaranaike">Sirimavo Bandaranaike</a>. The Party did enter the Government and he became one of the first three Trotskyist cabinet ministers. He received the portfolio of Communications (Transport) and set to work to build up the country's transport resources. He established Employees' Councils to help run the Ceylon Government Railway and the <a href="../../../c/e/y/Ceylon_Transport_Board_89f8.html" title="Ceylon Transport Board">Ceylon Transport Board</a> (CTB). He obtained a large parcel of land in the centre of Colombo for establishing a Central Bus Station (CBS) in close proximity to the main Fort Railway Station. The construction of the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bandaranaike_International_Airport_2a8e.html" title="Bandaranaike International Airport">new International Airport</a> at <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katunayake.html" title="Katunayake">Katunayake</a> (a former <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Air_Force_e156.html" title="Royal Air Force">RAF</a> base which had been taken over in 1957) was also started by him. He negotiated an agreement with the <a href="../../../f/i/a/FIAT_6c05.html" title="FIAT">FIAT</a> company to build buses in Sri Lanka. However, the Government was defeated shortly thereafter and he was unable to complete his work - the next government did not sign the agreement with FIAT.</p>
<p>At the next general election he held his Parliamentary seat. However, in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> he lost it on an election petition, although the LSSP retained the Agalawatte seat at the subsequent <a href="../../../b/y/e/Bye-election.html" title="Bye-election">bye-election</a>. He was editor of the daily <i>Janadina</i> newspaper for a short while around this time. He visited <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czechoslovakia.html" title="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> during the '<a href="../../../p/r/a/Prague_Spring_4241.html" title="Prague Spring">Prague Spring</a>' and was again impressed by the activities of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Workers%27_Councils_1bc5.html" title="Workers' Councils">Workers' Councils</a> there. He later wrote a book condemning the Soviet invasion which ousted <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Dub%C4%8Dek_16d6.html" title="Alexander Dubček">Alexander Dubček</a>.</p>
<p>He succeeded Dr N.M. Perera as President of the redoubtable <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Ceylon_United_Motor_Workers%27_Union_b9e1.html" title="All Ceylon United Motor Workers' Union">All Ceylon United Motor Workers' Union</a> (ACUMWU). He also set about organising the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Corporations_and_Mercantile_Union_1ae6.html" title="United Corporations and Mercantile Union">United Corporations and Mercantile Union</a> (UCMU) which brought together workers in government corporations, and of which he was General Secretary. He went around the country from factory to factory and built up a union of several tens of thousands of members. One of his lieutenants in this task was Vasudeva Nanayakkara, who became an MP in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>. At the 1970 General Election, the UCMU also sponsored the candidature of novice <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahinda_Rajapakse_4c41.html" title="Mahinda Rajapakse">Mahinda Rajapakse</a>, who was the Chairman of its Vidyodaya University branch and who was later to become Prime Minister and then President of Sri Lanka.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/i/Anil_Moonesinghe_d622.html" title="Edit section: CTB Chairman">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">CTB Chairman</span></h3>
<p>After the 1970 election, at which the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Front_b929.html" title="United Front">United Front</a> (UF) won a landslide victory, the workers at the CTB spontaneously established workers' committees and took over the running of the institution. They also asked for Anil Moonesinghe to be made Chairman of the Board. The new Government therefore appointed him Chairman and General Manager. Thus began the most successful years of the CTB as an institution. For the last two of the five years he was there, the CTB ran at a profit, while providing a service which was never previously or subsequently matched. In this he was aided by his Minister, Leslie Goonawardena.</p>
<p><br />
Senior citizens still nostalgically refer to the CTB under Moonesinghe, which provided an efficient and disciplined service to the public.<a href="http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2005/03/27/editorial.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2005/03/27/editorial.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> He would dress in a bush shirt and trousers and operate as a one-man flying squad to catch errant bus crews in the act, lying in wait in his metallic blue <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volkswagen_Variant_31fd.html" title="Volkswagen Variant">Volkswagen Variant</a> or his <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citro%C3%ABn_2CV_4112.html" title="Citroën 2CV">Citroën 2CV</a> at places like Dematagoda Junction to prowl on them. <a href="http://www.dailynews.lk/2002/12/18/fea08.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dailynews.lk/2002/12/18/fea08.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Stories would abound (all untrue) of him being spotted disguised with a beard. In order to prove that eight buses could be serviced in a day, he once personally carried out eight vehicle services at the Central Workshops, Werahera.</p>
<p>In addition to the role in management of the Employees' Councils (which the workers' committees were transformed into after being properly constituted, with democratic elections supervised by the Elections Commission), commuter organisations were included in an advisory role. The services were expanded and measures were taken to improve efficiency, including rationalising bus types. The CTB started buying buses from the <a href="../../../i/s/u/Isuzu.html" title="Isuzu">Isuzu</a> Company of Japan, in order to offset any cartelisation by <a href="../../../t/a/t/TATA_Engineering_and_Locomotive_Company_6344.html" title="TATA Engineering and Locomotive Company">Tata</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashok_Leyland_ade1.html" title="Ashok Leyland">Ashok Leyland</a>, the main suppliers, and also purchased <a href="../../../i/k/a/Ikarus_Bus_66c5.html" title="Ikarus Bus">Ikarus</a> buses from Hungary. Several new bus stands and bus depots were established. A modern, multi-storied bus station was planned at the CBS, complete with hotel and cinema, but this would never be completed.</p>
<p>Moonesinghe also took measures to build up local industry and the CTB became well equipped with foundries and workshops: the Central Workshop at Werahera became the largest in South Asia. The local modification of ticket machines was started after employees pointed out many unsuitable features, and a new workshop was acquired for this. In 1974 he started the assembly of bus chassis and prototypes of a locally manufactured bus and a car rolled out of Werahera.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>, when the <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janatha_Vimukthi_Peramuna_775f.html" title="Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna">Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna</a> (JVP - People's Liberation Front) staged an insurrection, he formed a 2,000-strong para-military body, the Hansa Regiment (of which he was honorary Colonel), from among the employees of the CTB to guard bus depots, bus stands and workshops. He also created 'CANTAB', a secret intelligence organisation, the agents of whom were employees of the CTB, which provided accurate reports of the strength and distribution of JVP units. JVP cadres would prefer to surrender to the Hansa Regiment as this was known not to execute or torture prisoners.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>, Leslie Gunawardena and he were preparing the ground for a major shift in the management of the CTB, whereby Employees' Council representatives were to form half the Board of Directors. However, in September that year the UF broke up and the LSSP Ministers were removed, so Anil resigned from the CTB.</p>
<p>At this time he also joined the editorial board of 'State', a theoretical journal of the LSSP, published in three languages. He was briefly employed at this time, by the Government of <a href="../../../g/u/y/Guyana.html" title="Guyana">Guyana</a>, as a consultant on transport.</p>
<p>He contested the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a> election for the Matugama constituency, which lay next to Agalawatte. He was narrowly beaten into third place by the sitting member of the SLFP. He became deputy secretary of the LSSP in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, having supported the group led by NM Perera at that year's conference. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>, he was arrested for his part in the General Strike, but later released without any charges being made. At this time he wrote a book on the repression of the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solidarity.html" title="Solidarity">Solidarity</a> union in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a>.</p>

<p>He split from the LSSP in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> over its refusal to go into coalition with Mrs <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sirimavo_Bandaranaike_d5ea.html" title="Sirimavo Bandaranaike">Sirimavo Bandaranaike</a>'s <a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Lanka_Freedom_Party_537e.html" title="Sri Lanka Freedom Party">Sri Lanka Freedom Party</a> (SLFP), forming the <a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Lanka_Sama_Samaja_Party_55ea.html" title="Sri Lanka Sama Samaja Party">Sri Lanka Sama Samaja Party</a> (SLSSP) with other breakaways. He supported Hector Kobbekaduwa at the Presidential Election of that year. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> the SLSSP dissolved itself and he joined the SLFP and contested the Matugama seat at a <a href="../../../b/y/e/Bye-election.html" title="Bye-election">bye-election</a> and won. He represented Matugama until 1989 and then was one of the MPs - under <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proportional_representation.html" title="Proportional representation">proportional representation</a> - for the <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalutara_District_0753.html" title="Kalutara District">Kalutara District</a> until <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>. During the 1983 anti-Tamil pogrom, he intervened to save several people from death. During the 'White Terror' of 1988-90, he was active in saving hundreds of suspects from summary execution - at one point having to threaten an Army commandant with attack.</p>
<p>In the early <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> he was elected a vice-president of the SLFP and was part of a re-organisation drive led by <a href="../../../a/n/u/Anura_Bandaranaike_3b8a.html" title="Anura Bandaranaike">Anura Bandaranaike</a>, DM Jayaratne, Berty Premalal Dissanayake and <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahinda_Rajapakse_4c41.html" title="Mahinda Rajapakse">Mahinda Rajapakse</a>.</p>
<p>In opposition, he was the spokesperson for Transport (he was also President of the Sri Lanka National Transport Workers' Union) and expected to receive that portfolio in the event of the SLFP returning to power. However, after the victory in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> of the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Alliance_4464.html" title="People's Alliance">People's Alliance</a>, the new Prime Minister, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandrika_Kumaratunga_06b8.html" title="Chandrika Kumaratunga">Chandrika Kumaratunga</a> did not make him a Minister. Instead, he became <a href="../../../d/e/p/Deputy_Speaker_b40b.html" title="Deputy Speaker">Deputy Speaker</a> and Chairman of Committees of Parliament. Soon after this, he was elected President of the <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahabodhi_Society_d42c.html" title="Mahabodhi Society">Mahabodhi Society</a>, a Buddhist Missionary organisation headquartered in Colombo.</p>
<p>He was disoriented by the rather <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derogatory_use_of_%27Byzantine%27_5243.html" title="Derogatory use of 'Byzantine'">Byzantine</a> internal politics of the SLFP. In the LSSP debate was out open and was democratic, with matters being finally settled with a vote. His habit of speaking his mind, which had only irritated others in the LSSP, proved to be a liability in his new political home. After becoming Deputy Speaker, he grew close to Mrs Bandaranaike, who had herself been deserted by many of her closest allies. Her death affected him deeply.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> he was appointed Sri Lanka's Ambassador to <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>, accredited to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a>, the <a href="../../../u/n/_/UN_0433.html" title="UN">UN</a>, the <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia">former Yugoslav republics</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>, the <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czech_republic.html" title="Czech republic">Czech republic</a> and <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slovakia.html" title="Slovakia">Slovakia</a>. He had a close relationship with <a href="../../../v/%C3%A1/c/V%C3%A1clav_Havel_1e7e.html" title="Václav Havel">Václav Havel</a>, the President of the Czech Republic, due to his connections with the oppositional movement in Czechoslovakia since the Prague Spring. After the victory of the UNP at the general election of December <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, he was recalled.</p>
<p>He died on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_8.html" title="December 8">8 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> in Colombo. He left four children, Janaki, Vinod, Previn and Priyanka, the last two by a second marriage to <b>Joan de Zilva</b>.</p>
