<p>There are two broad divisions:</p>
<ol>
<li>all animals of a given species are sacred, perhaps owing to the impossibility of distinguishing the sacred few from the profane crowd;</li>
<li>one or a fixed number of a species are sacred. It is probable that the first of these forms is the primary one and the second in most cases a development from it due to
<ol>
<li>the influence of other individual cults,</li>
<li>anthropomorphic tendencies,</li>
<li>the influence of chieftainship, hereditary and otherwise,</li>
<li>annual sacrifice of the sacred animal and mystical ideas connected therewith,</li>
<li>syncretism, due either to unity of function or to a philosophic unification,</li>
<li>the desire to do honour to the species in the person of one of its members, and possibly other less easily traceable causes.</li>

<p>Treating cults according to their meaning, which is not necessarily identical with the cause which first led to the deification of the animal in question, we can classify them under ten specific heads:</p>
<p><a name="Pastoral_cults" id="Pastoral_cults"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_worship.html" title="Edit section: Pastoral cults">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pastoral cults</span></h3>
<p>The pastoral type falls into two sub-types, in which the species</p>
<ol>
<li>is spared and</li>
<li>sometimes receives special honour at intervals in the person of an individual. (See <i>Cattle</i>, <i>Buffalo</i>, below.)</li>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_worship.html" title="Edit section: Hunting cults">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hunting cults</span></h3>
<p>In hunting cults the species is habitually killed, but</p>
<ol>
<li>occasionally honoured in the person of a single individual, or</li>
<li>each slaughtered animal receives divine honours. (See <i>Bear</i>, below.)</li>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_worship.html" title="Edit section: Dangerous or noxious animals">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dangerous or noxious animals</span></h3>
<p>The cult of dangerous animals is due</p>
<ol>
<li>to the fear that the soul of the slain beast may take vengeance on the hunter,</li>
<li>to a desire to placate the rest of the species. (See <i>Leopard</i>, below.)</li>

<p>Animals are frequently regarded as the abode, temporary or permanent, of the souls of the dead, sometimes as the actual souls of the dead. Respect for them is due to two main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>the kinsmen of the dead desire to preserve the goodwill of their dead relatives;</li>
<li>they wish at the same time to secure that their kinsmen are not molested and caused to undergo unnecessary suffering. (See <i>Serpent</i>, below.)</li>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_worship.html" title="Edit section: Totemistic cults">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Totemistic cults</span></h3>
<p>One of the most widely found modes of showing respect to animals is known as totemism (see <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totem.html" title="Totem">totem</a>), but except in decadent forms there is but little positive worship; in Central Australia, however, the rites of the Wollunqua totem group are directed towards placating this mythical animal, and cannot be termed anything but religious ceremonies.</p>
<p><br />
In secret societies we find bodies of men grouped together with a single tutelary animal; the individual, in the same way, acquires the nagual or individual totem, sometimes by ceremonies of the nature of the bloodbond.</p>

<p>Spirits of vegetation in ancient and modern Europe and in China are conceived in animal form. (See <i>Goat</i>, below.)</p>

<p>The ominous animal or bird may develop into a deity. (See <i>Hawk</i>, below.)</p>

<p>It is commonly assumed that the animals associated with certain deities are sacred because the god was originally theriomorphic; this is doubtless the case in certain instances; but Apollo Smintheus, Dionysus Bassareus and other examples seem to show that the god may have been appealed to for help and thus become associated with the animals from whom he protected the crops, and so on.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_worship.html" title="Edit section: Cults of animals used in magic">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cults of animals used in magic</span></h3>
<p>The use of animals in magic may sometimes give rise to a kind of respect for them, but this is of a negative nature. See, however, articles by Preuss in Globus, vol. lxvii., in which he maintains that animals of magical influence are elevated into divinities.</p>

<p>The bear enjoys a large measure of respect from all cultures that come in contact with it, which shows itself in apologies and in festivals in its honour. The most notable ceremonies involving bears are found in East Asia. The <a href="../../../a/i/n/Ainu_people.html" title="Ainu people">Ainu people</a>, who maintain a ceremony called <i><a href="../../../i/o/m/Iomante.html" title="Iomante">Iomante</a></i>, are considered to be the only remaining bear cult. This ceremony is not as popular among the Ainu as it once was, but is still practiced in small, private gatherings.</p>
<p>There is a similar festival among the nearby <a href="../../../n/i/v/Nivkhs.html" title="Nivkhs">Nivkhs</a>, but here it takes the form of a celebration in honour of a recently dead kinsman, to whom the spirit of the bear is sent. There have been some attempts to revive the practice.</p>
<p>There is a good deal of evidence to connect the Greek goddess <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artemis.html" title="Artemis">Artemis</a> with a cult of the bear. Girls danced as "bears" in her honour, and might not marry before undergoing this ceremony. According to mythology, the goddess once transformed a <a href="../../../n/y/m/Nymph.html" title="Nymph">nymph</a> into a bear and then into the constellation <a href="../../../u/r/s/Ursa_Major_c8b8.html" title="Ursa Major">Ursa Major</a>.</p>
<p>The bear is traditionally associated with <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bern.html" title="Bern">Bern</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. It is believed that the city's name derives from the Germanic word for "bears" (<i>Bären</i> in <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a>) and a bear is featured on the city's flag and coat of arms. In 1832 a statue of the <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic_mythology.html" title="Celtic mythology">Celtic</a> bear goddess <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artio.html" title="Artio">Artio</a> was dug up there.</p>

<p>Cattle and bison are respected by many pastoral peoples that rely on the animals for sustenance and the killing of an ox is a sacrificial function.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../t/o/d/Toda_%28tribe%29.html" title="Toda (tribe)">Toda</a> of southern <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> abstain from the flesh of their domestic animal, the buffalo. However, once a year they sacrifice a bull calf, which is eaten in the forest by the adult males. The buffalo plays an important part in many Toda rituals. These buffalo are currently endangered.</p>
<p>Conspicuous among Egyptian animal cults was that of the bull, <a href="../../../a/p/i/Apis.html" title="Apis">Apis</a>. It was distinguished by certain marks, and when the old Apis died a new one was sought. The finder was rewarded, and the bull underwent four months' education at <a href="../../../n/i/l/Nilopolis.html" title="Nilopolis">Nilopolis</a>. Its birthday was celebrated once a year when oxen, which had to be pure white, were sacrificed to it. Women were forbidden to approach it when once its education was finished. Oracles were obtained from it in various ways. After death it was mummified and buried in a rock-tomb. Less widespread was the cult of the <a href="../../../m/n/e/Mnevis.html" title="Mnevis">Mnevis</a>, also consecrated to <a href="../../../o/s/i/Osiris.html" title="Osiris">Osiris</a>.</p>
<p>Similar observances are found in our own day on the Upper <a href="../../../n/i/l/Nile.html" title="Nile">Nile</a>. The <a href="../../../n/u/b/Nuba.html" title="Nuba">Nuba</a> and <a href="../../../n/u/e/Nuer.html" title="Nuer">Nuer</a> revere cattle. The Angoni of Central Africa and the <a href="../../../s/a/k/Sakalava.html" title="Sakalava">Sakalava</a> of Madagascar keep sacred bulls. In <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> respect for the cow is widespread, but is of post-Vedic origin; there is little actual worship, but the products of the cow are important in magic.</p>

All over that region it is the chief figure in a group of myths, fulfilling the office of a culture hero who brings the light, gives fire to mankind, and so on.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_worship.html" title="Edit section: Dog">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dog</span></h3>
<p>Actual dog worship is uncommon. The Nosarii of western Asia are said to worship a dog. The Kalang of Java had a cult of the red dog, each family keeping one in the house. According to one authority the dogs are images of wood which are worshipped after the death of a member of the family and burnt after a thousand days. In <a href="../../../n/e/p/Nepal.html" title="Nepal">Nepal</a> it is said that dogs are worshipped at the festival called Khicha Puja. Among the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harranian.html" title="Harranian">Harranians</a> dogs were sacred, but this was rather as brothers of the mystae.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_worship.html" title="Edit section: Elephant">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Elephant</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thailand.html" title="Thailand">Thailand</a> it is believed that a white elephant may contain the soul of a dead person, perhaps a Buddha. When one is taken the capturer is rewarded and the animal brought to the king to be kept ever afterwards. It cannot be bought or sold. It is baptized and fêted and mourned for like a human being at its death. In some parts of Indo-China the belief is that the soul of the elephant may injure people after death; it is therefore fêted by a whole village. In <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambodia.html" title="Cambodia">Cambodia</a> it is held to bring luck to the kingdom. In <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumatra.html" title="Sumatra">Sumatra</a> the elephant is regarded as a tutelary spirit. The cult of the white elephant is also found at Ennarea in southern <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethiopia.html" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>. In India, the popular Hindu god Ganesha has the head of an elephant and a torso of a human.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_worship.html" title="Edit section: Fish">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fish</span></h3>
<p>According to the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> scholar <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashi.html" title="Rashi">Rashi</a>, the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canaan.html" title="Canaan">Canaanite</a> god <a href="../../../d/a/g/Dagon.html" title="Dagon">Dagon</a> was a fish god. This tradition may have originated here, with a misinterpretation, but recently uncovered <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relief.html" title="Relief">reliefs</a> suggest a fish-god with human head and hands was worshipped by people who wore fish-skins.</p>

<p><a href="../../../d/i/o/Dionysus.html" title="Dionysus">Dionysus</a> was believed to take the form of a goat, probably as a divinity of vegetation. <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan_%28mythology%29.html" title="Pan (mythology)">Pan</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silenus.html" title="Silenus">Silenus</a>, the <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satyr.html" title="Satyr">Satyrs</a> and the <a href="../../../f/a/u/Faun.html" title="Faun">Fauns</a> were either capriform or had some part of their bodies shaped like that of a goat. In northern Europe the wood spirit, <a href="../../../l/e/s/Leszi.html" title="Leszi">Leszi</a>, is believed to have a goat's horns, ears and legs.

<p>In North <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borneo.html" title="Borneo">Borneo</a> we seem to see the evolution of a god in the three stages of the cult of the hawk among the Kenyahs, the Kayans and the sea <a href="../../../d/y/a/Dyaks.html" title="Dyaks">Dyaks</a>. The Kenyahs will not kill it, address to it thanks for assistance, and formally consult it before leaving home on an expedition. It seems, however, to be regarded as the messenger of the supreme god Balli Penyalong. The Kayans have a hawk-god, Laki Neho, but seem to regard the hawk as the servant of the chief god, Laki Tenangan. Singalang Burong, the hawk-god of the Dyaks, is completely anthropomorphized. He is god of omens and ruler of the omen birds, but the hawk is not his messenger. For he never leaves his house. Stories are, however, told of his attending feasts in human form and flying away in hawk form when all was over.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_worship.html" title="Edit section: Serpent">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Serpent</span></h3>
<p>The worship of the serpent is found in many parts of the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_World_14db.html" title="Old World">Old World</a>, although it is not unknown in the Americas. In Australia, the Aboriginal people worship a huge python, known by a variety of names but universally referred to as the Rainbow Serpent, that was said to have created the landscape, embodied the spirit of fresh water and punished lawbreakers. The Aborigines in southwest Australia called the serpent the Waugyl, while the Warramunga of the east coast worshipped the mythical Wollunqua. In Africa the chief centre of serpent worship was <a href="../../../d/a/h/Dahomey.html" title="Dahomey">Dahomey</a>. but the cult of the python seems to have been of exotic origin, dating back to the first quarter of the <a href="../../../1/7/t/17th_century.html" title="17th century">17th century</a>. By the conquest of Whydah the Dahomeyans were brought in contact with a people of serpent worshippers, and ended by adopting from them the beliefs which they at first despised. At Whydah, the chief centre, there is a serpent temple, tenanted by some fifty snakes. Every python of the <i>danh-gbi</i> kind must be treated with respect, and death is the penalty for killing one, even by accident. <i>Danh-gbi</i> has numerous wives, who until 1857 took part in a public procession from which the profane crowd was excluded; a python was carried round the town in a hammock, perhaps as a ceremony for the expulsion of evils. The rainbow-god of the Ashanti was also conceived to have the form of a snake. His messenger was said to be a small variety of boa. but only certain individuals, not the whole species, were sacred. In many parts of Africa the serpent is looked upon as the incarnation of deceased relatives. Among the Amazulu, as among the <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betsileo.html" title="Betsileo">Betsileo</a> of Madagascar, certain species are assigned as the abode of certain classes. The <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masai.html" title="Masai">Masai</a>, on the other hand, regard each species as the habitat of a particular family of the tribe.</p>
<p>In America some of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas_3e71.html" title="Indigenous peoples of the Americas">Native American</a> tribes give reverence to the rattlesnake as grandfather and king of snakes who is able to give fair winds or cause tempest. Among the <a href="../../../h/o/p/Hopi.html" title="Hopi">Hopi</a> of <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona.html" title="Arizona">Arizona</a> the serpent figures largely in one of the dances. The rattlesnake was worshipped in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natchez.html" title="Natchez">Natchez</a> temple of the sun and the <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> deity <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quetzalcoatl.html" title="Quetzalcoatl">Quetzalcoatl</a> was a feathered serpent-god. In many MesoAmerican cultures, the serpent was regarded as a portal between two worlds. The tribes of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peru.html" title="Peru">Peru</a> are said to have adored great snakes in the pre-Inca days and in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chile.html" title="Chile">Chile</a> the <a href="../../../m/a/p/Mapuche.html" title="Mapuche">Mapuche</a> made a serpent figure in their deluge beliefs.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/n/a/Snake_worship.html" title="Snake worship">Snake worship</a> refers to the high status of snakes in <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu_mythology.html" title="Hindu mythology">Hindu mythology</a>.Over a large part of India there are carved representations of cobras (<a href="../../../n/a/g/Naga_%28mythology%29.html" title="Naga (mythology)">nagas</a>) or stones as substitutes. To these human food and flowers are offered and lights are burned before the shrines. Among the Dravidians a cobra which is accidentally killed is burned like a human being; no one would kill one intentionally. The serpent-god's image is carried in an annual procession by a celibate priestess.</p>
<p>Serpent worship was well known in ancient Europe. There does not appear to be much ground for supposing that <a href="../../../a/e/s/Aesculapius.html" title="Aesculapius">Aesculapius</a> was a serpent-god in spite of his connection with serpents. On the other hand, we learn from <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herodotus.html" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> of the great serpent which defended the citadel of <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athens</a>. The Roman genius loci took the form of a serpent where a snake was kept and fed with milk in the temple of Potrimpos, an old Slavonic god. Dewi was an Old Welsh god represented by a great red serpent. On the Iberian Peninsula there is evidence that before the introduction of Christianity, and perhaps more strongly before invasions of the Romans, Serpent-worship was part of local religion. To this day there are numerous traces in popular belief, especially in Germany, of respect for the snake, which seems to be a survival of ancestor worship, such as still exists among the Zulus and other tribes; the "house-snake," as it is called, cares for the cows and the children, and its appearance is an omen of death, and the life of a pair of house-snakes is often held to be bound up with that of the master and mistress themselves. Tradition says that one of the Gnostic sects known as the Ophites caused a tame serpent to coil round the sacramental bread and worshipped it as the representative of the Saviour. Ouroboros</p>
