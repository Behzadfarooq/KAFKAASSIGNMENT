<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/i/Anita_Blake_7aa6.html" title="Edit section: Character introduction">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Character introduction</span></h2>
<p>Anita Blake is the heroine of a vampire slayer series written by Laurell K. Hamilton. The series takes place in a parallel fantasy world where vampires, shape shifters, werewolves, faeries, etc exist. Her night job, and primary source of income, is the legal profession of re-animating the dead. As an "animator" in a parallel St. Louis, her job entails using magical abilities to bring tempoary life to dead bodies in order to question them for legal purposes. These abilities allow her to control dead bodies and enable her to see souls. Her other profession is a vampire hunter/exicutioner. In her world this profession involves tracking down and killing vampires who have murdered humans. A strong protagonist in the series, Blake is very direct, rude, and yet highly competent in the professions she is involved in. She is trained in various martial arts and weapons, but is most efficient with a gun. She is also a devout christian which often creates moral dilemas for the character. She is currently of the Episcopalian faith, having left Catholisism since the Catholic church have excommunicated all reanimators.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/i/Anita_Blake_7aa6.html" title="Edit section: Explanation of the character's name">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Explanation of the character's name</span></h3>
<p>The principal significance of Anita's name appears to be the Latin first name "Anita" together with the Anglo surname "Blake" represent Anita's mixed Mexican/Anglo heritage. Within the novels, this contrast, which also appears in Anita's mix of black hair and china white skin or in her combination of voudoun and Catholic upbringing, is one of Anita's key formative traumas.</p>
<p>Her middle name is Katerine, of Czech origin, taken from her father's favorite aunt.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/i/Anita_Blake_7aa6.html" title="Edit section: Summary">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Summary</span></h3>
<p>Anita Blake (in the latest book, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danse_Macabre_%28novel%29_d241.html" title="Danse Macabre (novel)"><i>Danse Macabre</i></a>) is a twenty-seven year old resident of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis%2C_Missouri_7f9c.html" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</a>. Born a <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humans_%28Anita_Blake_mythology%29_ca5a.html#Animators" title="Humans (Anita Blake mythology)">necromancer</a> with the power to control zombies as well as power over other forms of undead, Anita leads a complicated life. Her main job is as an animator for "Animators, Inc.," a St. Louis-based business that raises the dead for the right price. Anita is also a licensed vampire executioner (known to vampires as "The Executioner") and a consultant for <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humans_%28Anita_Blake_mythology%29_ca5a.html#RPIT" title="Humans (Anita Blake mythology)">RPIT</a>, the area's police division in charge of preternatural crimes.</p>
<p><a name="Character" id="Character"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/i/Anita_Blake_7aa6.html" title="Edit section: Character">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Character</span></h3>
<p>Anita is classic <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardboiled.html" title="Hardboiled">hardboiled</a>: flippant, stubborn, and tough. Like <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinsey_Millhone_dce9.html" title="Kinsey Millhone">Kinsey Millhone</a> and <a href="../../../v/2E/i/V.I._Warshawski_a556.html" title="V.I. Warshawski">V.I. Warshawski</a>, she has major emotional issues, is frequently the only female in <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machismo.html" title="Machismo">macho</a> situations, and tends to come across as quite prickly and difficult. Like <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spenser_%28fictional_detective%29.html" title="Spenser (fictional detective)">Spenser</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Scudder_da1e.html" title="Matthew Scudder">Matthew Scudder</a>, she plays <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knight_errant.html" title="Knight errant">knight errant</a>, championing vulnerable characters who ask for her help. Anita also shares many flaws with other hardboiled detectives: she lacks tact, loses her temper, and is insubordinate.</p>
<p>In discussing the genesis of the character, Hamilton has said:</p>
<dl>
<dd>I started reading a lot of hardboiled detective fiction — <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_B._Parker_6d75.html" title="Robert B. Parker">Robert B. Parker</a> in particular — and I read a lot of strong female protagonists. But there was one problem, a difference between the male and female protagonists of the different series — even the strongest of the women did not get to do some of the things the men got to do. The men got to cuss, the women rarely; the men got to kill people and not feel bad about it, if the women killed someone they had to feel really, really bad about it afterward and it had to be an extreme situation; the men got to have sex, often and on stage and very casually, but if the women had sex it had to be offstage, very sanitized. I thought this was unfair. <a href="http://books.missouri.org/eviews/october.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.missouri.org/eviews/october.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>The character has been criticized as a mere stand-in or wish fulfillment for the author as the number of men who find Blake attractive has grown, particularly in later books. Like Spenser, Blake bears a close physical resemblance to the series author <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurell_K._Hamilton_799c.html" title="Laurell K. Hamilton">Laurell K. Hamilton</a> and both are also somewhat idealized in terms of strength and fighting skill. Blake has some similar history to Ms. Hamilton — both have a fear of flying and both lost their mothers when they were young.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/i/Anita_Blake_7aa6.html" title="Edit section: Powers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Powers</span></h3>
<p>In almost every book, Anita either discovers new abilities, further develops existing abilities, or both. As of book 14, she is probably one of the most powerful humans in history.</p>
<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../h/u/m/Humans_%28Anita_Blake_mythology%29_ca5a.html#Animators" title="Humans (Anita Blake mythology)">Necromancer</a>: Anita is one of the most powerful animators in the world. She can raise zombies, sense the dead, sense vampires and lycanthropes, estimate their power level, and can resist (at least partially) mental influence from vampires. Particulars that set her apart from other animators:
<ul>
<li>Anita's zombies look lifelike and can fool the untrained eye, including "healing" any sign of decay or injury.</li>
<li>She can raise zombies that are centuries dead, and can do so without human sacrifice.</li>
<li>She is one of the few animators who can act as a "focus" to combine the powers of multiple animators.</li>
<li>She is the first person in centuries that can raise vampires (during daylight) as if they were zombies. After raising a vampire, she can heal any wounds as if it were a zombie.</li>
<li>In book 14 she is able to heal a vampire without raising it first.</li>
<li>Her <a href="../../../n/e/c/Necromancer.html" title="Necromancer">necromancer</a> abilities refer to the ability to control all types of undead, including at times vampires.</li>
<li>Anita is also able to call and control the spirits of dead werewolves (<a href="../../../s/h/a/Shapeshifters_%28Anita_Blake_Mythology%29_135c.html#Munin" title="Shapeshifters (Anita Blake Mythology)">munin</a>). She has particular affinity for the spirit of <a href="../../../v/a/m/Lycanthrope_characters_of_Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter_44ea.html#Raina_Wallis" title="Lycanthrope characters of Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter">Raina</a> and can channel Raina's healing abilities (<a href="../../../b/u/r/Burnt_Offerings_%28novel%29_ed9f.html" title="Burnt Offerings (novel)">Burnt Offerings</a> and later).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Combat training: Anita has taken classes in a variety of martial arts and holds at least one black belt. She works out regularly with her best friend <a href="../../../v/a/m/Human_characters_of_Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter_1dd3.html#Veronica_Sims" title="Human characters of Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter">Ronnie</a> "to be able to out run the bad guys" when she needs to. She is also comfortable with weapons, primarily handguns and knives.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Detective training: Anita has been involved with many investigations with RPIT and, in the later books, with the FBI. Her police contact, <a href="../../../v/a/m/Human_characters_of_Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter_1dd3.html#Rudolph_Storr" title="Human characters of Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter">Rudolph Storr</a>, routinely requires her to engage in independent <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime_scene.html" title="Crime scene">crime scene reconstruction</a> in order to obtain an analysis -- Anita's reconstructions are almost always correct and frequently include insights that the police have missed. Anita thinks like both a cop and a monster, according to some, which is what makes her so insightful.
<ul>
<li>As of <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cerulean_Sins_%28novel%29_bf70.html" title="Cerulean Sins (novel)"><i>Cerulean Sins</i></a>, she has Federal Marshal status which allows her to now enter any preternatural crime scene she so desires, or follow a vampire or other non-human crime suspect across state lines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Supernatural experience: Anita holds a bachelor's degree in preternatural biology and is a trained vampire executioner. She also has a two-semester background in comparative religion. These courses often told her useful tidbits about other cultures/mythologies, and throughout the series she learns vastly more about <a href="../../../v/a/m/Vampires_%28Anita_Blake_mythology%29_eb8c.html" title="Vampires (Anita Blake mythology)">vampires</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shapeshifters_%28Anita_Blake_mythology%29_099e.html" title="Shapeshifters (Anita Blake mythology)">lycanthropes</a>, and <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anita_Blake_mythology_19c2.html" title="Anita Blake mythology">other</a> <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preternatural.html" title="Preternatural">preternatural</a> creatures. <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humans_%28Anita_Blake_mythology%29_ca5a.html#RPIT" title="Humans (Anita Blake mythology)">RPIT</a> relies on her for information about a wide variety of supernatural entities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Human servant: In books 1-3 and 6+, <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Claude_ccfa.html" title="Jean-Claude">Jean-Claude</a> has marked Anita with three of the four marks necessary to make her his <a href="../../../v/a/m/Vampires_%28Anita_Blake_mythology%29_eb8c.html#human_servant" title="Vampires (Anita Blake mythology)">human servant</a>. This grants Anita unusual strength, rapid healing, increased resistance to vampire's abilities, and an almost complete resistance to Jean-Claude's mental influence, as well as a psychic connection to Jean-Claude himself. In books 10+, Anita has given <a href="../../../v/a/m/Undead_characters_of_Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter_525b.html#Damian" title="Undead characters of Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter">Damian</a>, her vampire servant, the fourth mark. This does not interfere with Jean Claude's marks. It is uncertain if this unconventional fourth mark grants Anita immortality.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Triumvirate member: Anita is a member of a "<a href="../../../v/a/m/Vampires_%28Anita_Blake_mythology%29_eb8c.html#triumvirate" title="Vampires (Anita Blake mythology)">triumvirate</a>" with Jean-Claude and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Zeeman_c8da.html" title="Richard Zeeman">Richard Zeeman</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Killing_Dance_%28novel%29_d4ca.html" title="The Killing Dance (novel)"><i>The Killing Dance</i></a>). Because of Anita's own connection with the dead, as well as Jean-Claude's unusual choice of two other members with power levels similar to his own, their triumvirate is the most powerful seen in any of the novels. Some results that developed in the later novels:
<ul>
<li>Anita, Jean-Claude, and Richard are all telepathically and metaphysically linked. They can draw on each other's powers and speak mind-to-mind.</li>
<li>Each is becoming more like the other.</li>
<li>Their powers are boosted when they are together, and more so when touching. In addition, Anita has developed several powers similar to those of vampires and lycanthropes. She also created another triumvirate with Damien and Nathaniel, with herself as the center.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Vampire powers: The combination of her necromancy and her membership in the triumvirate has caused Anita to develop a series of powers formerly seen only in vampires, including the following.
<ul>
<li>Anita has the ability to copy vampire powers that are used against her - sometimes temporarily, sometimes permanently (<a href="../../../n/a/r/Narcissus_in_Chains_%28novel%29_0809.html" title="Narcissus in Chains (novel)"><i>Narcissus in Chains</i></a>).</li>
<li><a href="../../../v/a/m/Vampires_%28Anita_Blake_mythology%29_eb8c.html#Ardeur" title="Vampires (Anita Blake mythology)">Ardeur</a> (<a href="../../../n/a/r/Narcissus_in_Chains_%28novel%29_0809.html" title="Narcissus in Chains (novel)"><i>Narcissus in Chains</i></a>) (spelling varies, depending on the book). Anita developed this power after Jean-Claude fed his ardeur through her. The ardeur has proven in later books to manipulate the personalities of Anita and those around her, as well as to be addictive to some characters (such as <a href="../../../v/a/m/Undead_characters_of_Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter_525b.html#London" title="Undead characters of Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter">London</a>).</li>
<li>Power draining: Anita has copied, apparently permanently, <a href="../../../v/a/m/Other_vampires_of_Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter_fcb4.html#Itzpapalotl" title="Other vampires of Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter">Itzpapalotl's</a> ability to drain the life energy from her victims and, if she chooses, to use that energy to heal another (<a href="../../../o/b/s/Obsidian_Butterfly_%28novel%29_a646.html" title="Obsidian Butterfly (novel)">Obsidian Butterfly</a>).</li>
<li>Psychic blades - the ability to turn a person's aura against them, usually resulting in cuts (<a href="../../../n/a/r/Narcissus_in_Chains_%28novel%29_0809.html" title="Narcissus in Chains (novel)"><i>Narcissus in Chains</i></a>).

<p>Anita was born with the talent to be a <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humans_%28Anita_Blake_mythology%29_ca5a.html#animators" title="Humans (Anita Blake mythology)">necromancer</a>.</p>
<p>Anita's formative experiences appear to be a series of traumas. In particular, Anita has never fully recovered from her mother's dying in a car accident, which occurred when Anita was eight. (In the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Laughing_Corpse_%28novel%29_8c16.html" title="The Laughing Corpse (novel)">The Laughing Corpse</a>, she is upset that no one protects the niece and nephew of John Burke at their father's funeral when their mother is hysterical and throws herself on the coffin.) Her father remarried a few years after and had a son. Anita did not feel she "fit in" with her blond father, stepmother, stepsister and brother Josh. She clashed with her stepmother, Judith, over her "unladylike" interests, independence, and necromancy. Anita's powers manifested during adolescence, causing various dead animals to reanimate and visit Anita's home. Embarrassed, Anita's father asked her maternal grandmother, Grandmother Flores, to teach Anita how to "turn off" her abilities. Flores believed that training a necromancer in <a href="../../../v/o/o/Voodoo.html" title="Voodoo">vaudun</a> ritual would lead to evil and encouraged Anita to remain <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic</a>. Later, when the Pope <a href="../../../e/x/c/Excommunication.html" title="Excommunication">excommunicated</a> all animators, Anita became an <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopal_Church_in_the_United_States_of_America_dc8c.html" title="Episcopal Church in the United States of America">Episcopalian</a>.</p>
<p>Anita majored in preternatural biology in college, earning a bachelor's degree. While in college, her rich fiancee's parents convinced him to break their engagement because Anita's mother was Mexican. Hurt, Anita decided to forego additional sexual experiences until marriage. She also accidentally raised a suicide, who sought her out in her dorm room.</p>
<p>After graduation, Anita was recruited by <a href="../../../v/a/m/Human_characters_of_Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter_1dd3.html#Bert_Vaughn" title="Human characters of Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter">Bert Vaughn</a> to join Animators, Inc. as a professional zombie animator. She was also trained by <a href="../../../v/a/m/Human_characters_of_Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter_1dd3.html#Manny_Rodriguez" title="Human characters of Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter">Manny Rodriguez</a> and became a licenced vampire executioner. At some point, she became associated with Edward (As the series develops Edward becomes more curious as to who is the better killer, but Anita doesn't want to find out, despite Edward's obsession.), and she, Manny, and Edward were involved in at least one dicey confrontation with vampires -- a battle against Valentine and his pack in which Anita received a number of severe scars, including a cross shaped brand on her arm, put there by some of the vampires' human thralls. The series begins some time after that confrontation, shortly after the legalization of vampires.</p>

Anita identifies the murderer, but by that point has sufficiently antagonized Nikolaos and her underlings that she expects to be killed.

<p><i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Killing_Dance_%28novel%29_d4ca.html" title="The Killing Dance (novel)">The Killing Dance</a></i> provides a notable turning point in her relationships with Jean-Claude and Richard. Richard, with his desperate attempts to remain "human", represents the side of Anita that rebels against the "darker" elements of her nature, while Jean-Claude, who has long accepted his demons and draws his powers from death, represents the part of her that accepts them. Ultimately Anita realizes that Richard's desire to remain "nice" and "normal" had placed himself and the others in even more danger, and she runs to Jean-Claude, who is at least able to protect himself from danger.</p>
<p><i>The Killing Dance</i> is also a turning point for the series in several other ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anita has accepted being Jean-Claude's "declared vampire servant" at the beginning of the book.</li>
<li>Anita and Richard form a vampire triumvirate with Jean Claude, accepting the first three "marks". In addition, Jean Claude and Richard announce that they are allies within the supernatural community. Taken together, these changes make it impossible for Anita to completely separate her life from Jean Claude or Richard.</li>
<li>Anita kills the werewolf lupa Raina and the wereleopard leader Gabriel in self-defense, resolving some unsettled conflicts from <i>The Lunatic Cafe</i>.</li>
<li>Richard becomes the Ulfric, or leader, of his pack.</li>
<li>Anita and Jean-Claude become lovers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anita was injured by wereleopard and/or werewolf in animal form, a common means of lycanthrope infection, during the concluding battle. The epilogue reveals that she did not change with the full moon.</p>

Richard affirms that he considers Anita the lupa of his pack, although they do not reconcile romantically.</p>

Anita and Richard reconcile during the book, with Richard offering to accept Anita's continued involvement with Jean Claude as long as Anita accepts that Richard isn't monogamous either.</p>

<ul>
<li>Anita acquires a magical mentor, the Wiccan Marianne. (Marianne is not a lycanthrope but works with the local werewolf pack in Tennessee.)</li>
<li>Marianne and her pack's Ulfric, Vern, begin teaching Anita how to be a better leader of the wereleopards.</li>

<li>We learn Damien is showing signs of being Anita's vampire servant and that Jean Claude gains power from sex.</li>

<p>Anita helps Damian to regain his sanity, assuming her position as Damian's master and rendering him the first "vampire servant" in centuries. She also comes close to reconciling with Richard, but Richard ultimately leaves her after she uses the <i>ardeur</i> to feed on him, declaring that, like Anita herself, he will not allow himself to be used as food. Anita accepts Micah as her lover and Nimir-Raj. Micah, who appears willing to accommodate any desire of Anita's, becomes part of a menage a trois with Jean-Claude, allowing Jean-Claude to feed on him.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cerulean_Sins_%28novel%29_bf70.html" title="Cerulean Sins (novel)">Cerulean Sins</a> Anita assists the police in tracking a lycanthrope serial killer. This is complicated by her close relationships with the "monsters" which puts her at odds with Rudolf Storr, the head of RPIT, who attempts to have Jason committed to a secure lycanthrope facility. Anita manipulates Storr into revealing his prejudice on tape; he ends up on administrative leave, and Jason is released on his own recognizance.</p>
<p>Anita and Jean-Claude outmaneuver Belle-Morte by taking <a href="../../../v/a/m/Asher_%28Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter%29_6af0.html" title="Asher (Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter)">Asher</a> to their bed in a <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menage_a_trois.html" title="Menage a trois">menage a trois</a>, making Asher their lover and therefore immune to most of Belle Morte's advances. More alarmingly, Anita begins to believe that Belle Morte is planning a war against the <a href="../../../v/a/m/The_Vampire_Council_of_Anita_Blake%7E_Vampire_Hunter_1265.html#Marmee_Noir" title="The Vampire Council of Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter">Mother of Darkness</a>, the oldest and most powerful of the world's vampires. Although Anita and Jean Claude do their best to avoid that conflict, the Mother of Darkness is beginning to awaken from a centuries-long sleep, and seems interested in Anita.</p>

<p>In <i><a href="../../../i/n/c/Incubus_Dreams_%28novel%29_b0a4.html" title="Incubus Dreams (novel)">Incubus Dreams</a></i> Anita assists the police in finding a group of vampires that are killing strippers, eventually going into their condo with a SWAT team.</p>
<p>Anita makes considerable progress with her metaphysical problems as she learns that she can partially control the <i>ardeur</i> by drawing power from others' lust and by ensuring that her other desires, such as physical hunger, do not go unfulfilled. However, she accidentally forms another triumvirate with Damien and Nathaniel, this time with her (not Jean-Claude) as the power focus.</p>
<p>Anita's personal life resolves in a number of ways. She accepts Nathaniel as the fourth of her concurrent lovers, and she and Richard also agree to renew their relationship. Although Nathaniel and Micah appear to accept or want Anita as their only lover, Anita reluctantly agrees to accept Richard's decision to date other people, and allows Jean-Claude to begin feeding his lust from others, at least psychically.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/i/Anita_Blake_7aa6.html" title="Edit section: Book 13: Micah">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Book 13: Micah</span></h4>
<p>Her relationship with Micah is focused on specifically in the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micah_%28novel%29.html" title="Micah (novel)">novella of the same name</a>. Anita also continues to wrestle with her recent increase in power, first attempting to deal with the <i>ardeur</i> and second, wrestling with the vast increase in her own powers as a necromancer. Anita is now so powerful that her attempt to raise a single person threatened to raise every corpse in the cemetery.</p>
<p>A blood test reveals that Anita carries four strains of lycanthropy: wolf, leopard, lion, and one unknown strain. However, she is not a lycanthrope despite being a carrier.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/i/Anita_Blake_7aa6.html" title="Edit section: Book 14: Danse Macabre">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Book 14: Danse Macabre</span></h4>
<p><i><a href="../../../d/a/n/Danse_Macabre_%28novel%29_d241.html" title="Danse Macabre (novel)">Danse Macabre</a></i> sees a possible pregnancy threatening to derail her life, even as she prepares to help host several visiting Masters of the City in honor of the finale performance of the vampire ballet troupe Danse Macabre.</p>
<p>The evidence that Anita may become a shape-shifter is growing; whether she will be wolf, lion, leopard, or something else is unknown. She resists changing shape by "giving her beast" to a lycanthrope. Because she can only give "her" lion to a werelion, this brings her into more contact with the local werelion pride.</p>
<p>Jean Claude and Anita determine that the ardeur is "seeking" food: specifically it may have shaped Anita's, Micah's, Nathaniel's, and Damian's personalities to make them more compatible partners for one another. It also encourages the visiting Master of the City of Chicago, who had been exiled by Belle Morte, to maneuver Anita into feeding her ardeur on him.</p>
<p>In her personal life, Anita wrestles with her jealousy of her lovers taking other lovers, particularly in the case of Jean-Claude and Asher. She also accepts that she is a succubus and a vampire, in that she feeds off of others.</p>
