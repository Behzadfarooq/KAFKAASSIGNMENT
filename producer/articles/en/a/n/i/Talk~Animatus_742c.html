	    <p>Animatus Animation Studios was found in 1989 by Fredrick.W.Armstrong. Fred Armstrong who was born December 31st 1951 grew up making Cut-Out Animation Films for Birthday Parties and for extra money. It was his way of earning money at such a young age. Fred was also fascinated by the wonders of Animation all in itself. He also liked filmaking and like most people growing up at the time he would use the Super 8mm Camera to create many short films. After College Fred began a Carrer in Independent Film Making and Independent Animation. In 1975 he began his Carrer as the lead Animator for Commercial Segments for a Local Guitar Retail Store called "The House Of Guitars". He had also funded his own Animated Projects. After making various attempts into Successfull Film Making and Animation. Fred found himself making various short films for Film Festivals for quite awhile.His first attempt at a Feature Film was in 1981 it was called "Fear No Evil" Fred jokes about how bad the film was and says "Fear No Paycheck". In 1980 However Fred Moved to New York City where he got a Job as a Crane Operator and Dolly Grip for Several Independent Films From 1980-1984. He was under the Influence Of Animator Francis Lee who was also an Independent Film Maker and Animator. Francis Lee also gave Fred extra time to Continue his own Independent Film Making And Animated Projects. He also modelded for Several Advertisements during the 1980s.He took a break from Filmaking However from 1985-1988. In 1988 however Kodak was selling an Old Animation Camera they didnt need it anymore Fred found the money to buy the Animation Camera from them. He then bought a Small Office up in Rochester where he had recently moved back to. He then started an Animation Agency called "Animatus" in May of 1989. The company began as an Animation Agency for Fred Armstrong to help with Clients. One of his first Projects was making Stop-Motion Animated Commercials for "The House Of Guitars" from the Late 1980's and Early 1990's. Fred began holding Student classes in 1992. For what Animatus is now famous for is Teaching Young Kids how to do Animation. His future Partner Dave Puls first Met Fred back in 1992. Dave who was one of Rochesters Prestigous Musicians for over 25 years. Had met Fred while taking an Animation Course in 1992. Fred and Dave soon Collaberated to do Various Animated projects. Dave Puls soon Created a Succsesfull Fim Festival Cartoon Series called "Fresh Toons" which began back in 1994. That same year Fred enjoyed much Succsess with his Documentary "End Of Line Rochesters Subway" which aired on the History Channel 3 times. And on WXXI 4 times. Mike Boas who is an Independent Filmaker also joined the Company in 1997. In 1997 also Fred came up with the Mascot for Animatus "Derf The Viking" who Starred In 5 Animated Shorts. Production for Derf ceased however after funding for the films werent receving any Revenue. Although it was also becuase that in 2004 Fred Funded a Mini-Series called "The Adeventures Of Su and Mo" that series has also ended. Currentley the Studio has the Kids make most of the Creative Films. However Dave Puls recently recieved Succsess for his films "Hate Preachers" and "When George Goes Marchin Home". Fresh Toons still continues to be funded. Meanwhile Fred still Continues Funded for other Projects Including another Film hes working on based on T.M. Wrights Novel "Strange Seed".
