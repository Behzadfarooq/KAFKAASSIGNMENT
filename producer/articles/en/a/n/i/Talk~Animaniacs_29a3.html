<dd>I was just looking over the article and considering something along the same lines. I think that there should be a section describing common segments, such as "Mime Time", "Wheel of Morality", as well as shorter gags, like the escape-from/return-to-water-tower "bumps", the changing last line of the theme song and the hidden jokes in the credits. -<a href="../../../d/y/n/User%7EDynSkeet_3c0b.html" title="User:DynSkeet">DynSkeet</a> <a href="../../../d/y/n/User_talk%7EDynSkeet_b41f.html" title="User talk:DynSkeet">(talk)</a> 12:29, May 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please answer this before inserting material. Also, if not does merit inclusion, then all it merits is probably a brief reference (maybe one short sentence). It's not significant enough relative to the show to include a whole list of songs. If there's been a CD or something released, say so (and that's probably all that needs to be said).

<p>Hmmm... I've never seen the cartoons, but I'm a bit doubtful that the characters are <i>indeterminate children</i>. The ears and noses in the logo look distinctly <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog.html" title="Dog">dog</a>-like.

<dd>They are most definately children (not necessarily human ones, obviously, but certainly the young of some species). And 'indeterminite' as good a word as any. There was, in fact, an entire song in which Dr. Scratchnsniff tried to learn what species they are. The song finally ends with the Warners claiming they're not any particular species, but simply "What we are, dear doctor, is cute!" <a href="../../../m/r/i/User%7EMrItty_7d5f.html" title="User:MrItty">MrItty</a> 18:06, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<dd>The trio are indeterminate because they are inkblot characters. They are derived from a process like <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulletism.html" title="Bulletism">bulletism</a>, but are refined to meet production or creative standards. Cartoonists have been doing this for quite a while because it adds greatly to the fantastic facet of cartooning.</dd>

<p>The article claims that the Hip Hippos and Pinky and the Brain had their own "full" theme songs. What qualifies as a full theme song? I seem to recall that almost every segment had a theme of some sort:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>She's Katie Kaboom, Katie Kaboom, lives in a house with a garden in bloom. Her family knows that any time soon, their little lady Katie, goes Kaboom!</i></li>
<li><i>Chicken Boo, what's the matter with you? You don't act like the other chickens do. You wear a disguise to look like human guys, but you're not a man, you're a chicken, Boo.</i></li>
<li><i>The crankiest of creatures in the whole-wide world, our next cartoon features Slappy the Squirrel!</i></li>
<li><i>Like Abbott and Costello, Like Sonny and Cher, Like Martin and Lewis, They're a perfect pair. Like Laurel and Hardy, Like Fontanne and Lunt, They're perfectly mismatched, They're Rita and Runt!</i></li>

<p>On the subject of theme songs, I have just made some edits to the presented lyrics of the Animaniacs main theme. If there is any dispute as to whether the changes I've made are correct, please note that I am using as reference the printed lyrics from the liner notes of the first <i>Animaniacs</i> album, which opens and closes with the theme song. -- -- <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPennyforth_3bbe.html" title="User:Pennyforth">Pennyforth</a> 21:24, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I restored the text concerning the altered lyrics for the theme song that accompanied the theme lyrics. On the same subject, wasn't there a third version of the line that started as "While Bill Clinton plays the sax" and then became "We pay tons of income tax"? I can't remember what the lyric was, but I believe it was set to a clip of the Warners dancing on a table from the episode "The Taming of the Screwy". If anyone remembers this lyric, please add it to the article. -- <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPennyforth_3bbe.html" title="User:Pennyforth">Pennyforth</a> 20:10, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because <i>Tiny Toon Adventures</i> was the precursor to <i>Animaniacs</i>; without the one, there never would have been the other. The introduction notes that after <i>Tiny Toons,</i> the animators used their experience to create brand-new characters instead of just "kiddie" versions of the classic Warner Bros. cartoon stars. --<a href="../../../m/o/d/User%7EModemac_38eb.html" title="User:Modemac">Modemac</a> 12:34, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I get your point.. but i think it's too much.. can't we just say "Animaniacs was the second animated series produced by the collaboration of Steven Spielberg and Warner Bros. Animation during the animation renaissance of the 1990s. The modern Warner Bros. writers and animators used the experience gained from its first series, Tiny Toon Adventures, to create brand new animated characters that were cast in the mold of Tex Avery's creations." and put all that information on the Tiny Toons article? Also, "but were not slavish imitations" is this comment necessary?. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighwind_8425.html" title="User:Highwind">Highwind</a> 14:05, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've seen an Animaniacs feature-length musical on the cartoon network, a couple of times, title something like "Yakko's Wish". It had story arcs for most of the characters from the show built in.

<p>This is commonly misprinted as "Please Please Pleese", based on a title in the cartoon. This is incorrect. The official title, as recorded in WB TV Animation production materials, is "Please Please Please". I'm reluctant to change it without discussing it here, since it's probably been the subject of a prior edit war.

<dd>Where are the materials that it is in? If you can provide a copy or link, that pretty much destroys any argument against it. That said, I'm updating the copy until someone provides evidence that it should be spelled "Pleese". <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> 18:12, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The primary evidence in favor of "pleese" comes from the cartoon itself, which intentionally misspells the title. At the very end, in fact, the fat Animaniacs fanboy (which is why we like this episode! Narf!) pops up and points it out, saying, "Notice how they misspelled this with two E's? I think that was INTENTIONAL!"&#160;:) --<a href="../../../m/o/d/User%7EModemac_38eb.html" title="User:Modemac">Modemac</a> 18:15, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's a very intentionally layered joke. There's also an error in the material it quotes from the alt.tv.animaniacs FAQ (actually, the Cultural Reference Guide to Animaniacs), and when I pointed it out to Hastings (I was at the gathering at WB TV Animation in 1995), Hastings all but said that was intentional. I'll dig up the source materials to settle it once and for all. <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmaynard_f6d3.html" title="User:Jmaynard">Jay Maynard</a> 18:26, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jay, if you're going to jealously guard it that way, and knowing you, you are, at least change the misleading comment. I took the comment to mean "Keep it saying 'Pleese'" and inferred that someone had edited it anyway. If you replace it with a "There is discussion on the Talk page," that'll help prevent things like this from happening.--<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarksasami_31e7.html" title="User:Darksasami">Darksasami</a> 17:41, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello there. There are just too many external links in the article. If some are being used as references, please create a <i>References</i> section and move the references there. This will be both useful as to easily catch spam, and to know which links were used to build the article.

<p>I've been hoping to see some in depth looks at the disney references on this page...is there a reason none of them are on here? Or did I miss them somewhere. Some of them are quite entertaining, direct (and numerous!) references to disney cartoon shows and movies.

<dd>Yes - the number of eps in the latter seasons are widely varied (due to the transition from Fox to WB networks). Thus, instead of doing season sets, they are doing 25 eps a box, and effectively ignoring the season 'boundaries'. -<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasem_8b9e.html" title="User:Masem">Masem</a> 00:09, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>That episode list isn't really anything new for wikipedia (plenty of the external links have that information), but since other TV shows have such lists, I recommend that if that list is to be kept, it be moved to "List of Animaniacs Episodes" to be consistent with other TV shows.</p>
<p>Also, I don't think every episode should be wikilinked. the TV show WikiProject says that only notable episodes should get a wikipage of themselves, and given that we have the various episode guides already in the external links, it would be prudent to not imply a wikipage to prevent kruft. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasem_8b9e.html" title="User:Masem">Masem</a> 17:16, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
