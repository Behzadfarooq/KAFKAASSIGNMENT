<dd>Ummm, I guess you didn't like the kangaroo photo. Fair enough. I'm not sure why you're dragging up the past (see above), especially since I removed that stuff myself after being asked to, but for a guy in your position, you have a good memory. If you think that what I had placed on my userpage was harmful, then you wouldn't want people to see it. And I'm not sure why someone on your talkpage said that the photo involved animal grabbing...there was no animal grabbing! To me, the photo resembles the hierarchy on Wiki, just like the one of the French revolution, where the working class feed the elite. Anyway, one thing I don't understand is why you had to blank my contributions on my userpage. One thing is to be blocked, but to hide history is not fair play. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Candide, or Optimism</a> 04:13, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Same, I would really like to know why Anittas got blocked. I'm the first one to say that he has acted inappropriately in the past, but in the past months he hasn't done anything inappropriate. Maybe I'm overlooking something. But something that warrants an <i>indefinite</i> block? Dismiss me as "mad hatter liberal", but he didn't upload the kangaroo photo to Wikipedia, and he was really only stating a free opinion. Things like that shouldn't be punished in this way. At least, there should've been more dialogue and warning, particularly considering that Anittas has made some useful contributions. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 13:28, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This recent ban emphasizes some troubling trends that have developed since the inception of Wikipedia. Jim Wales established Wikipedia thus acquiring the legal and moral leadership of the project. Other users in their respect for the creator of the encyclopedia have regularly acquisced to his views, even when they have gone against more popular theories, developed through a democratic process. Nevertheless, the fact that Wales continues to rule the encyclopedia in an autocratic way, making some decisions on a whim without consulting the existing administrative structures that have been established and defying official policies will force every user to analyze what Wikipedia and the ideals behind it mean for them. The recent blocking of Anittas is only one, albeit a shockingly disturbing event, in the recent past. Although Anittas did engage in an inappropriate conflict with Node, especially in the past, the insults where by no means unilateral, and usually could be defined as harmless banter. Considering Anittas's long history of performing productive work on Wikipedia, it is unfathomable that he could have been blocked for an indefinite period for a matter as trivial as this incident virtually with no immediate prior warning. And if the main force of Wales's fury stemms from Anittas's excercising of free speech and criticizing Wales, then the situation is only that much more ominous. <a href="../../../t/s/o/User%7ETSO1D_9399.html" title="User:TSO1D">Vox Populi (TSO)</a> 15:10, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</blockquote>
<p>At the same time, Wales is impressed by Anne Coulter, the woman who called Arabs for ""ragheads, camel jockeys, and jihad monkeys." I guess those attacks are okay. Wales, you own the servers, but you don't 0wn our will; nor our mind. The only way you can block me is by killing me. But then someone else will take my place. I know your kind.

<dd>This should at least be taken to arbitration. Is there any way that can happen. The reason I'm asking is because the Xed case went through arbitration (it's a case I was also involved in, since Xed asked for my help). Jimmy - don't think that we're being disruptive here or trying to purposely nag you just for fun or for trolling purposes. I, for one, am making a good-faith attempt to find out why Anittas' actions really warranted such an indefinite block, which I believe that in this case in unwarranted. As I have said before, Wikipedia works best when there is a sense of justice in the project, and that is what I am interested in. I think dialogue in this case would be good (as in all cases).

<dd>I'm more or less with Ronline here. I've had major run-ins with Anittas, even started an RFC on him once and was not entirely satisfied with the result, but I've also collaborated with him on articles. An indefinite block seems excessive to me, although some arbitration would be in order. And why on earth is this talk page protected? Not only administrators should be able to comment on what is doubtless going to be a controversial action? (And when I say "controversial", I mean exactly that: some will agree, others will disagree.) - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 18:07, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm one of those who disagrees with you and support's Jimbo's block of Anittas. He's been a constant source of personal attacks, strife and disruption who's had many, many chances to reform; his ultimate banning is not surprising in the least. In fact, it was all too predictable. Considering Anittas consistently has not played well with others, making many enemies along the way, the only controversy over this be a contrived one. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 18:39, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As much as anything, my issue is about process. Personal attacks? Yes, my biggest problem with him. Strife? Always hard to say. Disruption? I'm really not so sure. Neither Ronline nor I have particularly gotten along well with him, and as I remark above I even started an RFC against him, backing off mainly because Xed and others chose to use the occasion to attack <i>me</i>. But my immediate questions are about process:
<ol>
<li>Why is this talk page protected (an unusual measure, as far as I know). There ought to be a place to discuss this matter, and I can't see why that should be confined to administrators.</li>
<li>Anittas has sometimes been a problem, other times a good contributor, sometimes both within a single edit. Within the last month, I've had occasion both to collaborate with him on articles and to email him suggesting that he "play nicer" with others. But his conduct the last few months had certainly improved from earlier. It seems really weird that we couldn't get so much as a consensus to <i>censure</i> him half a year ago when his conduct was really egregious, and now, when it is somewhat improved, an indefinite block is imposed from on high. As far as I can tell, Anittas has been willing to work through the arbitration process. Don't we usually let that run its course? I would have presumed that Jimbo's intervention without due process would be invoked where the usually system seems broken, not where people are engaged with it. Or am I missing something on this front?</li>
</ol>

<dd>If there is a better place to have this discussion, preferably on a page that non-admins can edit, could someone please tell me where?

<dd>Anittas made uncouth remarks at people. He pressed people's buttons. He made an anti-semitic comment about someone being a "Jewwwwwwwwwwwwww". And then he decided to insult Jimmy in the face! How would you expect Jim to react, all sugar and spice? That being said, this b7 probably should've been a matter for ArbCom. OTOH, I fail to see why Jimbo doesn't invoke his power to ban <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilly_on_Wheels_8114.html" title="User:Willy on Wheels">User:Willy on Wheels</a>, a known, very infamous, and notorious vandal.

<dd>Anittas, I don't know the formal process, but I'd suggest that there are two separate issues here: the <i>block</i> (technical prevention from editing pages) and the <i>ban</i> (that Jimbo has effectively decided that you are unwelcome). I'd suggest that you contact Ronline, since he is on the mediation committee, has, like me, expressed the view that this is excessive, and would presumably know how to proceed, or whom to ask. I would also suggest that, if those involved are amenable, that you acknowledge the ban and agree for now not to edit on matters than your own case; ask for a forum in which to discuss the ban; and ask that the technical <i>block</i> be removed so that you can access that forum. (You can keep emailing me when you want to pass along substantive comments to other contributors who choose not to receive email; as you know, I will pass these along as best I can). - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 02:28, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I had a collision with Annitas in my very early days of editing. He came pretty hard on me, but after a couple of exchanges we cooperated prety much normally. So I would say he is not fundamentally evil. However IMO whatever appeal rules are, the first and foremost precondition of even a consideration of the appeal is an apology. An insult is an insult is an insult.

<p>Make note of the fact that the text of the article already covered the fact that Roman reached the Black Sea. I cannot find <i>proof</i> of any border on the Dnestr north of that until Alexandru cel Bun (not to say that it wasn't, not to say that it was).</p>
<p>I still can read several different things into the reference about Podolia. As such, the text may indicate direction (as in "passing through... to get to...") and is rather obscure on its own.</p>
<p>I'll nuance the reference to indicate Polish vassalge rather than assistance for Stephen.</p>
<p>I remember your sentence about Olaha, <i>and</i> my reason for deleting it: it is speculation (as founded as speculation may get, but still speculation), and it contradicts the very source it borrows from (I am amazed that Romanian comments tend to believe every questionable reference to some guy's disputed lineage - as long as it is explicit - but then deny merit when the source indicates an unconfortoble one).</p>

Secondly, even if not all sources are contemporary to the exact year in question, they are contemporary to the historical age.

<dd>However, the epithet "contemporary" is simply misleading. Leaving aside that excerpt from Procopius, all the others are dated between 9th and 14th century.

<dd>I understand very well. A 14th century written document is by no means contemporary with the events of the 1st millenium when the alleged ethnogenesis happened.

<dd>No, the article doesn't address only the first millenium. The article is to cover the rise of the Romanians until their foundation of the two states.

<dd>There are mentions of Vlachs (both south and north of Danube) before the foundation of the two medieval states of Wallachia and Moldavia. The article covers the time period since the abandon of Dacia (3rd century) and the arguments end around 10-11th century (which is also a time where the chronicles already attest Vlachs north of Danube) while a large part of the arguments addresses the possible links between proto-Romanians and Dacians and Roman colonists adding a supplementary load on the first half of this interval. Moreover, the formation of Romanian language, the Christianisation and other cultural coordinates defining the ethnogenesis of Romanians are dated also in the same first millenium. Most of the scholar opinions - be them "continuist" or "migrational" - converge claiming the ethnic identity of Romanians was well defined at the end of this millenium. Hence, except for some anachronic testimonies (most being added by you) the article does address only the first millenium. You have absolutely no arguments for your erroneous position. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 14:18, 20 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't understand your argument. The article is about the origin of the Romanians. That also covers the controversary of the theory on the Daco-Romanian continuity. That is where my sources come in. If you look at the article, before I added those sources, there was a section that dealt with that theory, with arguments for and against it. I added my sources in that section, in support of the argument for the continuity. That's how the article was constructed, with a section that argued on the theory. How are they being anachronic? Some of the people that are against the theory of the Daco-Romanian continuity say that Romanians migrated north of Danube as late as 11th century. Those sources were added there to show that if the Romanians indeed have migrated north of Danube, it must have been earlier than that. The article does not address only the first millenium. It never has. Check the history. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Origin_of_Romanians&amp;oldid=1741901" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Origin_of_Romanians&amp;oldid=1741901" rel="nofollow">See here</a>, for instance. The headline "Migrations from the south" addresses the Daco-Romanian theory and a couple of months later, in 2004, the section grew to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Origin_of_Romanians&amp;oldid=2491346#Migration_from_South" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Origin_of_Romanians&amp;oldid=2491346#Migration_from_South" rel="nofollow">this</a>. I added my sources later, in 2006, and they are all in context of that section. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Candide, or Optimism</a> 15:49, 20 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Even the old version of the article focuses on the first millenium. The first version covers the Romanization or the assimilation of the Dacians, the "Migration from the south" paragraph invoking some linguistic arguments (which they are all included in this period). The second version keeps the same trend (linguistic arguments), the only argument which specifically is outside this interval (though not by much) is an alleged (I say alleged, because there's no 11th century Hungarian chronicle!) 11th century Magyar chronicle, which even would be a factual information, still would be anachronic, as the article fails to point out how that source is relevant or trustworthy regarding the events happening at least a century before. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 11:09, 24 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The title of the article is "Origin of Romanians," not "Origin of Romanians in the First Millenium. There is nothing that says that we only have to cover the first millenium. The origin should explain where we come from. Since there are not many sources that cover our origin from the first millenium, except one source that I had included, I added other sources from the second millenium. There is nothing anachronistic about any of the sources included, because they all try to explain our origin before the creation of our state, which is exactly what the article is here for. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Candide, or Optimism</a> 17:58, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're losing the point. The 'Origin of Romanians', both scholarly and as content of the Wikipedia article are placed within the first millenium. Therefore the word contemporary is simply misfitted for 13-14th century sources. You also have no clue what "anachronic" means. However, given your stubborness, nationalistic drive and the fact you have already a ban, I suspect there's little value in debating further with you. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 18:03, 24 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, scholarly, it is not placed in the first millenium. Just because you say so doesn't make it so, and this has nothing to do with nationalism, being banned, or any of the other things you mentioned. Whatever book you will read, if the subject is on the Origin of Romanians, the sources that will be provided will mostly cover the second millenium. That's logical, since there are very few sources that mention Vlachs north of Danube before the first millenium. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Candide, or Optimism</a> 18:44, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Please do not blank this page</span></h2>
<p><b>I ask other administrators: please do not blank this page.</b> I continue to be in touch with Anittas. As far as I can tell, he is being very conscientious about not editing Wikipedia in any illicit manner to evade his block. Intermittently, he has emailed me with (quite constructive) comments on various articles, which I have usually placed on the relevant talk page, the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Wikipedia%7ERomanian_Wikipedians%27_notice_board_18e9.html" title="Wikipedia:Romanian Wikipedians' notice board">Romanian Wikipedians' notice board</a>, etc.</p>
<p>There was never a problem with Anittas intellectual honesty or his basic ability to add useful material. The issue was entirely about his tendency to insult other editors and to do some rather trollish pranks around matters of sexuality. He seems to be accepting that when he wants to contribute, I get to filter it, and he's usually been willing to take it under advisement when I suggest that a particular point of his is not worth pursuing. I think this amounts to an effective <i>modus operandi</i> for him to continue to contribute usefully to Wikipedia without being at all disruptive.</p>
<p>Note that I am one of the people who ended up sponsoring an RFC about Anittas some time back. Even before Jimbo saw fit to ban Anittas, I had been in correspondence with him, urging him on the one hand to continue making useful contributions and on the other to stop insulting other contributors. He doesn't currently seem to be willing to promise to do that if unbanned, so I don't see any way to advocate for unbanning him at this time, but as long as I am effectively functioning as a filter, I certainly won't be passing through insults and pranks. It is useful to have a talk page here as a means for other contributors to communicate with him.

<dd>Thanks to User:Margana for creating the article.

<p>I just spotted this now. Folks: Anittas is banned from editing, but not from communicating with editors, and quite a few of us (including myself, and I'm an admin) are in touch with him. He continues to have many worthwhile ideas, and I, for one, encourage people to intermediate for him. I wish he would apologize for intemperate comments (some of them <i>ad hominem</i>) that he's made in the past, and promise to refrain from doing so in the future, but apparently he won't, so he's going to remain banned from editing. Unlike a lot of other people who've been banned from editing, he appears not to be getting around it in illicit ways (like editing anonymously). There is certainly no rule against people being in touch with Anittas or making use of his good ideas. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 23:58, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see that Khoikkhoik changed the spelling of the name and moved it to another article. Look, we don't know how the guy spells his name, okay? Maybe the Turkish version of the name is like Khoikhoioi wrote it, but that's irrelevant. We should use the version that is on his ID card and that Turkish version of the name is not the one he is using. The guy is living in Sweden and is most likely a Swedish citizen; thus, we should use the version that we know of: and that is Sirac Dilber. If we go to the the Swedish Society of Gen terepy, <a href="http://www.ssgt.org/board.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ssgt.org/board.html" rel="nofollow">it says the same</a>. The article should be moved back. Also, in my opinion, users who are chicken and fear of upsetting the clique by posting articles that comes from banned users, should not try to improve that same article by doing stuff to it. My 2 cents. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Candide, or Optimism</a> 00:31, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sources for Battle of Vaslui</span></h2>
<p>Lysandros added the CN tag in two areas of the article, requesting for the claims to be sourced. The request in question is sourced in source number 44 and 46. I added the sources for the whole fragment. If I were to source every number and date, we would have too many sources of the same page from the same book, but if you guys want, you can use that same source where the citation request was added. Also, I don't think one should put a question mark in the box for military strength. In the box it said "Up to 120,000." When it was changed, it looked like "Up to 120,000?" You don't need to add the question mark to point out the uncertainty in the numbers. In fact, it's a bit misleading, because it looks as if the reader is asked whether the numbers were really up to 120,000. Well, according to some sources, they were.</p>
<p>The second part of the conflict took place in 1476 at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Valea_Alb%C4%83_1ee3.html" title="Battle of Valea Albă">Battle of Valea Albă</a>. The article in unfortunatelly a stub and I was planning to extend it to look like the Vaslui article, but some <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kangaroo.html" title="Kangaroo">people</a> put a stop to that. That conflict is a lot more complicated, since Corvinus, Dracula, the Tatars and Laiota were actively involved in it, while the Poles were on a stand-by. If someone feels like it, they could paste the article here and I could work on it on my talkpage.</p>
<p>I tried to email Lysandros, but his Wiki email is not activated. If someone could direct him here, I would be pleased. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Candide, or Optimism</a> 12:23, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Generally speaking, Wallachia may be deemed a cold country; and this, together with a damp quality in the soil, and the existence of many marshy places, produces a marked effect on the animal and vegetable production of the district. The vegetables are said to be of inferior flavour; the flowers deficient in the perfume; the domestic animals remarkable for mildness; the bears, wolves foxes, and other wild animals, much more timid than in other countries; and lastly, man himself, dull and heavy, with weak passions, no strength of mind, and an utter aversion to a life of industry.</p>

<p>"With the notable exception of Transnistria, the territory of today's Republic of Moldova belonged to the historical region of Bessarabia, a territory that belonged, from the 14th century and until 1812 to the Vlachian (proto-Romanian) Principality of Moldavia."</p>

<p>I don't know who wrote that stuff, but the Moldavians were not proto-Romanians. I believe that the line that defines proto-Romanians from Daco-Romanians goes to the 8th century. Before 8th century, there were proto-Romanians. After 8th century, several Romanian groups developed, including the so-called Daco-Romanian group. There are no proof of Vlach settlement before 8th century, therefore, one cannot say that proto-Romanians inhabited the Moldavian land. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Candide, or Optimism</a> 18:02, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't think he held that title. I believe his title was Dragos of Cuhea. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Candide, or Optimism</a> 18:08, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The conflict between Stephen and Ottoman Sultan <a href="../../../m/e/h/Mehmed_II_5655.html" title="Mehmed II">Mehmed II</a> started when both laid claim to the historical region of <a href="../../../b/u/d/Budjak.html" title="Budjak">Bessarabia</a>. The region belonged at first to Wallachia, but would later succumb to Moldavian influence under <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petru_I_of_Moldavia_b23d.html" title="Petru I of Moldavia">Petru I of Moldavia</a> and was possibly annexed to Moldavia in the late 14th century by <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_I_of_Moldavia_1904.html" title="Roman I of Moldavia">Roman I of Moldavia</a>.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Under <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandru_cel_Bun_2bbf.html" title="Alexandru cel Bun">Alexandru cel Bun</a>, the region would become an integral part of Moldavia and was successfully defended in <a href="../../../1/4/2/1420.html" title="1420">1420</a> against the first Ottoman attempt to capture castle <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chilia.html" title="Chilia">Chilia</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> After the assasination of <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bogdan_II_of_Moldavia_31bf.html" title="Bogdan II of Moldavia">Bogdan II of Moldavia</a> in <a href="../../../1/4/5/1451.html" title="1451">1451</a>, Moldavia fell into civil war and the region was retaken by Wallachia. The civil war ended with the coronation of Stephen in <a href="../../../1/4/5/1457.html" title="1457">1457</a> and on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_22.html" title="June 22">June 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/4/6/1462.html" title="1462">1462</a>, Stephen made an attempt to retake the castle of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chilia.html" title="Chilia">Chilia</a> from the shared <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungarian</a>-<a href="../../../w/a/l/Wallachia.html" title="Wallachia">Wallachian</a> rulership (see the <a href="../../../n/i/g/Night_Attack_9f94.html" title="Night Attack">Night Attack</a>).

<dd>Thank you, Bogdan, for adding my update to the Vaslui article and for creating the stub on Bogdan II. The new additions could use some improvement, but for now, it looks okay. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Candide, or Optimism</a> 20:48, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, Battle of Vaslui is listed as the first event for January 10, which also appears on the main page. I think it's nice that the article got a little bit of attention. Some contributors have already improved the article to a better standard, since it appeared on the main page.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">hometown links are blocked?</span></h2>
<p>Who came with the bright idea of blocking links to hometown? A link that was included by me in the Night Attack article has been blocked by a bot, and later removed by some user, because it was deemed as spam. The article is not spam! I cannot post the link here, because if I do, the whole message will be blocked, but you can click on the link in this version of the article, under the title <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Night_Attack&amp;oldid=49402037#External_link" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Night_Attack&amp;oldid=49402037#External_link" rel="nofollow">External Link</a>. The article describes the conflict and has a strategy framing on the battle. It also helped inspire me in writing the article, as it did with Battle of Vaslui. Why, oh why, would someone want to block all links leading to that host? Yes, I'm aware that they offer a free service which many annoying n00bs tend to use in order to annoy housewives and people who who love authority on the net (you know who you are), but still! --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Candide, or Optimism</a> 23:18, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
