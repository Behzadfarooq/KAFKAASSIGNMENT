<p>User:Elego created <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distributed_Concurrent_Versions_System_92ee.html" title="Distributed Concurrent Versions System">Distributed Concurrent Versions System</a>; I redirected to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concurrent_Versions_System_cdf4.html" title="Concurrent Versions System">Concurrent Versions System</a> because it seems to me (as an outsider) that DCVS is essentially VCS with a small if significant feature extension. I left comments <a href="../../../d/i/s/Talk%7EDistributed_Concurrent_Versions_System_5882.html" title="Talk:Distributed Concurrent Versions System">on the talk page</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/e/User_talk%7EElego_b078.html" title="User talk:Elego">on the user talk page</a> explaining it. Elego (which is, purely by coincidence, the name of the ocmpany which markets DCVS) reverted that redirect with no discussion at all. Before I get into an edit war, I'd like someone else to look in and see if this genuinely merits an additional article. I think not, since the functionality is substantially identical and DCVS is based on CVS, but others might have other ideas.</p>

<p>I don't understand why DCVS must redirect to CVS, so I've hopped in and made a comment. (Not acting as a mediator here). <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 17:21, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Because as far as I can see DCVS is a product which is based on CVS, and I am uneasy about the fact that it was created by a user whose username is the same as the company selling DCVS, and the article links to DCVS, and the fact that 90%+ of the functionality is already covered in CVS. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 21:18, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dt><i>What's going on?</i></dt>
<dd>An edit war. He and I disagree about edits that he insists on including. His original inclusion had some edits that I agreed with and others that I did not; I kept the ones I agreed with and the ones I didn’t I removed. He put them back in and although we exchanged a few messages to outline our points, he stopped the discussion when I moved the discussion to the <a href="../../../n/o/n/Talk%7ENon-native_pronunciations_of_English_cc0d.html#French" title="Talk:Non-native pronunciations of English">talk page</a> and continued placing his edits in even though I have reverted them and asked him to build a consensus before including his changes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>What would you like to change about that?</i></dt>
<dd>I have asked him to either build a consensus, provide some sort of adequate source for his edits (he says he is his own source but knows of many sources), or refrain from including the edits that I have been reverting. This is only on the factual statements that he includes. There is also an issue of the way his edits describe the features that I believe unnecessarily describes accent features as absolutes rather than tendencies and I would rather his edits conform in style to the rest of the article.</dd>

<dt><i>What's going on?</i></dt>
</dl>
<p>I was trying to make order in the Italian American page and I found that some Italian American personalities' heritage isn't reported and explained (example Robert De Niro, Quentin Tarantino, Madonna, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci, Brittany Murphy, ecc). I don't know why Arniep replaced always the American wording instead of Italian American which is widely considered correct in official biograhies and by almost everybody. That'd help me to link actors and so on to the Italian American wikipedia page. I think would be more correct to write on the header the real heritage of that personality to make information clearer and more complete. I try to explain to Arniep that nationality is implied in the birth place which is reported in the header near birth date. An Italian American actor or whatever should be reported as an Italian American not only American. That doesn't mean he/she's less American. Italian American means half Italian and half American, so a plus. I'm asking to use ethnography and biography rules. Not reporting it Italian American page wouldn't exist.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<dt><i>What's going on?</i></dt>
<dd>...We have this Article discussing a character from the show <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Grown_Up_199f.html" title="All Grown Up">All Grown Up</a>. I started this article and my friend <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENew_Era_Outlaw_7f05.html" title="User:New Era Outlaw">New Era Outlaw</a> helped. Anyway, not long after we changed things around (due to the old way was threatened to be removed) someone came by and edited out everything about Kimi as she is in All Grown Up. I fixed everyting and things went on smoothly. We contributed things as less bias as we can (we post detailed observations we make of the character that obviously can be counted as traits) but one day Tamao came on and altered stuff that bashed Kimi badly. Called her bi-polar, etc. Well we were appalled and edited that stuff out because it was lying and not at all true and THEY were biased accusations. Sometimes someone would add something at did appear biased and we did what we could to alter it enough that it wasn't, so as not to end up in the predicament we are now. Tamao comes around and, everytime, alters the spacing which throws off the text's location with pictures we have in it so of course we add them back in to keep balance. Now he's claiming the article is biased and should be deleted. He says we should let people post bashings and keep them there. Basically he claims we should let it fall apart. Also he says we should not include the couples section where all we are doing is including what is known about this character and are including the possible couplings she's been known to be in accross the internet that's non-crossover. We also include indications as to how this is a possibility and likely hoods but we try to keep it as biased as possible. In fact most of the stuff we do on this article is keep it biased as possible. Tamao also complains the observations and traits we point out are opinionated, and I'll admit a few are but most we take as what is said/shown. If it is show Kimi writing with both hands, we says should could do that or it could be an animation error. If she's wearing a skaters outfit and is said to be a good ice skater we guess she can rollar blade too. Speculation yes but again we add stuff like "It is possible" and stuff, leaving it open to opinions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>What would you like to change about that?</i></dt>
<dd>...Nothing, if needed I'm open to some changes but I'd like things to mostly stay the same. The contraversies section I'll admit is more opinionated for Kimi fans and is possible to be removed. Tamao points out that our inclusion of Sister,Brother, a Rumored episode, should not be included and I agree with that and am already getting rid of it.</dd>

<p>I will add my comments here. As Staredcraft has said before, he and I are regular contributors to this particular article. That is not to say, however, that we are the ONLY contributors towards this article. If you take a look at the history of <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kimi_Finster_0ea4.html" title="Kimi Finster">Kimi Finster</a>, you will see that several others (only one is identified by name, "Angie Y.") have also put forward towards the construction of this article.</p>
<p>Tamao then comes on, and writes several obviously biased statements on the character, accusing her of being Bi-Polar, "weak", "selfish", "easily manipulated by others", when it is clearly not true and very biased assumptions to make about a character in any Wikipedia entry, unless it is establshed as fact (for example, Gargamel in the Smurfs is clearly an evil character for the fact that he shows evil traits in the show.) Tamao has provided no evidence to support the stated claims, so I have deleted those entries from the Wiki.</p>
<p>Then, Tamao returns, and deletes two of the links, without giving any explanation as to why it was done in the first place. I have since returned the links.</p>
<p>If you visit the article, you will see that information is quoted in parathesis to serve as proof of what is being claimed in the article, be it the episode it was aired, or quotes from the show itself. On the discussion page, I have cited all of my sources of information, which should more than suffice for evidence of what I, at least, have contributed towards this entry.</p>
<p>On top of that, nobody else has complained on the issue, despite the fact that several pages of this kind exist on the Wiki, in the SAME format:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Pickles_d482.html" title="Tommy Pickles">Tommy Pickles</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuckie_Finster_437e.html" title="Chuckie Finster">Chuckie Finster</a></li>

<li><a href="../../../d/i/l/Dil_Pickles_65be.html" title="Dil Pickles">Dil Pickles</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It is my belief that Tamao is being unscrupulous, and only wants the article deleted because of sheer dislike of the character, NOT because it is in the best interest of the forum. I also suggest that something is done about Tamao, as this person has constantly harassed this particular entry. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENew_Era_Outlaw_7f05.html" title="User:New Era Outlaw">New Era Outlaw</a> 00:06, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Request for relevant <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">citation</a> (to show that a given argument is not <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>) is being denied.</dd>

<dd>I have never seen this argument other than Wikipedia, and I suspect this claim to be <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Citations provided so far do not consist of a leading ID opponent making this claim. Some are almost similar, e.g. a leading ID opponent claiming that the designer must be complex (a quote from Dawkins) but without the ID opponent mentioning irreducible complexity, claiming that the designer must be irreducibly complex, or claiming that the designer must be irreducibly complex <i>by intelligent design's own reasoning</i>.</dd>

<p>Wade, the wikipedia policies are clear on this issue: text cannot be original. Try to revert it, if that does not work, take this dispute to the next level: arbitration. The user may have to have their rights revoked to really get the message. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenwmccrary58_d710.html" title="User:Stevenwmccrary58">Steven McCrary</a> 16:24, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Some good news: the section was finally removed. Alas, the issue has been replaced by another argument I suspect to be <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>the postulation of the existence of even a single uncaused causer in the Universe contradicts a fundamental assumption of Intelligent Design that a designer is needed for every specifically complex object.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>How does an uncaused causer contradict the assumption that a designer is needed for complex specified information? It is not explained. What's worse, my requests of a leading ID opponent making the argument are being denied, this time on the grounds that my previous objections (as the one above regarding irreducible complexity) "failed." But with luck and some patience, perhaps this argument will eventually be removed if no suitable <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">citations</a> can be given, all without resorting to arbitration.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One of the problems is that it isn't with just a single user, but a small group of users. Reverts tended to be reverted back and the small group cites "consensus" as justification. --<a href="../../../t/i/s/User%7ETisthammerw_810c.html" title="User:Tisthammerw">Wade A.

<p>Sorry: I don't see an explicit response section so I'll add one. The complaint above is a very one sided-view. This dispute blew up over The Deep (hist: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Deep_%28John_Crowley%29&amp;curid=863997&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Deep_%28John_Crowley%29&amp;curid=863997&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) and was begun when Ts decided to change Whilst into While. Looking over his edits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Telestylo" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Telestylo" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, I realised that he has been doing it a lot - indeed, he seems to do very little *other* than make this change.

<p>For more info on my argument, please take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anal_sex#Women_doing_the_man.27s_ass_picture" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anal_sex#Women_doing_the_man.27s_ass_picture" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anal_sex#Women_doing_the_man.27s_ass_picture</a></p>
<p>The policy says: A taboo image shall not be posted unless it is essential for the article to be understood. I removed the picture and Appleboy user reverted. I reverted Appleboy's change, so the article didn't have the picture anymore. Now Dpark reverted it and the article has the picture now. I'm avoiding to create a revert-war. We need some opinion whether the image is appropriated or not.</p>

<dd>Ghirlandajo is making many personal attacks against Poles in general and user Halibutt in particular (see his edit summaries, edits in the History of Belarus, language he uses on the talk pages), accussing others of making personal attacks when such a thing is not taking place (although some users after weeks of his attacks are beginning to lose patience) and engaging in revert wars.</dd>

<dd>If you can convince Ghirlandajo to be civil and stop offending others, it would be a great boon.

</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>Who's involved?</i></dt>
<dd>Me and loxley.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>What's going on?</i></dt>
<dd>I found a number of gaps, as well as factual and bias errors on these pages, so I've worked to fix them, contributing substantial new material and providing references. Loxley disagrees with my changes and keeps reverting or damaging them in various ways. We're at the point where he just reverted a few pages of my work without comment.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It appears that Loxley strongly supports one warring camp of philosophers who disagree with Dennett, so his changes are largely focused on defining Dennett as negatively as possible. Besides the excess POV, he does not possess a clear understanding of Dennett's work, so he's also making numerous factual errors. I've done my best to merge in whatever good parts he's added, clarify things that could be misunderstood and generally put together better pages. His counter-changes started off as reasonable if flawed, but have progressed to simple vandalism.</p>
<p>I've tried to discuss this with him, but it has not been productive. From my point of view, he's been argumentative, unresponsive and very deeply biased. I've lost respect for him, and now just consider him a heckler who doesn't even understand what he's heckling at. I suspect that he found me impatient and, from where he stands, partisan. I freely admit that I am entirely out of patience with him, and he could probably point out responses where I failed to control my anger, especially after he started erasing key parts of pages just because he disagrees with them.</p>
<dl>
<dt><i>What would you like to change about that?</i></dt>
<dd>I want this this edit war to stop before it even gets into its full swing and triggers automatic protections against reverts. I'm quite willing to accept unbiased and supported changes by him., but I'm not willing to stand by while he ignorantly pisses on Dennett. I'm angry and disgusted.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ideally, I would like to come to some mutual agreement so we can both positively participate in making these pages better. Precisely because he is so fond of people like Chalmers and Block, he could add balance by reporting on their views. However, as things stand, his contributons are of negative net value.</p>
<p>It may well be that our personalities class and he's more reasonable when dealing with other people. It may well be that I'm particularly impatient with him because I perceive him as intentionally damaging my work. If so, then a third party might be able to resolve this.</p>
<p>If not, then it's going to come down to blocking one or both of us from changing these and related pages, at least until this calms down.</p>

<dd>Edit war</dd>
<dd>Repeated removals of "disputed" tags prior to resolution of disupted issues</dd>
<dd>Repeated removal of statements which are backed by verifiable sources which cast doubt on the statements in the current text which lack verifiable sources, are "original research", are not neutral point of view, and in my opinion, just plain wrong.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>What would you like to change about that?</i></dt>
<dd>I would like statements for which there are no verifiable sources, i.e. "Original research" removed. I would also like Natalinasmpf to abide by the 3 revert policy. I would also like Natalinasmpf to respect the posting of "disputed" tags until factual disputes have been resolved. After the factual issues are resolved, I would like to make edits to remove biased point of view.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One specific issue that I would like to see addressed is the following. The text of the "Under the Commintern" section contains the statements:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Marx's theory had presumed that revolutions would occur where capitalist development was the most advanced and where a large working class was already in place. Russia, however, was the poorest country in Europe with an enormous, illiterate peasantry and little industry. Under these circumstances, it was necessary for the communists, according to their ideological mission, to create a working class itself.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For this reason, the socialist Mensheviks had opposed Lenin's communist Bolsheviks in their demand for socialist revolution before capitalism had been established.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Taken without any other context, the statement: "Marx's theory had presumed that revolutions would occur where capitalist development was the most advanced and where a large working class was already in place." is true. Without any other context, the statement says nothing about Marx's theory regarding revolutions where capitalist development was not the most advanced or where a large working class was not in place. However, in the context in question, the statement was obviously meant to be a statement of contrast between what Marx believed regarding revolutions "where capitalist development was most advanced" and Russia. The implicit meaning is something along the lines of "Marx's theory had presumed that revolutions would occur *earlier* where capitalist development was the most advanced, and *later* where it was not so advanced.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The idea that the latter result is a consequence of Marx's theory is "original research" and is not supported by verifiable sources. However the contrary idea, namely that a Russian revolution could provide a signal for workers revolution in the West, (that is precede revolutions in countries where capitalist development was most advanced) is documented at</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would like to make a comment regarding the editting of the Communism page in general. The editting history, as well as the talk, shows that a small group of individuals, including Natalinasmpf have taken it upon themselves to be the guardians of the existing page, and act to thwart any independent editting. This could be either good or bad depending upon circumstances. Wikipedia has espoused the goals of Verifiability, No "Original Research" and Neutral Point of View. These goals, together with the ability of countless individuals to make contributions to Wikipedia provide the basis for something truly great, something truly better than existing encyclopedias. I frequent the Math sections of Wikipedia, and note that already the math sections of Wikipedia are more extensive, and hence more useful than the encyclopedias which were available to me in my younger days.</dd>

<dd>The group which has taken virtual posession of the Communism page, however, appear to want to drag Wikipedia back toward the Encyclopedias of yesteryear. Encyclopedia Britannica is cited as a model. However, the older encyclopedias were commercial undertakings. As commercial undertakings they often reduced content for the sake of cutting costs. But perhaps more importantly, as commercial undertakings, they were subject to the influences of politics. In my opinion, this led to a significant lack of neutrality in their articles on political subjects. Blocking the appearance of verifiable facts which challenge the nice tidy narratives told in some articles might give the appearance of being more "encyclopedic", but in reality is an obstacle to the development of objective, verifiable articles. For this reason, I would hope that a mediator will give suggestions to this group that they take a friendlier view towards the inclusion of information which is supported by verifiable sources, and take a harsher look at narratives that may seem to be the "consensus" of their group, which may tell a pleasing story, but which are not supported by factual evidence.</dd>

<dd>(Mr/Ms) Conradi has been <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28subnational_entities%29_d563.html#Vandalizing" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (subnational entities)">Vandalizing</a> the page by changing the names of proposals, "Nasty editting", massively modifying others' entries in successive steps numbering in the dozens, and reverting and moving the pages. Administrator action has made 8 deleted edits to correct this problem (so far).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In addition, on the Project talk page, Conradi has engaged in personal attacks, name calling, comparing to "genocid", etc. I've posted the levels of <a href="../../../v/i/p/WP%7EVIP_552d.html" title="WP:VIP">WP:VIP</a> warning on her/his talk page, and presumably Golbez has done the same, but it's quickly deleted there.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>What would you like to change about that?</i></dt>
<dd>Folks would like to make substantive contributions on a Proposed Guideline page. The easiest solution would be for this disruptor to be banned for life, as apparently s/he has engaged in similar behaviour elsewhere -- but for now, just leaving folks alone in this one place would be helpful in the short run.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I brought it here first, as there might be a serious language impediment or cultural difference. There have been obvious lapses in Conradi's English language skills (probably en-1, unlikely en-2, certainly not the self-reported en-3). <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamAllenSimpson_739d.html" title="User:WilliamAllenSimpson">William Allen Simpson</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On a hunch, I checked against de.wiki as that's listed on Conradi's user page as a native language. It may not be a language problem. Possible personality disorder. S/he's got deleted pages there, too — although not as many as the 271 to date here. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamAllenSimpson_739d.html" title="User:WilliamAllenSimpson">William Allen Simpson</a> 12:45, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>from user:KJVTRUTH , I have in my possesion a (1955 Masonic Bible) that lists Presidents who have been Masons. It plainly states on the Page for Thomas Jefferson "there are unmistakable evidences that he was an active Mason" The bible also on the page lists his involvement with the laying of the Corner Stone for Central College in 1817, He is listed by Charlottsville Lodge No. 90 as a visitor present at these ceremonies. "Masons" of today do not want to call Thomas Jefferson a brother, possibly because of his letters with Adam Weishaup who founded the Illuminati. Wanting someone to NOT be a Mason Today, can't change the fact they were one in the past.</p>

<dt><i>What's going on?</i></dt>
<dd>There's been quite a bit of nonsense going on at <a href="../../../v/e/g/Veganism.html" title="Veganism">Veganism</a> lately. I was absent for the article for quite awhile, and recently returned with a bit more permanence. It appears I returned at a rough time, fresh out of a recent protection. Disputed content was found, and removed until a discussion could take place (which didn't occur). Incessant reverting occurred, resulting in another protection of the page. Accusations arose between myself and another user. Then, one more came in supporting the other. In the process, <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkinwalker_9c72.html" title="User:Skinwalker">Skinwalker</a> decided decided to jump on the wagon, and make false accusations of myself, <a href="../../../n/i/d/User%7ENidara_b036.html" title="User:Nidara">Nidara</a> and several anonymous users. Finally, we (<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisTyers_1664.html" title="User:FrancisTyers">Francis</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/d/User%7ENidara_b036.html" title="User:Nidara">Nidara</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanaen_d33d.html" title="User:Canaen">Myself</a> managed to organize a clear, proper consensus vote to get the page restored, and other users jumped in as well. Once this was near completion, <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkinwalker_9c72.html" title="User:Skinwalker">Skinwalker</a> came back, requesting an <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequest_for_Comment_14d2.html" title="Wikipedia:Request for Comment">RfC</a> before a request to remove the protection, and filed the request. I dated the request, and updated the status of the situation. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkinwalker_9c72.html" title="User:Skinwalker">Skinwalker</a> then accused me of vandalism, and threatened to report me as a vandal. See [User talk:Skinwalker#Veganism_RfC] for that matter. All the while, he didn't contribute to the process of getting the article running again; he simple hindered it (from mine and others' positions, at least).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>What would you like to change about that?</i></dt>
<dd>Frankly, I have a bit of fear instilled in me from the words of Skinwalker, past words, and of an apparently related group of users. I have every reason to believe that as soon as I make an attempt to report any of them for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikicrime_a3b5.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikicrime">Wikicrimes</a>, incivility, personal attacks, or harassment, they will instantly accuse me of the same (this has been done to me by them), and report me in kind. I'm not sure if any of them would be able to delete/hide my report while they do so. I'd like to be able to work on <a href="../../../v/e/g/Veganism.html" title="Veganism">Veganism</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environmental_vegetarianism.html" title="Environmental vegetarianism">Environmental vegetarianism</a> without this harrassment. I dislike banning users; it doesn't usually help the encyclopedia. Everyone has something to contribute. I simply want peace. If there's nothing that can be done, I might be forced to attempt use of official paths, and I don't want that. I hope that the Mediation Cabal can help.</dd>
