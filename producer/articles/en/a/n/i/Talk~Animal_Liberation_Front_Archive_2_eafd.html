<h2><span class="mw-headline">Rod Coronado</span></h2>
<p>I think the text underneath should read "Rod Coronado, a prominent ALF activist and convicted arsonist in the United States." He is notable for both being an activist and being an arsonist. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocJohnny_db09.html" title="User:DocJohnny"><small><font color="blue">John</font></small><small><sup><font color="blue">DO</font></sup></small></a>|<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDocJohnny_23f8.html" title="User talk:DocJohnny"><small><font color="blue"><sup>Speak your mind</sup></font></small></a> 11:31, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is a difficult one. The relation to this page is that he is an ALF activist, however it is also accepted that ALF commit arson. I don't think I would have a problem with your version - as it is backed up by evidence. It does, however, lead to the question of whether it needs to be in this article as it is already in the article about Rob Coronado.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 14:25, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>He is famous/infamous for being a convicted arsonist. That is the source of his credibility. It seems notable to me and belongs on there more than "from the United States".--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocJohnny_db09.html" title="User:DocJohnny"><small><font color="blue">John</font></small><small><sup><font color="blue">DO</font></sup></small></a>|<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDocJohnny_23f8.html" title="User talk:DocJohnny"><small><font color="blue"><sup>Speak your mind</sup></font></small></a> 15:11, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think you missed what I was saying. I am not contesting the USA bit - that it useful as it is a fact of his location. The problem is that the article is about the ALF not him, so putting to much detail in about him is a bit overkill as it is already in the article regarding him. Stating that he is from the USA is not there for his notability, more to show the geographical spread of the ALF. I personally would prefer it to stay how it is but would like some other opinions on it before it were to be changed.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 16:21, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sounds good, I understand your point about the whether the arson information belongs here since it is in the main article. My point is that since not everyone will go to the main article, and he is notable and distinguishable from other animal rights activists by being a convicted arsonist, one can make a case for inclusion here. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocJohnny_db09.html" title="User:DocJohnny"><small><font color="blue">John</font></small><small><sup><font color="blue">DO</font></sup></small></a>|<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDocJohnny_23f8.html" title="User talk:DocJohnny"><small><font color="blue"><sup>Speak your mind</sup></font></small></a> 17:41, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Looking at the <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rod_Coronado_daf3.html" title="Rod Coronado">Rod Coronado</a> article's talk page it seems very stable over there. The occasional discussion regarding the word terrorist in the past but that is about it. I think it is a stable non-disputed article - compared to most of the Animal Rights related ones. I would say also that the information that is being discussed here is not pertinent to this article and should stay as it is.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 13:42, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As much as I agree with you, various US government agencies class them as a terrorist organisation. Therefore, the classification as a terrorist organisation stands. -<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 20:11, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The US government describes terrorist organizations as violent, you can not be violent to a non-living object. The ALF rejects violence therefore it is not a terrorist organization. It does not fit the profile of a terrorist organization because it rejects violence.</p>
<p>If you are going to use the government's definition of a terrorist organization (and I believe we should) i.e. "The US government describes terrorist organizations as violent... (above)" then the <a href="../../../a/l/f/ALF_1be5.html" title="ALF">ALF</a> is clearly a terrorist organization. The U.S. government (<a href="../../../f/b/i/FBI_73d2.html" title="FBI">FBI</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Homeland_Security_2981.html" title="Department of Homeland Security">Department of Homeland Security</a>, etc.) considers the <a href="../../../a/l/f/ALF_1be5.html" title="ALF">ALF</a> a terrorist threat. <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arson.html" title="Arson">Arson</a>, it seems, can be very dangerous. "Activists" like Coronado also threaten action against humans (see the quote section on the <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rod_Coronado_daf3.html" title="Rod Coronado">Rod Coronado</a> page.) That this is <i>not</i> a nonviolent organization is clearly to be seen. As far as "...you can not be violent to a non-living object (above)," I hardly think we can accept this out of hand (see <a href="../../../p/r/o/Property_damage.html" title="Property damage">property damage</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violence.html" title="Violence">violence</a>.)</p>

<dd><i>"Domestic terrorism refers to activities that involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any state; appear to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; to influence the policy of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States."

<p>Real ALF members reject harming humans and take every percaution not to harm humans. If a human should be killed or injuried then the ALf condemns the action. People who kill in the name of animal rights do not represent the ALF. No human being has been killed by an ALF action, or ever will be. The Alf should not be confused with the animal rights milita, which advocates violence. Alf members strongly adcovate againist harming humans.</p>
<p>I don't think that the ALf is a terrorist organization because they reject harming humans the real terrorists are the corpartions that murder animals.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, read the quote more carefully. "<a href="../../../d/o/m/Domestic_terrorism.html" title="Domestic terrorism">Domestic terrorism</a> refers to activities that involve acts <i>dangerous to human life...</i>" <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arson.html" title="Arson">Arson</a> is dangerous to human life.

<p>I have a question for those who condemn the actions of the ALF. If you support the kind of property destructon of the jewish resistance fighter during the holocaust, then why don't you support the ALF is it because that was the 1940's and this is now? Is it because these were humans and those are animals or is it because that was Poland and this is the US? Or could it be that those who condemn the actions of the ALF are speclists who condone property destruction on behalf of humans?</p>

<dd>Thank you for the irrelevant statement. This has nothing to do with the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>. If I read your words in their correct context-- I might be misreading them, as they are not terribly clear-- they read to me as saying that you are a supporter of the Animal Liberation Front, in which case I suggest you join an ALF support group and leave the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> entry to those of us concerned with <a href="../../../f/a/c/Facts.html" title="Facts">facts</a>, not <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rhetoric.html" title="Rhetoric">rhetoric</a>.71.16.224.178 07:11, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Can I just step in here and say that people are entitled to their own views on Wikpedia, and this talk page. It does not matter if you love or hate the ALF - what matters is that the article is created to be <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> regardless of those views. There is a danger to life in every action we take every day. We must remember that a lot of what happens is decided upon by intent.</dd>
<dd>It is perfectly acceptable, and should be to anyone who supports the ALF, to have a reference in this article to the fact that they are described as a terrorist organisation. This comes with the category that is titled 'Terrorism'. It is not POV so it should stay. -<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 15:20, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This question about the holocaust is not rhoteric, it is a simple question that expouses the hypocrisies of those who condemn the actions of the ALF. Billions of animals are killed every year in the U.S. It is hypocritical to condemn violence, then critize those who destroy property that is designed to kill innocent beings. The attudute you displayed in my response is the same attudute that the nazis displayed when they killed they killed the jews. Look inside a slaughterhouse and you will change your mind, especally the iowa beef packers slaughterhouse, in Emporia, Kansas. That question I asked is directed at those who would praise those who destroyed the gas chambers in the exterimination camps, and helped jews escape, but condemn the actions of those who break the law by destroying property and taking animals from places of abuse. Those who do some serious research on the ALF will quickly find out that it does not fit the description of a terrorist organization. Many ALF members model themselves on the jewish resisttance fighters of the holocaust. I am going to tell you how the United States is like nazi germany. In both countries the governments tried to hide the killings. why is it difficult to get access to a slaughterhouse, and why is it againest the law to take pictures in the slaughterhouse. In both countries if the victim was taken to a safe place the government calls the actions criminal, and tries to punish those who are responsible, in nazi germany a person faced execution by helping someone who belongs to a racial group the nazis viewed as inferior to hide or escape, But that same person could kill the member of the targeted race and not have to worry about punishment. So to in the United States when people take animals from places of abuse and send them to loving homes the law comes down on them. But when those same animals are murdered the law does not care.

<dd>I think the point that is trying to be made is that this is not the place for this discussion. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia.

<dd>That is exactly my point. ALF activists have strong <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belief.html" title="Belief">convictions</a> and feel that their actions are justified, but to ignore the fact that the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> considers this group a terrorist organization would be intellectually dishonest. It also denigrates actual non-violent movements, such as the numerous <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-violent.html" title="Non-violent">non-violent</a> animal and human rights organizations that have so successfully affected public policy in the United States and throughout the world. These rants on the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> (capitalized) and the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_People_f3dc.html" title="Jewish People">Jewish People</a> (also capitalized) are illustrative of the fact that some think if they believe in something strongly enough they can somehow change the reality of the situation in which they find themselves.

<dd>Thank you for the references, none of which mention the "Jewish Resistance," that is unless you think the terms "Holocaust" and "Jewish Resistance" can be used interchangeably (they can't.) Those websites compare the slaughter of animals to the concentration camps of Nazi Germany. They don't compare ALF members to freedom fighters or the Jewish Resistance.

That was the point I was making-- about a statement that <i>you</i> made.71.16.224.178 03:57, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Note the "if": I was making a point about policy.

<dd>I'm tired of you trying to shut down this discussion. This page is here to discuss the article, and the article is about the ALF. The "if" is very important Slim. For example, suppose I were to say "...if a credible source says the ALF routinely murders children, we quote that too," as if such a quote actually existed (it doesn't). All I ask is that supporting evidence be offered for various claims.71.16.224.178 05:38, 7 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And I'm tired of single-issue anons who don't know how to edit within our policies and who waste people's time on talk pages. I was explaining policy when I wrote that, as in: IF you have a source that says the ALF is run by the mothers' union and that George Bush's wife is a prominent member, THEN put it in the article. That was my one and only point. If there is a claim in the article that you think is false and it is not supported by a source, quote it here. Otherwise, please stop the endless arguing. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 06:03, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I said above under general... Robin Web was charged for JD incitment (not actions) NOT CONVICTED, but aquited. Its more a case of the police fishing. AR activists generally have a policy of not critizing those who use other tactics within the movement, Robin Webb adheres to this too. Lots of RSPCA members are also in the ALF, does that make the SPCA the ALF? Why not mention the 20 or so other animal liberation organizations apart from the ALF that have been active underground? Barry Horne was not an ARM activist as the Isle of Write incideries were not targetting humans and were claim at the time by the ALF.

<p>The ALF has harmed no one and rejects violence. Racist organzation have killed countless people and advocate violence. And yet the U.S government lists them as the more dangerous threat. Do you know why? Because of money.</p>
<p>How come it is a felony to photograph inside a slaughterhouse, besides the reason that meatpacking companies want to keep costumers in the dark about the suffering animals go through simply for them to enjoy meat.</p>

<dd>The ALF creates monsters, such as the Justice Department and is then unwilling and unable to stop them. They use arson, an uncontrollable force, as a weapon that will, eventually claim either a civilian or firefighter's life. ALF cannot be ignored until they are as violent as racist organizations.

<p>Barry Horne wasn't an ARM activist, he was only ALF. If you have proof against this please provide. Terrorism or Freedomfighters is essential reading for any academic editing these pages. As I read through the article I am making the following notes... We should mention how the UK state regards the ALF beside the US definition, esp as the ALF has its roots in the UK. The band of mercy was not recreated as the HSA, it was simply that BoM came from HSA members. The roots in the angry brigade and anarchism in the UK should be mentioned. As well as the anti-vivisection riots of the late C19th. This sentence- "Lee and Goodman were arrested for allegedly taking part in a raid on Oxford Laboratory Animal Colonies in Bicester, which earned them the name the "Bicester Two." They were sentenced to three years in prison, but released after serving one." its not alleged if they were convicted. there are other problems with this version of histroy, I'm going to do some reading and come back to this one. The US origins are NOT conflicted, the US liberations were NOT the ALF as they were done by non vegetarians, so by definition could not be ALF. The ALF have been using vandalism for a long time, its what the founder started with! ARM info should be under ARM. They are diffrent organizations. If someone is a memeber of the SPCA and gets fed up with them and joins PeTA that doesn't make the RSPCA PeTA does it? the mink paragraph needs more balance, eg: science about mink release and info about the area they were released. Graham Hall was never an Animal Rights activist, he was a animal welfarist. That whole branding incident was also shown to be a hoax and publicized in the media as such.</p>

<p>"Recycled Hall's new scam (2) was to 'brand' his own back with the letters 'ALF'. Hall claims he was kidnapped by some animal rights people who conned him into thinking he was on the way to expose some dog fighting. Even from the start, this does not stand up, because after C4 Dispatches, no animal rights person would have anything to do with Hall, and he himself would be unlikely to try to contact them, being aware of the possibility that some of them might want revenge. The story is doubly suspicious because it is written by Foggo, the creep who tried to infiltrate and film the August 1999 Earth First! summer gathering near Bungay in Suffolk. Hall claims the ALF bundled him into a van, put a sacking hood over his head, and then burned his back with a hot iron. Recycled Hall has a track record of such claims. In another story he said he was kidnapped and told newspapers that he'd been shot in the leg, (could this be the kneecapping allegation recorded in GA54/55&#160;?) and on another occasion that he'd been tarred and feathered. (3) To be kidnapped once is unfortunate. To be kidnapped twice goes beyond coincidence, and stretches credulity too far. The front page picture of his wound in the Mail seems surprisingly superficial for a branding. There is a distinct lack of red flesh around the edge of the 'wound'. Even the Mial itself on the Monday questioned the story. We think the whole thing is fake, the sort of make up job people had in old civil defence exercises. This opinion is compounded by hard questions asked by Robin Webb. Where and when did Hall go to hospital after the attack? No one is saying which hospital, which suggests he never went. What record do they have of this? Have the police been told&#160;? We find out West Mercia police were only told of the attack after Hall went to the media - a sure sign this was simply a stunt." GA is the Magazine Green Anarchist. for more:<a href="http://www.animalsagenda.org/articledetail.asp?Menu=News&amp;NewsID=291" class="external free" title="http://www.animalsagenda.org/articledetail.asp?Menu=News&amp;NewsID=291" rel="nofollow">http://www.animalsagenda.org/articledetail.asp?Menu=News&amp;NewsID=291</a> And if POV is really at contention here then heres an ANTI-ALF comment about Graham Hall <a href="http://www.animalrights.net/59825" class="external free" title="http://www.animalrights.net/59825" rel="nofollow">http://www.animalrights.net/59825</a> "West Mercia Police are still investigating the incident and stressed they were keeping an "open mind" on whether animal rights activists were involved or not." I think that if the ALF had done it, they would have claimed it thu the press office. After all if you wanted to be secret about it they wouldn't have put ALF on his back.<a href="../../../x/a/n/User%7EXanax_04fb.html" title="User:Xanax">Xanax</a></p>

It would be worth your while to look over these before making any radical changes. What the policies say is that our edits must already have been published by credible sources, and that they should present all majority and significant-minority views. The ALF is allowed to be used as a source for this article because it's about them.</li>
<li>You should source your edits by linking to a source after the sentence or paragraph, or if it's not online, by adding a <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_reference.html" title="Harvard reference">Harvard reference</a> in brackets after the sentence (e.g. Best 2004).</li>
<li>The two books I've been using as sources are Steven Best (ed) <i>Terrorists or Freedom Fighters</i>, and Ingrid Newkirk <i>Free the animals</i>.</li>
<li>Material should be written in an enycyclopedic tone: no weasel words, no words that convey an opinion e.g. we don't say "The ALF stole 40 beagles from research lab" and we don't say "The ALF liberated 40 beagles"; instead, we find a neutral word. If we want to say they stole something, we have to attribute that claim to a court e.g. A court in Essex ruled that ALF activists stole 40 beagles."</li>

<p>Thanks for the help, I did keep the NPOV in mind, and if any bias came thru I'll blame the politically charged sources I have been reading(: A few books (booklets) I have found that have alot of ALF content include: Memories of freedom, terrorists or freedom fighters, Into the 90's with the ALF, Bite Back 2004 action report, against all odds and the ALF Primer. Is it Okay to use Magazine refrences? I only have refrences in Animal Rights Magazines to Horne being ALF not ARM, is this acceptable? There is a well documented statement from the Judge of his case say there was no intention to Harm anyone, although the ARM could esposue that they also have no intent, but are mearly careless about how they terrorise their victims.. tricky..<a href="../../../x/a/n/User%7EXanax_04fb.html" title="User:Xanax">Xanax</a> 05:11, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Magazine references are fine, Xanax, as are ALF leaflets, so long as you make clear where the information is coming from e.g. "According to the ALF ..." or "According to an ALF leaflet entitled "X,Y,Z" published in 1980 ..." etc. As for ALF and ARM, separating them is difficult. My understanding is that ARM, like the ALF, is not a "group," but just a direct-action name. In other words, if I go out tonight and smash the windows of my local butcher's store, I can claim that action as ALF. But if I also beat up the butcher, I would be more likely to claim it as ARM (I couldn't claim it as the ALF, because the Animal Liberation Press Office would reject the claim). That's my understanding anyway. Robin Webb has indicated that the ALF and ARM may consist of the same activists: see the article for details of what he said. If you want to say definitively that they are not the same people, you would need to find a source. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 08:44, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yep I agree Slim, but membership cross over still doesn't preclude them being seperate organizations/social entity/terrorist cells. "In other words, if I go out tonight and smash the windows of my local butcher's store, I can claim that action as ALF" thats true in so far as you are vegan or vegetarian and "To take all necessary precautions against harming any animal, human and non-human." (biteback magazine and ALFFAQ). You could also claim to be a christian, but in so far that you must believe in a monotheistic God and Jesus and stuff.
<dl>
<dd>Also I've read Robin Webbs comments, and I've also seen them in the context of a television debate, he was laying out principles, not describing the organizations membership. He is only a press officer for the ALF. I believe Robin Web has an agenda seperate from ALF. Also if the ARM was seen as harmless then the majority of its actions wouldn't work (product scares, death threats), so this may be propaganda. There are court transcripts showing ALF activists denoucing the ALF to escape conviction, this would be similar. If ARM terrorists act as ALF activists they arn't being true to ALF guidelines. Also another problem is some activists believe that Arsonists arn't ALF memebers contary to claims because arson endangers life, dunno who I'm ganna quote on that...</dd>

<p>Just for the record I'm not trying to push a POV here, and I know alot of this does seem like its just from my personal perspective, but'd love to see wiki actually work for this type of social history which is notorieously hard to document and usually ends up one sided or non-existant. I am however finding it hard to find alot of sources as the ALF, ARM etc are terrorist style groups.<a href="../../../x/a/n/User%7EXanax_04fb.html" title="User:Xanax">Xanax</a> 13:40, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A few of the many links to stories of ALF violence. To place this organization in such a category is mildly demeaning to the organizations conatined eg the Civil Rights Movement.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Firstly, the Center for Consumer Freedom is widely known to be nothing but an Anti-Animal Rights capaign organization, and not trustworthy. Animal Crackers, the typepad blog, is not worthy of being cited in an article either; Blogs are opinions. Further, it notes only destruction of property, which is not violence. Whether or not you agree, the defenition of Violence according to the ALF does not include destruction of property. You can't make a car suffer.</dd>
<dd>As for the TimesOnline article: being a taget of the ALF does not mean you will be physically harmed; it means that all your material objects, and you relationships (not relations) are subject to damage.</dd>
<dd>Arson is an acceptable tactic to many, involved with the ALF and otherwise. It's not considered to be Violence as long as no animals (human or otherwise) are harmed. <span style="background-color: #008000"><a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanaen_d33d.html" title="User:Canaen"><font color="#FFFFFF">Canaen</font></a></span> 23:27, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I suggest it matters less what the ALF's definition of violence is, than whether the ALF's actions equate with the accepted definition of violence. Taken from dictionary.com, Violence:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Physical force exerted for the purpose of violating, damaging, or abusing</dd>
<dd>Abusive or unjust exercise of power</dd>
<dd>Vehemence of feeling or expression; fervor.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>I think plenty of ALF actions fall within those definitions. I could be wrong, but it seems from the article as if the ALF are suggesting non-violence is synonymous with "no direct action that could endanger life". If that is the case, then perhaps their claim of being non-violent should be qualified with their own definition. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket">Rockpocket</a> 00:00, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Despite the partisan nature of the website, the story depicted is valid and was widely reported by the UK media <a href="http://www.i-mockery.com/meatatarian/branded.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.i-mockery.com/meatatarian/branded.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.i-mockery.com/meatatarian/branded.htm</a> Plus as an independant body I thought we didn't allow organizations to self-classify or describe? Also- arson is an acceptable tactic to many? I'm guessing the persone posting has never lost a loved one as 'collateral damage' - arson is violent, brutish and unsophisticated as a form of protest. This past decade ALF had caused more damge to property than the IRA, and I am a man who is passionately in favour of the rights of buildings, to liberate constructs from abusers, to inflict economic damage on those who profit from the misery and exploitation of buildings etc. I agree that the links presented were for the most part biased, but it does not detract from the fact that acts of violence have been carried out by the ALF, ergo they can't be classified as a non-violent resistance movement (unless we take their word and definition for it, but I'm a nasty cynic who doesn't). For crying out loud, this site even has mentions the attack on Brian Cass by ALFers.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeteranthony_24a7.html" title="User:Peteranthony">Peteranthony</a> 00:20, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Its important that we represent why the ALF consider themselves to be non-violent without misrepresenting their acts (which, by the wider definition, are probably not "non-violent" to a lot of people outside their movement). There is no merit to saying "the ALF does not consider it to be violent, so its not" - by that rationale, we should edit <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Irving_2e5a.html" title="David Irving">David Irving</a>'s article as if there was no Holocaust. In both cases, their opinion does not get to define the content of their entry.</dd>
<dd>I've made two (hopefully) subtle qualifications to address the issue. Firstly, I changed the intro to use the language of the ALF's guideline about violence, rather than just say "non-violent". Secondly, i have added one sentence at the beginning of the "attitude towards violence" section to establish the parameters of what the term is referring to, according to the ALF, in that section. I hope this allows the reader to make their own mind up about whether the ALF are "non-violent". <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket">Rockpocket</a> 18:37, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think we need a source for "The ALF define "violence" to include acts of aggression specifically directed against people and animals only," because otherwise we're stating it as a fact. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:19, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Good point. Alternatively we could write it as "the ALF appear to define..." - as i feel we need to somehow explain how the ALF define themselves as non-violent despite claiming what, according to the definition of the word, appears to be violent acts.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Terrorism, Direct Action, Sabotage, or Arson?</span></h2>
<p>There were some changes in the first sentence regarding what exactly the ALF does yesterday. The current version says <i>The Animal Liberation Front (ALF) is a name used internationally by animal liberation activists who engage in direct action, including sabotage and, much more rarely, arson, on behalf of animals, or in protest of the animal testing, vivisection, fur, meat, egg, or dairy industries.</i> I think it should cut out the bit about arson, since arson is covered under sabotage. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 08:14, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think it's sufficient to say "direct action," because there are many different kinds of direct action, and we can't list them all (and listing only the worst would be POV). We go into detail in the body of the text. Also, it's not clear what "sabotage" would amount to. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 09:01, 11 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I won't argue with your change, though I do think that most people think of them as carrying out sabotage so I think it will likely be changed back.

As far as i'm concerned, it is sufficient to state the facts and let the reader make their own mind up.

<dd>The ALF is not a terrorist group. Before you go about labeling people as "terrorists," please consider the defenition of the term. Regardless of all the bullshit surrounding the word, in it's essence, it is "one who uses terror," usually to accomplish a goal. You could quite easlily call <a href="../../../s/h/a/SHAC_cd8d.html" title="SHAC">SHAC</a> a terrorist group, because a lot of their tactics involve scaring people into stopping their involvement with Huntington Life Sciences.</dd>
<dd>However, animal liberations, such as those performed in the name of the ALF, are a form of <a href="../../../d/i/r/Direct_action.html" title="Direct action">Direct action</a>. They serve not to cause fear, but to achieve a concrete result. The goal in an ALF liberation is not to scare the operators of the place (although that is sometimes an added bonus), but to liberate animals. Plain and simple. <span style="background-color: #008000"><a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanaen_d33d.html" title="User:Canaen"><font color="#FFFFFF">Canaen</font></a></span> 22:52, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I call it burning down a McDonald's. Arson is a tactic rarely used by ALF cells. One must understand that the ALF does not carry out actions. Cells of individuals carry out these actions, and they are then claimed for the ALF. I'm not in all of their heads believe it or not, but I this particular action causes direct financial damage to McDonald's, a corporation which commits many attrocities. They no longer have that facility to make money in. If they want it again, they'll have to rebuild, knowing full well that someone or a group of someones are pretty damned determined to get rid of McDonald's in their area.</dd>

Now, since most of those places are run as <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franchise.html" title="Franchise">franchises</a>, it hurts the manager a lot more than the corporation, but it still has some effect. <span style="background-color: #008000"><a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanaen_d33d.html" title="User:Canaen"><font color="#FFFFFF">Canaen</font></a></span> 00:04, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure about that, Canaen. The term is already in scare quotes and is clear from the previous sentence that it is not a POV assertion, but an allegations made by the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Department_of_Justice_e439.html" title="U.S. Department of Justice">U.S. Department of Justice</a>. However, the USDoJ doesn't <i>define</i> the law under which they are charged (i presume that was some Homeland Security legislation that says arson attacks can count as domestic terrorism). So they <b>are</b> being charged with "domestic terror" offenses by the DoJ, that is quite different from saying they are charged with what the DoJ call "domestic terror" offenses. Currently the sentence is the equivalent of saying '<a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Manson_8fd5.html" title="Charles Manson">Charles Manson</a> was charged with what the DoJ called "murder"'. The DoJ doesn't define it as murder, the <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law.html" title="Law">law</a> does. That is why the DoJ can only make allegations or bring charges. I'm not going to revert back immediately, however, instead we can perhaps get some further opinion or come to consensus. <b><a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="blue">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a></b> 07:54, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The quote in the article says that vegetarians can be in the A.L.F. If that is so, then it seems inconsistent for them to be anti-dairy, unless they only target the particularly cruel parts of that industry. <a href="../../../e/p/a/User%7EEpa101_79b7.html" title="User:Epa101">Epa101</a> 12:54, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To be honest, I'm still not too convinced. If you don't want to do any more work, you don't have to; I'll have a look. With the first link, the A.L.F.'s official motive was unconnected to dairy. I know that anti-dairy graffiti was sprayed, and that does count as some evidence, but it cannot single-handedly be used to suggest to say that the A.L.F. is completely anti-dairy. The second link seems a little strange. How exactly are McDonald's connected to dairy? They don't sell milk or eggs. They might use butter, but so does everywhere. It sounds a bit like a wild rumour to me. I'll try to investigate this stuff a bit. <a href="../../../e/p/a/User%7EEpa101_79b7.html" title="User:Epa101">Epa101</a> 13:01, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm now in favour of removing the word "dairy" from the opening paragraph. I've searched the A.L.F. website, and find no evidence that they're, by definition, anti-dairy. In their list of saints, they include a lot of vegetarians. Everything is always phrased "vegetarian/vegan" being deliberately inclusive. I expect that some within the group would like to end the dairy industry, but every group has its internal differences. <a href="../../../e/p/a/User%7EEpa101_79b7.html" title="User:Epa101">Epa101</a> 13:15, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Epa101, you are referring to the ALF as if they are an organisation. Remember that the ALF is simply a front, a set of guidelines and rules if you will, under which non-violent, pro-animal rights actions occur. To state that 'the ALF is anti-dairy' is a non-point as the ALF in that context does not exist. If you said that 'activists under the guise of the ALF, in XYZsville are anti-dairy' then thats ok. Also bare in mind that there is not an ALF website. There is an 'ALF Press Office' website - which is a seperate, legitimate organisation, there is also a site which provides information on the ALF - but as there is no such thing as the organisation 'the ALF' it is not 'their website'.</dd>
<dd>Soy milk does have environmental issues, yes, but it has far fewer issues in total than the issues involved in dairy.

<dd>Hi. I understand that the A.L.F. is not a card-carrying organisation, but, if we can't say that they're pro- this or anti- that, then it makes no sense to talk about an A.L.F. at all. What I've decided on is that it is inappropriate how the opening paragraph does not mention leather, zoos, circuses, etc. but does mention dairy. Any glance over the links at the bottom indicates that their focus is more concentrated towards the former. I'm going to alter it, and it shall keep a reference to the fact that some members also oppose dairy. Sorry if my point about soya milk seemed a bit provocative. I should've just said that some animal rights people are skeptical on the anti-dairy, pro-soya argument. Oat milk is a new one on me.

<p>This is in response to SlimVirgin. You can't say that they oppose all industries with animal use, because that would mean opposing wool, silk, gelatine sweets, and elements of beer, apples, bananas, cereals, could go on forever. <a href="http://www.animalliberationfront.com/Practical/Health/VEGAN-L%20FAQ.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.animalliberationfront.com/Practical/Health/VEGAN-L%20FAQ.htm" rel="nofollow">Here is a resource from their website illustrating my point</a>. We can say that they are opposed to animal suffering wherever, but they single out certain industries above others as targets, and their literature seems to suggest that dairy is not one of those that is considered to be a priority. <a href="../../../e/p/a/User%7EEpa101_79b7.html" title="User:Epa101">Epa101</a> 13:20, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just thought I'd add that, although the official definition of "vegan" is someone who doesn't eat meat or dairy, there are people in the animal rights movement who define "vegan" as someone who doesn't eat anything that's may have come into contact with any animal product, as shown in F.A.Q. above. It seems that the "official" A.L.F. sites recognise that their members differ over what exactly counts as a significant exploitation of animals. They deliberately welcome mere vegetarians. I'd guess that it's to avoid the activists getting divided by arguing over details. <a href="../../../e/p/a/User%7EEpa101_79b7.html" title="User:Epa101">Epa101</a> 13:32, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Epa101, I think maybe you should do a bit of reading on what <a href="../../../v/e/g/Veganism.html" title="Veganism">veganism</a> acutally is. It is not limited to food and I don't think anyone who calls themself a vegan thinks that. This explains such things as vegan clothing, vegan cosmetics etc... I think what you are trying to change is a little pointless as the ALF do oppose all animal abuse - plain and simple. However, for practicalities sake they target those industries that do the most damage to animals. Also, veganism isn't about complete removal of anything animal related - it is about removing everything that is practicable (so removing dairy, meat, leather etc... but not stopping using roads).-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 14:36, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

The ELF/ALF do not call it that, they call it direct action, which if you read the page on direct action, can include what some consider to be terrorism.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tone of "attitude to violence" section</span></h2>
<p>The way that the first paragraph in this section is written seems to be suggesting that the A.L.F. is violent really. In the context, Webb's comment appears like an apology for violence, but the Green Party of England and Wales have said exactly the same thing: they don't like violence, but they can understand it when nothing gets done on the issue<a href="http://www.greenparty.org.uk/news/2130" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.greenparty.org.uk/news/2130" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. Perhaps, the quote should be moved elsewhere, or the paragraph should be written in a less P.O.V. tone. <a href="../../../e/p/a/User%7EEpa101_79b7.html" title="User:Epa101">Epa101</a> 19:01, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think it was written that way to best reflect the different interpretations of what the ALF does. They call themselves non-violent based on their definition of the word "violence", but within a wider definition, they do commit violent acts. Moreover, sometime ALF activists do carry out violent acts (under both definitions) but not in the name of the ALF. When these occur, the ALF refuses to condemn it.</dd>
<dd>As the rest of the article defines the ALF as "non-violent" (and correctly so), this section was inserted to provide independant perspective, allowing the reader to make up their own mind about whether "the A.L.F. is violent really". Taken in the context of the entire article, i think the balance is about right. <b><a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="black">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a></b> 20:06, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The category says that entries must have been officially designated as a terrorist organization by someone empowered to do so, in such a way that there is a consequence for that organization. It doesn't seem to me that that applies to the ALF. They are not an illegal organization. There are no restrictions on ALF activists, such as frozen bank accounts and the like, as occurs with terrorist groups. All that happened is that the DHS said they were regarded as a "domestic terrorist threat," but without consequence or any official listing, so far as I know. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:54, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Incorrect SlimVirgin. There are organizations that exist in the united states that are on official lists of terrorist organizations (DOD, FBI, state dept. etc.), and are still allowed to operate/raise money. ALF is one that comes to mind. GreenPeace was another, they were on the FBI list. Westboro Baptist Church is on the DoD list. When I was working full time counter-terrorism/force protection for the army, we would get the CT briefings with a full list of terrorist organizations operating in our area, and some of the names on the lists were very public organizations that were actively engaged in fundraising activities. Religious organizations like IIIT, SCC, IRO, Al Wafa, etc still operate in the US.

<dd>You could call the respective agency. DOD's list is not for civilian release, so you wouldn't be able to see that one, but State Department's list is public. I would assume DHS and state have it up on their websites somewhere. I looked on the TEL, but the wikilink we have only shows foreign groups. There is a seperate list for operating domestic terrorist organizations, but for the life of me I can't remember what the name of it is.

<dd>I guess, if we can get it, we should us the Exclusion List as a criterion for the category (that is, if we are saying significant consequence for that organization's activities is the benchmark). Otherwise the 'consequence' wording should be rethought.

</ul>
<p>Testimony of Dale L. Watson, Executive Assistant Director, Counterterrorism/Counterintelligence Division, FBI Before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence February 6, 2002 "The Terrorist Threat Confronting the United States"</p>
<p>"During the past decade we have witnessed dramatic changes in the nature of the terrorist threat. In the 1990s, right-wing extremism overtook left-wing terrorism as the most dangerous domestic terrorist threat to the country. During the past several years, special interest extremism--as characterized by the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) and the Earth Liberation Front (ELF)--has emerged as a serious terrorist threat. The FBI estimates that ALF/ELF have committed approximately 600 criminal acts in the United States since 1996, resulting in damages in excess of 42 million dollars."</p>
<p>"In recent years, the Animal Liberation Front (ALF)--an extremist animal rights movement--has become one of the most active extremist elements in the United States. Despite the destructive aspects of ALF's operations, its operational philosophy discourages acts that harm "any animal, human and nonhuman." Animal rights groups in the United States, including ALF, have generally adhered to this mandate. A distinct but related group, the Earth Liberation Front (ELF), claimed responsibility for the arson fires set at a Vail (Colorado) ski resort in October 1998, which caused 12 million dollars in damages. This incident remains under investigation. Seven terrorist incidents occurring in the United States during 2000 have been attributed to either ALF or ELF. Several additional acts committed during 2001 are currently being reviewed for possible designation as terrorist incidents."</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I'm aware of that. That's the comment I was referring to earlier. But an FBI agent saying the ALF has "emerged as a serious terrorist threat" is not the same as them being formally designated. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:43, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bam: I found it at good old FAS.org "Probably the best-known extremist group in Europe and North America is the Animal Liberation Front (ALF), founded by Ronnie Lee in England in 1976 and still very active . The ALF appeared in Canada in 1981, with a series of break-ins at several university and medical laboratories involving vandalism, arson and the release of animals; this was followed by attacks on fur stores and meat-packers. First recognized in the United States in 1982, the ALF made the FBI's domestic terrorism list in 1987 with a multi-million dollar arson at a veterinary lab in California. Similar incidents in Arizona and Texas in 1989 were also classified as domestic terrorism.4" <a href="http://fas.org/irp//threat/com74e.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://fas.org/irp//threat/com74e.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>But is there, in fact, an official FBI terrorism list? There appears to be absolutely no consequence for any organization named as "terrorists" by only the FBI, so what is the sense in which the ALF would be regarded differently having been placed on this list, if it exists? Also, the source may be speaking loosely. It first talks of the ALF being "designated" and then says it was the acts that were so designated. I think we need to find an official source for this alleged designation. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:26, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I couldn't see anything on page six. The entry on page 19 says that three ALF acts have been designated as terrorist by the FBI and the rest criminal. That's not the same as designating the organization, and the source you're quoting is the same as the one I quoted above, which says the ALF is <i>not</i> designated as a terrorist group by any of the govt depts that are in a position to designate them. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:32, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Uh a terrorist organization is defined on page 31 as "groups or individuals whose terrorist activities are directed at elements of our government or population without foreign direction". As ALF is classified as a group committing terrorist activities under the classification of "domestic terrorism" they are therefore defined as a terrorist organization by the FBI. You seem to be stuck on the fact that it doesn't spell out word for word "ALF IS OFFICIALLY AND HEREBY DESIGNATED AS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION". FAS.org, the Canadian intelligence service, etc, all interpret the above to designate ALF as a terrorist group from the FBI. FAS in particular is a world respected expert in global terrorism studies and governmental studies as well. I highly trust them as a source. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 20:43, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The category says: "Designated terrorist organizations are non-governmental organizations that currently are designated by a law monopolist as a terrorist organization. Law monopolist organizations for the purpose of this category are bodies where designation by that body would be expected to have a significant impact on the group." And the examples they give are governments or the UN.</dd>

<dd>I'm not trying to be obstructive here, though I'm sure it looks that way. It's just that I edit terrorist-related articles quite a lot, and so I know the hoops that governments jump through before designating organizations as "terrorist," and the impact is invariably significant and immediate. Yet here we are accepting an apparent listing from a law enforcement agency, not a government, based on their view that three ALF acts fitted their description of "terrorist" in 1989, a view that has had no effect whatsoever on the legal or financial status of the ALF in the United States or anywhere else in the world. It just isn't enough to fulfill the requirements of that category in my view. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:57, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I don't think you're being obstructive. You're following the strict definition of the rules. I'm finding myself getting too "into it", and I've got other things to do today, so I'm leaving this out until tomorrow. In reference to your last comment, SlimVirgin, the FBI, as a united states governmental bureau, speaks FOR the government. They ARE the government. when the FBI has designated a group as a terrorist, then the US government has designated them as a terrorist. Remember, the FBI is federal, and the seniormost bureau member (Director of the FBI) reports directly to the Atty. General. So this is in actuality a governmental statement. It's just like when the DHS changes the alert level of the nation. It's not just "DHS's " alert level. IT's the NATION's alert level. DHS just happens to hold responsibility for that. It's still a governmental action. Same thing with the FBI, which is the nation's federal law enforcement agency, and the lead branch of government when it comes to terrorism (as cited in the very end of that .pdf file). Ok that's it for me today. I'll pick up on this tomorrow.

<dd>I hope I'm not splitting hairs. As I said, I'm used to editing Middle East terrorist-related articles, and there we have situations such as the paramilitary wing of Hamas being designated terrorist, but not the social affairs half, it's all very precise and debated endlessly at an international level; followed by press conferences, funding cut, etc etc. It's all public, transparent, unambiguous, and it has immediate legal and financial implications. This, on the other hand, feels too casual, too ambiguous, and most importantly, pointless. However, I truly don't want to split hairs. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:45, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can see where your are coming from, SV, and appreciate you are not being obstructive. It appears to me also that the FBI announcing that the ALF is a domestic terror group/threat does not have immediately obvious consequences for the ALF's extistance (in terms of legality of membership, funding, dissemination of information etc). However, although not an expert i expect it probably does have implications or consequences for the aftermath of (illegal) acts carried out "by" the ALF. For example, i'd imagine that any crime carried out by a "domestic terror group" (according to the FBI) would immediately become a federal investigation rather that one for local law inforcement. I would imagine it also has consequences come sentencing, and there may even have consequences regarding investigative techniques that can be used under the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriot_Act_2eb5.html" title="Patriot Act">Patriot Act</a>. These, admittedly, are not directly consequent to the "group", but - as we know - the ALF is not a group, but a Front for acts within certain parameters. Is it therefore inappropriate to consider the consequence this listing would have on such acts? I'm not sure of the answer to this, am also currently unsure whether i think the ALF should be in the cat or not, but i just thought i would put this out there. <b><a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="black">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a></b> 00:40, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, those are good points, Rockpocket, and I hadn't thought of it that way. Calling ALF acts "terrorist" might allow investigators to take steps they couldn't otherwise be able to, and so on. Okay, I'm willing to concede the point.
