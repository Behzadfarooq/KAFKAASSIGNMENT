<p>Recently you edited the Operant Conditioning article in a couple of places and would like some clarification about their basis.</p>
<p>The first edit involved the deletion of the term "involuntary reflexive" from the portion reading "while Pavlovian conditioning deals with the conditioning of <i>involuntary reflexive</i> behavior so that it occurs under new <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antecedent.html" title="Antecedent">antecedent</a> conditions." However, Classical Conditioning cannot be used with all behavior in general, only with reflexes (respondent behavior). Is it possible that you are confusing Classical Conditioning with operant procedures that condition stimulus control over operant behavior? I would agree that both cases involve procedures to cause a behavior to occur in response to a novel antecedent stimulus. However, Classical Conditioning does this using successive trials in which the novel stimulus precedes an existing unconditioned stimulus. Wouldn't this happen regardless of any consequences delivered, whereas consequences <b>would</b> have an effect upon the occassion of non-reflexive behavior? For example, you can condition salivation to occur in response to a tone regardless of whether or not you provide reinforcement afterwards (ie. whether or not you give them food to eat for having salivated). An operant response, however, will not change in frequency without a change in the contingency of the consequences that maintain it. Operant conditioning employs consequences while Classical conditioning does not.</p>
<p>Stimulus control procedures, such as discrimination training or generalization training, require the use of consequences to alter the frequency of operant S-R relations. If you reinforce a response when it occurs in situation 1, but extinguish it when it occurs in situations 2, 3, and 4, the response will occur with greater frequency upon the occassion of S1 and with less frequency upon the occassion of either S2, S3, or S4. That is to say, S1-R will be reinforced, while S2-R, S3-R and S4-R will have been extinguished. Unfortunately, the article currently lacks a good section on the stimulus control of operant behavior, something I hope to get around to adding in the future.</p>
<p>The second edit I refer to in the article is an addition stating, "The subject has no control of the consequences in Pavlovian conditioning." As I mentioned before, in the implementation of Classical Conditioning there are no consequences to speak of, hence the procedure being referred to as representative of "S-R Psychology," while operant conditioning employs the addition of a third term, the consequence, in what is called the "Three-Term Contingency" (S-R-S). --<a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunar_Spectrum_f48f.html" title="User:Lunar Spectrum">Lunar Spectrum</a> | <a href="../../../l/u/n/User_talk%7ELunar_Spectrum_d908.html" title="User talk:Lunar Spectrum">Talk</a> 10:11, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Although the early literature on Pavlovian Conditioning did utilize nearly only reflexive responses, there has been a significant movement away from the restriction to reflexes in recent years. This is reviewed, pretty clearly, in Domjan's textbook on the Principles of Learning and Behavior that I refererenced. It, in turn, references many principle articles on conditioning written in recent years that do not use reflexive actions to measure classical conditioning.</p>
<p>Also, I do not find it out of turn, at all, to speak about consequences when talking about Classical Conditioning. RA Rescorla has made quite a career out of demonstrating the requirement that the unconditioned stimulus have some characteristics of a reinforcer for the procedure to work - and that the reinforcing value of the unconditioned stimulus is of nearly direct relation to the ease with which a conditioned response may be elicited.</p>
<p>Both of these areas of behavioral psychology are quite broadly supported by research in the last 3-4 decades, even if they are not discussed by Pavlov or Konorski's earlier work. Part of the process at Wikipedia is adding referenced, sourced, material, and I added references with my additions. The Classical Conditioning page is very weak in this area, and I had planned to add more as time permits, later. The key is adding references as the material is added, so that the material is verifiable. But I think you will find both of the points I added are broadly supported in recent reviews on Pavlovian or Classical Conditioning, and much of the support can be found in the citations in Domjan's text. --Animalresearcher 10:29, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's a very good point about the similarilties between USs and primary reinforcers, and there's clearly overlap between the two procedures in terms of their effects upon behavior. But how does that suport the statement that "the subject has no control of the consequences in Pavlovian conditioning" when Pavlovian conditioning doesn't use consequences to begin with? And even if a consequence could be construed from Pavlovian conditioning, if a behavior has no control over it consequences, then the behavior is inconsequential and the consequence would have been unable to maintain the frequency of that response. Doesn't it seem that the reliable elicitation of a response, despite its lack of control over its consequences, would imply that respondent behavior is a distinct class of behavior apart from operants? --<a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunar_Spectrum_f48f.html" title="User:Lunar Spectrum">Lunar Spectrum</a> | <a href="../../../l/u/n/User_talk%7ELunar_Spectrum_d908.html" title="User talk:Lunar Spectrum">Talk</a> 19:26, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are right, consequences should be replaced with "presentation of unconditioned stimulus". Consequences clearly implies things that I didn't intend to imply. A student of eyeblink conditioning explained to me that eyeblink conditioning could be operant or classical depending only on whether the eyelid was restrained or not. In classical the unconditioned stimulus is out of the control of the animal. In operant the reinforcer is controlled by the animal. I've been doing a lot of work translating between classical and operant, and forget the whole world hasn't been living inside my head for the last few years.&#160;;) --Animalresearcher 23:14, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, the sentence does look better now. I hate to press the issue, though, but the only problem left is that instead of describing a contrast between Pavlovian and operant conditioning, the sentence now describes a similarity (which would make the "Unlike" redundant). In operant procedures also, the subject's response does not have control over antecedent stimuli, only upon its consequences. I could simply change it to "Like," but I might just wait until I've put in a section on the stimulus control of operant behavior to be able to follow up on that similarity.</dd>

<dd>What you mention about the eye-blink reflex sounds right. The eye-blink by itself would be a respondent behavior, while the restraint of the reflex would be operant behavior. However, during the restraint of the reflex, I don't think that the original motor impulse causing the eye-blink would itself be inhibited. Rather, the learned restraint probably occurs through the activation of opposing muscle groups which prevent the eye from blinking, but do not prevent the neural activation of the reflex from being transmited. So that would mean that during restraint, at least two responses occur: the orignal reflex and its opposing restraint (an operant). --<a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunar_Spectrum_f48f.html" title="User:Lunar Spectrum">Lunar Spectrum</a> | <a href="../../../l/u/n/User_talk%7ELunar_Spectrum_d908.html" title="User talk:Lunar Spectrum">Talk</a> 23:49, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Looks good, I'll take a look at it more carefully when I have a bit more time (I'm sure you are busy with the SfN meeting as well) and see if I can suggest other things to add.

<dd>My point was more that a Nobel Laureate at Cambridge is also one of the most famous primate researchers ever.

<p>I guess it depends how you define adult. The original papers by Connors and Hestrin labs were in juveniles (~p21) precisely because of the reasons you mentoned about the optics, so yes it may not represent what happens in older animals. However using transgenic mice that selectively express GFP in specific subtypes of interneurons you can more easily identify interneurons in older animals, so in 2002 Galarreta and Hestirn showed that electrical synapses are still present in 2-7 month-old mice, which are definitely adults <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=search&amp;DB=pubmed" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=search&amp;DB=pubmed" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Take that in combination with the observation that some connexins persist into adulthood, and its not such an unreasonable conclusion to say that in some cell types, electrical synapses are fairly common even in adults. Also, in parts of the brain such as the inferior olive its been known for a long time that gap junctions are present and allow the cells to oscillate together, so in this case I don't think its such a stretch.

<p>AR, your edits to animal rights articles are becoming unacceptable. Your recent edits about BUAV and the ALF said the opposite of what the source said, and were arguably defamatory; your edits to PETA about their attitude to pets said the opposite of what the source said; and your edit that PETA deliberately prolonged monkeys' suffering for publicity is not only highly unlikely, but was sourced to Wikipedia, which is not allowed.

<dd>Also, there were those of us who lived through the Silver Spring monkeys incident, and the Wikipedia listings on it were attempts at revisionist history by PETA, or people who merely sourced PETA on the topic. AT EVERY STAGE of the Silver Spring monkey incident, there was substantial controversy. It's a little different when you know the incident with lucid detail from having lived through it. It is VERY hard for an outside observer to think PETA was doing anything other than engaging in lawsuits to gain publicity, even if it meant prolonging animal suffering. I would not say they <b>wanted</b> to prolong the animal suffering, but that they <b>wanted</b> publicity and further animal suffering was viewed by them as collateral damage. You need to ask yourself under what possible legal framework did they feel they were entitled to the animals, or could make better assessments on pain and suffering than the medical and veterinary experts who saw them? --Animalresearcher 10:31, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To answer about the CCF thing. The CCF is an unreliable organisation as the source of their funding is unknown, they are an attack organisation. BUAV is a world reknowned organisation that are approached by many organisations with regards animal rights. I have never seen a single publication by the BUAV which could be classed as 'an attack' - they provide facts. The CCF do - an example: On the front page of their site at the moment they have <a href="http://www.consumerfreedom.com/news_detail.cfm/headline/3179" class="external text" title="http://www.consumerfreedom.com/news_detail.cfm/headline/3179" rel="nofollow">this</a> article linked. It states 'When Animal Liberation Front spokesman Jerry Vlasak famously commented that medical researchers who use animals should be targeted for "political assassination,"'. Now this is taken completely out of context. At no point did he state that anyone should be targetted - he said that he thought it would be an effective tactic. Here is the exact transcript: <i>If these vivisectors were being targeted for assassination, and call it political assassination or what have you ... I think that strictly from a fear and intimidation factor, that would be an effective tactic. And I don't think you'd have to kill -- assassinate -- too many vivisectors before you would see a marked decrease in the amount of vivisection going on. And I think for 5 lives, 10 lives, 15 human lives, we could save a million, 2 million, 10 million non-human lives.</i> Now, does that sound like someone calling for assassination? Or does it sound like someone talking about how he sees things going? To me, having heard him speak at another event, it sounds like the latter.</dd>
<dd>If you can provide some reason why CCF should be used as a source then please do.</dd>
<dd>Now, PETA, on the other hand should only be used rarely in my opinion - on articles about themselves and as direct quotes from them about specific things. Newkirk can be used as a source as she is a well known and published author.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 20:49, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If i may interject, BUAV has been accused of fabricating evidence (see the two newspaper reports in <a href="http://www.rds-online.org.uk/pages/news.asp?i_ToolbarID=6&amp;i_PageID=201" class="external text" title="http://www.rds-online.org.uk/pages/news.asp?i_ToolbarID=6&amp;i_PageID=201" rel="nofollow">here</a>) and making false allegations. World renouned they might be, but free of agenda they are not. PETA - and other groups - regularly alter the context of notable scientists' comments to imply they think testing is ineffective. In addition, a High Court judge recent ruled the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_Liberation_Press_Office_9c36.html" title="Animal Liberation Press Office">Animal Liberation Press Office</a> "was not a neutral reporting exercise or even simply a vehicle for apologists for the ALF, but a vital part of the ALF's strategy." <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uklatest/story/0,,-6144993,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uklatest/story/0,,-6144993,00.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Seeing as Vlasak is the US representative of the Press Office and his British counterpart was described as a "central and pivotal figure in the [ALF]" - it doesn't take a genius to work out that what he says has great influence in ALF policy. Finally, the CCF is hardly alone in describing what Vlasak said as such. Here is a notable source interpreting the implication perfectly: <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1268790,00.html" class="external text" title="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1268790,00.html" rel="nofollow">"Kill scientists, says animal rights chief", "Fury as former surgeon calls for selective assassinations"</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="black">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a> 21:11, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I prefer more mainstream sources anyway,..CCF is largely useful in collecting information from more reputable sources about the controversy, which is mostly the same ways BUAV and PETA are useful. I know a LOT more about PETA because I know a few principals in the Silver Spring monkey case, and because I looked into them when they regularly protested at my center in the early 90s. --Animalresearcher 00:20, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Animal rights has philosophical and ethical context. In philosophy and ethics, there is debate. This is a good one pitting the foremost ethicist on animal rights against one of the foremost US legal scholars. It would be even better if there were more publicly accessible debates in which one POV were pitted against another so that all sides of the debate could be shown equally. It is certainly possible it would be better moved to the section on criticism, but since the debate features Singer and Posner equally, I felt it would be better there. But if you want to move it down to <i>criticism</i>, I won't complain.--Animalresearcher 17:05, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
