	    <p>There is such a thing as animal magnetism beyond what is stated in this Wikipedia. I have experienced it. There is an invisible energy that flows between you and the other person that you are very attracted to and they are attracted to you. The energy is very very strong physical thing that you actually feel emanating from the other person and flowing back to them just like a circuit. You can even determine the person is in the same area even though they are somewhere behind you even if you are not looking at them or if you don't see them. It is an experience that is bordering on the occult in the sense that no one seems to be able to explain it, but before the scientific community writes this off to mere nonsense, they need to do more research. There is something to this. Other experiences similar to this are feeling as one with someone, or an experience I had in practicing Scientology wherein I and the twin I partnered with in a communication course actually felt the energy wave of the thought that I sent to them while communicating to them. The thought had an effect that the exercise was intended to result in.</p>
<p>There is a lot more to this than meets the eye. Just as we can't see electricity or magnetism, there is something going on. Research is needed.</p>
<dl>
<dd>We all feel a special connection to the people we love (well, so I hope!). It's not an unusual experience to feel drawn, as if by magnetism, toward a person you love. It's in your head, man. Or your heart, if you prefer. It's a feeling-- don't build it up (or, if you like, degrade it) by inventing some mysterious energy field that must be behind it. Love is weird and complicated enough.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for using your attraction to someone to detect her, I'm dubious. It's possible to recognize a loved one from very few clues, including subliminal cues. Call it <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intuition.html" title="Intuition">intuition</a>, there's no need to go further than that. People can't sense each others' presence without actually *sensing* them; if there were a "sixth sense" for detecting our lovers' presence, it would be obvious to everyone and well-known in all cultures (as are the other senses). <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilarius_0cd7.html" title="User:Silarius">Silarius</a> 02:07, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>

<dd>That reasoning seems flawed. For example, there could exist a sixth sense which is only accessible in altered states of consciousness when input from the other senses is turned down. Most ancient/rural cultures *do* believe in some kind of "spirit" reality which can be directly sensed, perhaps because they routinely access altered states through hypnotic music, dance, psychedelic plants etc; while in modern/urban culture the combination of an educational system which promotes linguistic thought at the expense of sensitivity to feeling, and the near-constant barrage of primary sensory input, may conspire to make most people unaware of their sixth sense. Not saying I believe this but it's one possible explanation, among others. ----Ben</dd>

<dd>Right <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#OR" title="WP:NOT">here</a>. Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought. This includes anonymous opinions about animal magnetism. Encyclopedic content needs to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/Wp%7Ev.html" title="Wp:v">verifiable</a> and come from a reputable source. <a href="../../../t/w/e/User%7ETwelvethirteen_db89.html" title="User:Twelvethirteen">Twelvethirteen</a> 17:33, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>This page doesn't really describe Mesmer's theory in any meaningful way, and is rather light on other details. Suggest either merging with <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Mesmer_772b.html" title="Franz Mesmer">Franz Mesmer</a> or pulling the explanation from that page here and expanding it? Advantage of keeping a separate page is that the phrase Animal Magnetism is in widespread use, but usually *not* referring to Mesmer's theory. This alternate meaning ought to be given more prominence.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree; in fact, I found this article pretty useless. This page seems to address "mesmerism", not the common colloquial usage of "animal magnetism". But the article doesn't say what that *is* at all. It mostly discusses some the two terms, and gives a few other circumstantial details. Could someone who has some idea of what this actually is please update the article to explain?</dd>
