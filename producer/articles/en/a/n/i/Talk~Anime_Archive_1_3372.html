<h2><span class="mw-headline">Accent mark on the e in anime</span></h2>
<p>Why do people put an accent mark on anime: animé? Is it because of the claim of the derivation from French? To try to look cool (but end up looking stupid)? The accent in Pokémon? Or to hint that the "e" should be pronounced (technically a <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diaeresis.html" title="Diaeresis">diaeresis</a> should be used for that)?</p>

<dl>
<dd>It's to hint that the "e" should be pronounced. I for one used to think it was pronounced "a-neem" (cringe) before I became a fan. I see this a lot with the word "sake" written as "saké" so people don't pronounce it like the English word "sake". Yes, a diaeresis is the proper accent mark for this purpose in English, but it's fallen out of use and people are more familiar with the French way. I think a pronunciation note in the beginning of the article (like it is now) is far preferable to using an accent in any case. <a href="../../../d/o/p/User%7EDopefishJustin_bbf5.html" title="User:DopefishJustin">DopefishJustin</a> 00:02, Apr 15, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">External links</span></h2>
<p>I'm not an anime fan and I really can't speak to this authoritatively, but it seems to me (from the perspective of someone coming to this article looking for information), that there "External links" section is too long to be much use.</p>
<p>I accidentally stumbled onto this link:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.anime-info.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.anime-info.net/" rel="nofollow">Anime-Info.net</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, as I happen to read French, I found it quite useful, but most English-speakers wouldn't, so I removed it (<a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html#Foreign-language_sites" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Manual of Style</a>).</p>
<p>If that was serving some purpose that I missed and it really needs to be there, by all means, add it back. But I looked through the other links and I really can't tell what they all, collectively, accomplish, that couldn't be accomplished by a shorter selection. As it was, I was hard-pressed to find what I was looking for (in this case, images) admidst the deluge. It looks like somebody with a bit more knowledge needs to do a bit of pruning, perhaps? --[[User:Aranel|<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_6303.html" title="User:Aranel">Aranel</a> ("<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_Sarah_20da.html" title="User:Aranel/Sarah">Sarah</a>")]] 00:01, 11 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>It just keeps getting worse as people continue to add new links. Can someone who knows something about the subject look into this? Otherwise I'll try to prune on my own, but I'm sure some people wouldn't like that because I don't know which are really the most popular sites.

Aranel: Did you read my other comment? Anipages daily is far more informative than any of the other pages listed here. The guy who runs it Benjamin Ettinger knows more about film production aspects in anime than really any other english speaker. I find his information invaluable to understanding the production side of anime (in partiuclar artistic and independant work) invaluable. In a world (in refrence to anime subculture) where real knowledge is scarce and fans have many misnomers, this site is a beacon of knowledge. Finally it is a promotion of anime as an artform and not as a pop culture fandom, for that I feel this site should definetly be included in the links.</p>

<p>The following lists are getting to be rather excessive:</p>

<li>The list of "some of" the important conventions</li>
<li>Notable names in anime</li>

<p>My concern is that the lists are starting to get in the way of the communication of the information in this article. Comprehensive lists in all four cases might be useful, but they should be in separate articles (especially the first two, which I am about ready to move to their own articles as they stand). Can I get some input from someone who actually knows which items on these lists are of sufficient significance? (The lists in this article do not claim to be comprehensive. They are <i>supposed</i> to be short and by definition should leave out many items that are of major secondary importance.)

<p><a name="Long_vowels" id="Long_vowels"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Long vowels</span></h2>
<p>Most anime-related topics in Wikipedia seem to use kana spelling for long vowels (<a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoujo.html" title="Shoujo">shoujo</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doujinshi.html" title="Doujinshi">doujinshi</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishounen.html" title="Bishounen">bishounen</a>, etc) instead of following the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_for_Japan-related_articles_dcca.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style for Japan-related articles">Wikipedia:Manual of Style for Japan-related articles</a>, which recommends short vowels in titles and macrons in content (shōjo, dōjinshi, bishōnen, etc). I know that otaku circles like pretending they know Japanese, but this is an encyclopedia for the general public we're dealing with here and some consistency would be nice. How loudly would y'all object to shifting all articles to their short-vowel titles, and adding redirects for the long forms? --<a href="../../../j/p/a/User%7EJpatokal_73ec.html" title="User:Jpatokal">Jpatokal</a> 14:36, 31 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Opposed because of search engines. Incorrect or not, shoujo is a more widely-recognized Anglicization than shojo, doujinshi more than dojinshi and bishounen...well, those two are about equal, but bishounen has a slight edge on search results. Yes, we can have redirects to the "preferred" spelling, but that harms the Google rankings (whatever they may be). Beyond one spelling's popularity over the other (we're also charged with making the article titles whatever is most likely to be searched for), I don't really have a preference, although when I do write those three, I still naturally write the "ou" transliteration. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadicalBender_a5e1.html" title="User:RadicalBender">R<small>ADICAL</small>B<small>ENDER</small></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadicalBender_2a58.html" title="User talk:RadicalBender"><small>★</small></a> 16:33, 31 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Google ranking argument seems to be a bit of a red herring, since Wikipedia doesn't show up in the top 100 for either form of shōjo... and can you decide if you're opposed or don't have a preference? 8) Any other opinions on the subject? <a href="../../../j/p/a/User%7EJpatokal_73ec.html" title="User:Jpatokal">Jpatokal</a> 06:41, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><strike>I thought the whole point of having article names without long vowels is because English readers are much more familiar with them that way in most cases (people look for Tokyo, not Tōkyō). Since anime terms are more familiar with long vowels indicated, there doesn't seem to be any point in moving them for that reason. Long vowels are quite important in Japanese so I would object to not indicating them when there's no compelling reason for it. Consistent romanization is a concern, though. I personally prefer the "ou" style more than proper <a href="../../../h/e/p/Hepburn.html" title="Hepburn">Hepburn</a> "ō" because it's closer to the Japanese spelling and people won't turn around and ignore an extra letter when they use the term like they often do with accents. This kind of discussion probably belongs more on <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_for_Japan-related_articles_faf3.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style for Japan-related articles">Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_for_Japan-related_articles</a> though.</strike> <a href="../../../d/o/p/User%7EDopefishJustin_bbf5.html" title="User:DopefishJustin">DopefishJustin</a> 00:02, Apr 15, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem with "ou" is that, while it matches the kana, it doesn't make sense in English: most anime fans probably read "doujinshi" phonetically as dough-jin-she (or even dough-u-jin-she?), when it should be doh-jin-she. Most English-speakers aren't capable of making the distinction between short and long vowels anyway, so ignoring the macron is IMHO the lesser of two evils.</dd>

<p>After thinking about this more I've changed my mind, I think it's better that we follow a consistent standard. If people search with "ou" they'll get redirected anyway. I'll start changing minor stuff as I find it and if no one objects, the "big stuff" like shoujo should move too. <a href="../../../d/o/p/User%7EDopefishJustin_bbf5.html" title="User:DopefishJustin">DopefishJustin</a> 15:59, May 10, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Manga Artists under notable Names in Anime??</span></h2>
<p>Personally I think there should be a seprate entry for manga artist who had influence on anime so that artists such as Go Nagai, Rumiko Takahashi and Masamune Shirow (who people seem to constantly confuse with Mamoru Oshii) should be moved to a seprate category to reduce the common confusion that these artists have amongst anime fandom.</p>
<p>The artists that should be under anime that were also manga artists are Leiji Matsumoto for his large contributions to anime such as Starblazers etc., Osamu Tezuka, Katsuhiro Otomo, and Hayao Miyazaki. All others did little to no anime work with Shirow only co-directing one <a href="../../../o/v/a/OVA_586b.html" title="OVA">OVA</a> series</p>
<p>I deleted a comment that was basically unobjective shirow worshiping that didn't get any facts straight siting him as the creator of the Ghost in the Shell film, a film that he had very little to do with, and is much more a product of Mamoru Oshii's philsophies on storytelling than Shirows.</p>
<p>I was just curious what people thought of this idea??</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Manga sentence</span></h2>
<p>Currently: <i>Anime is influenced by the drawing style of manga, or Japanese comics.</i></p>
<p>I don't know, I don't like the wording of this particularly. I always thought, and was under the impression both anime and manga art styles influence each other, and also depends on the style of the artist as well. It is not always the case, I think, that mangaka are Japanese animators animating for an anime. In some cases, the character design is reflected upon the art style of the original mangaka... isn't it? Well, thing I have a problem with is that some anime is produce before the manga, and some manga is produced before the anime. Whatever the character design and art style is selected for whichever is produced first, it seems that becomes the basis for what influences the production of the next anime or manga series, or anime based on the manga, or manga based on the anime. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 12:46, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>implying that most criticizes low framerates and lack of "animation" is the critic's fault for not recognizing different animation styles is pov and apologetic.</p>
<p>Regarding the quality of animation to budget, see this link:<a href="http://homepage2.nifty.com/kannagi/A3.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://homepage2.nifty.com/kannagi/A3.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. There was also a more detailed article in AWN magazine that's about anime budgets, but the article is locked now and open to subscription only. Usually anime budget is a lot lower than american animation. Even some inconspicuous western series such as Sherlock Holmes in 22nd Century costs approximately a couple million US dollars per episode to produce, a lot higher than Japan production costs. But Sony specifically said they spent much more money to revive Astro Boy, and the animaton shows. Remember Miyazaki said in an interview that he quit TV animation in the early 80s because he couldn't muster enough budget to produce the quality animation he wanted. Hope this clarifies stuff up. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWareware_de22.html" title="User:Wareware">Wareware</a> 22:09, 24 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

I think there is some confusion in what I was getting at in my statments. I was refering to radical animators who used completely different shortcuts to achieve different effects than most anime. I think that while Astroboy and SAC are a lot more fluid in animation than most anime due to higher budgets, they still use many techniques that are common to anime (though far less than a standard tv show like Naruto). I wanted to show examples that deviated from the norm to illustrate that anime isn't entirely unified in its style (which is a very common misconception). I'm not so sure about the level of deviation from the norm in regards to Astroboy and SAC.</p>
<p>I need an expert to help me out on this, I based the information I recieved on comments from a friend who is an animator, as well as Benjamin Ettinger's excellent anime blog (anipages daily). I need to ask Ettinger to retool this entire article, he'd provide much more solid information than any of us could in regards to production and history of anime, not so much on "fandom." I think a big problem with anime is that knowledge is extremely scarce, and misinformation combined with fan oriented glorification and exaggeration seems to rule the day.</p>

<p>By the way, I am currently mid-copyedit. My goal is to cut down on some of the excess detail that tends to be generated by excessive enthusiasm. I know from my experience with Tolkien articles that when you are very close to the subject matter, it is very difficult to keep track of how much of the information present may be extraneous. This article, at the moment, is so long and complicated, with so many detailed notes and references, that it is not as effective as it could be at communicating the information it contains. If I cut out something that actually <i>was</i> crucially important, please let me know!
