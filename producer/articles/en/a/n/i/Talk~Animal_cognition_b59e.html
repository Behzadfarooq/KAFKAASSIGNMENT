<p>For the time being, I've removed the following passage:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Robert Yerkes proved in <i>The Mental Life of Monkeys and Apes</i> (1916) that monkeys and apes are capable of transfer their learning to new tasks (Sebeok, 1990)."</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is not clear what the point of including this is. Transfer of training is a very general phenomenon - any animal that can learn anything at all will transfer some kind of learning to some kind of new task. Offhand, I can't think of anything that Yerkes showed about transfer in his 1916 book that is still of distinctive significance now. If you want to put this back, please discuss it here first and explain why it matters - it may be a perfectly valid point that just needs some rephrasing. <a href="../../../s/e/g/User%7ESeglea_8627.html" title="User:Seglea">seglea</a> 01:33, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>To get over the 'original research' label on the 'Relative Intelligence' section a citation to Shettleworth's Cognition, Evolution and Behaviour' on the bit about different niches might be helpful. <a href="../../../d/b/r/User%7EDbrodbeck_fbe9.html" title="User:Dbrodbeck">dbrodbeck</a></p>
<p>Who are these 'many' that don't like the scientific approach? What journals do they publish in?

<p>This whole "widely believed to be the smartest bird or ape or whaterver" bit is getting out of control. First of all it is full of weasel words. Secondly, the study of animal cognition is not about ranking species. Read the book I mention above, or pick up a copy of JEP:Animal and find me somewhere where this is mentioned. <a href="../../../d/b/r/User%7EDbrodbeck_fbe9.html" title="User:Dbrodbeck">Dbrodbeck</a> 11:26, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It'd be interesting to see some studies. I concede that the research is too poorly conducted to say anything with authority. And though it mentions controversy over the relative intelligence of dogs and cats, at least it doesn't argue that either of them are "the smartest animals" (despite s few weasel words implying it.</dd>
<dd>From what I've heard from people who work with these various animals, (and from newspaper articles, which I tend not to trust on matters of science) the ranking seems more or less accurate. But the categories are so broad that it's difficult. Domestic dogs aren't as smart as wolves (selection for infantilism), and Neophemas cannot approach the African greys. Then there are individual species which rise above the pack. Every falconer I've met(all three) insists that Harris hawks are far smarter than other raptors, and human intelligence certainly exceeds that of Oranguatangs (though considering the state of the planet, some may dispute this). Since this is original research, and hearsay to boot, please don't add this to the article, these are just observations for what might be improved.</dd>
<dd>The one thing I will say for certain is that most of an owl's head is taken up by the eyes. And back to hearsay mode, at least one falconer I know makes a routine of insisting on their relatively low intelligence. They're certainly not up there with parrots, unless maybe you're talking something like cockatiels (cutest parrots there are, but also the dumbest, I swear).</dd>
<dd>Damn looking at this now I want to do some experiments on animal cognition myself. Might make a good <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hampshire_College_d744.html" title="Hampshire College">Div II Project</a>. Any rate, this is yet another article which has improved since I last saw it, though still in need of much work. A good sign that the idiots who write what they "know" may, <i>finally</i>, be starting to loose on Wikipedia. Keep this pattern up and I may come back and start editing again. ~Luke --71.192.117.127 21:21, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Intelligence or cognitive ability if you will, is proably modular (see Galistell's Organization of Learning for a nice primer). Asking if say, a rat shows similar intellgence to a human is like asking if humans can fly by flapping their arms. There are several nice treatments of such 'rankings' including Kamil (1987) and of course Shettleworth (1998, I think).<a href="../../../d/b/r/User%7EDbrodbeck_fbe9.html" title="User:Dbrodbeck">Dbrodbeck</a> 21:40, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This relative intelligence seciton is getting silly. Who cares what people think is the smartes species, or what the 'widespread belief' is? <a href="../../../d/b/r/User%7EDbrodbeck_fbe9.html" title="User:Dbrodbeck">Dbrodbeck</a> 00:17, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Funny, I study animal cognition and we NEVER bring up this stuff about 'well if they are intelligent we cannot eat them'.

<p>Oh sorry, I did not make that very clear now did I. Those of us that do research in animal cogntiion.

<dd>Dbrodbeck, you might want to do a little more reading in your field. Donald Griffin discusses this a bit in Chapter 13 of &lt;ital&gt;Animal Minds&lt;/ital&gt;, in the section "Ethical Significance." So does deWaal. 70.226.173.75 20:56, 15 January 2007 (UTC) (whoops, sorry for the missing sig. Rbogle 20:58, 15 January 2007 (UTC))</dd>

<p>the converse is true, however; animal cognition is almost ALWAYS brought up in arguments about vegetarianism, possibly because morality is as irrelevant to a study of intelligance.81.107.159.5 23:20, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It smells like pov, and has no citations. Anyway it is probably in the wrong place. <a href="../../../d/i/l/User%7EDiletante_77a9.html" title="User:Diletante">Diletante</a> 04:16, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The society agreement which is a typical ground for human moral says that we agree to protect good living conditions and fair treatment for all those who are like us, so for also the animals if they qualify by this standard.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/i/Talk%7EAnimal_cognition_b59e.html" title="Edit section: Animal testing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Animal testing</span></h2>
<p>A question: Has it been taken into account in the experiment arrangements that since the animals are at the mercy of humans they have to listen to subtle social cues very carefully compared to free adult humans? So their behaviour just has to be primarily social whether that is their nature or not.</p>
<p>Another question: From where and how to get an objective opinion about my rabbits being able to read some words? There is a film at www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv49w6IrQaI. I have now taught them the words left, right, in front, back, above and down. So it should be possible to train them to perform a labyrint guided by written words. I have already tried it once with a promising result and I will put the video to YouTube too, maybe today. My rabbits are otherwise untrained and somewhat uncooperative. They are interested in new tasks and not in repeating the same old tricks. Food rewards do not seem to work. One of my rabbits is bold and the other one too timid for labyrinth tasks.</p>

<dd>Two points, BF Skinner taught pigeons to 'read' ages ago. 2) this is not really a forum for discussing animal cog it is a place to talk about the article. <a href="../../../d/b/r/User%7EDbrodbeck_fbe9.html" title="User:Dbrodbeck">Dbrodbeck</a> 11:43, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks, but I didn't find that point about BF Skinner and reading pigeons from the Wikipedia, now even from under the header rumours about BF Skinner. And could you please include information about who and where are capable of testing animals' intelligence objectively.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are sources beyond WIkipedia. Try an intro psychology book, oh perhaps Glietman's text. Then perhaps look at Mike Domjan's Learning textbook, then W. A. Roberts' book 'Animal Cognition' or Sara Shettleworth's 'Cognition, Evolution and Behavior'. Like I said before, this is not really the appropriate place for discussing how to design experiments. <a href="../../../d/b/r/User%7EDbrodbeck_fbe9.html" title="User:Dbrodbeck">Dbrodbeck</a> 11:55, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
