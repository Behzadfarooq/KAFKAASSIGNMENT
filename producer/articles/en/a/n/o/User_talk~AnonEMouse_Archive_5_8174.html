<p>Hi there! My main concern is in regards to your wanting to use the admin buttons in an area in which you clearly have strong opinions and/or biases about. A smaller concern, ironically, is simply my own personal bias in regards to those who spend considerable time in your subject of interest, but I'm quite sure that I was able to look past that in my participation.

<p>... seems to be going tolerably well.&#160;:) I was glad to support, and not just because of your prior kind words to me and the barnstar. Several days left, so don't count your chickens (do mice get along with chickens?) and all that, but I anticipate you'll be a mouse with some new shiny buttons for your climbing wheel in about 6 1/2 days.</p>
<p>Just so it doesn't surprise you at some future date, though, I have serious reservations about the idea of featuring a porn bio, however well-written, on the main page. I understand completely, WP:NOT censored and no subject-matter limits to content, but the firestorm that would come down on the project from putting J.J. on the main page just doesn't seem worth it to me. I'm open to persuasion that I'm misguided on this, of course; but feel free to hold off on responding to this comment until the RfA is over if you like.

<dd>(Butts in)...Getting FA status doesn't mean that a page will automatically feature on the front page sometime in the future. Raul maintains a list of FAs that will never appear. As to whether that page (should it become a featured article) would be on that list...well, it's not my list, but that aside, there's no reason why a well-written informative item on any subject should be denied FA status. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 08:44, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for "butting in"; that's very helpful information (and I realized after hitting "save" that this might possibly be the case). I have <i>no</i> problem with this or any article's being featured <i>per se</i>; it was specifically the idea of having it automatically pop up on people's homepages at work, school, etc. that concerned me. It wouldn't offend me, but ... well, just close your eyes and imagine what "mainpage talk" would look like that day. But of course, now you have me curious; where can I find this "list of articles that are excellent enough to be featured, but will never grace the front page"? <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 11:08, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think Raul has it written on a piece of paper somewhere, so as not to cause a polemic over why such-and-such an article is on the list (or it may just be listed somewhere I don't know about).

<dd>/nodding/ Thanks. That reminds me of a few days ago, when there was a heated dispute over editing of the "Fuck (movie)" article that was the subject of a long threat on ANI.

<dd>Seppuku seems excessive, I think chopping of your tail and rubbing ashes in your belly-fur would be sufficient. I used "diatribe" in reference to the length of the comments, not their content, which is indeed intelligent and well-written. Some of the criticisms seem to revolve around the idea that, while you've done good work there is still more to do and therefore you shouldn't be an Admin. I wouldn't bother responding to that at all. However, a <i>brief</i> explanation regarding the situation with <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo.html" title="Jimbo">Jimbo</a> might be a good idea.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Commercial link" removal</span></h2>
<p>Hi AnonEMouse. I removed those links because they were all added by one user, all within the space of about a week, and all linking to one of two sites. You can look <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Luftballoons" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Luftballoons" rel="nofollow">here</a> for details. I have a hard time seeing how most of those articles should stay on Wikipedia, let alone the links I removed. Keeping in mind <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, if there is important information contained in those links it should be written into the article somehow. To me, the addition of the entire batch of those links by Luftballoons looked like nothing more than an attempt to boost his site's rankings on Google and other search engines. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotman1974_0598.html" title="User:Robotman1974">Robotman1974</a> 20:44, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Firstly, congratulations! Glad to see another admin on board! We need all the labor we can get.&#160;:D</p>
<p>Secondly, great questions on the ArbCom candidate statements. Thought provoking, and I have a feeling they may actually shake some of the candidates up a bit and make people take the election a bit more seriously. Thanks for that.</p>
<p>Third, I've updated a few of my answers on there to remove some "wiggle". In case it's occurred to you that I have a bit unusual an approach to my candidacy, just recall that my primary goal in all this is <i>not</i> to win myself a seat on ArbCom, it's to end up with the best ArbCom that we can get. This means we need as many good candidates as possible and we need the best of those to win the seats. If I end up being selected, of course I have no hesitation in performing the duties, though if five people better suited to the job are elected, then that's better for Wikipedia as a whole.</p>
<p>Again, congratulations on your successful RfA!

<p>While you may decide it's a direct reproduction, the image owner does not and has copyrighted the page. By not honoring the website publisher's view that the material is copyrighted, Wikipedia runs the risk of a lawsuit. Indeed, you could be quite wrong about "direct reproduction" in this specific case. What looks like a direct reproduction may well be a rather careful and painstaking restoration job. It's not something you can tell just by looking at the final product. What you can tell, though, is that the publisher has copyrighted the page, and that Wikipedia has chosen to ignore this. That's not a good risk. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 22:08, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm sure you'll make a good Wikipedia Admin.

I suddenly found myself on the other side; I was lumped in with the common vandals. It showed me that yes, it's pretty easy to make mistakes here. It showed me both our cases were similar: we both got in trouble for trying to improve Wikipedia, doing things that were against Wikipedia's policy while were were unaware.</p>

<p>I noticed you AC candidate review page. You seemed to interpret "not wanting to research something for minimal use" with "not wanting to research anything". You also said that one of the answers was confusing, yes, the complexity was the point; I was showing that the matter of deciding RfA policy what clearly out of the bounds of ArbCom as drifts into open ended legislating and that the role of Bcrats has not been well defined. While AC can decide on abuses ideally, effectively it will have a hard time as the role was never made clear by consensus, and AC can't just "figure out" the rules to "get consensus" either as it drifts into that same complexity as before. What would help is a community discussion on achieving consensus. I'd give you a simple answer if there was one. As for mispelling a word while I hammered out all these replies, I don't really know what to say about that.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b> 18:28, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand defending yourself before others if I were making a public attack on you. I'm just writing down my thoughts. You're welcome to read them, they're not private, but they're not intended as an argument to others (yet). Right now they're only really intended for me. Since I edit from different computers at different times, this is the most convenient place to store them, rather than as a text file on one computer. If you want to convince me to support, defending yourself isn't as useful as actually doing the work. Note that almost everyone else did the work.</dd>
<dd>I can put it as a follow-up question though. Why are you willing to do the research to track down a personal page that nothing links to, in the user space of one not particularly notable editor, out of thousands, but not to do the research to search through actual arbcom decisions that will be directly relevant to the job you're applying for, and to answer a question that you have been directly asked?</dd>
<dd>Also, I have to say, responding to a question that I asked of you with "minimal use" didn't imply a whole lot of respect for that question, and by extension, for the questioner. You are, of course, not required to give it, but if you want my vote, it helps. Meanwhile, most other candidates seem to have thought the question was reasonable and answer it; some even considered it quite useful. More that that, there are even other candidates treating actual blatant personal attacks on them, directly, in their questions with a reasonable amount of respect (see the questions pages for Nandesuka, Avraham, etc.). I value that ability to treat others with respect quite highly, and it seems that others do too. You may remember User:Phaedriel, who recently got the second highest number of supports for admin ever; that overwhelming support was mostly based on that ability to treat others well.</dd>
<dd>You're not being judged as an absolute here, almost all of the candidates for arbcom are fine editors, most are even fine administrators. I'm pretty sure I wrote that as well. However only 5 will get seats. So all are being judged in comparison to the others. Getting a "no" doesn't necessarily make you bad, just makes others better. If you want a "yes" from me, you don't just have to be good, you have to be better than some very impressive users. Note that I'm not running myself; I don't think I would be able to meet my own criteria yet&#160;:-) - but that doesn't mean I shouldn't differentiate between some excellent candidates as best I can, does it?</dd>

<dd>Every month or so I check the 2 pages of WLH of my user name, partly out of curiousity and to see if I am on any user lists, but also because I temporarily desysopped myself and wanted to see if I was listed anywhere based on that. Your userpage subpage was one of the ones that stood out. Anyway, some of the questions I got were more useful than others, and I am not "incorrect" or attacking or disrespecting anyone if I think that, just in disagreement.</dd>
<dd>As for the Stevertigo re-RfA, I wouln't call that a "nickpick" either, that was a half-backed solution to avoid figuring out the extend of the sysop power abuses and just dumping some sort of admin recall sort of idea on RfA. And it predictably turned out to a be a pile-on failure. At any rate, I am not going to look through every AC case just to find one, if I can, that I think is completely wrong (and there are none that I remember since I've been active on this site). Overall, ArbCom does a pretty good job more or less, so most of what I have to say would be nitpicks.</dd>
<dd>I'd rather do more productive things, such as work on the backlog at <a href="../../../p/p/_/WP%7EPP_1ffd.html" title="WP:PP">WP:PP</a> and <a href="../../../a/f/c/WP%7EAfC_e9d7.html" title="WP:AfC">WP:AfC</a> develop a MW patch. On ArbCom, whatever research is not already presented on the lengthy evidence page I'd be willing to look for because it would help decide the outcome of a case, which greatly affects the editors (often several) in question. I don't feel a need to "prove that I can do research" upon request as I already know I can. I am sorry if that comes of a not respectful, but thats just how I feel: I only do such things that serve enough purpose to be worth it, rather than distract me from other matters. I see what you are trying to get at though, what I would be willing to do is, if you gave me a specific pending case, give my thoughts on what policies are relevant and come up with some proposed remedies. That at least isolates things down to a less time consuming level, and one more accurate to ArbCom.</dd>
<dd>As for "mispelling", I was wondering how you would react to that&#160;:). That seems a tad too superficial IMO, I can't see why that would matter too much. I suppose I could download the Firefox toolbar. The main reason that I am running for AC is to give more options to voters and because its a task that I feel I could handle. In fact if 2 more candidates came up that I would support myself, then I'd drop out. I don't think I am being disrespectful to anyone, and your questions are not any less harsh than my harshist replies&#160;:). <b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b> 19:20, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

Even though I've been given <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrator_f252.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrator">the mop and flamethrower</a> since we last met, I won't do it myself (since an admin shouldn't block someone in an edit dispute with them, and also since I do think you do have good intentions), however I should warn you to be careful. I've looked over your edits, and they're not vandalism, but they're mostly on talk pages, and most of the messages on talk pages are rather argumentative. Don't do that. Wikipedia is not a message board, it's an encyclopedia.

I know,I dont mind it mentioned,but lets just remove the picture.We can still see how pretty she is on the other picture,but people doesnt need to see her naked.It is very offensive and is taking away the voters,especialy in Italia.We can leave the informations about,but no one will be hurt if the picture is removed.</p>
<p>It is like putting the picture of Berlu when he fainted.Those are just some thing that might be interesting to watch,but there are links for it,there is no need to put it in the front.</p>

<p>I saw you new message,congratulations for the promotion.I`ve been banned manu times,but it is just because I am trying to show them who are really Italias patriots and I dont wont Italia to got to the wrong hands again like it happend in April when people voted sinistra and now we are going to suffer for ages because of that.I also tryed to show them that it is not Serbs who are guilty for Balkans wars,but it were Muslims.I didnt even talk about Croats,but Muslims are guilty for Balkan wars and Muslims are flooding Italia and very soon there will problems like in France if they continue to come in.You cant evn go thrugh the street without seeing a Muslim anymore.My intentions indeed are good,because i want to explain it to them thta things cant get out of hand here like it happend in Balkans and in France.</p>
<p>When I tryed to explain how Muslims are guilty for what happend in France,I got blocked.I got blocked about 20 times,but since my last return I am trying to keep out of arguments because I realized that I can never explain it to people here when i keep getting blocked for telling the truth.</p>
<p>I would appriciate if you could think over about that picture and agree with me.</p>

<dd>Geez, that was stupid of me. I was in a bit of a rush, and was a little annoyed at people who think that IAR is a reasonable keep reason.

But, I stupidly jumped to "I'm right and your wrong" like I said I wouldn't. I should have stepped away for a couple minutes, and it's good someone actually asked me what I was doing. Although, while looking through transclusions of {{<a href="../../../m/y/s/Template%7EMyspace_e2c7.html" title="Template:Myspace">myspace</a>}} (how I found that), I did find some links to myspace that were blatent advertisments. So, I guess the right thing now is to ask for consensus of people, and not single-handidly do something like deleting all transclusions (unless of course it's a link to "the unofficial myspace fansite for _insertartisthere_" or "Bob's page" or a full page ad). -<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalguard11_b1fa.html" title="User:Royalguard11">Royalguard11</a><small>(<a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyalguard11_4f58.html" title="User talk:Royalguard11">Talk</a>·<a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyalguard11_Desk_a7bb.html" title="User talk:Royalguard11/Desk">Desk</a>·<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalguard11_ER_5b7b.html" title="User:Royalguard11/ER">Review Me!</a>)</small> 23:08, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

It makes for interesting reading but I don't know if it provides any further justification for not allowing unsourced names; the policy as it stands is in no way unclear; I tried to point out something along these exact lines on my talk page as a concrete example of why we couldn't include the alleged real name of the performer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It could be libelous, if the person whose real name is being discussed is NOT a famous porn star. Going around naming real people as porn stars is not a good thing. Without a real source, such "outings" should be regarded with great suspicion, as they could easily be malicious attempts to hurt some real person who is not a porn star.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 01:06, 8 November 2006 (UTC)"</p>

There had already been two removals of the name; the first, by someone else, included an edit summary that just said the legal name was being removed; however, when I removed it the first time my edit summary was "Therre is no source stated for his legal name; please don't restore it unless a verifiable source is listed".</p>
<p>When I discovered that it had been reinserted anyway, I placed the template and provided copious amounts of documentation on the article talk page. Did I jump the gun? (I know we're probably not talking about the usual sort of encounter one would have in these situations, by the way.) It occurred to me that perhaps I should have provided all the information on the talk page for a second reversion and held off on the template until a third. As you may have noticed, I get irritated with people who want to argue about incredibly clearly-stated policy. I don't think the template as it exists necessarily has the best wording in situations like this, but it's what's available. (However, when broken down, the wording of the template makes perfect sense—see my talk page.) Not that any of my attempts were effective (nor were they going to be), but again, hopefully this isn't the norm.</p>
<p>Finally, I don't know if you came across the link to the attorney in Chicago with the same name as the one causing so much recent controversy; fortunately, there was a picture of him on the webpage so no one could possibly think the two people were one and the same. (Sheesh, it's difficult to write "around" information, lol.)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Yasmine Bleeth mugshot again.</span></h2>
<p>I noticed you removed the mugshot from the page. I'm pretty sure we had reached a compromise, leaving a link to the image. Do we have to have the argument again? AnonEMouse (squeak) 17:04, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I agreed to a link to it, but are you aware that there was not a link - there was the actual image of her mugshot? With only one other image on the site - that of her as a child - it doesn't make any sense to me that that one picture should reflect her entire adult existence encompassing her grief over her mother's death, her parents' divorce, her shock and anxiety over 9/11 which happened in her hometown the day before the incident with the car and cocaine - especially since her father and half-brothers may have lived near the World Trade Center at that time, her career setbacks, her breakup with her fiancee, etc. She paid her dues re: the cocaine paraphernalia possession, and I don't think that wikipedia should continue to potentially impact negatively on her career in such a brazen way as to have ONLY her mug shot as a reflection of her adult life. She has been very open about her previous addiction and her mother's death and her breast cancer advocacy (especially since it can impact negatively on her career since she was known for her natural breasts), etc. Many other celebrities refused to discuss their arrest and drug addiction and family member's breast cancer diagnosis so I think that she should be given a break so that at the very least - ONLY a link to that sad, unfortunate picture should be on her wikipedia site. <a href="../../../b/c/s/User%7EBcsurvivor_08a1.html" title="User:Bcsurvivor">Bcsurvivor</a> 01:45, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, I remember our compromise to make it only a link, but you didn't do that, you just removed. That's why I wrote to ask if our compromise was still on.

<p>Since we both got sidetracked a bit, you had asked for commentary on <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenna_Jameson_fd39.html" title="Jenna Jameson">Jenna Jameson</a>. My one issue with it is the pseudo-bullet-pointedness of the prose from the "business" section down. I'm not sure if there's plans to expand it further or not, but it feels very stilted. I'm also unsure about the mainstream appearances section, I'd personally either keep it all there and eliminate the list or eliminate the prose and keep the list, not necessarily both. It's off to a pretty good start, though - I never thought I'd find her interesting. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 03:33, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks, that's basically what the other reviewers wrote. I'll add it to the review. However, I've noticed that it's a lot harder for me to actually put the reviewer comments into practice than it was for you - with Babb, I would write something, and you would do it, while with Jameson, it's taking many days for me to make better paragraphs out of the broken points. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 14:10, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
