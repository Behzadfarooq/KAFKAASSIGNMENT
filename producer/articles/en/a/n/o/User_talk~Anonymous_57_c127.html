Nor is just the allegation of a Wikipedia editor, thanks to <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">"no original research"</a>.

<dd>It's not controversial at all, except that people with "popups" (some sort of bot, I'm assuming) kept re-inserting the false material, presumably in the name of the War on Vandalism. If you questioned the reliability of the correction, try considering the reliability of the original version (in this case: inferior to the correction) before you revert to it.

Not much bot to it, just saves a couple clicks. We DO still read the edits, and as Bethling mentioned, the phrasing and the lack of a <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">proper citation</a> made it look like you were just adding personal commentary. And we are considering the reliability of BOTH versions, right here and now: if we were certain that the original version was correct, we'd just keep reverting your edits. However, we're not sure, and that's why we're trying to talk to you to help you make your edit look good. -- <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowlynk_6f44.html" title="User:Shadowlynk">Shadowlynk</a> 05:10, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please stop trying to tag everything you feel is improperly referenced with an (unref) tag. This behavior is far more disruptive than helpful, as several of the articles you are thus tagging are featured articles, so they have proven themselves reasonably well referenced already. Tagging entire sections is likely at best to be met with disapproval if not resistance from most seasoned editors. What I suggest you do instead is concentrate on a single article at a time, and for each section, indicate where you feel a citation is needed. And no, not every statement need to be backed up by a reference (just look into any other encyclopedia and you will see this is true). Referencing every sentence would just make the articles plainly unreadable.--<a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamdrake_04b4.html" title="User:Ramdrake">Ramdrake</a> 21:07, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You seem to have been applying these tags so aggressively that your behaviour lead to more experieinced editors complaining about your behaviour and blocking you temporarily. You should take that as an indication that your behaviour has been inappropriate on Wikipedia. I encourage you to use these tags judiciously, i.e., where they are most needed, and not question things like what the provinces of Canada are. This is something that you could easily verify and reference yourself if you think it is necessary, rather than trying to get other people to do it.
