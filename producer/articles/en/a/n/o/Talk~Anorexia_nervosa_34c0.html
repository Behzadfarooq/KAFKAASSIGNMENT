<p>Just wondering if there should be a source cited:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1) not many people carry so many BMI #'s in their head</dd>
<dd>2) most people just say "depression"; it's the same thing as "unipolar depression"</dd>
</dl>
<p>A different way to spot anorexia: soft, downy fuzz all over a sufferer's body. It's much finer hair than normal leg hair. It's a self-defense mechanism of the body (to try to preserve heat) when there is too little fat in the body.</p>
<p>There are MAJOR differences between anorexia nervosa, the diagnosable disorder, and "pro-ana", the lifestyle choice which refers to anorexia as a lifestyle rather than a disease. The former compells and controls the sufferer; the latter is a conscious choice which is self-regulated and typically the product of intelligent research and experimentation. Frequently, however, eating-disordered-anorexics will claim to be "pro-ana" as part of the defiance component of their psyche, and this causes serious confusion in society between the two. Make no mistake: genuine pro-anas are not eating disordered, and eating disordered persons BY DEFINITION cannot be pro-ana, because they are compelled by a disorder, not self-directed by their own volition.</p>
<p>The key to understanding the difference is, of course, VOLITION. The free agency of the will operating in the human mind makes all the difference in the world.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I was about to ask for a cite on there being two distinct groups, pro-anas who aren't sick and anorectics who are, but that can only lead to one of us sounding like <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Szasz_eb3d.html" title="Thomas Szasz">Thomas Szasz</a>, of which good cannot come. I'll just say that its very difficult to determine if another person isn't eating due to mental illness or a lifestyle choice that looks identical to it. Or, for that matter, just not being very hungry. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalieber_db73.html" title="User:Calieber">Calieber</a> 20:31, Oct 27, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>I heared that the decline of metabolism is one of symptoms of anorexia nervosa, but the article seems ignoring it at all. Does anyone know about this? -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 04:52 11 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I believe it's related to poor nutrition/starvation, but I don't know enough about that area to add it. It's more a matter that there is alot of information about Anorexia, and that the article does not contain everything, rather than ignoring things. Some areas of Wikipedia aren't very useful because there are too few contributers who have knowledge in that field&#160;:]</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>Should pro-anorexia websites be discussed here? I think there should be some discussion of this disturbing phenomenon, if not here then in its own article. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C. Boyer">Daniel C. Boyer</a> 20:43 24 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it should have its own article</dd>
</dl>
<p>- important to know however that "pro-ana websites" are not websites that encourage, recruit, proliferate etc anorexia. the term "pro-ana" is misleading.</p>

<p><b>Anoretic</b> was not listed in my dictionaries and Google gives 708 hits. So I changed it into <b>anorectic</b> (in dictionaries, and 13.600 Google hits). <a href="../../../g/u/a/User%7EGuaka_3e6a.html" title="User:Guaka">Guaka</a> 15:41, 23 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(trojjer, NSI — 2006/4/22 07:46 <a href="../../../b/s/t/BST_ae82.html" title="BST">BST</a>) What's going on – I always thought that <i>anorexic</i> was the correct adjective (and colloquial noun) to use. It's certainly the most <a href="http://googlefight.com/index.php?lang=en_GB&amp;word1=Anorexic&amp;word2=Anorectic" class="external text" title="http://googlefight.com/index.php?lang=en_GB&amp;word1=Anorexic&amp;word2=Anorectic" rel="nofollow">commonplace</a> term amidst Google's index... Is there some Greek grammatical clause that I'm overlooking, that changes the "x" into a "ct"? Sounds pretty feasible – although, despite the fact that I try to uphold <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_English_ebb4.html" title="British English">British English</a> and, similarly, its classical roots, ahem, <i>anorexic</i> is easier on the tongue. And it's already become so ingrained in media.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>anorexic is the adjective. anoretic is the noun, e.g. an anoretic is right, an anorexic isn't. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELouiseCooke_c320.html" title="User:LouiseCooke">LouiseCooke</a></dd>

<p>In the Risks section, it states</p>
<p>"95% of anorexia nervosa sufferers are females"</p>
<p>Two paragraphs later, there is the statement</p>
<p>"Twenty years ago it was thought that for every 10-15 women with anorexia or bulimia, there was one man. Today researchers find that for every four females with anorexia, there is one male, and for every 8-11 females with bulimia, there is one male."</p>
<p>These are incompatible. I have no expert knowledge of anorexia - I want to find out about it from the Wikipedia. Maybe somebody with some competence in this area can reconcile the two statements?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. I was very surprised to see the radical statement '95% of anorexia nervosa sufferers are females'. I call it a radical statement, because where does it come from? To which countries does it apply? I'm from Spain, and here 4 out of 10 patients (of anorexia nervosa, of course) are men. And I don't think that's an odd number here in Europe. Tomorrow I'll be taking a seminar on the Treatment of anorexia nervosa (that's why I was hanging out here -I'm starting work at a hospital next week and this is the kind of disorder I'll most frequently see, I've been told), and if I get some recent world epidemology figures I'll put them up here. Maria, March 2nd 2006.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, this is what I found. The female-male ratio of Anorexia Nervosa is about 9-10:1, as almost all epidemiological studies state that almost 90% of patients affected by an eating disorder are women, and only about 3-10% would be men. This is from a U.S study by Gambill, 1998. I couldn't get any other recent international results, so perhaps the article should mention that too. Maria, 5 March 2006</dd>

<hr />
<p>I find this arbitrary distinction between anorexic nervosa sufferers and "pro-ANA" types to be ridiculous as a practicing clinician who treats those with this disorder. Most anorexics are choosing to starve. In some cases it can be argued that their fear of being fat is so overwhelming that it restricts their ability to eat normally. However, many anorexics manage to gravitate to "pro-ana" sites to reinforce their starvation behavior. In response to some of the questions above, there was a famous study on starvation done with conscientious objectors during World War II that found that depression was a concomitant of starvation (see Garner Handbook of Eating Disorders). There were also a lot of personality changes such as withdrawal, obsession with thinking about food, changes in eating habits, hoarding behavior that can be connected to the fact that a person is starving. In response to another statement, the percentage of men with eating disorders has been skyrocketing as we become more sedentary a society. It used to be that men would excessively exercise, now dieting is more acceptable for men. There are clearcut cultural factors in the promotion of anorexia nervosa. Prior to Twiggy coming to the United States, anorexia was so rare that each case merited a journal article. After Twiggy, the disorder became incredibly commonplace. We changed the definition of a sexy woman from an hourglass (e.g., Marilyn Monroe) to a tube (e.g. Twiggy) (Again, check out Garner) Finally, most practicing clinicians ignore the loss of period requirements in diagnosing males as it is not relevant.

<p>I have the following critisms of this article and I can work on it over the next few days unless there disagreement ...</p>
<p>(1) Some anorexics know they are overweight, but are still unable to put on weight (or perhaps they are not AN sufferer, but an atypcial ED? .. this is open for debate)</p>
<p>(2) The last paragraph on treatment is the experiance in the US ... in the UK practice is different, with more outpatient treatment.</p>
<p>(3) I feel the 'interacting with sufferers' should be expanded ... to bring up issues like codependency and boundaries etc... 'unconditional love and empathy' without boundaries to guide the sufferer would not help.</p>
<p>--193.132.127.68 16:43, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Go ahead, I don't think your criticisms are unfounded. Interacting with sufferers (be careful, "sufferer" is a loaded term) is unlikely to be of much benefit.

<p>Not really. Dorland's medical dictionary defines anorexia as a lack of appetite for food. In the practice of medicine anorexia can be caused by any number of diseases such as Tuberculosis, cancer of all types, over active thyroid disease. The suffix 'nervosa' indicates, correctly, a psychological or psychiatric cause.

I have a problem with the folowing "However, while very emaciated women will never menstruate ". I think at the very least a 'most' should be inserted if that line isn't delated all together. I don't know what the person who wrote that defines very emaciated to be but I know some women continue to menstruate with bmi's in the 11-12 range without taking hormones and if someone's below that weight amenorrhea is the least of their problems.</p>

<p>I added "in this article, anorexia will be used synonymously with anorexia nervosa" to the top paragraph, since that is the case. The other alternative would be to change each instance of "anorexia" to "anorexia nervosa", but I think it might be good to reflect the fact that the terms are used synonymously in common language. Thoughts? /<a href="../../../s/k/a/User%7ESkagedal_c3c6.html" title="User:Skagedal">Skagedal</a> 12:19, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>NOT just that, but also for brevity's (and its sibling ease of reading's) sake. I changed the article to reflect this. Remember each time you use "anorexia nervosa" when you could be using "anorexia", you are wasting 9 bytes of data.</p>

<p>Hi there, this is my first time posting, so I apologize if I mis-format this blurb. Someone vandalized the phrase "in this article, anorexia will be used synonymously with anorexia nervosa" by replacing the first "anorexia" with "anal leakage." I switched it back to anorexia. Just wanted to let people know, in case any one was wondering why my IP was changing things. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.57.20.92 (<a href="../../../7/2/2E/User_talk%7E72.57.20.92.html" title="User talk:72.57.20.92">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.57.20.92_4d10.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.57.20.92">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>I'm quite sceptic about the existance of this list. There is a great risk that people will be added just because it has been speculated in the press that they might be anorectic, or maybe just because some Wikipedian thinks they're thin. I think that at the very least, if a person is to be in this list, his or her disorder should be mentioned and discussed in that persons article.

<dd>We went through this discussion on <a href="../../../p/n/e/Talk%7EPneumonia_d385.html" title="Talk:Pneumonia">Talk:Pneumonia</a>. I think anorexia is a bit more sensitive than pneumonia; listing someone here would amount to defamation if the claim was untrue, speculative, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a> etc. Only those people who are publically <i>well known</i> (e.g. Karen Carpeter) should be listed here. In my personal view, people should only be listed here if they made lasting changes to the public perception of anorexia. This is fairly exclusionist, but keeps out all the dross and speculation. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 20:53, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My feeling is that this type of content decreases not only the quality, but the credibility of Wikipedia. A recent survey fo content showed that Wikipedia was statistically and demonstrably as accurate as the Encyclopedia Brittanica. If I wanted to know who was indicated to have suffered from anorexia nervosa, I would look on Page 3 of the Star or Page 6 of the Post...not the Encyclopedia Brittanica, and therefore, by association, not Wikipedia.</dd>

<p>The DSM-IV criterium that requires <a href="../../../a/m/e/Amenhorrea.html" title="Amenhorrea">amenhorrea</a> specifies "<b>in postmenarcheal females</b>".

<p>I don't see myself as fat, I just hate eating! I am 5'4" and weigh 98 pounds on a good day. It's not that I don't want to gain weight, I just don't want to eat to do it. This has gone on since I was about 13 years old and I am in my 40's now. I have mastered the art of hiding my eating habbits and I can make a full plate look half empty without having to take a bite. If I force myself to eat, I automaticly gag (no control). This is not something I have time for, nor the money to deal with it. My husband would throw a fit, and my children would see nothing but a bad example. How do you know?</p>
<p>confused.</p>

<dd>I would certainly not ask a bunch of strangers on Wikipedia. The fact that you have posted here seems to suggest that you are somehow intrigued or worried about it. Your first port of call should still be your family physician; as the consequences of <i>bona fide</i> anorexia are quite significant, I think time and money are only relative. Your weight means little; steadily losing weight would be worrisome. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 23:41, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree: go see your family physician. it's hard to make a diagnosis based on a short account like that, but to me it sounds more like some sort of maladaptive eating behaviour (food aversion, globus hystericus, functional dysphagia,FAED,...), maybe even coeliac disease, or some other organic disorder. get a thorough check-up, that's my advice. a correct diagnosis &amp; treatment might seriously improve your quality of life. <a href="../../../a/r/h/User%7EArhielanto_ce7a.html" title="User:Arhielanto">Arhielanto</a> 00:38, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry, I'm a bit new to Wikipedia, but I believe that I must post a link here before adding it to the main page.</p>
<p>My link is Somerset &amp; Wessex Eating Disorders Association, I design and manage the site on a volunteer basis (being a recovered sufferer from anorexia and bulimia myself).</p>
<p>Although we are a rather localised charity I would hope that the information provided by the site would be useful to a much wider audience.</p>
<p>Our site address is <a href="http://www.swedauk.org" class="external text" title="http://www.swedauk.org" rel="nofollow">www.swedauk.org</a></p>
<p>I appreciate that others may remove the listing if they don't feel that it's appropriate to be included here but I thought that I'd post in up just in case and have also done so in a few other eating disorder related articles.</p>
<p>I hope that this is ok. Feel free to email me if there's a problem (contact details are on the website).</p>

<p>my BMI is 35, and i eat under 1500 calories a day, also i'm sedentary, the calorie calculators say that i need 2318 calories a day,and still i'm obeise, and i still don't loose weight, can i gain this problem????</p>
<p>1. No. But you need at least 1200 for your system to work correctly. 2. BMI is not nonsense, as it is used to accurately calculate an anorexics development 3. See a physician, as this is not the proper forum for this type of question.</p>

<dd>Ooookay, while I agree this person should see a physician or get some psychological help, I really think you (Mjformica) shouldn't go around saying BMI is nonsense. It's not. It's an indicator, that's all. Perfectly validated and widely used. The problem arises when people want to make a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, for example, based only on BMI. That's what is wrong, and what is sheer nonsense. Maria, March 2nd 2006.</dd>

<dd>Maria...my comment was harsh, as is my wont. My apologies, I'm working on it. I have a HUGE problem with BMI because it does not take into account muscle mass, only body mass. I am 5'6". I weigh 180 lbs. Despite a healthy 16% body fat, I look like I weigh about 145 because I am a serious athlete, and muscle is more dense than fat. According to the BMI index (that's redundant), I am morbidly obese. As a medical professional, see my concern? --<a href="../../../m/j/f/User%7EMjformica_ed24.html" title="User:Mjformica">Mjformica</a> 14:29, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi again Mjformica. Listen, I just calculated your BMI, and from my results you belong to the 'normal' category. Maybe you made some sort of mistake calculating it? I used metres and kg instead of the US standard scale units you gave me, because as far as I know they are the ones the World Health Organisation use. I've rechecked it twice (with the help of the conversion tables at <a href="http://convert.french-property.co.uk/index.htm" class="external free" title="http://convert.french-property.co.uk/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://convert.french-property.co.uk/index.htm</a>), and I get 23.91 as your BMI.

<dd>I agree, of course BMI in itself is nonsense. But then a good physician doesn't look at his patient's BMI and says "you're fat. lost some weight"; he looks at BMI, hip/waist ratio, Blood pressure, blood tests (for LDL, HDL, TG, glycemia, liver function), take anamnesis, and only then decides whether or not the patient has a weight-related problem (metabolic, orthopedic, and/or psychological) requiring treatment. The essence is the Clinical aspect, not the statistical (the same goes for anorexia, and medicine in general really). I agree we need a more nuanced depiction of the issue in the news and media, but saying "BMI is nonsense" is just as oversimplified as the current BMI-obsession.</dd>
<dd>There's the simple fact that a substantial portion of the western population are sedentary fastfood consumers wíth a high BMI, and a high(er) risk of developing cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, lower life expectancy &amp; QOL,... BMI being redundant will change little about that. Ironically, getting these people's BMI down should not be a concern, getting them to excercise and eat healthier (not less) should. So basically, yes, i agree with you, just not with your wont. <a href="../../../a/r/h/User%7EArhielanto_ce7a.html" title="User:Arhielanto">Arhielanto</a> 00:38, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BMI is the crudest possible measurement of excess weight. It measures height and weight only. It is linear mass density in different units. People have a range of skeletal builds, muscular masses, etc... BMI attempts to infer information about the contents of a person's body by measuring the outside, for which there is <i>some</i> correlation. I'm technically 20lbs overweight by BMI, which is funny because this fact always surprises pretty much anyone who has ever seen me.--<a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELoodog_7c34.html" title="User:Loodog">Loodog</a> 03:37, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>More than anything else, the statistical claims about rates of anorexia, death rates, ethnic and cultural associations and assertions of associations with other psychiatric and physical orders require citations from reputable sources. It's one thing to say that 95% of people with anorexia are female and another to be able to back the claim up.</p>
<p>Some more time might also be given to the changing rates of anorexia nervosa within different ethnic groups, but that's just my opinion.</p>
<p>I agree, the stats probably do need to be re-checked somewhere <a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHandmedown_7093.html" title="User:Handmedown">Handmedown</a></p>
<p>BMI is should never be dismissed seeing as almost all treatments of eating disoreders require the constant calculation of the clients BMI.</p>

<p>Anorexia plagues men as well, but this is a predominantly female affliction to the tune of about 90%. This disease is both a result of, and protest against, a culture that imposes unreasonable standards of thinness upon its female subjects. In regards to the claims that refute the importance of feminism, I encourage the following reads:</p>
<p>Feminist Perspectives on Eating Disorders, ed Fallon The Beauty Myth, Naomi Woolf Backlash, Susan Faludi Fat is a Feminist Issue Appetites, Caroline Knapp</p>
<p>Caroline Knapp, herself a former Anorexia sufferer, writes that "Anorexia is a response to cultural images of the female body--waif-like, angular--that both capitulates to the ideal and mocks it, strips away all the ancillary signs of sexuality..." and continues by explaining that "It's about the anxiety that crops up alongside new, untested freedoms, and the guilt that's aroused when a woman tests old and deeply entrenched rules about gender and femininity. It's about the collision between self and culture, female desire unleashed in a world that's still deeply ambivalent about female power and that manages to whet appetite and shame it in equal measure. It's about the difficulty a woman may have feeling connected to her own body and her own desires in an increasingly visual and commercial world, a place where the female form is so mercilessly externalized and where conceptions of female desire are so narrowly framed. And it's about the durability of traditional psychic and social structures, about how the seeds of self denial are still planted and encouraged in girls, about how forty years of legal and social change have not yet nurtured a truly alternative hybrid, one that would flower into feelings of agency and initiative, into the conviction that one's appetites are good and valid and deserve to be satisfied..."</p>
<p>According to Naomi Woolf, "Dieting and thinness began to be female preoccupations when western women received the vote around 1920; between 1918 and 1925, the rapidity with which the new, linear form replaced the more curvaceous one is startling." Knapp concurs, stating that incidents of eating disorders have increased by 36 percent every five years since the 1950's. Eating disorders have occurred more and more frequently since the beginning of woman's liberation movements; have occurred alongside these movements. The female body is the space upon which a culture contests its conflicting value systems.</p>
<p>Clearly, Anorexia is a feminist issue. The average model weights 23% less than the average woman. Women in this society have to lose an average estimate of 23% of their body fat to be considered comparable to media images. Furthermore, women are confronted by a 33 billion dollar beauty industry, targeting the insecurities of a female demographic. An unhealthy and unreasonable standard has been created to harness women's new purchasing power, in a society which still priviledges the female body over the accomplishments of the mind.</p>

<p>I've edited the previous text from the presentation section (previous text below) so it reflects features reported in the clinical / scientific literature (see references in new section). Several of the examples given seemed anecdotal and not generally given as common features, although they certainly may be true of some people with anorexia.</p>
<p>Also, some of the text was based on links to newspaper stories, blatantly seemed like a drug or doctor advert (Drs. Jose Yaryura-Tobias and Fugen Neziroglu / Anafranil) or was focused too much on results from single studies.</p>
<p>Hence I've chopped it down and based it on reviews of the anorexia literature which should provide a more representative description.</p>

<hr />
<p>The primary physiological characteristics of anorexia nervosa are:</p>
<ul>
<li>voluntary starvation</li>
<li>exercise stress</li>
<li><a href="../../../o/b/s/Obsessive-compulsive.html" title="Obsessive-compulsive">obsessive-compulsive</a> behaviors relating to food, food consumption, or physical activity</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these are not diagnostic criteria but are instead characteristics associated with many or most individuals with anorexia nervosa. In addition to the intentional starvation almost always associated with anorexia nervosa, some subjects will also take part in a high level of physical activity.</p>
<p>Anorexia nervosa has a negative impact on the <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immune_system.html" title="Immune system">immune system</a> and the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Nervous_System_be63.html" title="Central Nervous System">central nervous system</a> (CNS). It is also thought to be linked to <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serotonin.html" title="Serotonin">serotonin</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/p/Dopamine.html" title="Dopamine">dopamine</a> abnormalities.</p>
<p>Many anorectics are diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive behavior at some point in their lives. Some have an eating-disordered <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parent.html" title="Parent">parent</a>, demonstrating a possible genetic link with the disorder. Drs. Jose Yaryura-Tobias and Fugen Neziroglu have demonstrated by their pioneering work in getting FDA approval for American use of the drug Anafranil that obsessive-compulsive aspects of the disease can be alleviated by that drug, generically known as clomipramine. Total cessation of all anorexic disease was reported in one patient in as short as one hour after administration of Anafranil in clinical trials in Manhasset, NY in February 1979. After a one year course of treatment with Anafranil, this patient has lived a normal life except for occasional visual hallucinations caused by underlying paranoid schizophrenia.</p>
<p>In a long-term set of studies done by Wentz Nilsson, Gillberg, Gillberg, and Råstam on fifty-one adolescents with anorexia nervosa, eighteen percent of subjects were consistently diagnosed with some type of autism-like disorder at onset and at five- and ten-year follow-ups <a href="http://www.jaacap.com/pt/re/jaacap/abstract.00004583-199911000-00013.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jaacap.com/pt/re/jaacap/abstract.00004583-199911000-00013.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Researchers Christopher Gillberg and Carina Gillberg have noted that a "small but important minority" of young women with anorexia nervosa may be suffering from undetected and underlying autistic disorders. <a href="http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=702&amp;id=713402005" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=702&amp;id=713402005" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>Anorexic subjects will often go through a cycle of recovery and relapse, unless weight is restored long-term.</p>

Currently, the DSM-IV lists <a href="../../../a/m/e/Amenorrhea.html" title="Amenorrhea">amenorrhea</a> as a required characteristic of diagnosis, as it nearly always accompanies anorexia nervosa in females. However, while many emaciated women will never menstruate (unless they use a form of hormonal-replacement therapy), some women cease to have their menses before appreciable weight has been lost. Conversely, a small percentage of women reach weights that are quite low and still manage to menstruate regularly. Further, the eating disorders work group of the DSM is attempting to have the amenorrhea requirement removed as it makes diagnosis in males problematic. Researchers have often pointed to lack of sexual potency in males as the equivalent of female amenorrhea, but there continues to be a lack of consensus regarding this criterion.</li>

<p>I added information late 2005, regarding Christopher Gillberg's observations that autism spectrum disorders (ASD's) are common in adolescent onset AN and are a sub-group that are particularly difficult to treat. The information was removed. I would like to see that information reinstated. If not, I would like to know why ASD's should not be included in the AN article. I can provide journal references if required. The occurrence of narrow focused obsessions are an integral element of ASD's; an aspect of behaviour that could cause some with an ASD to obsesses about body image and food.</p>

<dd>Hi there, the scientific article cited to support the 'highest mortality claim' is more recent than the <i>Cecil Essentials of Medicine</i> 5th Edition book, which was published in 2000. The Birmingham et al. (2005) study from which this claim is taken is from contains the most recent and thorough review that seems to exist on this matter and estimates the mortality to be 10%. This Wikipedia article is better based on the most recent scientific evidence from a peer-reviewed journal than a general medical textbook. Hence, I'll restore the original version. However, if you can find any more recent evidence that disputes this, please add it to the article. - <a href="../../../v/a/u/User%7EVaughan_120e.html" title="User:Vaughan">Vaughan</a> 15:21, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Important note:</b> When I was writing this comment, I looked at the history that someone removed the tag I put in the lead section. In the edit summary (s)he said that <i>Remove {{{fact}}} tag from initial summary. This is referenced later in the article (see Prognosis section).

<p>The lead should be capable of standing alone as a concise overview of the article, should be written in a clear and accessible style, should be carefully sourced like the rest of the text, and should encourage the reader to read more.</p>

<p>Multiple citation to the same source is not prohibited and it is even suggested. I am going to put the tag again and please put its reference, not just removing the tag.</p>

<dd>Hi there,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The introduction is a summary of the article. If it was referenced, it would contain <i>all</i> the references from the main article, because it is a summary of those references. This would make it virtually unreadable. It would also be pointless just picking out certain facts to be referenced here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This style is typically not used in academic work, and does not detract from the quality of the article as this information is fully referenced further down. Requiring a single fact to be referenced in the summary is splitting hairs when it is present in the more detailed discussion below.</dd>

<p>Hi all, I noticed that under the list of the signs and symptoms of anorexia, the psychological symptoms are separated from the emotional ones.

<p>69.30.182.166 05:09, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's in the high schools. Social pressure is very high, especially upon adolescent women to look a certain way. Not by men, but by other women of the same age. Social life is cruel for teens.</p>
<p>This not only applies to women, boys my age who don't look a certain way (eg; looking or being underweight) are frequently accused of being anorexic. Anorexia is used frequently as a derogatory term, thus increasing pressure</p>

<p>The "Presentation:Emotional" section here includes a lot of claims that aren't well substantiated (studies show men prefer curves? Which ones?). Additionally, the line "Arguably, by relentlessly obligating women to have very thin bodies, society helps to dominate and control women, by keeping them off-balance psychologically" should probably be changed to say "Some feminist writers argue that, by relentlessly ..." or something to that effect. And finally, the section also seems to suggest that anorexia only has roots in the desire to be physically attractive, which, by my understanding, is not always the case. --<a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoultaco_1629.html" title="User:Soultaco">Soultaco</a> 23:21, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is highly biased and disregards the male aspect of the eating disorder. and for those of you fighting for it to stay so you're doing your cause a disservice as it only makes others think it's a 'chicks' problem. an eating disorder especially one as prominent as Anorexia, or anorexia nervosa, should be discussed in a subjective manner. or at the very least incorporate a good amount of the male perspective. i must also add that the idea that female eating disorders take a greater precedent than male eating disorders is just sad. it is a psychological illness which while affecting the female population at a greater rate it still has an affect on males. in fact i read no mention of any affect on men at all. i'm amazed that rather than try to create a common bond between the sexes there are those that would rather widen the gap and claim, an eating disorder no less, as just their own. and as far as i know eating disorders like anorexia are more a backlash of loss of control and self imagery than the 'male' media force.

<dd>I completely fail to see how the article "disregards the male aspect". The article uses gender-neutral terminology, for the most part. --216.162.217.131 19:52, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It doesn't mention the male aspect period. Even though it supposedly uses gender-neutral language, it mentions it as a female related problem and fails to acknowledge the fact that it can affect males.</p>
<dl>
<dd>First off, the article says it "primarily affects young adolescent girls in the Western world", which is backed by studies. It also cites research indicating that 90% of anorexia victims are female (which implicitly also acknowledges that about 10% are male, BTW). Given these stats, it's not altogether inapproprate to focus somewhat more on the causes of anorexia amongst females. Second, I encourage you to please present some particular quote which is dismissive of male anorexia; the fact that some of the text refers more to anorexia amongst females doesn't mean that male anorexia is being ignored, particularly given the demographics mentioned. And if you think there's something relevant to add to the article about male anorexia - well, go right ahead. --<a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoultaco_1629.html" title="User:Soultaco">Soultaco</a> 19:11, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
