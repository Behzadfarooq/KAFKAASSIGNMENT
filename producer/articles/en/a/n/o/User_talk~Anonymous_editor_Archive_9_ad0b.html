<p>The following argument is taken from the following website (<a href="http://www.themodernreligion.com/comparative/christ/bible_meaningtomuslims.html" class="external free" title="http://www.themodernreligion.com/comparative/christ/bible_meaningtomuslims.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.themodernreligion.com/comparative/christ/bible_meaningtomuslims.html</a>). It explains my edit.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The Muslim used to have probably a very different attitude about the gospels than he does today. I’m just speaking of the majority or large segments of the community who use to feel much differently than large segments of the community feel today. And most of the blame for that I suppose could be placed on one hand on the Muslim and on the other hand on some of the Christian community and how it was they present the gospel. So I have to talk a little bit about that, I am trying to clear the air both for the Muslim and the Christian, and the interested bystander.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You see the Quran commands the Muslim to show respect for the books of other people, their religious scriptures. That commandment was abused by certain, I stress just certain, missionary efforts. By taking these verses that relate to the respect for scripture out of their context, and quoting them back to the Muslims saying, "Look, your book says my book is true. So read my book and then you’ll be in trouble because you’ll find out that my book is different than your book." And I’m afraid than that the blame must be shifted over to the Muslim who very often never thought about that before but thought that made a lot of sense, and he was letting someone else tell him what his own book said. So it was that before too long when the missionary would on the one hand say your book says you should listen carefully to my book now let me read you my book, the Muslim tended to think that it must be that your book is full of lies.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Even if the Quran says respect the books of other people, it must be that some people have put some lies in there, because I don’t go along with that thing you’re reading. He looked back into the Quran to try to find some verses to justify the position that the Christian changed his scriptures and put some lies in there. And that just made it worse because now the missionary said, "You’re really off your book because on one hand it says believe in our book and on the other hand it says we changed our book. "The problem being that the Quran doesn’t say any such thing of the kind, and these arguments that were first brought forward about 200 years ago are reprinted every year by certain missionary groups. The arguments are old and tired and quite insufficient."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>THE QURAN’S THREE ACCUSATIONS</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What the Quran really criticizes is not anybody else’s books. It never mentions the Bible, but as a matter of fact neither does the bible, that is just a nickname for a collection of books. What it talks about are scriptures and what it criticizes is the way that some, I stress some people, use their scriptures. It criticizes the handling of whatever people call scripture. It endorses the fact that the truth has been preserved by people, that they have in their scriptures the truth, but they mishandle it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It makes basically three accusations which probably you could go to any church and the pastor will say those things are true of those people over there.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(I) The Quran says some of the Jews and Christians pass over much of what is in their scriptures.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(II) Some of them have changed the words, and this is the one that is misused by Muslims very often giving the impression that once there was a true bible and then somebody hid that one away, then they published a false one. The Quran doesn’t say that. What it criticizes is that people who have the proper words in front of them, but they don’t deliver that up to people. They mistranslate it, or misrepresent it, or they add to the meaning of it. They put a different slant on it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(III) And the third accusation is that some people falsely attribute to God what is really written by men.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now probably in any church there will be people who will say, "Yes, I know a church that does all those three things. They pass over much of what is in their scripture, they‘ve changed things, they put the wrong slant on the words, and they’ve credited God with things that men said. "So really there is not a cause for a problem between the Christian and the Muslim on these charges, the Christian, I would like to think, would generally go along with those ideas."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think based on this text, my edit to the article was justified. Thanks --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 02:06, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Would you please let me know your opinion about my edits? The reason that I think my edits were important is that Many fundamentalist Christians and Jews find the statement that Bible has been changed offensive in the first place. Of course saying that at least some parts of the Bible have been changed is defensible (e.g. book of Esther) though some people may not like it. But I think it would be illogical to ask Christian and Jews to not to use their book in their judgments. The Quran states:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"It was We who revealed the law (to Moses): therein was guidance and light. By its standard have been judged the Jews, by the prophets who bowed to God's will, by the rabbis and the doctors of law: for to them was entrusted the protection of God's book, and they were witnesses thereto: therefore fear not men, but fear me, and sell not my signs for a miserable price. If any do fail to judge by (the light of) what God hath revealed, they are (no better than) Unbelievers. "(Quran 5:45)</dd>
<dd>"Let the people of the Gospel judge by what God hath revealed therein. If any do fail to judge by (the light of) what God hath revealed, they are (no better than) those who rebel." (5:48)</dd>
<dd>"To thee We sent the Scripture in truth, confirming the scripture that came before it, and guarding it in safety: so judge between them by what God hath revealed, and follow not their vain desires, diverging from the Truth that hath come to thee. To each among you have we prescribed a law and an open way. If God had so willed, He would have made you a single people, but (His plan is) to test you in what He hath given you: so strive as in a race in all virtues. The goal of you all is to God. it is He that will show you the truth of the matters in which ye dispute;"(5:49)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Your sentence that "Quran wants Jews and Christians to judge by and stand fast to what were their original scriptures (e.g. 5:45-49) " could be improved I think(since Jews and Christians don't have access to the original manuscripts, Quran can not ask them to hold fast to their original scriptures). Thanks --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 06:59, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hi Anonymous editor, I completely agree with you point. But there are some Muslims like me who do not believe so. Of course, Qur'an asks People of the book to believe in Qur'an. But there is no verse in the Qur'an saying that you should believe so, because your scripture is corrupted. On the other hand, Muhammad(pbuh) says that since your scripture says something about me and since I pass the criteria of being a prophet, you must believe in me (<i>because your scripture says so</i>). The idea that the Bible has been corrupted is brought up to explain the differences between the Qur'an and the Bible. Most of the differences are historical differences which I don't care (e.g. Noah's son died in the flood or not; I don't care)</p>
<p>What the Qur'an asks People of the Book is "O People of the Book, <i>commit no excesses</i> in your religion".</p>
<p>The Qur'an doesn't say these Christians are doing sin in saying that Jesus was crucified. No, It says “They do blaspheme who say: “Allah is Christ the "son of Mary". But said Christ: Children of Israel! worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. ...” (5:72)</p>
<p>The Qur'an claims that they do not do whatever their scripture tells do to do. On the other hand, they mistranslate their scripture, or misrepresent it, or they add to the meaning of it. They put a different slant on it.</p>
<p>Now, I am concerned about this because many Christians and Jews at the first place find the sentence "Bible has been changed" to be offensive. Please also have a look at (5:45-49). Thanks.--<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 22:55, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, It is not a personal belief: In the article <a href="../../../s/i/m/Similarities_between_the_Bible_and_the_Qur%27an_86fc.html" title="Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an">Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an</a> we read "Particular Muslims such as the Mu'tazili and Ismaili sects (accounting for a fairly small percentage of total Muslim population), as well as various liberal movements within Islam, believe that different revelations are created by God for the needs of particular times and places."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Qur'an itself says (assuming this verses actually refer to the issue):
<dl>
<dd>"None of Our revelations do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, but We substitute something better or similar: Knowest <i>thou not that Allah Hath power over all things</i>?"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"When We substitute one revelation for another,- and Allah knows best what He reveals (in stages),- they say, "Thou art but a forger": but most of them understand not. Say, the Holy Spirit has brought the revelation from thy Lord in Truth, in order to strengthen those who believe, and as a Guide and Glad Tidings to Muslims."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Could you please let me know only one verse saying that "it is wrong to believe in the crucifixion, and likewise say that the other books have major changes and not just small changes." There is none. Please show me one; that would be enough for me. The crucifixion itself is not important; the interpretation attached to it is important (i.e. saying that it is "THE salvation of man".)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anonymous editor, of course, we should report everything no matter some people may find it offensive. But my purpose here is to help presenting Islam in the best possible way. I don't like it when some Jew or Christians read the article, at the beginning of the article reads this and says "Ah Ah" or becomes angry. If I want to explain this matter to a Non-Muslim, I would not start with such a statement. The Qur'an itself mentions this point implicitly not explicitly. It says that we replace something with a better one. This is the proper way in my mind.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Currently, please revert my edits if you want. I'll prepare some passage and consult it with you before adding. How is that? Thanks.--<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 23:37, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, blasphemy is sin. But saying that “Jesus was crucified” is not a blasphemy. The Qur'an never says that "They do blaspheme who say: Jesus is crucified". Qur'an says that the scriptures do not say that Jesus is God; on the other hand, it says that Jesus said “ worship God, my Lord and your Lord”; Quran gives hint to Christians in order to help them realizing that their scripture doesn’t say that Jesus was God. In fact, in the gospel of John, Jesus says “I am ascending to my father and your father, to my God and your God” This is the Qur’an’s hint.

<p>I could use another opinion on the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forgiveness.html" title="Forgiveness">forgiveness</a> article. An opinion has been expressed that the article reads too much like an essay. When you get a moment can you give it a look. The suggestion that it should be several short sentences for an intro seems a bit much (or little). I think most of the sentences provide important information. One or two could go, but other editors added them and I didn't think it was my place to delete them as they do have info.(eg Last sentence of third paragraph). Also what do you think about the picture debate. You will find these matters on tha talk page as well.</p>
<p>I could also use an opinion with an editor that keeps trying to slip in that Christianity is the espicially forgiveness religion. Thanks again for you earlier submission to the article. --<a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERSpeeter_fe4a.html" title="User:RSpeeter">speet</a> 07:46, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You are aware that his recent addition to his userpage proved him to be an ignorant Racist? - Further, you'll be pleased to know, according to Karl, that you and I needed shelter when we were driven from Canada and Ireland respectively - In Denmark no less, We had an oppurtunity to get a good Danish education, and were fed by the Danes when we had no food, Denmark, apparently, has been paying all our bills (<i>So where the hell is <b>my</b> money going?</i>), but, thankfully, we were not forced to work (I do it for thrills really), Further, Denmark offered us free Rent, phone,internet,car and school for our 20 Children.. It's amaxing the life I've had without knowing it. Apparently we built "Moske"s in the Christian land of the danes, and, we can't speaking Danish having lived there for 30 years.. from a pre-birth age I've lived there, and I still can't speak the language..

<p>Hello there, I am in an agrument, along with at least one other Wikipedia user, over how the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harp_Seal_2eab.html" title="Harp Seal">Harp Seal</a> page should be edited. It appears that one user, <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneric_Player_cc8d.html" title="User:Generic Player">User:Generic Player</a> continuosly posts either unfactual or semi-factual data and complains when it is removed.</p>
<p>Generic Player seems to me not to get the whole unbiased review idea. Just doesn't get it. If you are free, could you look into that page for me? It would be a real helpful. I was going to do some research on the subject and post it but I am afraid that all of my research would be in vain as Generic Player will probably delete or edit it to include references to the killing of innocent seals by buck-toothed fisherman looking for some extra dough for booze money or something.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We started a proposal <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiethics_d174.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiethics">Wikipedia:Wikiethics</a> to state the existing policies coherently and make suggestions on improving the editorial standards in Wiki. I thought you might be interested in contributing to that proposal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a pro-porn and pro-offense lobby is trying to make this proposal a failure. They unilaterally started an approval poll although almost no one including me believe that it is time for a vote, simply because the policy is not ready. It is not even written completely.</p>
<p>Editors who thinks that it needs to be improved rather than killed by an unfair poll at the beginning of the proposal, started another poll ('Do we really need a poll at this stage?') at the same time. The poll is vandalized for a while but it is stable now. A NO vote on this ('Do we really need a poll now?') poll will strengthen the position of the editors who are willing to improve the policy further.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about the ethics and editorial standards in Wiki, please visit the page <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiethics_d174.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiethics">Wikipedia:Wikiethics</a> with your suggestions on the policy. We have two subpages: Arguments and Sections. You might want to consider reviewing these pages as well...</p>

<dd>Hi, they apperantly deleted again. Could you please take the 'Do we need a poll?' poll back if deleted. A NO would be helpful to wikipedians with some ethical standard. If it is deleted your taking the poll back to the discussion page would also greatly appreciated. I will check it too now.

<p>Assalaamo Aleikum. Sorry to be pestering you here but note the "History" section of <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim_World_5dbb.html" title="Muslim World">Muslim World</a>. I've tried removing it, but been pushed back 4 times, including once by an IP who has appears to have been stalking Netscott, reverting back to his position at least twice after Netscott had used up his 3 reverts.. in only four edits<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=72.21.33.130" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=72.21.33.130" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Anyway, the problem here is as you can see, the "history" section is patently false. It credits the Ottomans with spreading Islam, which is obviously wrong considering the overwhelming vast majortity of Muslims live outside of the predominantly Arab land held by them. It then continues into irrelevence with two paragraphs on contemperary "Islamists". Frankly, if you want to know the history of Islam, thats what we have <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Islam_572a.html" title="History of Islam">History of Islam</a>. --Irishpunktom\<sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishpunktom_3aca.html" title="User talk:Irishpunktom">talk</a></sup> 22:53, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Seeing your edits to the sandbox, now I know that you use 1024x768 screen resolution. Because the page now looks disorganized in 800x600.

I'm not here to argue about Christianity and Islam; I'm having quite a bit of trouble on the <a href="../../../e/v/o/Talk%7EEvolution_8c56.html" title="Talk:Evolution">Evolution talk page</a>.
