	    <p>I have updated the page because Black Pearl was listed as a member of the Anoa'i family, which he is not. This was listed in the Wrestling Observer Newsletter by Dave Meltzer, the top pro wrestling journalist today. Although Rikishi has stated that Black Pear is a member of the family, he's only done this to help him out with work. Moreover, Black Pear isn't even of Samoan descent, but rather is of Fijian ancestry. Also, Jimmy Snuka is not related to the Anoa'i family. He is of Fijian descent only.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Can you provide references for this? I have seen various references to both being related, including Afa's homepage. Jimmy Snuka's relation is not as close so his being from Fiji is not actually a problem. And please sign your posts typing four tildes (~). <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 19:08, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Reference is Dave Meltzer.</dd>
<dd>Here is his official site: <a href="http://www.wrestlingobserver.com/wo/" class="external free" title="http://www.wrestlingobserver.com/wo/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wrestlingobserver.com/wo/</a></dd>
<dd>Here is his email address: Dave@wrestlingobserver.com</dd>
<dd>Dave is the top pro wrestling journalist today and is known for his accuracy in pro wrestling news reporting. He is very quick to respond to emails. However, sometimes he may respond to emails on his website. I check the site daily, so if you don't hear from him, I'll come across it on the site. But most likely he will respond to the email within a day or so. Anyway, I hope that helps.</dd>

<dd>I am afraid this is not enough. We need a link to an article or a quote of the relevant article. I am not prepared to send him an e-mail enquiring about this. Anyway, this would be enough. If he knows and you know and I know, someone may came along and ask the same questions again. So please take care to provide such a source. And what about Snuka?

<dd>Here is the exact quote from Dave Meltzer's January 22, 2007 issue of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter:</dd>
<dd>"Okay, here is the latest on the Anoa'i family tree. Black Pearl, who is the sometimes champ in Italy, is not Rikishi's brother as we listed, although it is billed as such. Black Pearl is actually Fijian in ancestry and from California. He broke into wrestling with Jimmy Snuka Jr. and he's basically Rikishi's gofer on the road. Rikishi has been pushing him to promoters as his younger brother to get him his break. Rikishi is the son of Afa's sister, as is Umaga and Tonga Kid. Ro-Z is the son of Sika. Yokozuna (Rodney Anoa'i) is the nephew of Afa &amp; Sika, as the son of a brother who has since passed away. Samu is the son of Afa, as is Afa Jr."</dd>
<dd>That is the entire Anoa'i professional wrestling family as of today. The sites you referenced are inaccurate. If you have any further questions I suggest you email Mr. Meltzer at Dave@wrestlingobserver.com to verify information. He will respond to the emails and he is the most reliable source for professional wrestling information. Moreover, Jimmy Snuka is of Fijian ancestry (and not related to any of the ANoa'i family) as listed at his profiles at <a href="http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/profiles/j/jimmy-snuka.html" class="external free" title="http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/profiles/j/jimmy-snuka.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/profiles/j/jimmy-snuka.html</a>.</dd>

<dd>Thanks, Scanadiense, for the excerpt. I will reflect that information in future edits. However, we still have nothing on Snuka, as OWW says nothing either way.</dd>
<dd>Please stop telling me to email David Meltzer. If I feel like it, I will. But private contacts are no basis for putting information on WP.</dd>
<dd>Finally, could you please please please sign your post by typing four tildes after your post. It will expand into your signature. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 08:24, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have heard that Snuka isn't actually related to the Anoa'i family too. However, I've forgotten the reason. Back in 2002, WWE magazine ran an article going over the Anoa'i family tree, and it mentioned Snuka's link to the family. However, I no longer have that magazine and I forget what the link was. He is either a cousin-in-law (where he married into the family), or he's considered a cousin much like Peter Maivia is considered an uncle, a "courtesy" cousin so to speak. --<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubhagan_33c0.html" title="User:Dubhagan"><font color="black"><b>James</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/u/b/User_talk%7EDubhagan_8d04.html" title="User talk:Dubhagan"><font color="green"><b>Duggan</b></font></a> 02:34, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
