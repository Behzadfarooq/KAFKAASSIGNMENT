I think you knew what I meant when I said 'my article'... I meant 'the article that I wrote.' I am fairly new to Wiki, but I thought the whole idea of it was that anyone could write an article. So I wrote one, which is fully legal according to the rules that have to be followed. I don't appreciate you arbitrarily deleting "the community's" article because you want to force somone to follow a voluntary suggestion. If you think there is a problem with the article, why not work to update it and make it better (as is the whole point of wikipedia) instead of just deleting it? Anonterm 15:05, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Don't give up on either Wikipedia or your article. I remember the first time a comment I made was removed as OR. My face burned with anger! However, even as I wrote that comment, I knew it was OR. Just a note on the artile you started on a band, if it lacks <i>notability</i>, it likely won't last. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font color="black"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font color="blue"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 15:37, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've had enough... every time I try to put something up, it is deleted right away. I had many good things to contribute to Wikipedia, but as of now, I quit. This site has proven to be unwelcoming and unhelpful.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The deletions are not 'arbitrary'. Wikipedia has clear guidelines for what constitutes notability with regard to bands, and <i>Rock and Roll Adding Machine</i> doesn't even come close to meeting them. While it is true that they are guidelines and not rules, they are described like that so that they can be broken if there is a really good reason. A really good reason might be that the band has garnered a huge amount of media attention, or is famous for some reason other than their music. It's not intended that the guidelines be broken just because someone likes the band and really wants the rules not to apply. If you think there might be a really good reason why the guidelines shouldn't apply to this article then you should probably explain it here. I would also suggest you try editing some other articles that you aren't so emotionally involved with. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 14:55, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Obviously you haven't kept abrest of the situation... I'm not 'emotionally involved' with the article, I'm upset because I wrote a nonbiased truthful and informative article that conformed to all mandatory rules and it has been repeatedly deleted. I think anybody in a similar position would be [justifiably] upset too. The article was not a promotion in any way, and so far nobody has disputed any fact that was in it. As a Canadian, you are not necesarily in the best position to judge what bands are important on the New Jersey music scene. All I'm asking is that everyone stop trying to edit something that they know nothing about. Anonterm 15:04, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually what I was doing was explaining to you how Wikipedia worked and making a suggestion I hoped would be helpful. Please have a close read of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">the music notability guidelines</a>. Wikipedia works by consensus rather than by the punctilious application of rules. Is there actually any reason why you think this band might satisfy the notability guidelines, or do you just disagree with the guidelines? <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 15:28, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I do not have any problem with the notability guidelines, but I do have a problem with your application of the guidelines on two counts. First, you are applying the <i>guidelines</i> as if they were <i>rules</i>. Second, the band is a local underground legend and just because YOU don't know something about a subject does not mean that it is not informative or interesting to a lot of people. Do you have any special qualifications or knowledge of the NJ underground music scene that I should be aware of? Anonterm 15:34, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It has already been decided by consensus of Wikipedians that bands that are only popular in their local area should not get articles. That's what the notability guidelines are about. Is there any other reason why they should get an article? <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a></dd>
