<p>ae, while your edits themselves are fair enough, your comments are needlessly aggressive. You can dispute certain allegations, but you cannot dispute the existence of the dispute. Normally, it should be enough to refuse to have weasly terms in the article and ask for credible sources. "who the heck cares" is not an argument, if there <i>are</i> notable sources, they will be included. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>·õè</b>)</a></small> 10:43, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with you, although I should point out that, in such a case, sometimes agression is the only tool to counter itself. I agree that if there is a reliable source it should be included, but there is none to support urchid's claims this article. The only source stating that is based on a completely unreliable interview, as stated before.

<p>Hi , a big problem is that if we start adding Islamic sites here , people wil include shia , salfi &amp; even Qadyani sites. Then U know , very soon faithfreedom , jihad watch will come into Islam page , saying we need to make this article NPOV . So watchout for that happening .

<p>In response: Yes, I underestand completely, but I still believe that we should provide viewers with an appropriate list of general links that educate them about the religion. This is integral to clarify the tenets of the religion. Very few users will actaully use directory for general info about the religion. Critical links are given in the directory and I clearly restate that a religion does not need POV in the first place because it is factuality rather than an issue. The links I listed are factual and I ofcourse did not link them for POV, but for factuality. But, yes, I do understand what you were saying, thanks for informing me. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor">Anonymous editor</a> 19:11, Jun 12, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is unsourced material. It needs to be sourced before inserted into an encyclopedia. Surely, noone can make up stories and insert them into an article. Btw, I am whose sockpuppet, SlimVirgin? The only reason I was using anon IP currently is because I am on a 3rr violation and was being made personal attacks against by a user who has used several sockpuppets.

<dd>You're not meant to be posting as you're blocked for 3RR. It's not a made-up story, and you surely know that, because it's a notorious incident.

<dd>I'm surprised you haven't heard of the schoolgirls killed in the burning school. Their school caught fire, and the religious police wouldn't allow them to escape because they weren't wearing headscarves and black robes. Fifteen girls died and around 50 were seriously injured. There are hundreds of thousands of stories about it online e.g. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1874471.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1874471.stm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. In future, if an editor makes reference to something you've never heard of, ask for a source on the talk page, but don't delete it, though you're entitled to delete it if no source is forthcoming, or better still, you could look for a source yourself. As for the sockpuppetry, I won't mention the name because I have no evidence, but if evidence emerges, I'll let you know. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:24, Jun 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I would like to point out a few things on the Islam talk page. While user 4.158 was probably going too far in his comment at the top of the section "The Truth About Islam", I don't think it deserved the bashing it got by you. It wasn't really right for user 4.158 to use the words "scum", "foul" and various others, but I have to say that it wasn't much better when you started that shouting. I would like to point out that Christians and Muslims do NOT worship the same God. Perhaps Islam and Christianity share a few similarities, but Allah is not as loving as our God. He requires that people's good deeds outweigh their bad ones, which is impossible since even one sin can keep you out of Heaven. Well, I won't drawl on, and I hope this doesn't create any hard feelings between us. Regards. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpionman_ba8b.html" title="User:Scorpionman">Scorpionman</a> 18:44, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The very fact that you deny that muslims and christians worship the same God is indication, with all due respect, that you do not understand Islam. Surely, you can not believe like christianity does that all our sins are forgiven just because Jesus 'died' on the cross. Why would God, the one and only, put us into this world if he did not want us to prove ourselves, to be faithful to him, to serve him. Islam does not state that one sin keeps you out of heaven and you have been misinformed. The very fact that you said your 'good deeds' have to outweigh your sins contradicts this. There are certain beliefs that one needs to get into heaven and there are certain sins that are forgiven. See <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>. Islam is a way for people to live and truly it is the peaceful and pious way to live, I found that out when I learned more about Islam from sources that were not anti-Islamic. Islam is indeed the true word of God, the true message that was passed on to humans by Jesus, Moses, Abraham, Muhammad and≈¢ the other prophets, peace be upon every one of them.Allah is the most merciful, the most forgiving and truly what you said about one sin is very contrary to this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Surely according to what you said, in Christianity, you can kill a hundred people and as long as you have faith you will get into heaven. Truly you can not believe that? You have to consider that sin is there for a reason. Also you should realize that unlike christianity, Islam says there are other good people of the other abrahamic faiths (christianity and judaism) that will also be able to enter heaven. Doesn't that show God's true love towards all his people? The christian version of God states that all who are not christian will not get into heaven. Surely then, who classifies as a christian in your eyes, there are so many different beliefs?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Please realize I understand all of this as I was once an evangelical christian myself. I know many like myself and my wife who have converted to Islam. And I am sorry but I do not have time to go on and explain Islam thoroughly right now but if you wish to learn more I will clarify the beliefs for you. I Similarly,I was not hard on user 4.158, if you check most of his edits, they are primarily Islam bashing and profanity against Islam. A true muslim would never be caught showing this type of intolerance to others and I find it ironic that christians who claim they want to pass on 'love and tolerance' have been the first in line to vandalize Islam-related articles. I hope you understand and I appreciate that you lead me to clarify this for you. Learn about Islam, surely you will understand what I mean. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor">Anonymous editor</a> 20:00, Jun 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you read the Islam article, it says that conversion out of Islam is punishable by death. It's not like that with Christianity, and seeing that you DID convert out of it, you weren't punished with death. Also, if you kill a hundred people, God will still forgive you if you are repentant. If you recieve Jesus as your Savior and Lord, you will be able to go to heaven. If Allah is as loving and forgiving as you say he is, why does conversion out of Islam mean you should be punished by death? A Christian who turns to Islam isn't punished that way. As for the many different beliefs, I'd have to say that I don't know quite all of them, but I do know that Catholicism, which is one of the beliefs, says you can buy for yourself and for others passage into heaven. Not possible. But tell me, how do muslims earn their way to heaven? <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpionman_ba8b.html" title="User:Scorpionman">Scorpionman</a> 20:28, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Christian conversions were also punished by death if you look through history. In fact, not converting to christianity was highly punished by death in early Europe. As society has changed so has this concept and there are christians today who I guarantee will still use the same concept to deal with apostasy.</p>
<p>About Muslim passage into heaven: Allah Almighty forgives pretty much all sins except idol worshiping and trinity beliefs; "Allah forgiveth not that partners should be set up with Him; but He forgiveth anything else, to whom He pleaseth; to set up partners with Allah is to devise a sin most heinous indeed. (The Noble Quran, 4:48)." Therefore, Islam forms the direct relationship between a Muslim and His Creator Allah Almighty as long as a Muslim believes in One True GOD. There is no middle man between a Muslim and His Creator; "It was We Who Created man, and We know what dark suggestions his soul makes to him: for We are nearer to him than (his) jugular vein. (The Noble Quran, 50:16)"</p>
<p>Many times, people fail to realize that the Islamic concept of salvation is not based upon good deeds, but is based primarily upon faith. In the many times Allah Almighty talks in the Quran about salvation, he always states, "Those who believe and do good deeds." Belief is always mentioned before deeds or works. When one converts to Islam, one does not do it by doing some good work but rather through realizing and believing that there is but one God and Muhammed (peace be upon him) is his last messenger. Non-Muslims may perform good works as well, but what sets them apart from Muslims is their lack of IMA‚ÄôAN (Aqeedah) [faith], or belief. The reason that the good works of the non-believers are worthless in the hereafter is because of their disbelief. Unless a person's imaan or aqeedah is not correct, his deeds are wasteful.</p>
<p>"Strongest among men in enmity to the believers (Muslims) wilt thou find the Jews and Pagans; and nearest among them in love to the believers wilt thou find those who say, 'We are Christians': because amongst these are men devoted to learning and men who have renounced the world, and they are not arrogant." (The Noble Quran, 5:82)"</p>
<p>"Say: 'O People of the Book (i.e., Jews and Christians)! Come to common terms as between us and you: That we worship none but Allah; that we associate no partners with Him; that we erect not, from among ourselves, Lords and patrons other than Allah.' If then they turn back, say ye: 'Bear witness that we (at least) are Muslims (bowing to Allah's Will).' (The Noble Quran, 3:64)"</p>
<p>Furthermore, notice what is says in Luke 10 of the bible: - On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. "Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?" - "What is written in the Law (testament)?" he replied. "How do you read it?" - He answered: " 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'&#160;; and, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' " - "You have answered correctly," Jesus replied. "Do this and you will live."</p>
<p>Notice that Jesus didn't talk about any trinity concept, nor did he say to the man that he must accept Jesus as a mediator (or son) between him and GOD Almighty to win eternal life. No Jesus was pretty clear and straight forward here: LOVE GOD ALMIGHTY AND LOVE YOUR NEIGHBORS AS YOURSELF. That is simply all there is to it to win eternal life according to Jesus'.</p>
<p>Similarly, in Mark 10:18 one of the many examples that protestants usually deny is found (New Testament!): "Why do you call me good?" Jesus answered. "No one is good‚Äìexcept God alone." Surely if Jesus was involved in the trinity, he would not have said this. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor">Anonymous editor</a> 00:27, Jun 16, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Hi guys , just wanted to add , no where in Quran Allah said turning back from Islam is punishable to death , I know its present in Islam page , that has been put there by an Islamphobe . For more U can see <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostasy_in_Islam_9d90.html" title="Apostasy in Islam">Apostasy in Islam</a></b>.</dd>

<dd>About other religions Allah says <i>Those with Faith, those who are Jews, and the Christians and Sabaeans, all who have Faith in Allah and the Last Day and act rightly, will have their reward with their Lord. They will feel no fear and will know no sorrow (2:62)</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So U dont necessarily have to be a muslim to go to heaven ( well if U R then its even better ). All U have to do is that U have to have faith in <b>One God</b> , DAy of judgement ( and of course afterlife ) &amp; do good deeds to others . Very simple . If U commit a sin , ask for forgiveness sincerely ( dont try to play games with God ), U R forgiven . Btw according to Islamic books Sabaens include non Abrahamic faiths ( unlike what is written on WP ). <a href="../../../f/a/r/User%7EFarhansher_7fdc.html" title="User:Farhansher">Farhansher</a> 04:36, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well most of the times its because of lack of knowledge . I never heard of people leaving Islam &amp; accepting Christianity or Judaism , but sometimes people , not having all the answers , tend to become Athiest . I mean its difficult to actually prove God . And when people fail to do so , they tend to think it is better to leave unexplainable things behind . Some people I have talked to ( who said they left Islam ) , told me that they werent able to wear Hijab , or werent able to offer Prayers , or werent able to leave Alcohol , so they first accepted &amp; then left Islam . But if U ask them if they believe in One God , they say yes . If U ask them If they believe in Muhammad as the last prophet , they say yes . So technically they R still inside Islam , though they dont know . There is a possibility of people leaving Islam when /if they R opressed by other muslims , ( well like the fabricated story of Enviroknot , though it turned out to be a good joke when the self proclaimed born Saudi muslim women wasent able to translate on sentence of Arabic ) . But this is again out of hatred to the oppressers , &amp; not b/c of any defect in Islamic teachings .</p>

<dd>It was at first an interesting religion but then after I learned more, it became such a brilliant and pure way to live life, that explained many questions that Christianity could never answer.

At first, it was such fascination to me that here is a book that was written so many centuries ago and reveals so many of the recent discoveries we are making now.

<p>I thought my edit summaries made that clear. The fact that the Qur'an mentions Abraham is already mentioned in the second sentence. The paragraph in question was discussing the dubious historical nature of the sources on Abraham; thus, the only reason for including the Qur'an in that section would be to point out that since it was written almost 3,000 years after the time Abraham was supposed to have lived, the Qur'an is an even more dubious historical source than the Book of Genesis. I didn't imagine you wanted to include that statement, did you? In any event, Mustafaa also removed Hebrews, which makes sense; Hebrews is a few hundred years older than the Qur'an, but it's still not a historically relevant source. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:16, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree, in cases of clear vandalism, we block the vandal, we don't protect the article. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>·õè</b>)</a></small> 08:48, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From what I've seen in his edits <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdip_Yuksel_c494.html" title="User:Edip Yuksel">User:Edip Yuksel</a> seems to be just about what you have said about him... but, I had heard about him before he came here and he is not grandly significant but I don't think he is anywhere near speedy delete vanity and I do believe he might even deserve an article as a minor author in a controversial movement which seems to be getting more interest (as with all Islam) post towers falling. I do agree that we will have to watch out for his POV in many articles and I've expressed my skepticism about his NPOV abilities... but, I don't think this should have any reflection on whether he gets a page or not... because, we control his page as much as he does, and we can keep it NPOV. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> 03:29, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
