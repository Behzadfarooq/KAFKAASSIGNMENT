<p>Hello! I am a "fan" of the Shield and, as a pastor, have used in in many Bible studies and similar meetings. It is an excellent tool, and I hope you didn't interpret my edit as intending any disrespect (not intended) or tak any personal offense (also not offended). I look(ed) at the Shield as more of a symbol than a theological point, such as <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justification_%28theology%29.html" title="Justification (theology)">Justification</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incarnation.html" title="Incarnation">Incarnation</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resurrection.html" title="Resurrection">Resurrection</a>, etc.</p>
<p>Upon further reflection, it seems to me that <i>many</i>, or at least <i>some</i> theological points are highly related to symbol (Genesis and Revelation are both FILLED with it really), and so I would have no problem if you were to restore the deleted category. I <i>still</i> think a category such as "Christian symbols" is most appropriate, but I will defer to your decision.</p>

<dd>Dear sir,</dd>
<dd>I see that you have been on WP for some time, which may have prompted your annoyance over the "move" I made. May I point out to you a WP guideline: <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Assume good faith</a>? Now, refer me to the Arabic sources that proclaim basmala to be a better version or the name of Bismillah. I am a born Muslim with the obligatory knowledge of Quran, and this is the first time I have heard the word basmala referring to Bismillah. However, if basmala is kept being preferred over Bismillah here on WP, it isn't really going to erase Muslim memories which are very familiar with this line. Re: my name. While, it's none of your business, it raises academic curiosity off and on. (*Deep breath.* Your message is worthwhile, though the tone is not.) I thought you were an authority on Arabic and on Islam and would see the connection? My name is Arabic, Muslim, and it means a woman who can make a prophecy/ see into the future. With so much interest in me and my edits, did you not see my user page?</dd>

<dd>Thank you for writing back, it saved me some real heartache. I did make a mistake by playing around with the page without talking about it first. It's a newbie mistake, for which I was sorry when <a href="../../../h/a/j/User%7EHajor_7ab9.html" title="User:Hajor">–<i>Hajor</i></a> pointed out. I was alarmed by what I maintain is a much less popular term for Bismillah, if it is indeed the name of Bismillah at all. I have read Arabic for over 25 years. NEVER did I hear basmala was a variant of Bismillah, let alone its name. I am a Muslim, and if basmala were valid, I would be the first one to defend it. Anyway, the rudimentary Arabic explanation that I left on the talk page is valid, I may not have written it well. My mother language is Urdu, which is written and read like Arabic, and is derived from Persian and Arabic, among other languages. When we start learning how to read Arabic, this is how we begin. It was for the benefit of anyone (and I cannot account for the vast variety of language exp level of the readers/ editors) who may wonder about the variants.</dd>

<dd>P.S. Indeed I must thank you for the concern about the word/name prophetess. It is admittedly scandalous. The word "Prophet" refers to (according to Islam, etc. of course) the Prophets of Allah. The word prophet in general is about someone who can make a prophecy - such as in the phrase <i>prophet of doom</i>. Likewise Messenger of Allah is different from, e.g. <i>the messenger who arrived with a letter for you this afternoon</i>. You know this, of course, I just wanted to give you the context. Anyway, I'll look into your suggestion, it crossed my own mind earlier. Hmmm, I had more to say but WP says talkpages aren't for usenet style chatting. I am available on e-mail if you wish.

<p>AnonMoos, the sections you restored weren't just deleted -- they were extensively rewritten and re-organized into the one section on current trends in Salafism. It really really messes up the article to have one treatment of these matters above, and another, more disorganized and Salafi-POV, treatment below.

<p>but I really don't appreciate attempts to pervert history and facts. The article doesn't mention that the Israeli occupation kills civilians, and it doesn't mention that the Palestinian armed resistance has also involved - but by no means exclusively - attacks on civilians. Both facts are reasonably well-known. The changes you wish to make would imply that all Palestinian "non-non-violent" resistance was either terrorism or suicide bombings. Not true, and see also <a href="../../../w/o/r/Wikipedia%7EWords_to_avoid_41db.html" title="Wikipedia:Words to avoid">Wikipedia:Words to avoid</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 21:12, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't care what was there first. I'm perfectly happy to acknowledge that I replaced POV and inaccurate material with factually accurate and NPOV material. I am not denying and don't seek to deny that violent resistance by Palestinians has included attacks on civilians, and personally I deplore such attacks (that of course is my POV). Neither do I deny that the Israeli occupation has also involved (many more) attacks on civilians (which I also deplore). In the interests of balance, if we insist on specifically mentioning that aspect of the violence (which is not what the article is about), we should mention it in relation to both parties. However, if you wish to take out the reference to armed Palestinian resistance altogether, I will not make a fight about it, although I would think it better that it remained. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 17:06, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>OK, you say you would like the discussion to proceed on a reasonably civil basis, while at the same time accusing me of making my edit "from what I can tell, with a very specific and deliberate intention of whitewashing over brutal atrocities and crimes with a weaselling equivocating euphemism". How on earth can you justify attributing such a motivation to me? In order to help establish a civil tone, I'll explain my motivation in detail.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My main concern was accuracy and fairness. The previous version read in part "...Arab resistance often carries connotations of terrorist attacks and of <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_bomber.html" title="Suicide bomber">suicide bombers</a> in particular...". Well, the suicide bombs are a relatively recent phenomenon, and both armed attacks on military targets and non-violent actions were going on long before them. Furthermore, Palestinian resistance to many people carries connotations of teenagers throwing stones at heavily armed soldiers, of what many people see as heroic defiance against overwhelming force. So these connotations may appear to some people, but definitely not to all. "Armed action" seemed like a neutral term that would cover all Palestinian violent resistance (I suppose except stone-throwing) without going into details that are extraneous to the subject under discussion. Particularly, why accuse the Palestinians of terrorism when the Israeli armed forces have killed far more civilians? Incidentally, I think this principle of not delving into non-related matters should also be extended to the section on South Africa.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Your later edit read, in part, "has involved non-violent resistance as well as terrorist attacks and <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_bomber.html" title="Suicide bomber">suicide bombings</a>." Again, that implies that Palestinian armed resistance was all terrorism, when quite a lot of it has been armed attacks on military targets.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dd>I hope that this helps clarify both my intentions and my edits, and I would like you to reconsider your claim that I had "a very specific and deliberate intention of whitewashing over brutal atrocities and crimes". <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 18:31, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, apparently I was wrong in thinking that you wanted a civil discussion. Or else you have a very different conception of "civil" from me. At this stage, I'd be very happy never to have any exchanges with you again.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for "condescending", well, how about "some Palestinians have felt the need to take up acts of non-violent resistance to improve the international Palestinian image"? Utter condescending nonsense. I know Palestinians who are engaged in non-violent resistance and "improving their international image" isn't what they are motivated by. Not to mention "armchair romantic radicals from a distance like yourself". How do you know anything about me that gives you a right to make such assumptions?</dd>

<p>I understand that you have a big thing for "spirituality" (even though this word unfortunately doesn't convey much of anything in particular to large numbers of people) -- however, the whole point of creating a cross-link to Wikimedia Commons (which I was the first to do for this category) is to provide a practical pointer to locations where further images of interest may be found. Unfortunately Commons:Category:Spirituality doesn't meet this criterion because it's almost completely empty. Furthermore, it really doesn't suit you to try to jump on a high horse of "anti-deletionism", considering that you previously deleted the link to Commons:Category:Religious symbols -- which is as highly useful as Commons:Category:Spirituality is highly useless... - AnonMoos 02:31, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you truly are interested in developing the category of spiritual <i>and</i> religious <i>images</i>, then your selection of <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Religion" class="external text" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Religion" rel="nofollow">one in fifty religion subcategories at the commons</a> - religious symbols - makes no sense either. That's why I replaced it with the beliefs category. If your criterion is current size of a category, then this is a superior choice. In addition, it goes well beyond a small sample from a few religious traditions, which is the case with the religious symbolism category. I'm more than willing to go with the larger religion category and the beliefs category. Zeroing in on the symbolism subcategory alone is too narrow. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_0444.html" title="User:Richard"></a> — <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_0444.html" title="User:Richard">Richard<sub>RDF</sub></a><sup><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERichard_3dad.html" title="User talk:Richard">talk</a></sup> 03:29, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Explan: If you record the point that the sun strikes at midday every day you see that it progresses in an expanding circle - i.e. a spiral. The spiral then reverses after three months and inverts so you get four spirals over a twelve month period ergo value of three monthes hence my gestation point.

At the same time I feel terrorist is a big word that will certainly include anybody who bomb innocent civilians. Surely someone killing himself in the way is better than the one cozily sitting in a fighter jet and destroying houses and killing innocent civilians because of the mere thought that maybe somebody is wanted there. While the first is using all what he got, the second could have made a better choice. Both of them surely do not know what peace is and who is The Peace.

<p>The image I removed is not relevant because it is not an image of the Lindisfarne Gospels, it is modern work inspired by the Lindisfarne Gospels, of which there are thousands. (Every artist interested in Celtic Knotwork has created similar images.) This particular image does nothing to help understand the subject and could lead to serious misunderstanding. For example, that shade of green is not found in the mnauscript. Likewise, the shading found in the image (getting darker at the points and as the strands pass under other strands) is not typical of Insular art and is misleading.

<p>well, maybe "Neopagan symbols". "Pagan" is too wide, it could include all African, Asian, Polynesian etc. native traditions. I'm not entirely sure about even the "Neopagan" category (too eclectic). Maybe just categorize as "Neopaganism" and "Symbol" case by case. Just my thoughts, though. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 20:16, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>well, we are really stuck with the fact that "Paganism" is an umbrella term coined from the Christian pov. Even self-describing pagans succumb to that by often defining themselves in contradistinction to Christianity. Terms like "Forn Sidhr" are an attempt to overcome this, seeking a self-centered tradition without the need of an external "enemy" in order to define itself. I presume you are intending to group Germanic pagan symbols. How about a specific "Germanic symbols" or "Germanic pagan symbols" category then? Still, as you predicted, this will open disputes about whether a given symbol is "genuinely Germanic". I would, for example, object to the categorization of the "Fylfot" or the "Sunwheel" (not to mention the "Black Sun") as such. It may be better to just settle with a "Neopagan symbols" category. I do not intend to police categories too strictly, so I am not likely to interfere with you too much here, just make sure that if the category name implies use of the symbol in antiquity that you include only symbols for which a case for ancient use can be made. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 17:32, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Someone asked this regarding the British_Isles_Venn_Diagram.png. I checked out the image history, and it seems that you were the one who added the ellipse around england and wales. Maybe consider at least responding on the talk page to the query. Cheers, 82.82.184.34 16:17, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Some kind of explanation as to why England and Wales appear as they do in the venn diagram might be appropriate. I presume this relates to Wales being part of the Kingdom of England when it unified with the Kingdom of Scotland in 1707 to form Great Britain? 194.203.110.127 15:59, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some people say the above stated languages are dialects, but it is true that language is CAN ONLY be officalized via Mutual Unintelligebility. So I was just asking the question, because these modern languages can understand each other in writing; That means that the syntax of the languages are the same, but I/we can't determine if they are different languages, if I/we don't know if the Syntax of the OLd languages were mutually intelligebable. Now, the reason I did not say just '....other SYNTACTAICALLY....' but '....other in writing SYNTACTICALLY....' is because you can't understand the langages phonologically, anyways, so it I just put the '....in writing....' to clarify, but if it didn't help, then I guess that was too bad, we're all sorry, &amp; I'm sorry for everything:'(</p>

<p>Yes... Zora and I have gotten very frustrated in the past when we had to clean up literally dozens of stubs... (and just like this article they used primary sources which weren't very encyclopedic and on topic.) It's just that no one types in RHM to find the basmala... and RHM root is not for all of the words of the basmala... I have no problem deleting it... just, there is no reason it should be a redirect. I know that AfD is probably frustrating... (personally, I don't care about this kind of stub because it doesn't create any real bias... unlike creating articles about Shia view of X) But... if it is violating an agreement maybe it can be deleted more easily? I'm not sure. The article needs to have a source about the root RHM specifically... instead of describing issues not directly related. I do agree with you... I just don't think it should be a redirect. If you want to change it back then I guess you can... but, it should be deleted unless it really discusses R-H-M. Although, it could easily fail on AfD because of eventualism. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 19:10, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Weasel words?</p>
<p>Here is Wikipedia's definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Weasel words are almost always intended to deceive or draw attention from something the speaker doesn't want emphasized, rather than being the inadvertent result of the speaker's or writer's poor but honest attempt at description.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A link that says the viewer can see text from the book by clicking on it, when it really just shows some text <i>which is not necessarily from such a book</i>, seems to be a good example of that.</p>

<p>I can understand a correction and brief instruction or hints on how to complete it, but not the casual erasure and harsh "you got it wrong, do it like this" attitude that you have.</p>
<p>This is at total discord with the Wikipedian / community approach that I'd come to think Wikipedia stood for. Frankly, I'm now wondering why I should bother to extend it, rather than being excited (as I was) at the thought of participating.</p>
<p>Frankly, your attitude to newbies is more than likely turning every person away from Wikipedia that you "correct" in such a harsh manner - in short: hindering more than you help.</p>
<p>If you 'correct' 10 articles each week, but turn those same 10 people away from contributing - you're simply preventing growth, rather than aiding proper growth by helping newbs.</p>
<p>I'm annoyed, and frankly very angry at such treatment - I appreciate you "help", but <b>NOT</b> your attitude.</p>
<p>I'm happy to be corrected - <b>but not smacked down like a little child</b>.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>you appear to be marked as the creator of the above image. It claims to refer to the time of the United Monarchy. Is it therefore possible that you could put onto the map the locations of Shiloh (former capital), Gibeah (Saul's capital), and indicate which areas of the map were part of David's Judah and which were parts of Ishbaal and Absalom's Israel&#160;? --<b><a href="../../../f/d/u/User_talk%7EFDuffy_2e93.html" title="User talk:FDuffy">User talk:FDuffy</a></b> 13:20, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, and thanks for getting back to me so fast. Would it be possible for you to add references to the disputed content?

<dd>Sorry, I wasn't clear. My point is, if the text includes inline references (see <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>) other contributors can get involved without having to ask you to explain the problem. As it stands, the conflict is less than clear, and basically amounts to an edit war, instead of an anon editor removing cited sources. Does that make sense? —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 23:42, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Citing sources will solve the dispute to the best of our ability. That is to say, anything unreferenced is fair game for removal. What we are left with is the closest approximation to the facts as we are best able to state them. This leaves no room for edit wars, and anyone engaging in said edit wars will either find themselves blocked, or in this case, page protection can be imposed, preventing anonymous IP's from editing.

As part of the ongoing effort to keep entries in <a href="../../../a/m/e/Category%7EAmerican_Civil_War_de23.html" title="Category:American Civil War">Category:American Civil War</a> to a minimum, I recategorized this article in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Category%7EConfederate_States_Army_9375.html" title="Category:Confederate States Army">Category:Confederate States Army</a>, along with several other articles related to <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleeding_Kansas_59d7.html" title="Bleeding Kansas">Bleeding Kansas</a>.</p>
<p>I can understand that you may not agree with the recat. However, this article belongs in a subcategory -- not the "top-level" category.

That keeps the article in <a href="../../../b/l/e/Category%7EBleeding_Kansas_5767.html" title="Category:Bleeding Kansas">Category:Bleeding Kansas</a>, which is a sub-cat of Category:American Civil War.</p>

<p>Not that I appreciate your way of approaching this, but I will give you a respectful response nonetheless.</p>
<p>I recreated the article Kethib/Ketiv because the title of the article itself is spelled badly. The old article with the very poorly transliterated <i>Kethib</i> should be DELETED because it does not represent <b>any</b> transliteration scheme. If the original author wanted to follow an older system, then it would be <i>kethibh</i> (since the Bet is aspirated = [v]), but he/she did not. Nowadays, the majority of people who comment on Hebrew either use a standardized system for transliteration, in which כתיב would look like <i>kĕ<u>t</u>î<u>b</u></i>, or they use a more sound-based transliteration such as <i>ketiv</i>. No one who actually knows Hebrew at this time (as far as my experience goes) would ever transliterate כתיב as <i>kethib</i>. - <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonah_mishael_9a45.html" title="User:Yonah mishael">Yonah</a></p>

Separating my text indicates exactly what I have written on a discussion page. This is useful especially when a comment is longer than one paragraph. If I place it only in lightgrey or silver, does this offend your obviously superior senses (since everything that I do seems to be STUPID in your book -- which is hardly a form of respectful discourse)? - <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonah_mishael_9a45.html" title="User:Yonah mishael">Yonah mishael</a></dd>

<p>Hey AnonMoos, I will look into that one, and attempt to fix it. Altho I have to say I have no background info about the subject because I am christian, but I will educate myself about the subject and work on translating the english sources into arabic. I will let you know when I think its done. Cheers --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Anubis_deb6.html" title="User:Lord Anubis">Lord Anubis</a> 13:29, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, You are right ( As I pointed out in the arabic wiki Holy Trinity discussion page), It should be Hamza, and not just the normal Aleph, but Arabs usually neglect putting the Hamza on the character when writing, and they have adapted the same thing when typing (typing ا is easier than أ). Having studied arabic for 10 years (And it is my first language), I still forget when to put hamza or aleph. It is kinda like the french vowels in english-adopted words, how often do you type "Cafe" with a é instead of e? ie: Café&#160;?! How come you know Arabic then&#160;? Do you have an arabic background&#160;? --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Anubis_deb6.html" title="User:Lord Anubis">Lord Anubis</a></p>

For this reason, I'm not sure that it will fall under blanket fair use to use rasterized versions of these glyphs in the article, particularly the Apple logo.

<dd>I'm not sure that illustrating a font glyph falls under fair use by those critera. I know the Apple logo has been removed from Apple-related userboxes that I have created in the past. You could argue that under the wording of the template we are illustrating the item in question, but I read it more as a catch-all phrase, so that if the item represents a corporation it can be used for that article, if it represents an item (ie. a product shot) it can be used for description of the product, etc. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntrigueBlue_1722.html" title="User:IntrigueBlue"><small>INTRIGUE</small>B<small>LUE</small></a> <small>(<a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EIntrigueBlue_96ec.html" title="User talk:IntrigueBlue">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_IntrigueBlue_4dae.html" title="Special:Contributions/IntrigueBlue">contribs</a>)</small> 16:35, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All those issues are where you disagree with me, not that I'm being un-constructive. I made a suggestion on the transliteration because I happen to be familiar with Arabic transliteration, and I wasn't insisting anything; just offering my opinion. I think you're upset because my suggestion didn't agree with what you wanted. On Salafism, I added the merge tag because the articles themselves claimed that they were talking of the same movement, and I explained it on the talk page in a reasonable way.

<p>I respond..</p>
<ul>
<li>(A) That source is much better than what was previously there, which was NO references. However, I agree that the promo text from a board game is not a desirable source. It would be best if I or you were to find another source for the same information and list both sources.</li>
<li>(B) The subsections listing like that was meant to be further expanded and elaborated on. Each one of those components of the flower of life deserves a great deal of attention and description.

You simply eliminated EVERYTHING that I had written and replaced it with the old <i><b>STUB</b></i> of an article. This is highly unacceptable and very aggrivating! There is a code of conduct to be followed in editing Wikipedia and it certainly falls outside of these guidelines to arbitrarily decide that EVERYTHING someone has written in a lengthy expansion should all be flushed down the tube at your whim, without even the slightest regard for preserving ANY of the useful information presented. Again I remind you that the article was a simple STUB before I got there, and I expanded it significantly.</p>

<p>The UAE are considered part of the mashriq; or at least they consider themself to be part of "Al-mashriq al-arabi". Many things in the UAE and Qatar are named after the mashriq. For instance mashriqbank <a href="http://www.mashreqbank.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.mashreqbank.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mashreqbank.com/</a> which is a UAE bank. The map I have on right now is the closest to "Al-mashriq al-arabi" which its map was published in one of the "Tarikh al-arab" volumes. 68.79.101.136 05:29, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes this is user Seblini I sent your the last message. You should do some reasearch before contributing to the masriq page. You are probably refereing to Bilad-asham or maybe the levent (term used by europeans which included syria lebanon palestine and jordan) We are talking about a term that was used by arabs accross the arab world hundreds of years ago: the mashriq. Qatar and UAE are considered part of the mashriq. some even consider the whole arab peninsula being part of the mashriq which also includes saudi arabia, yemen and oman. This map is the closest map to the mashriq map that was published in a "tarikh al-arab" volume that dates back to the 1960's. and pelase stop reverting my edits.</p>
<p><br />
Dude I saw the map of the mashriq in a "tarikh al-arab" volume so dude I might have been wrong. so dude stop being so stubborn I was wrong and you were wrong; and thats the correct map.</p>
<p>There is no shuch thing as the english-word mashriq. we are refering to the arabic word mashriq that has been around for several hundered years and which may be used in english conversations. and this word means where the sun rises and it rises in UAE and Qatar before rising in iraq, syria and lebanon. the UAE and qatar are the farthest arabic lands to the east. therefore they are included in what is known as the lands of the mashriq. I don't know if you really beleive that its a good argument when you say "Eastern Arabia" is not the same as Mashriq. Its like saying "middle-east" is not the same as Asia; yes its not the same but part of the middle east is part of Asia just like part of eastern arabia is part of the mashriq. It is very obvious that you don't have a lot of information about this subject and I would appreciate it if you stop making random contributions.</p>

<p>This is very interesting. Looking at the Shield am I not looking at the lower Trinity of the Sephiroth? Power, Glory &amp; Foundation - Netzach, Hod, Yesod? - above the Malkuth - Kingdom? As in 'Thine is the Kingdom, the Power and the Glory'? Inverted, as it is below, it becomes the Higher Trinity, Kether, Chochmah and Binah, which many commentators equate with the Holy Trinity? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThePeg_7930.html" title="User:ThePeg">ThePeg</a> 17:20, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I wonder if you might have some input on this. The current article seems to take it that "Greater Syria" refers exclusively to not merely the greater-Syrian position as a whole, but specifically to the SSNP interpretation of it. I'm not convinced that either is the case, but particularly not the latter (with the implications regarding Iraq, etc).

<p>I think the opening sentence needs to be present tense. It doesn't matter that sundown towns don't really exist anymore--the <b>definition</b> hasn't. If a town exists where certain people are kicked out after a certain time, than by golly, it's a sundown town.

It is you to bring evidence, not something you read or believe which is outdated and lay in construction.

Basically, the problem is, having pages like this protected for months isn't very fair to other anonymous users, although I guess they can just get accounts. The thing is however, is that the anonymous editors actually write the majority of the text of this encyclopedia, and we don't call it "the free encyclopedia" for nothing.

<p><font color="black">You are right, there is a difference. A takfir is a Muslim who charges another with apostasy, while a kafir is a complete unbeliever. However, I'm unsure what you are referring to vis a vis my edit, since, to quote my edit summary, "takfirs" is "...probably not the self-ref for members here", meaning that even though the group's name is "Takfir wal-Hijra", its own members are not likely to apply the nisba "takfiri" to themselves. I did not mention anything about "kafiris" in my edit or its summary. So, I'm slightly confused, but thanks for reviewing the edit. -<a href="../../../f/s/o/User%7EFsotrain09_ca86.html" title="User:Fsotrain09">Fsotrain</a><sup><a href="../../../f/s/o/User_talk%7EFsotrain09_af29.html" title="User talk:Fsotrain09">09</a></sup> 16:40, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</font></p>
