<p>Nu sunt sigur de ce ai plecat. Poate din cauza ungurilor. Daca il ating pe ungaro, o sa faca acelasi argument care ai facut si tu cand te-am atins.

<p>M-am uitat pe harta aia dar cred ca nu e tocmai 100% adevarata. De exemplu, la cetatea alba, nu sunt decat 1000 de romani. la babele, chishlitza si limanskoye sunt numai romani. la satul nou langa sarata sunt romani si acolo dar pe harta nu apare nimic. Am modificat si eu un pic harta ta pe baza datelor din recensamantul din 2001. zi-mi si mie ce crezi.

<p>Have you read these documents? Also, you once said that Bessarabia was probably given by Mircea to Alexandru, yet, when Stephen ruled, Bessarabia was first under the rulership of Hungary and Wallachia. Can you explain these exchanges of land? Also on that map, I see "Omlas" being a enclave of Wallachia. How come?

<dd>in the 1390 treaty with poland, mircea was called <i>Woyvoda Transalpinus, Fogaras et Omlas dux, seurinii comes, terrarum Dobrotici despotus et Tristri dominus</i>. Omlas, Fagaras and Severin were feuds given by the hungarian king to mircea. in the <i>hrisov</i> of 1387, he mentions along his possesions <b>къ Татарскым странами</b> (hope i got it right), translated by most romanian historians as <i>părţile tătăreşti</i> ("tatar parts"). probably this was reffering to territories in southern moldavia, bessarabia and, maybe, northern dobruja. iorga said tht he found a map of wallachia from 1780 that shown besarabia proper (today's bugeac) as part of wallachia. from what i know, hungary never ruled bessarabia after year 1000 (hungarian tribes probably lived in the region before migrating to pannonia). i think you're talking about the port of killia, which was indeed ruled for some time in the 15th century by hungary and wallachia. the border is almost a straight line because nobody knows how much of moldavia did mircea rule. the border on the map is based on Petre Dan's description in <i>Hotarele românismului în date</i> (Litera International, Chişinău, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 973-675-278-X</a> -- <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 9975-74-902-X</a>) "Sud Cetatea Albă, Nord Cahul, Nord Tecuci, Sud Pasul Oituz" (south of <a href="../../../c/e/t/Cetatea_Alba_e4f3.html" title="Cetatea Alba">Cetatea Alba</a>, north of <a href="../../../c/a/h/Cahul.html" title="Cahul">Cahul</a>, north of <a href="../../../t/e/c/Tecuci.html" title="Tecuci">Tecuci</a>, south of Oituz mountain pass. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonimu_9d7a.html" title="User:Anonimu">Anonimu</a> 16:57, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I meant Chilia. I thought that was a part of Bessarabia. Thanks for the info, but do you know why Mircea received those lands from Hungary, and how Chilia became a Hungarian-Wallachian possession? I think Genova also had the port - or at least the fortress - but I don't know how they got it. They also had another fortress along the Nistru. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Candide, or Optimism</a> 17:19, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>sorry, mircea didn't receive them, one of the previous rulers of wallachia did. Amlas, Fagaras and Severin were given by <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_I_of_Hungary_6a27.html" title="Louis I of Hungary">Louis I of Hungary</a> to <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladislav_I_of_Wallachia_489d.html" title="Vladislav I of Wallachia">Vladislav I of Wallachia</a> in october 1366, after the second accepted the hungarian suzerainty. i don't know for sure how chilia became hungarian and wallachian. in 1435 it was still part of moldavia <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonimu_9d7a.html" title="User:Anonimu">Anonimu</a> 18:24, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I see. Well, I think that when it comes to Severin, it was not given, but returned to Wallachia. If you know of any books that cover this period of time in detail, pls let me know. I once had the history of Stefan cel Mare by Iorga, but was too young to read it.

Stefan allows the peasants to follow Giray and the armies meet near a forest, at Siret. The Tatar army flees across the Dniester, but few escape.

<p>This strikes me as racist: "si combaterea imigratiei asiatice si africane". You don't mention you want to stop immigration, you mention you want to stop immigration of asians and africans.

<p>I didn't even say i want to stop immigration. I mentioned only africans and asians because i thought no european or american so poor that he couldn't raise a child would come to Romania.

<p>În 17 septembrie va fi referendum în Transnistria legat de independenţa regiunii. Cu această ocazie probabil multă lume va căuta pe Wikipedia informaţii despre Transnistria. Am încercat să adaug în articol nişte informaţii legate de acest referendum, anume:</p>
<p>- faptul că mai multe organizaţii antiseparatiste au lansat un apel la boicotare, considerînd referendumul "farsă"</p>
<p>- faptul că din 46 de ţări membre ale Consiliului Europei, 45 sînt împotriva recunoaşterii referendumului, numai RUsia are altă părere</p>
<p>- faptul că datele Comisiei Electorale Centrale din Tiraspol au fost schimbate în mod ciudat, anume numărul total de alegători s-a micşorat cu 7% faţă de 2005, ceea ce ridică suspiciuni asupra unei încercări de creştere artificială a prezenţei la vot prin raportarea unui număr mai mic de alegători înregistraţi.</p>
<p>Totdeauna am dat lincurile care dovedesc cele scrise de mine, n-am născocit nimic din burtă.</p>
<p>Userul Willian Mauco, care pare fan Tiraspol, mereu mi-a şters adăugirile. (vezi istoria paginii)</p>
<p>Puteţi vedea la pagina de discuţii Transnistria ce argumente a adus. Anume: ăia care cer boicotarea referendumului din Transnistria sînt foşti KGB-işti, că aşa zice o organizaţie rusească de analiză (a dat un linc pentru asta). Întîi a spus că respectivii nici nu sînt din Transnistria, ci doar din Basarabia, dar i-am dovedit că unii dintre semnatarii apelului la boicot sînt transnistreni. Am fost împăciuitor, i-am zis că n-are decît să adauge părerea organizaţiei ruseşti că antiseparatiştii sînt foşti KGBişti, că n-are decît să-i considere pe cei care vor boicotarea referendumului drept băieţi răi, dar faptul în sine, că s-a cerut boicotarea referendumului, trebuie menţionat. Degeaba, mereu mi s-au şters adăugirile - pentru celelalte 2 fapte nici n-a adus argumente.</p>
<p>A mai fost o adăugire care a şters-o, despre arestarea a 4 persoane din Transnistria care sînt împotriva separatismului (între timp li s-a dat drumul). În cazul ăsta am renunţat eu să mai insist pentru includerea informaţiei în articol (deşi informaţia e incontestabilă), tocmai fiindcă n-am vrut să mă cert prea mult.</p>
<p>În perioada asta cînd agenţiile de ştiri vor menţiona referendumul de la Tiraspol, se va citi articolul Transnistria în Wikipedia poate mai mult decît într-un an întreg. De aia acum e nevoie să existe în articol informaţii despre contestarea corectitudinii referendumului. Nu cer să se menţioneze ca adevăr absolut faptul că referendumul e incorect, ci doar că există unii (OSCE, 45 din 46 ţări ale Consiliului Europei, unele organizaţii din zonă şi din Basarabia) care consideră asta. Vă cer de aceea sprijinul ca să interveniţi pe pagina de discuţii Transnistria pentru a susţine rămînerea informaţiei în pagină şi să repuneţi informaţia atunci cînd Mauco o şterge (eu nu pot să verific chiar 24 de ore din 24). Evitaţi atacurile suburbane, păstraţi ton civilizat. mulţumesc.</p>
<p>Who is William Mauco Here is an article about a Wikipedia celebrity, William Mauco, and his relations with the International Council for Democratic Institutions and State Sovereignty (ICDISS), an organisation "which seems to be a front organisation for a Kremlin-backed rogue statelet called Transdniestria" (quote from the article) <a href="http://0.bypass-filter.com/index.php?q=aHR0cDovL2Vkd2FyZGx1Y2FzLmJsb2dzcG90LmNvbS8yMDA2LzA4L2dvdGNoYS0yLmh0bWw%3D" class="external free" title="http://0.bypass-filter.com/index.php?q=aHR0cDovL2Vkd2FyZGx1Y2FzLmJsb2dzcG90LmNvbS8yMDA2LzA4L2dvdGNoYS0yLmh0bWw%3D" rel="nofollow">http://0.bypass-filter.com/index.php?q=aHR0cDovL2Vkd2FyZGx1Y2FzLmJsb2dzcG90LmNvbS8yMDA2LzA4L2dvdGNoYS0yLmh0bWw%3D</a></p>
<p>Edward Lucas wrote about Mauco: "The other lead is William Mauco. He has an extensive record of posting intelligent and fairly neutral entries on Wikipedia, not only about TD but about other unrecognised statelets. Crucially, these predate ICDISS's birthday of January 2006. And he also claims to have been at their conference in Mexico City in April of this year. I have written to him asking to get in touch, and had a friendly email in reply. I am planning to follow up this research in an article in European Voice at the end of August, so watch this space!"--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMariusM_97ae.html" title="User:MariusM">MariusM</a> 08:37, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>So do you guys still use the Ceauşescu textbooks? I have a friend who is a Peace Corps volunteer in a village an hour north of Bucharest and she said the general conception seems to be the place to learn Romanian history is not in Romania. Germany and France collaborated and made a common historical textbook for certain school classes, do you think Romania could ever collaborate on one with Hungary?</p>

<p>Greetings. I want to settle this dispute as quick as possible because there is no point of edit war. I was very surprised when I first read this article. I got the impression that it was all but of romanian origine, which is not true.</p>
<p>1.These lands have always been in the territory of the Bulgarian Empire since its very creation. When the principality emerged from Bulgaria in the mid 14th century it was not because its population was not Bulgarian but because of the feudalism which was now inluenced the previously centralised Balkan states (Bulgaria, Byzantium, Serbia). Karvuna was not the only one Bulgarian area which dropped from the central power, there were also Vidin Tsardom and various principalities in Macedonia which emerged from the collapsed Serbian empire. It is obvious that the population there was almost completely Slavic. See <a href="http://www.bgns.net/Bg/otech/history/sredna/maps.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bgns.net/Bg/otech/history/sredna/maps.html" rel="nofollow">Historical maps of medieval Bulgaria (in Bulgarian)</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Tehy were in the Bulgarian Empire only until 971 (if you ignore the numerous byzantine interventions on the danube during that period.. i could list them if you want). The next mention of Bulgarian in Dobruja is from Ivan Asenn II (1230's) and then agian no info until the byzantine sources of the 1320s. So no proof that Balik (the founder of the state) was ever a vasal of Bulgaria. Obvious to whom.... after 970 numerous people settled in Dobruja: Petchenegs, Cumans, Tatars and even Turks.(from what i know foreign -not BG, not RO - historians, even some Romanian ones, agree the rulers had a turkic origin, cumans and proto-gagauzes being the main candidates). That is a nationalistic site, and those maps are evidently amateurish.. i could draw similar maps with an oversized wallachia<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonimu_9d7a.html" title="User:Anonimu">Anonimu</a> 19:24, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>2.The very names Dobrotitsa, Ivanco, Theodor are Bulgarian =&gt;they were obviously Bulgarian feudal lords who took the opportunity to gain de facto independence from the weak central power. There were more than 60 de facto independent states in the Balkans in the late 14th century, you can't say that there were also 60 peoples, yes?</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Obviously" Bulgarian?

And Theodor is a name of Greek origin, not necessarily Bulgarian. Also bear in mind that the ethnicity was of minor importance during the Middle Ages (in comparison to the religion).

<p>3.In 19th century there were more than 100,000 Bulgarians in Northern Dobrudzha alone, these lands were given to romania not because its population was vlach or romanian but because Romania needed an outled to a sea and took this region as a compensation when the Russians seized Besarabia. --<a href="../../../g/l/i/User%7EGligan_469f.html" title="User:Gligan">Gligan</a> 15:45, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, the Byzantines made little difference between Bulgarians and Vlachs. In fact they rarely refer to the Bulgarians as "Bulgarians", they usually used Moesians, Vlachs, Barbarians, Slavs but this does not mean that the Bulgarians are Moesians or Vlachs or Barbarians. I have never written that Dobrudzha was ethnically pure. There were of course Vlachs, Tatar, Cumans, Byzantines, but they were fewer than the Bulgarians. --<a href="../../../g/l/i/User%7EGligan_469f.html" title="User:Gligan">Gligan</a> 16:15, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is very difficult to find reliable sourses about the poppulation od Dobrudzha in the 19th century. We should find the ethnic structure when the territory was Turk before 1878 because both romanian and Bulgarian sourses would be irreliabe. Neighter would I believe a romanian sourse, nor would you believe a Bulgarian one I suppose. I think that when the the region became Bulgarian and romanian both governments forced some of the Vlachs and Bulgarians respectively to write their ethnicity as the governments wanted to, While for the turk it didn't matter whether the Christian population there considerred itself Bulgarian or Vlach (they were simply infidels for them) so the ethnic structure of that period would be most reliable. So you can also search for this, not only me. And I also may ask you what your reliable sourse is. --<a href="../../../g/l/i/User%7EGligan_469f.html" title="User:Gligan">Gligan</a> 17:02, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First of all, the origin of the source (either Romanian or Bulgarian or Klingon) is irrelevant to me, as long as it is accepted as reliable by the majority of historians and it is based on facts, not on propaganda of any kind. So don't make any assumptions on my behalf. Second of all, it was you who made a statement, not me ("100,000 Bulgarians in Northern Dobruja in the 19th century" and that the "Vlachs, Tatar, Cumans, Byzantines [..] were fewer than the Bulgarians"), and I assume that when you make a statement you know what you're talking about. Asking me for sources in return is a puerile tactic - I haven't stated the contrary, I was just wondering where did you get all that from and whether you can put the money where your mouth is. <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMentatus_3908.html" title="User:Mentatus">Mentatus</a> 18:11, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The ethnic composition of Dobrudja in 1850 (during thurkish rule): 30% turk, 23% romanian, 14% bulgarian... you can find the full data taken from Encyclopedia of Islam (available also online, not free of course) at <a href="../../../d/o/b/Talk%7EDobruja_b41b.html#Trolling_by_Bogdan_and_Constantzeanu" title="Talk:Dobruja">Talk:Dobruja</a>... and unless every family had 50 members, that 100,000 you gave is impossible... Even more impossible considering the report of an italian diplomat ( <i>La Bulgaria ed il porto di Varna. Cenni descrittivi e statistici. Rapporto del R. vice-console sig. avv. Perrod in data 20 settembre 1864</i>) saying that bulgarians settled in Eastern Bulgaria only in the previous 40 years or Bulgarian historian L. Miletich that wrote in 1902 (<i>Старото българско население в северо-източна България</i>) that most bulgarians came in northern Dobruja in the previous century.<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonimu_9d7a.html" title="User:Anonimu">Anonimu</a> 19:24, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do not remember the exact name of the book in which I read this data, it may have been a nationalistic one (now I am in Sofia and the library I read this in in Plovdiv, so it would take time before I check). I would accept this census from 1850 BUT I will point out that this does not include southern Dobrudzha where the population was composed mainly of Bulgarians and Turks. If this is included both the Bulgarians and romanians would be approximately equal. Now we do not claim northern Dobrudzha, so this is not so important.</p>

<dd>No, it includes all dobruja. quote from EncIslam "At this date in the kadas of Tulca, Isakca, Macin, Hirsova, Babadagh, Kostendje, Mangalya, Pazardjik [ Dobrich, <i>n.n</i>], Balcik and Silistre were 4800 Turkish, 3656 Romanian, 2225 Tatar, 2214 Bulgarian"... so it includes all dobrich oblast and at least half of the silistra oblast (which has a strong population even today)<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonimu_9d7a.html" title="User:Anonimu">Anonimu</a> 08:07, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The main question here is the principality of Karvuna. Of course there were no population census in the Middle ages and I cannot prove that for instance the population consisted of 76,34% Bulgarians, 12,98% Vlachs and so on. So you may speculate that the population included huns, goths; you may say that half of the population of the Bulgarian Empire was Vlach, you may say "prove me wrong". How can I prove this?! How can you prove that the population of France was French not Frank or Celtic? But no one asks these questions: though the population in Europe was undoubtedly mixed in most of the continent, it is assumed that the population of what used to Bulgaria was mainly Bulgarian, the population of what was Wallachia used to be Vlach and so on. And as the region of Dobrudzha was always within Bulgaria, it makes sense that its majority was Bulgarian. If the Tatars were majority they would have joined the Golden horde, if it was Vlach it would have joined Wallachia, but the fact is that it always remained in Bulgaria and I have stated above the reasons why it split from the central power.</p>

<dd>It's ludacrious to claim that a zone controled by an medieval Empire had the omonyme population... It's like we'd claim Eastern Bulgaria was mainly russian between 968 and 971, then mainly greek between 971 and the 1200s then again Bulgarian for some years, then Tatar...etc. Again it has not been always within Bulgaria... it was in 681-968, and the southern portion was Bulgaria also in 986-1000 and for some years in the 1200s... and if we go back in time, it was roman or byzantine between 46 AD and 681. In those times region didn't join empires, they were conquered by empires, so it's again irrelevant. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonimu_9d7a.html" title="User:Anonimu">Anonimu</a> 08:07, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The well-established historic truth says that Dobrotitsa was a Bulgarian and ruled over the Bulgarian Principality of Karvuna. Apparently the romanians are creating a new history. ...how smart of them... but the historical documents tell nothing about serious presence of Vlachs in Dobrudzha during the Middle Ages, and do not tell me that the Byzantines use "vlach" sometimes considerring some Bulgarian Emperors, because the same byzantines have called the moesians, cumans, huns, you name it. Thus the Byzantines wanted to humiliate in a way the Bulgarians. It is not an honorable action to speculate with history.</p>

<dd>What well-established historians? Both Iorga and Inalcik are respected historians (btw, Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, a very authoritative source, calls Dobro "Walachian prince").

<p>For example if I say that Vladislav I of Wallachia was a Bulgarian and ruled over Wallachia populated by Bulgarian and Vlachs as a vassal of the Bulgarian Emperor (the last one is true, see the article for <a href="../../../i/v/a/Ivan_Alexander_of_Bulgaria_9697.html" title="Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria">Ivan Alexander</a>, there is plenty of literature there) how can you prove me wrong!?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I can't. I doubt that Vladislav was a Bulgarian vassal. First, it had received feuds in Transylvania from the Hungarian king for his vassalage... but no feud from Ivan Alexander... Second, it minted it's own coin that imitated the Hungarian ones (as Dobrotici did)... very unusual for a vasal to have it's own coin..

<dd>Well... then the map you gave me means nothing, too... But the fact is that you have no documents to show that these lands were Byzantine in the period (681-1000, 1185-14th cent.); just this logically: after the battle of Ongala, the Bulgarians established capital Pliska to the south, how is this possible for the byzantines to hold the area of the lower Danube just to the north of the Bulgarian capital????, it is just impossible. So you must try very hard to find sourses for byzantine presence in that period, because these does not exist.</dd>

<p>Hey, I think it's a bit silly... to Romanian articles we're usually adding old, actual names which are often very different phonologically from your variants. You're adding Bulgarian names written in Romanian to our articles (<i>Vidin</i>, <i>Şabla</i>, <i>Caliacra</i>)... this is stupid, everyone can check the rules of your script somewhere and <i>transliterate</i> Cyrillic into it. What I suggest: foreign names should be added only if they're special with something, not just dumb transliterations or adaptations, unless they've got anything to do with minorities. <i><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Todor</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">→</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Bozhinov</a></i> 10:33, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The same goes for reading a book about your cities in the Middle Ages. That's why it's best to make a redirect and only list the name in a relevant historical section. Also, to be precise, one needs to read a Romanian book written after 1919 and before 1940, not just before 1940.</dd>
<dd><i>Tulcha</i> is just a phonetic rendition, but <i>Harsovo</i> is a pretty different thing, possibly related to <a href="../../../h/o/r/Hors.html" title="Hors">Hors</a>, and it's an old variant. <i>Diiu</i> is OK, it's pretty interesting and there's some limited Bulgarian-identifying Vlach-speaking population west of the city. I would suggest including it in the body just like the Hungarian <i>Bodony</i>. I'd recommend the same for obsolete Bulgarian names like <i>Harsovo</i> and <i>Holavnik</i>. <i><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Todor</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">→</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Bozhinov</a></i> 12:29, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here's my suggestion (see also <a href="../../../g/l/i/User_talk%7EGligan_1dd5.html#Gligan" title="User talk:Gligan">Gligan's talk page</a>): The rule for adding a name of a place/town/region in another language should be:</p>

<li>a significant minority lives or lived there</li>
<li>the place/town/region had OFFICIALLY that name</li>

<dd>Look, Anonimu. When these towns were in the Bulgarian Empire, their official name was the same I have given. You are constantly provoking me and I have the feeling that you are trying to insult and mock me (with great success, I should say that if this is your aim you have achieved it). When I provide sourses you keep silence, and even when I provide them you do not accept them without reason. I give you facts, sourses, maps; you give me NOTHING. I went to the National Library to search references for you and you still show no respect toward my effords. It is very easy only to ignore without reason as you do it.</dd>

<dd>German and Hungarian sources are seldom used for events of Bulgarian history, and Turkish sources have no relation to anything but the 14th-15th century, which is the very end of our empire. Romanian was used for a relatively short period in this part of Dobruja, so only publications between 1918 and 1940 would use it, and not all of them at all.</dd>
<dd>Hǎr<u>s</u>ov<u>o</u> (if you'd like that transliteration) is a different name, it's Slavic (perhaps <a href="../../../h/o/r/Hors.html" title="Hors">Hors</a> + <a href="../../../-/o/v/-ovo.html" title="-ovo">-ovo</a>). The modern Bulgarian one is Hǎr<u>š</u>ov<u>a</u>, which is phonetically the same as the current Romanian rendition of the older Slavic name.</dd>
<dd>As for Mentatus' suggestions, the main flaws are what is considered official and what is considered a significant minority. <i><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Todor</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">→</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Bozhinov</a></i> 13:06, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To Gligan and Todor: Well, I think the rules are pretty fair, bearing in mind that the purpose of inserting the historical name in an article should be adding more information about the history of the place, not to make irredentist claims (e.g. I don't think the Greeks - or at least the majority of the Greeks - claim <a href="../../../i/s/t/Istanbul.html" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> nowadays).

<p>A lot of the Romanian names are also just renditions.

<dd>I do not think so. Around 7-9 Medieval Bulgarian documents have survived, excluding those related fully to the Church. By your logic I cannot give the Bulgarian names even to our towns not to mention the towns in Greece and Turkey which have their Bulgarian names written. As archaic Bulgarian names such as <i>Холъвник</i> exist it is obvious that these towns were called like this when they used to be Bulgarian. Nowadays no one in Bulgaria refer to Turnu Magurele as Holavnik or to Drobeta-Turnu Severin as Severin, so these names were only used in the past when these towns were Bulgarian.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I will repeat again, your logic is not not reliable. If I follow it, it would seem that as there are no contemporary document in which is written that Lovech or Silistra or Pernik was within Bulgaria, consequently you may say that these were not in Bulgaria, which is ridiculous.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You know very well that in the Middle Ages no one called Turnu Magurele for instance with its contemporary name, how did they called it then???</dd>

<p>The Early and late Middle Age Bulgarian names did not change. Vidin was always calles Bdin, Silistra-Drastar, Sofia-Sredets and so on. In the history section section of all these towns (I mean Severin, Orsovo, Turnu Magurele) is written that they existed since Roman times, so they existed in the Middle Ages too. And when thay were Bulgarian it is not possible that they were called Turnu, Drobeta or anything like this. How do you imagine that the Bulgarians would have created their names later, after their rule has vanished?? That makes no sense.</p>
<p>Also their origin. Severin may have come from the Bulgarian <i>Sever</i> which means North, Orşava originates from Orsovo and -ovo is typical Slavic sufix.</p>
<p>Please wait Todor and Mentatus to write their opinion. Write in your page, so that they would easily follow our thoughts. --<a href="../../../g/l/i/User%7EGligan_469f.html" title="User:Gligan">Gligan</a> 14:03, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The fact that an important settlement existent in ancient times doesn't necesarily imply a continous inhabitations. The only thing that could certify this would be the continuity of the placename(Rome,Athens, London, even Paris), but this is not the case. SO uless they're mentioned in Bulgarian documents, there's no proof they've existed in that period. You don't need a rule over a city to have a different name for it. There are numerous examples of exonyms that have nothing to do with a foreign rule. Severin may also come from the roman emperor Severus, while "ova" means field in Turkish, and that would make perfect sense considering the geography of the place.<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonimu_9d7a.html" title="User:Anonimu">Anonimu</a> 14:48, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do not know Ronamian but I think that for 1940 it was written 40,000 Romanians in the Vidin district, not in the town, and I think that the Vlchs mainly populated the villages. Also I could not find that this sourse cites the Bulgarian census for thses years. I will go to the National Library again and will try to find the census data from the period 1900-1940.</dd>

<dd>Yeah, but Bulgarian names for Bucharest and Braila are just cyrillic rendition for the Romanian names... while "Vidin" and "Diiu" are very different. Moreover, while the vlach population in Vidin is autochtonous, the ones in Bucharest and Braila were people who had run from Ottoman occupied Bulgaria.<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonimu_9d7a.html" title="User:Anonimu">Anonimu</a> 15:53, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

In optica mea nu prea vad o diferenta mare intre moldovenii din moldova si cei din RM si cred ca e o mare greseala ca Wikipedia a lasat sa faca acest articol. E un articol foarte subiectiv. Moldovenii fac totii parte din graiul romanesc, deci vreau sa vad foarte clar ce e diferenta si asta nu vad in acest articol, calitativ slab de tot. Cred ca e un lucru foarte prost sa te lasi influentat de un regim anti-romanesc si pro-sovietic. In fine, inca n-am scapat de romanofobie, asta e.</p>

Daca eu vreau sa ma consider Italian, zic ca sunt Italian, dar ce argumente (ma refer la argumente ethologice) am? Asta nu inteleg nici la Moldoveni, ptr a fi un popor separat tre' sa ai o identitate diferita si eu cred ca asta nu exista. Chiar daca te uiti la intelectualitatea moldoveneasca, ea zice in majoritate ca moldovenii fac parte din graiul romanesc. Deci principalele probleme care le am cu acest articol sunt ca nu vad diferenta intre moldovenii din moldova si cei din RM si a doua e ca nu cred in obiectivitatea recensamuntului moldovean.

<dd>Russia — the Russia of Alexander Nevsky, of Dostoyevsky, of Solzhenitsyn, of Saint John of Kronstadt, of Tsar Nicholas, of Andrei Sakharov — Russia <big><big>≠</big></big> the USSR! In my view, any self-respecting Russian is a strident anti-Soviet, anti-Communist. It is possible - eminently possible - to love the Russian people and loathe the USSR with all one's heart, at the same time; after all, the Great Russian people were the biggest victims of communism (except perhaps the Chinese people). <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBiruitorul_cab6.html" title="User:Biruitorul">Biruitorul</a> 20:25, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, let me note that Romania had good reason to take the Cadrilater: it was Romanian territory, and Bulgaria had just been defeated. Furthermore, there were no Soviets in Romania in June 1940 either, so your argument makes little sense?</dd>
<dd>No, the Orthodox Russia that worhsipped God and didn't set up Gulags where tens of millions perished. And anyway, since when is Sakharov an absolutist? Or Solzhenitsyn? Or Galina Starovoitova? Or Saint Andrei Rublev? Or Saint Maria Skobtsova? Even Tsar Nicholas was a constitutional monarch for most of his reign. You just can't compare the two Russias.

<dd>Ah, and one other point: I'd say Stalin was quite absolutist himself, wouldn't you? The Holodomor was quite an exploitation, wasn't it? The point is: why can't you say, "Yes, I'm a communist, but I admit that much of what was done in Russia between 1917 and 1991 in the name of communism was pure evil, and especially between 1929 and 1953'? If Palmiro Togliatti could do it, if, for goodness' sake, Nikita Khrushchev, the Butcher of the Ukraine, could do something like it, then why can't you? <b>A régime that kills millions of people is only worthy of condemnation.</b> Was the Tsarist government perfect? No. Was Yeltsin the ideal ruler? Far from it.

<p>Do you have a citation that proves he "ordered the killing of hundreds of thousand of jews"? Those were revenge killings, but he also saved many Jews, especially in the Regat. No, they had no right to shoot. They were agents of atheistic Bolshevism. Even if it's 100, even 50, it's still a massacre.

<dd>He wanted to set an example. It was wrong for him to have issued that order, but that doesn't necessarily make him a Holocaust perpetrator. Anyway, a true Holocaust perpetrator would not have spared hundreds of thousands (not "some") of Regat and other Jews. As he said during his trial, "Am fost prezentat ca dictator. Ştim că aceştia extermină pe adversarii lor. Eu pe cine am exterminat?... Nici un evreu care a fugit din Transnistria şi apoi a fost judecat in ţară nu a fost executat." No, war is only legitimate if it is in defence of Orthodoxy, not to spread Bolshevism, so they had no such right. And yes, I know very well that they were Bolshevik atheists. No, the killing of 200 people is in no way a "figurative" massacre.

Not every Jew killed in WWII in Europe was a victim of the Holocaust. They were victims, but not necessarily Holocaust victims. Holocaust perpetrators don't set up theatres for Jews, and they don't protect them by the hundreds of thousands either.

<dd>Care to cite? I can't <i>prove</i> I'm not one, but I can say I'm not one, and I do say that. No, maybe because they realised he had done a great service to Romania by taking power after the disaster of 1940 and doing his best to reverse that. Was he a perfect man? No, and he shouldn't have killed the Jews he did. But he still accomplished a lot of good. That's your definition. The theatre was set up by the Iron Guard but only became operational under Antonescu. It's difficult to determine precisely who was and was not responsible, and where the boundaries of the Holocaust begin or end. These are debatable matters - see Paul Goma. I will insult Islam, because Islam <i>as a religion</i> is a false doctrine, as are all non-Orthodox ones. I have nothing against Muslims as individuals. I certainly have nothing against Russians, who (along with the Chinese) were the greatest victims of Communism for 74 years. The Hindus come next.

<p>Yes, otherwise you lack credibility. I don't speak like one. Millions of Jews were killed in Europe in WWII. He at least tried to regain Romania's honour; she (and, by implication, the Church) had lost huge chunks of territory without a fight, and that was unacceptable. Paul Goma is a hero in the fight against Ceauşism. If someone called Orthodoxy false, I would engage him in debate and convince him that it is the truth (unlike <a href="http://seekerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/_blogger_5932_1957_1600_religion_of_peace_1-1.jpg" class="external text" title="http://seekerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/_blogger_5932_1957_1600_religion_of_peace_1-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">some Muslims</a>).

<p>No, I'm not: as I said in this discussion: "Millions of Jews were killed in Europe in WWII". The other nations were a minority; the majority rules. They spoke out on RFE. Here's what you said: "Don't you think you should invite some Russians too (as Russia received the Soviet Union's seat in the UN)&#160;? They could present the Soviet POV." My answer: Russians who present the Soviet POV are not good Russians. My kind of Russians are Tsar Nicholas, Solzhenitsyn, Saint John of Kronstadt, etc. Just because something is in Wikipedia does not make it true; a template suggesting more than a passing link between Integralism and Fascism does not strengthen that link. You are neither the Father, nor the Son, nor the Holy Ghost. <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBiruitorul_cab6.html" title="User:Biruitorul">Biruitorul</a> 22:55, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>my friend, you're beginning to tread on some thin ice. You have called Biruitorul an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Fântâna_Albă_incident&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119458553" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Fântâna_Albă_incident&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119458553" rel="nofollow">ultranationalist</a>, and now a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Biruitorul&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=119533512" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Biruitorul&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=119533512" rel="nofollow">holocaust denier, fundamentalist and perhaps even Iron Guard member.</a> Remember that Wikipedia has <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">a policy against that sort of thing</a>, which I would advise you to respect. <a href="../../../k/2E/_/User%7EK._Lastochka_8064.html" title="User:K.

<p>"Prove"? I'd like to see you try. He is not a Holocaust denier, not an ultranationalist (he is a nationalist, but not of an especially destructive variety), and I seriously doubt he is a member of the Iron Guard. <a href="../../../k/2E/_/User%7EK._Lastochka_8064.html" title="User:K.
