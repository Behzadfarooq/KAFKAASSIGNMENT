<dd>We all here have good intentions but sometimes just don't agree with each other. Muslims have respect for the word "Allah" but on the other hand, many Non-Muslims think Muslims are worshiping a different God. I am really angry at Martin Luther. This guy, I believe, had a significant share in Non-Muslim's misunderstanding of Islam. Timothy thinks we should keep the word "Allah" in Qur'anic quotes but use "God" in the text itself. It seems to me to be a good idea. What do you think Anonymous editor? Again, I know that the word "Allah" by itself is important for Muslims.</dd>
<dd>Let me provide another example: It is about the words "Messiah", "christ" and "anointed". They all have the same meaning. According to Gary Miller:" The meaning of the Hebrew word "Messiah" is "God's anointed." Gary Miller claims that "Even Cyrus the Persian is called 'Messiah,' or 'the anointed,' in Isaiah Chapter 45. This verse has been translated in a misleading way...Here, when it refers to Cyrus, they translated the Hebrew word "Messiah" with "God's anointed." But in places where the Bible is talking about Jesus, when the term "Messiah" appears, instead of translating it as "anointed," they simply transliterate it so that it reads "Messiah." This word "Messiah" is in the Greek equivalent written as "Christ" and in fact often appears this way in the Greek <a href="../../../s/e/p/Septuagint.html" title="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>. Miller claims that there is a conspiracy to give us the impression that there is only one Messiah, one Christ and no other."</dd>

<dd>"Again, I know that the word "Allah" by itself is important for Muslims." - it shouldn't be, as the phrase al-ilah, from which Allah derives, has been used for false gods as well. It is in truth as arbitrary as English God, a mere artifact of linguistic history, not any kind of personal name of God.</dd>

<dd>Timothy, please do a favor to me. It may seem strange to you but Many Muslim have veneration for some words (especially "Allah"). They think God is better to be called by the names "Allah"&#160;; "Al-Rahman" (the mercyful) and so on. Please, please understand them. It is quite natural that they want to use these words. Had I not seen how some Non-Muslims have misunderstood Islam because of these words, I would not have liked changing the arabic words to english ones. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 09:55, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes it was pretty good. I had some problems with it and I fixed them. The introduction is different adds more besides Timothy's version and that's probably what I like better than his version. But I still think that it should be understood that there was a reason these articles are like this in the first place. He should stop thinking that his edits are the best ones that ever happened.

<p>Thanks Anonymous Editor. How was my summary for "Islamic concept of God"?</p>
<p>One thing: It was pointed out that "The One God" is not grammatically correct (though it is Islamically correct; The verse 2:133 precisely says "The One Allah" and I was reminded of this verse when I saw your edit). Maybe we should say "The One True God"? But I don't know if this phrase has been appeared in Qur'an or not. I would like to use a Qur'anic phrase. Any suggestion? --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 05:34, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Salaam,</p>
<p>I'm quite confused about a dispute between me and some other members on the page: <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_and_anti-Semitism_a000.html" title="Islam and anti-Semitism">Islam and anti-Semitism</a>. It is not really a "dispute", since NOBODY has responded to anything on the talk page. What is happening is that someone is reverting my edits constanstly. I've tried to edit the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed&#160;:"After Muhammad's efforts to convert the Jews of Yathrib failed [citation needed],", since nobody came up with a source for that.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Removed: "since the Sabbath is a commandment which (according to Islam) God demanded of Jews but not of his other followers", since nobody came up with a source for that.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Put the Quranic verses (The Proof 6-7) in context. I have merely completed the quote.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Created a new section called "Historic and modern Muslim respect for Jews", because "Muslim denunciation of Anti-Semitism" doesn't fit into the "Historic events of Muslim persecution of Jews" section.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Added one more prominent Muslim (i.e. <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harun_Yahya_5528.html" title="Harun Yahya">Harun Yahya</a>) who opposes anti-Semitism.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've posted this info on <a href="../../../i/s/l/Talk%7EIslam_and_anti-Semitism_d0f5.html" title="Talk:Islam and anti-Semitism">the talk page</a>, but no one seems to respond to me. All the users seem to be interested in is reverting my edits. Can you please comment on what's going on? I seriously don't understand.

<p>Hey, I was wondering if you could help me out with this. Recently, a whole section was removed from the article <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_and_anti-Semitism_a000.html" title="Islam and anti-Semitism">Islam and anti-Semitism</a>. This section was called "Historic Muslim respect for Jews", a parallel to the section "<a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_and_anti-Semitism_a000.html#Historic_events_of_Muslim_persecution_of_Jews" title="Islam and anti-Semitism">Historic events of Muslim persecution of Jews</a>". The argument underlying the removal was that this section "did not belong to the article".</p>
<p>Firstly, did the section indeed not belong to the article?</p>
<p>Secondly, if it didn't, is there another article in wikipedia where this section would belong.</p>
<p>Thirdly, would it be appropriate to create an article which accomodates this section along with other views.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 18:53, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Anonymous editor, It was unbelievable to see the unfactual and unneutral quality of the Muslim POV in such an important article like Jesus! Please have a look! I made lots of changes. I think Muslim editors need to pay more attention to Christian related pages. I remember I had the same impression with <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvation.html" title="Salvation">Salvation</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sin.html" title="Sin">sin</a> articles. Muslim editors usually don't look at those articles so they do not represent Muslim POV accurately enough. Thanks to Timothy for directing me to the Jesus article. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 07:48, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's what it does need to imply. It should say that because then we know that the importance is of himself as a figure and not that of him only being a perspective of the Christian figure. It's not simply Islamic views of Jesus, it's Jesus as a different figure. I think Timothy made it very clear why he wants to move it when he said <i>"He is *not* "by himself" an important figure in Islam, and yes, the only reason he appears in the Qur'an is as a rebuttal of Christian heresy, and to establish Muhammad as the legitimate sucessor to Jesus, the central figure of the dominant religion of Muhammad's time.Timothy Usher 21:20, 8 May 2006 (UTC)"</i> --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 21:51, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Aiden, I think that Isa is the best, but prophet of Islam will be the only compromise. The reason is that the title makes it clear that he is a prophet in Islam and the Jesus article already has the christian view so people will never confuse it. And the intro will say that the name is actually Isa. I think the article was fine before this entire moving problem was started by Timothy, but that a title that makes it clear that he is important enough as a prophet and major figure in Islam is the closest to Isa. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 21:45, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But Aiden, the <i>Jesus in Islam</i>, or <i>Islamic views of Jesus</i> are a problem because it's not only a persective of the Christian figure. Prophet in Islam shows that he is an important figure by himself too. Isa is the best for that reason but most other people agree with that as the compromise. Jesus in Islam or Islamic views are not the compromises and will be more confusing. Any further moves should go to RM or the article not be moved. If it does go to RM and no consensus is found then it will stay at Isa. This is why Jesus (prophet in Islam) is the best. And it doesn't have POV connotations now since it says that he's a prophet only in that religion. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 22:05, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Though I do agree with your views, Anonym, that if Isa is important enough to warrant his own article, there should be one.

<dd>Dear Brother, your comments on the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Template_talk%7EIslam_bf35.html" title="Template talk:Islam">template_talk:Islam</a> has been counted as a vote and its put under the neutral section. Many muslims agree that Shahada should be used as the logo of the template. In my opinion Islam template is the only template that doesn't contain a logo that is significantly related to the religion. The image looks like the Taj mahal. The image I have proposed relates to three different areas in Islam, .i.e</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Shahada - Proclamation of faith</li>
<li>The masjid</li>
<li>And finaly Islamic caligraphy</li>
</ol>
<p>If you could only reconsider your vote in favour of this we could have three different aspects of Islam represented in one image. I earnestly request you to reconsider your comments in favor of the current image. please <a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMyst%C3%ACc_07bb.html" title="User:Mystìc"><span style="color:white;background:#008">&#160;<span style="background:#009">«<span style="background:#00a">₪<span style="background:#00b">M<span style="background:#00c">ÿ<span style="background:#00e">š</span>†</span>í</span>c</span>₪</span>»&#160;</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../m/y/s/User_talk%7EMyst%C3%ACc_4c6e.html" title="User talk:Mystìc"><font size="-2">(T)</font></a></sup> 16:58, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks brother.. But the sad part is the editors who are not for it would still use your neutrality as a negative vote. I perfectly understand voting is evil in wikipedia, but as you can clearly see, I've been pushed for voting here.. So honestly if you think my image is good for the above reasons I have given, could you kindly move your vote to <i>for it</i>.. this way nobody will loose.. And you are not doing anything against your conscious as you dont mind either image. <a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMyst%C3%ACc_07bb.html" title="User:Mystìc"><span style="color:white;background:#008">&#160;<span style="background:#009">«<span style="background:#00a">₪<span style="background:#00b">M<span style="background:#00c">ÿ<span style="background:#00e">š</span>†</span>í</span>c</span>₪</span>»&#160;</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../m/y/s/User_talk%7EMyst%C3%ACc_4c6e.html" title="User talk:Mystìc"><font size="-2">(T)</font></a></sup> 18:24, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Greetings. I wanted to suggest that the article on Terrorism in Kashmir be renamed to Indo-Pakistan conflict in Kashmir or Kashmir conflict or something and simply discuss both terrorism/insurgency and state repression. Also, it could be re-written for more neutrality and monitored to stay that way. Just a suggestion.

<p><i>Anonymous editor, you were wrong in blocking Timothy</i></p>
<p>Anonymous editor, A big chunk of the discussions on the Joturner's RfA is rooted in your wrong decision of blocking Timothy. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 22:07, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I blocked Timothy? No I never blocked him, maybe you are thinking of someone else. And I see no discussion about that on the rfa. I see some people's own personal pov over what types of people can be made administrators and others who were contacted simply to oppose. It's a very horrible mess and I think that Joturner did not want to put up with it anymore . But it's silly to think that poor Timothy's block ever had anything to do at all with Joturner. But I'm sure he'll try now to use it as a reason even if it's obvious that he would have opposed anyways. Joturner could have passed if he had waited, but I see why he would withdraw. I also hope that you stay and don't leave wikipedia because of editors like Timothy. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 19:13, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was unhappy to see it fail, but I agree with Kusma that it probably saved a lot of time against some pretty pointless arguments, many lies and lots of vote advertising by some opposing editors. What was really troubling was how it failed for almost the same reasons as before. It might still have passed if you continued but don't worry about it. But the rfa was a very bad case of incivility but you showed in your responses that you would make a good admin. I just wish that you would change your userpage back like the part about Identity. It's your own page and it's very interesting. Some editors would have opposed even if you didn't have a userpage. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 20:15, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't anticipate making major changes to my user page at this point. In its current state, I honestly don't see any promotion of Islam; I hardly mention that I'm a Muslim. And so, in the upcoming weeks, I most likely won't make too many changes. Perhaps I'll rephrase some of the more <i>contentious</i> axioms. However, I feel there is an extent to which I am willing to do this as, like you said, some editors will continue to oppose no matter what I do to my userpage. And as I personally don't see what the big deal is (now that I removed the admittedly overly Islamocentric information) I see no reason to sacrifice a healthy level of individuality just to gain adminship months from now. Perhaps I'll change my mind in the future, but as of right now, I see current quibbles about the userpage unsubstantiated. <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">joturn</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">r</a> 04:17, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, I doubt that I could have actually passed. The RfA was getting ugly and many people were beginning to vote oppose (or change their votes to oppose) as a result of the ugly appearance of the RfA and the comments raised by the most opinionated objectors. Promotion after such a terribly ugly RfA seems hard for me to believe. <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">joturn</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">r</a> 04:17, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article is under attack by anti-Muslim editors. Pecher believes that it is a FACT that Aisha was six years old when she married Muhammad. He also seems to want to use the "legacy" section as an indictment of Islam. I need some backup. Where are all the Muslim editors?</p>
<p>Not that I always get along with the Muslim editors, as you know. Trying to stay neutral is turning my hair from grey to white. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 21:36, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your edits negligently mischaracterize the cited sources.

<dd>Actually I moved that sentence from another part of the paragraph that has been recently messed and repeated. And also it would be better for you to provide specific cites than giving a link to several pages of hadith.

<dd>Hi. Please read the fourth paragraph</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Islamic extremist violence is not synonymous with all terrorist activities committed by Muslims. <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalist.html" title="Nationalist">Nationalist</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/p/Separatist.html" title="Separatist">separatist</a>, and occasionally <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxist-Leninist_65ee.html" title="Marxist-Leninist">Marxist-Leninist</a> organizations in the Muslim world often derive inspiration from secular ideologies. These are not well described as either Islamic extremist or Islamist.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So the case of Kashmiri people fighting to separate Indian controlled kashmir from India does not mean it's Islamic extremist terrorism just because they are mostly Muslim. The other attacks are not proven or sourced. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 15:56, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, Please read this from the article: "The central fact is that overwhelmingly suicide-terrorist attacks are not driven by religion as much as they are by a clear strategic objective: to compel modern democracies to withdraw military forces from the territory that the terrorists view as their homeland. From Lebanon to Sri Lanka to Chechnya to Kashmir to the West Bank, every major suicide-terrorist campaign — over 95 percent of all the incidents — has had as its central objective to compel a democratic state to withdraw." <a href="http://www.amconmag.com/2005_07_18/article.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amconmag.com/2005_07_18/article.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></dd>

<dd>World has declared major terrorist orginazations of Kashmir as Terrorist and not freedom fighters and their attacks as acts of Terrorism. Here, we are concerned with Terrorist attacks. How can you justify that Terrorist attacks on Hindu holy city, hindu temples and Hindus is not an act of Terrorism? How can selective killing of hindus is not an attack of terrorism? How can you distinguish between these attacks and other examples of attack here? Do you want to hide all terrorist attacks on Indians and Hindus under this so called "freedon fighters"? All three examples of attacks are proven. Instead of deleating them selectively, you should ask for citations. No example here is with citation but you selectively removed Terrorist attacks on Hindus , Hindu Holy city and Hindu temples.
