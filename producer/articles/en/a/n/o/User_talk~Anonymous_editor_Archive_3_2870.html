<p>I've done two reverts and I can't do any more. Zeno has replaced a section on sources with his version touting Ibn Ishaq as the only real source on Muhammad and claiming that it is deprecated by Muslims because ... and then he lists every single accusation against Muhammad that he can find in Ibn Ishaq. It's transparently POV. Zeno and Coolcat are reverting to keep it in place.

<p>I noticed that you are against people throwing their extreme POV's in other's faces. Well, I've noticed that you're not exactly following that yourself. For example, in the Islam talk page, you were throwing all these alledged "hate crimes" that Christians supposedly committed at other users. Now, don't get me wrong. I'M not going to go bashing other's religions. I'm a Christian, and we're not supposed to go committing hate crimes.

<p>Regarding the section <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abrahamic_religion.html#Evangelism" title="Abrahamic religion">Abrahamic religion#Evangelism</a>: you posted that "Islam does not permit forcing someone" to convert. This prohibition is not consistently followed - there has often been a disconnect between practiced Islam and ideal Islam.

<p>According to my searches online, I must say that the word <i>Musselman</i> has no religious connotation with Islam when Nazis used it to describe Jews prisioners. I also found many places, notable people and including a Geometrical theorem. Therefore, I just listed all usaged of the word in that section to avoid controversy. However, the article looks now as deviation form the main subject. So, one of the two, weather we accept that or remove all at once as the <i>Mussulman</i> word has no religious connotation.

<p>... For teaching me about getting started on Wikipedia. I am a fast learner, just overwhelmed with the amount of material here and the structure - I will get a handle and make myself uesful soon, InshaAllah. I love the wiki technology, and I want to use it to develop open interactive forums for various topical communities in Pakistan, where I live. I have noted your contributions on the topics I am most interested in at the moment (religious/ Islamic to be spec.). Very worthwhile. Jazak-Allah. We'll keep talking.</p>

<p>Hi, I'm examining this debate with a view to closing it. I notice that you removed a vote from the debate, on the grounds that it was "unsigned". <b>YOU MUST NOT DO THIS</b>. I recognise that you did this with the best of intentions, but it is not permitted. I routinely step through every single edit on a deletion debate, and by the end of it I know more about each editor than (almost) their own mother.

<p>Greetings ... looks like I had signed out for the night just before you left me the message about the anon vandal. Yes, Dmcdevit is right, it was a dynamic IP so the editor gets a new one with each sign-on or dial-up; blocking those people usually has limited value. Protecting the article, or waiting until the vandal gets bored, is usually the best approach, if reason fails -- and I'm a bit puzzled as to why the editor wasn't willing to talk about that picture and discuss it rationally, but there's no accounting for some people's unreasonableness ... oh well. I hope the protection solves the problem for the time being.

<p>Anonym, Shafi3i seems to be a traditionalist Shafi'i, and linkspamming for an anti-Salafi site. He is linking the site to six articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../t/a/w/Tawhid.html" title="Tawhid">Tawhid</a></li>

<li><a href="../../../f/r/i/Friday_prayer.html" title="Friday prayer">Friday prayer</a></li>
</ul>
<p>He feels that all of these articles have a Salafi slant and that his site is necessary medicine. It would be MUCH BETTER if he actually rewrote the articles involved so that they present both the Salafi and the traditionalist view. Linkspamming to get your point across is a bad tactic, and lazy. I'm tired and cranky and perhaps I didn't approach him the best way. If you can convince him to rewrite rather than linkspam, please do. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 06:15, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

It was not link spamming. I am contributing and editing some posts in a NOPV way in the english section. Added few links here and there and she made it a "big plan to impose" as she told me. Within a month i have written in another wiki section more articles than some can produce in a year . I understood that Zora is a muslim. Saying lazy about another muslim is Gossip and backbiting. Why would I come to wikipedia try to do something and then get into all this mess with zora and others? I came here to enjoy and help. It seems i was wrong. I am out of here.</p>
<p>I did not link the site to those six articles. I was linking different pages of the site to the relevant articles. I would like you to help me convince her that distorting the truth is wrong.</p>
<p>n.b. If you are interested i have attended cornell (M.S) and MIT (PhD) add to it a degree in Islam (UsuL Al Fiqh) from Al Azhar university.</p>

<dd>Hey, I'm not a Muslim, I'm a Buddhist. If you have a degree from Al Azhar you're just what we need! But we have to play by the rules that exist here. It takes a while to learn the rules. I'm not sure that I've learned them all myself. But I have been fighting various kinds of linkspamming for more than a year, and what you're doing doesn't seem all that different from the stuff I'm fighting. How about we work together to correct any Salafi bias in the articles? I don't want to see it reign unchecked any more than you do. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 07:40, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that "prophet of Islam" is pushing the boundaries of POV (it assumes that there is a "thing" called Islam, which exists independently of the prophet or his/her community) and "final prophet" is definitely POV because it assumes as fact that there IS a thing called Islam and that Muhammad is the last, definitive prophet. That's pure Muslim dogma, and it's POV. Some people would say that they are Muslims AND that they think there have been later prophets. Yes, I know you'd consider them marginal kooks, but they exist.</p>
<p>If you want Wikipedia to combat bigotry re Islam, then you're going to have to accept that we don't have any credibility unless we are seen as scrupulously neutral. If you try to turn Islam-related articles into apologia, you're playing right into the hands of the bigots who see any neutral commentary as biased. They'll point to your edits and say, "See, there is a conspiracy to use Wikipedia to preach Islam".

<p>Well, if was so eager to make the article concerned a featured one, I should have nominated it for a featured status by now.. You wanna say that Kashmiris r not Indians.. my parents are Kashmiri pandits and they r proud of their Indian passports. U r saying that Indian soldiers are ordered to kill Kashmiri civilians, now thats wat I call totally unbiased view... they r ordered to kill... but those killed by Indian troops are either terrorists, civilians helping these terrorists and civilians who unfortunately happen to pass across the line of fire. India is a democratic nation and no democratic govt will order its military to kill its own civilians for no freakin reason.. tell me what will the Indian govt. gain by killin its own civilians.. The only people who accuse New Delhi of carrying state terrorism are the separatists and Islamabad (for a very basic reason.. to create anti-India sentiment). And the hell yes, the number of Kashmiris killed by separatist are more than Indian troops. Which newspaper do u read man?? The very fact that 2 kashmiri politicians are cabinet ministers and kashmiri political parties provide internal support to the ruling INC shows the amount of say kashmiris have in new delhi's policies. No major kashmiri political parties oppose new delhi's rule over kashmir, instead they whole heartedly support India and its policies. PDP is one Congress's strongest allies. For yr kind information, i support US's occupation of Iraq. the very fact that so many Iraqis came out and voted during the elections shows the amount of favorable viewpoint Iraqis have towards the US. Just because a few (but aggressive) of the Iraqis oppose the US doesn't mean that American occupation of Iraq is not favored among the Iraqis. U r insulting Kashmiris because if the indian army was doing anything wrong, Kashmir's goverment had every right and power to take an action against them. The fact that they haven't....

<dd>Why don't you give me a source which says that separatists killed more civilians than the Indian army? You and I both know that is not true. Almost anyone who knows history will tell you that. It is also known that in the early stages of the occupation of currently Indian-claimed Kashmir, Kashmiris were blindfolded and shot in rows in their villages by the Indian army. These were not individual troops doing this, these were troops under orders to do it. I realize that it is a shame that this happened, but please accept the facts first. There are very few separatists as opposed to army troops, using separatism as an excuse is not going to help anything, it will only whitewash. The article pretty much blames the separatists for everything. Support of US occupation has planted a government that goes with anything the US wishes anything the US wants to do illegally. Accepting the occupation in Iraq shows that you see the same elements in the ccupation in Kashmir. This further shows that you know very little about all sides of the story and your view is one-sided. The kashmiri government in occupied regions will not take action, they are under Indian military rule. That's like saying that the Prime minister of Iraq comes out on to the streets, where thousands of US troops are patrolling, in order to condemn them!

<dd>well that same episode regarding indian troops firing civilians.. from where did u hear that.. i bet it was either from a pakistani's mouth, or a paki newspaper or separatist website. No other country or intl. organisation accuses New Delhi of carrying out state-terrorism.. now that doesn't mean Indian troops dont carry human rights violation.. but the hell not under delhi's orders. Rape, murder, lootings, kidnappings happen in every part of the globe.. u cant blame the central govt for that.. Ok, u dont trust me and the Indian govt. but i guess u trust media agencies like BBC. For yr kind info. most of the article's content is from <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/south_asia/2002/kashmir_flashpoint/" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/south_asia/2002/kashmir_flashpoint/" rel="nofollow">BBC's coverage</a> of the Kashmir dispute. And I dont wanna waste time proving to a person like u that the number of people killed by the indian troops are less than those killed by the militants.. its like trying to prove that the world is round and not flat!! U wanna talk about facts.. go to kashmir and then argue with me.. sitting in USA and being brainwashed by yr pakistani friends doesnt help Mr. Anon --<a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeepak_gupta_071e.html" title="User:Deepak gupta">{{IncMan</a>|<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeepak_gupta_f27b.html" title="User talk:Deepak gupta">talk}}</a> 17:44, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just for your information, my friend who constantly talks about the atrocities committed in Kashmir, is an Indian historian that I live next door to. He has studied this conflict for a long time. I also have a Pakistani friend where I work, but he is not as obsessed with this issue, but he does know a lot about it. I just wanted to tell you this before you excuse my Pakistani friends of trying to "brainwash me".

<dd>Sure anon.. we can work to sought out differences.. but before we start doing so I suggest that you gather a more accurate and verifiable data regarding the issue.. I agree that a lot of civilians have died due to Indian firing but accusing new delhi of carrying out state-terrorism is weird or simply doesn't make any sense. You must have noticed that every information in the article is supported by a source (see the reference section). I hope that whatever future edits u make to the article are unbaised keeping in mind this is an encyclopedia and again backed by verifiable sources.

<p>Hello, I am glad you are a muslim, as I am too. Salaam. But what I don't understand is, is that you used to be christian, I didn't expect any christians to become muslims after the September 11 attacks. - Sultn</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for your message. Actually it is quite opposite to what you said. According to certain sources, converts to Islam have increased after the 9/11 attacks. That is because many people learn that Islam is not what most of the U.S media makes it out to be.

<p>I will edit the article to be like it used to, but without the unlikely opart (even though it is indeed unlikely that there are 1 million or even half of it, of Muslims in Brazil. I live in Brazil and believe me, there aren`t many Muslims. Muslims are extremely rare here because they prefer to emmigrate to richer coutries.

<dd>PLMF, although you might think that is the case in Brazil, but wikipedia must give all sides of the story. If there are sources that give such estimates then they must be voiced. It is very unfair and against wikipedia policy to edit in such a way that is personal point of view. Therefore do not revert the edits, but read wikipedia policy on sources and NPOV.

<p>The way you put there is POV too. Several sources agree on 1 million as a nice, round figure and state that the official census contains discrepancies and error"" Which sources are these? How reliable are they (especially compared to the official census)? It just look like propaganda to artifically inflate the amount of Muslims in Brazil... Also, it`s already stated that Muslim authorities believe there are 1,5 Million Muslims in Brazil. The lines you added just favors the Islamic (wrong estimatives, although it`s not the point here) estimatives. <a href="../../../p/m/l/User%7EPMLF_79c1.html" title="User:PMLF">PMLF</a> 02:40, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I welcome your new found interest in Islam, but please know that Wikipedia is not a forum for discourse or furthering such ideas. Before jumping to accuse me of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a> etc. kindly understand that religion is not the issue, though your pattern of edits seems to suggest so. The reasons why I feel some of your edits are not really up to the mark (though you might think otherwise) is that you are deleting whole lines which are referenced properly. eg. The pervez musharraf article where i added the siachen skirmish and on his involvement in kargil. Apparantly after 2 reverts it stayed since the sources proved so. I thought it might have been a slight oversight on your part in not reading the references and didn't make much of it. But in <a href="../../../k/a/r/Kargil_War_f86a.html" title="Kargil War">Kargil War</a> too the same issue arose wherein you didn't read a single reference that was there and as a result I had to quote almost every other line culled mostly from the very sources for you to read. Not to forget that few supported your view it was POV just because India fared well in the war and so deserved to be told factually. hen I find you either stalking me or responding only to my statements and pointing out my so called personal attacks, but find that you conveniently chose to ignore all the nonsense trashed by the anonymous editor - not you&#160;:) in the talk page of <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism_in_Kashmir_ca2b.html" title="Terrorism in Kashmir">Terrorism in Kashmir</a>. This, even after i'd made truce to everyone if i'd made any comments that was not proper, intentional or otherwise. Clearly it shows that you do wish to ignore genuine personal attacks and instead chose to point out minor mistakes made by me. Coming to <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism_in_Pakistan_98e9.html" title="Terrorism in Pakistan">Terrorism in Pakistan</a>, your real knowledge on these subjects stood exposed when you removed the statement made by a known terrorist by claiming that <a href="../../../r/e/d/Rediff.com.html" title="Rediff.com">rediff.com</a> was a blog site or some forum. I don't know what else to say except that you probably haven't even heard or even opened the starting page of the site to understand who or what rediff.com is. The news was sydincated from the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Press_Trust_of_India_34af.html" title="Press Trust of India">Press Trust of India</a> as you can read. Either you might have a slight tilt or don't wish to accept facts and deal with it or you dont' even read the given sources properly. I feel that unless you can take the time to know the background of the source and the contents of the source itself, you should refrain from making erroneous edits that lead to substandard articles. Hope that helps to ease any editing issues. Tx. <a href="../../../i/d/l/User%7EIdleguy_eb71.html" title="User:Idleguy">Idleguy</a> 06:23, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No one is stalking you, that is a ridiculous accusation. I just meet you on articles I have worked on before. It seems more like you are stalking me because I am usually at the articles first and you seem to enjoy my "pattern of edits". Like I said before, Islam has nothing to do with my edits on Pak-Indian issues. Why do you constantly refer to Islam? Does it make you think you can undermine my edits? Now that I look at your edits, they show a greater bias then mince since I mostly remove vandalism from articles, make minor fixes or apply wikipedia POV/image/source policy. Frankly, I think your edits are mostly nothing but POV pushing without the slightest regard that maybe <b>Pakistani</b> view should be represented on a Pakistan-related article. I can not represent their view, but I can make the article less POV. You did NOT source correctly on the Kargil article and I apologize if you thought it was a personal attack against you, even though it was obviously not. About the talk page of terrorism in Kashmir I said that you should ALL stop making personal attacks. The reason I warned you to stop using religion is because the anon user never referred to the MUSLIMS, he referred to Kashmiris. Starting to embark on a <b>flame war</b> is not in wikipedia's best interests. Also I was about to make a response to the anon user and gupta, before you finished editing. But seeing that you already started to make a rebuttal towards him, I stopped short and told all sides to refrain from it. If you took it offensively then you misinterpreted it.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Rediff.com is not a reliable source and you know it. Your source was 3 lines written by a nobody on rediff.com! Maybe I should cite the same type of thing on Terrorism in India? Just because I am Muslim does not mean I dislike other faiths, but the sad reality is that on Indian and Pakistani articles only Indian sides of the story are being shown and it is becoming evident that this is partially due to your edits. Therefore I can only suggest when you get sources, make sure they aren't just Indian nationalist sites and cite them properly. Hope that helps to ease any editing issues and allows you to edit wikipedia productively.

<p>Well, we can not call murder "terrorism" can we? That way whenever someone is murdered every second, will that be called "terrorism"? Usually terrorism refers to massive attacks on large populations in order to acheive a large political goal. A kidnap murder of a journalist doesn't really do much. Well, I guess it could be some sort of minor terrorism, but there is no widespread terrorizing. I don't know whether it should be readded.</p>
<p>I think it is fair that you started that article, but please watch out because it will become biased really fast; that is the case on most articles dealing with South-Asian issues.

<dd>Hey, the murder of Daniel Pearl didnt have any major political impact!! Give me a break. Islamabad came under immense pressure from USA during the entire unfortunate episode. Terrorism is an act which creates terror among the people and that particular episode was no exception. Pearl's murder was not just any other murder. So many people from countries supporting the US-led coalition are kidnapped in Iraq and then murdered. Isnt that terrorism. Why is this one an exception.

<p><i>Terrorism is an act which creates terror among the people</i>. Yes, which <i>people</i> were exactly terrorized? Like I said it is one of those things which does have political influence but still does not have widespread terrorizing. I don't see how Daniel Pearl's murder was any different from shootings by people here in the US. Thousands of people are kidnapped and plenty are murdered on the streets by drug gangs, by racial problems, etc. Very little is different. For all we know Dan Pearl could have been murdered just because of his race. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 22:49, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, it's a repeat, to some extent. I probably should have just modified Islam by country but I had completely forgotten about it. The two articles should be merged, using my table rather than the Islam by country table, and also repeating the info re sources and caveats.

<p>Anon, I appreciate yr efforts to remove POV from Wikipedia, but you at times ignore anti-Indian POV and it seems that u r more concerned about POV against muslims and Pakistan. Take the example of article on state terrorism. U were quick to remove anti-Paksitan POV but were least concerned about anti-Indian POV in India section. At times in effort to remove POV you end up expressing yr own point of view. Again, I really appreciate yr policy of making Wikipedia more encyclopedic, but rm one POV and adding another doesn't help.

<p>What was added to the Pakistan section was POV because it was linking various events to Pakistan most of which were unrelated to state terrorism. Your edits on the Indian section however are completely focused on so-called accusations by Pakistan. Why are you still denying this? Please don't think for an instant that slowly you can try to whitewash history and these articles. You said only Pakistan accuses. What happened at Amritsar? Thousands of sikhs were killed. What happened in Assam, thousands of christians were killed. What happened and is happening in Kashmir? I think you already know. Please don't try to rewrite history or try to cover massacres. I bet all these people killed by India have atleast some complaints.

<dd>Again, anon you hardly know anything of wats happenin in India and still u claim yrself as to be all knowledgable. Certain number of sikhs demanded for an independent nation, an India supressed their movement. There was a clash between hindus and sikhs following the episode which resulted in riot. Thats not state terrorism. So was the case in Assam. Indian army carries out operations to kill terrorists and not civilians anon. U dont know anything about Punjab and pl stop adding POV.

Ofcourse, it will give a slight negative image of India (just like every other country on that page), I don't doubt that, but the material is certainly accurate and human rights groups and victim groups are sufficient for state-terrorism as that is what the section says. When a country performs certain actions, it is responsible for the blame. So let's leave it as is for the sake of argument.

<p>Got your message at my talk page - not a problem (and I hope no offense taken either way). My edit was my view - that I personally think that it is easier for people to realize that Muslims believe that the New Testament as it was compiled is corrupted, and most disagree with Pauline Christianity teachings, hense my inclusion as to the "Q" document and the "teachings of Jesus" rather than the teachings of paul. I reckon if I included the history of the new testament as well, that would have been good to clarigy. I do understand the Muslim belief toward "the book" - and the issues with both the old and new testament corruptions. But the simple fact is that they believe the pure teachings of jesus were corrupted - or in other words the Q oral tradition was lost. The history and pauline portions Muslims tend to discount historically. Keep up the good work and happy editing....</p>
<p>Incidentally, which school of thought do you adhere to within Islam? Will help me tailor my comments to your beliefs better. -<a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 19:06, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Humus, how's a link that has 2 paragraphs about "No gays and dancing" relevant to the Hamas article. And why did you say that I made a POV removal?

<p>Humus, there was no POV intended by me. The link is irrelevant. Note how I didn't remove other links only that one.

<dd>I don't know where your "2 paragraphs only" come from. The entire article is very relevant and timely.

<p>So we should have your way in the end? Wow, how very NPOV for you Humus.

<dd>Please don't personalize it. The change is not "my", it is not "my way" and I don't enjoy this. FYI, earlier I had a policy not to engage in RV wars, but I was taught the hard way that it won't always work. Some editors just wouldn't listen to sensible arguments and would cover or deny irrefutable facts, or use lame arguments like "very short article", etc. Still I always try to assume good faith. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens"></a>←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">←ну?</a> 21:52, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ofcourse it is your way. You gave me no good reason to keep it. It makes me wonder how you will react if I add something like that to the Israel article. I didn't have any political reason the link was clearly unencyclopedic. FYI, good faith doesn't come by reverting additions that are clearly unencyclopedic or accusing others of using "lame" arguments when all you have done is revert. I wont revert the link, because this can easily be used against you when other editors complain.

<dd>Oh, what a clever trap! I gave a perfectly good reason: "it helps to clarify any confusion on the issue", "very relevant and timely".

<p>No problem with me AE as long as it is going to be linked to. Anyway, there was only one movie ever produced (The Message). I dunno if you watched it. The 2 others (the documentary and the Walt Disney style one) are ok according to the critics and they are not biased. -- <a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF">Svest</a> 03:10, 16 October 2005 (UTC) <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: orange">&#160;Wiki me up</font></a></small></p>

<p>Hi. I would appreciate it if you could help me rewrite the section on differences between Hinduism and Islam. I tried to adapt it from this website because I think it is quite important for the article, but I do not have much time at my disposal to reframe it completely. You seem to be quite enthusiastic about working for this article. I am sure you'd help. Thanks</p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, I might add the section later. The article is currently in the process of edit warring and disputes between 6 or 7 different editors so I will add it when the situation cools down a little. The section will have to be fairly shorter also. You did not "adapt" from anything; you copied and pasted from a Hindu site. As Islam and Hinduism are two completely different religions (unlike Islam and Judaism which are Abrahamic) criticism is not the differences between the two.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also please do not vandalize other articles (example Islamophobia) and violate copyrights. Any further actions of the sort will get you blocked from editing.--<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 05:22, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Right. You'll agree that Hindu critique of Islam exists, especially with the rise of Hindu fundamentalism (more or less on the lines of the copyrighted article I summarized), precisely because of the huge differences between the two religions that you talked about. I think it makes perfect sense to talk about it now that we have an article of Criticism of Islam. I trust that you will soon put it back with modifications.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually that's another point. Do you have any sources which tell about Hindu critics of Islam? Unless you can name this I think that it should be removed. The article is not about religious differences, its about critics who use these differences in an academic, non-fundamentalist manner. By the way, the "rise of Hindu fundamentalism" which is irrelevant to the article anyways, was not evident either in the lines you added; infact the copy and paste job you did was from a Hindu site. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 05:22, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hmm.. Now I have a better idea of the thought process going on in your mind. I hope it's not that you want to remove the section first, and then try to come up with newer and newer rationalizations on why you did that. I agree I did not cite my sources. These critques are very well known (are material for undergraduate courses on comparative religion). There is no dearth of Hindu academic criticism of Islam going back at least to 18th century. Because of fundamentalism, this material has become more available because it is more often cited. A list of references I could recommend you at the spur of the moment: 1. Swami <a href="../../../d/a/y/Dayananda.html" title="Dayananda">Dayananda</a> Saraswati, the founder of <a href="../../../a/r/y/Arya_Samaj_19a5.html" title="Arya Samaj">Arya Samaj</a> in his critique of modern religions <i>Satyarth Prakash</i> devotes a whole chapter to Islam. <a href="http://www.aryasamajjamnagar.org/chapterfourteen.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.aryasamajjamnagar.org/chapterfourteen.htm" rel="nofollow">Ref</a> 2. Swami <a href="../../../v/i/v/Vivekananda.html" title="Vivekananda">Vivekananda</a>'s (arguably the best known spokesperson of Hinduism in the West) critique of Mohammed and Islam from the viewpoint of <a href="../../../y/o/g/Yoga.html" title="Yoga">Yogic</a> spirituality are well known. 3. Best known is the <a href="../../../v/e/d/Vedanta.html" title="Vedanta">Vedantic</a> criticism of Islamic absolutism in religion and morality, and there are many books on this. 4. In fact there have been religious theological debates between most famous 18th-19th century Hindu and Muslim scholars. 5. <a href="../../../a/u/r/Aurobindo.html" title="Aurobindo">Aurobindo</a>'s critiques are also well known.</p>
<dl>
<dd>So far the only one out of these that I have actually seen criticize any aspect of Islam is Dayanada and he spells the Qur'an about 5 different ways throughout his document. And also, ofcourse the section will be removed first; you can't expect people to insert copy and pasted material. I have already rationalized why it has been removed; it is your job to come up with rationalizations and accurate academic sources to why it should be inserted, especially since you believe it is so necessary. By the way, if it is fundamentalists who are criticizing then that will be indicated in the article.

<p>Don't use threats and other Islamic tactics here. Don't define yourself what is illegal and what is not. What I do is perfectly legal and it is a mere reflection of what you do. Because it were you Muslims who have initially been editing the article in your own favor. I merely do the same thing. You follow your prophet Muhammad, I follow my prophet Ali Sina. It's not you right to do a thing and then when somebody does the same to you, to claim it is "illegal". If my doings are illegal so are yours. Do not bother sending me further messages as I will not reply.</p>

<p>AE, it's really not OK to delete other people's messages from article talk pages. If someone wants to know why the article changed, the material should be there. Please, show enough humility to allow yourself to be criticized in public. It's good -- if extremely painful -- spiritual practice. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 20:55, 19 October 2005 (UTC) (who is often wrong and often has to apologize)</p>

<dd>Look Zora, if there is a personal message directed at me, then please ask me on my talk page. I will be happy to solve the issue. In the past I have always addressed your concerns immediately just like I did in this article, where I readded the material you wanted reinserted, despite your lack of providing sources. I don't see how showing me hostility for me reverting my own edits despite your reasons (which at times are lame, sorry to say) will make the issue at hand any better.
