<p>Hey anon, there are two similar templates: <a href="../../../p/a/k/Template%7EPakistanTopics_e9f5.html" title="Template:PakistanTopics">Template:PakistanTopics</a> and Template:Pak links. Maybe they could be merged? I prefer the format of the first one. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 17:28, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, did help on both templates. One is more to do with categories with general Pakistan information whilst the other takes you to the direct articles on particular subjects, therefore, both have different functions, hence i suggest they should be left seperate. <a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFast_track_a98f.html" title="User:Fast track">User:Fast track</a> (<a href="../../../f/a/s/User_talk%7EFast_track_6db5.html" title="User talk:Fast track">talk</a>) 23 January 2006</dd>

<p>Hmm... It's ironic; before the recent discussion about this, I would have notified <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BYT</a> of that same vote, because he would be interested, even though I expect he would vote other than as I did. To <a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a>'s credit, he notified everyone generally, rather than supporters only. Of course it doesn't belong on the administrators' notice board, but I guess I don't mind if more people know about the discussion. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 20:02, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, my name is <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChad78_10c6.html" title="User:Chad78">Chad Smith</a>, and I am the person who put up the article about Dr. DeYoung. I admit, I really didn't know what I was doing, so I didn't do a great job of meeting Wikipedia standards - in fact, I did a lousy job. However, I would respectfully ask for another chance.</p>
<p>I do believe that Dr. DeYoung is notable enough to be included on the Wikipedia. As I stated in my request to keep the article, Dr. DeYoung is <a href="http://www.rbc.org/hps/jdeyoung/" class="external text" title="http://www.rbc.org/hps/jdeyoung/" rel="nofollow">a cohost</a> of <a href="http://www.rbc.org/dod/home.php" class="external text" title="http://www.rbc.org/dod/home.php" rel="nofollow">a nationwide television program</a>. He is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0970824602/" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0970824602/" rel="nofollow">a published author</a>, <a href="http://jimmydeyoung.gospelcom.net/pp/affiliates/index.php" class="external text" title="http://jimmydeyoung.gospelcom.net/pp/affiliates/index.php" rel="nofollow">a nationwide radio talk show host</a>, a regular guest on many national talk shows, both <a href="http://www.ankerberg.com/Articles/social-issues/SI0904W1.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ankerberg.com/Articles/social-issues/SI0904W1.htm" rel="nofollow">on television</a> and <a href="http://www.mbn.org/GenMoody/default.asp?SectionID=3F6097C8979B48B49D177E7A1C26CEE1" class="external text" title="http://www.mbn.org/GenMoody/default.asp?SectionID=3F6097C8979B48B49D177E7A1C26CEE1" rel="nofollow">radio</a>, an accredited journalist, and a featured conference speaker.</p>
<p>You have stated on your user page that you seek to clean up articles and put them in a NPOV. I would ask for your help doing that. In the request for removal, someone said that it sounded like a press release, and that's pretty much what it was. I was ignorant as to how a Wikipedia article should be. I was hoping someone would come along and clean it up, or tell me how to clean it up. Instead it was removed.</p>
<p>I did some reading about the problem the Wikipedia has been having with someone flooding posts about LBU alumini. I am sorry about that. I am not that person, nor do I have any association with him or his group. It just so happens that Dr. DeYoung did receive a degree there.</p>
<p>If you need proof that I am not this Jason person, please let me know how I can prove it. My name is Chad Smith, I live in Chattanooga, TN, USA. You can easily look up my name and phone number online and give me a call and ask if I am who I claim to be. I work for Dr. DeYoung, he did not ask me to put up an article about him, until I told him about it, he didn't know what a Wikipedia was. I simply thought, (and still do), that he deserved an article. In his own field, Dr. DeYoung is quite well known. Please reconsider adding his article. I'd be happy to work on rewriting it so that it meets the criteria of this nobel work.</p>
<p>I'd like to thank you for your contributions to the Wikipedia. I can see that you've put a lot of work into it, and it is important to you. I, too, believe it is an important work to put knowledge in the hands of the people - that is that everyone have free access to this information. That's why I work with OpenOffice.org, GIMPShop, and other open source projects, because I believe knowledge should be free. So, again, thank you for the work you've done to make the Wikipedia the best source of information on the Net. And whether or not you choose to allow a Jimmy DeYoung article to be included, I look forward to working with you in the future.</p>

<p>Hi Anonymous editor, I'd like to request that when blocking a vandal that you make sure that you've signed as it helps to determine if it is an old block. For example if a new user lists the vandal at AIAV not knowing that they shoud be warned again before listing, it makes it easier to see if the vandal should be warned or/and removed from AIAV if the block is fresh.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I had made chnages to the Kashmir page to make the conflict information more balanced and improve some of the grammar. Why did you revert it back to what it was? The view currently espoused isnt exactly the most blanced or well written, The changes I had made reflect the information also avaiable on the Kashmir conflict page. When I made the changes I had forgotten lo log in under my user name in case you are confused.</p>

<dd>Hello. Many parts that were capitalized didn't need to be like saying "northern" or "northwestern". Also the plebiscite info about troop withdrawal would need sources because otherwise article can't keep balance. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 04:26, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Read article a(1) of the truce agreement, <a href="http://www.un.int/pakistan/15480813.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.un.int/pakistan/15480813.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.un.int/pakistan/15480813.htm</a> and this is on pakistan's un mission website...so i'd say what i wrote was pretty balanced and what exists there is not:-)</p>

<dd>Hi again. It says "simultaneously a cease-fire order to apply to all forces under their control". This would apply to both forces wouldn't it? Then we should say both Pakistan and India rather than just Pakistan in that sentence It should say "The United Nations General Assembly unanimously voted in 1948 for both countries to withdraw". I didn't say that there wasn't a cease fire order, I meant both countries should be mentioned then. I should have made that clearer. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 19:56, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi. I was referring to the truce agreement. The cease-fire was already applied.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you read A below you will see what I mean. Also, India's position of not doing the plebiscite reflects from non-compliance (1).</p>
<p>Obviously that does not make India's position morally tenable, but that is the legal truth and the article does not reflect that.</p>
<p><br />
A. (1) As the presence of troops of Pakistan in the territory of the State of Jammu and Kashmir constitutes a material change in the situation since it was represented by the Government of Pakistan before the Security Council, the Government of Pakistan agrees to withdraw its troops from that State.</p>
<p>(2) The Government of Pakistan will use its best endeavour to secure the withdrawal from the State of Jammu and Kashmir of tribesmen and Pakistan nationals not normally resident therein who have entered the State for the purpose of fighting.</p>
<p>(3) Pending a final solution the territory evacuated by the Pakistan troops will be administered by the local authorities under the surveillance of the Commission.</p>
<p>(1) When the Commission shall have notified the Government of India that the tribesmen and Pakistan nationals referred to in Part II A 2 hereof have withdrawn, thereby terminating the situation which was represented by the Government of India to the Security Council as having occasioned the presence of Indian forces in the State of Jammu and Kashmir, and further, that the Pakistan forces are being withdrawn from the State of Jammu and Kashmir, the Government of India agrees to begin to withdraw the bulk of their forces from the State in stages to be agreed upon with the Commission.</p>

<p>Hi again,</p>

<dd>Since you have not replied to my comment, I will assume that you agree with me as I see edits after that by you. I removed all the references to the plebiscite as that is already referred to int the history of kashmir conflict which has more obbjective information..Looking at the talk pages for kashmir, people had earlier agreed to keep it controversy free, so I think this is in-line with that.</dd>

<p>Hi Anonymous editor,</p>
<p>re: "Isa" article; Before adding "by nature" to the article, I discussed it in the talk page but you didn't answer to it. Please provide reasons if you want to remove "by nature".Christianity believes that Jesus is the son of God by nature, however David is not so. This is the difference. Otherwise, Both Jesus and David were people of God. Christianity has a particular understanding of "son of God". <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 20:48, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree that Quran clearly states that Jesus is not the son of God, but it is clear from the context that Quran is only trying to say that Jesus is no more than a human being; that's it. Now I claim that if we do not include this, it will cause confusion. If we look at the previous edit made by "JBJ830726" we can see this: "This is may be because the title "<a href="../../../s/o/n/Son_of_God_bcd3.html#in_the_New_Testament" title="Son of God">Son of God</a>" implies that Jesus is the greatest of the prohpets (saying <b>the son</b> instead of <b>a son</b>) whereas Muhammad is the greatest prophet."</p>

<p>Thanks for turning your attention to the article <a href="../../../j/y/l/Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_dcd7.html" title="Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons">Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons</a>.

Could you please protect the page for real? As you can see, anonymous users (not you, hehe) keep removing the image on the page.. which is central to the article.

<p>I assume your are talking about Mike18xx. The <i>Infidel</i> page looks not that bad in relative terms. I didn't spot any obvious 3RR's, but I may have missed them. I see personnal attacks in the edit summaries, but he's hardly the only offender (that's still no excuse, for anyone).</p>
<p><i>Dhimmi</i> looks worse. There may well be some 3RR violations in there, but it's tangled; I can't say for sure by who or where. There is incivility (at least) on the talk page. I think protecting was a good call (likewise <i>Infidel</i>).</p>
<p>I'll watch both pages for a while, but that's about all I can do for now. Feel free to seek help from other more experienced admins. Maybe some kind of informal mediation would be useful.

<p><i>"Infidel" is only used when translating Muslims text and speeches, presumably always for the word "kafir", and it is understood by English readers to mean basically "non-Muslim".

<dd>I don't know what resolution. The current image was limited to its size because of resolution restrictions which is why I think that that is its limit for size under this particular fair use licence. If you can get permission for your resolution from the newspaper then that can solve the problem easily. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 22:32, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can make a pretty good argument that an image no taller than 1000 pixels can be considered fair use and web resolution since it can be shown on a Monitor screen at whole. A violation of the Fair Use doctrine would occour if the version of the images we had could be used for republishing. Thus if someone came to wikipedia, got the image, and used it for publishing. Here's what I propose: I'll upload the file AGAIN, copy this conversation over to the talk page, while you protect the updated image.

<dd>You are wrong in your belief that permission would affect any image under fair use. Even if the publisher came out and said you are not allowed to use it, (as it's the case with AP images) we still may use them if fair use applies.

<p>Regarding the copyright issue. It is a copyright violation regardless. The Danish newspaper allows a single personal copy for persons (and make explicite that it is not for companies or anything else) <a href="http://www.e-jp.dk/jp_ophavsret.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.e-jp.dk/jp_ophavsret.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. The e-mail says that the cartoonists needs to be approached <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Poulsen#Billeder_.28Parken_og_spillerbilleder.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Poulsen#Billeder_.28Parken_og_spillerbilleder.29" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, and I have not seen any evidence that that has happened . Wikipedia says it also, the question that remains is whether it is fair use (assuming it is at a US based server, as it propably does not apply to countries outside the USA):</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Images and photographs, like written works, are subject to copyright. Someone owns them unless they have been explicitly placed in the public domain. Images on the internet need to be licensed directly from the copyright holder or someone able to license on their behalf. In some cases, fair use guidelines may allow a photograph to be used.</i> (<a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_8c2e.html#Image_guidelines" title="Wikipedia:Copyright">Wikipedia:Copyright#Image_guidelines</a>)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>So, as there is no copyright obtained (see above), the question is whether this constitutes fair use. The copyright disclaimer at the image page says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The image is low resolution and of no larger and of no higher quality than is necessary for the illustration of an article, and the use of the image on Wikipedia is not expected to decrease the value of the copyright, eg, <u><b>there is no risk this image can be taken and republished on another newspaper</b></u>.</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_drawings.png" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_drawings.png" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I loaded the image in some image software, and I could without much loss of quality enlarge the image by 100%. And based on my experiences (although limited), the quality of the images is such that reasonable (although smaller) copies can be made, in full color and at sufficient resolution. That violates the not-republishable clause and in that sense, I would say that it is not fair use of the cartoons. But what would a judge say? Than comes the whole larger context in paly, such as the extreme controversy it invoked, etc. And in that sense, the outcome is completly unpredictable. (And the final question, will this result in court case over copyright issues, not likely because there are so many copies in high quality that go over the internet at locations you can not tough them (Belarus for example), that these cartoons will probably remain there for a VERY long time.)</p>
<p>BTW, other images that have the same characteristics as this image (see the list at the image page), does not imply that other images automatically can be considered "fair use".</p>
<ul>
<li>The two edited versions are explicitly covered by AP ( <a href="../../../t/i/a/Image%7ETianasquare.jpg_9374.html" title="Image:Tianasquare.jpg">link</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/i/Image%7ERaising_of_the_flag_-_colored.jpg_e196.html" title="Image:Raising of the flag - colored.jpg">link</a>)</li>
<li>One manipulated is a private picture ( <a href="../../../s/u/n/Image%7ESunglass-c.jpg_dc0f.html" title="Image:Sunglass-c.jpg">link</a>)</li>
<li>Two sceenshots are from game/movie, and only a fraction of the work, not the whole cartoon, which makes it fair-use ( <a href="../../../f/f/i/Image%7EFFIIIUS_Siren_Censored.png_7ec6.html" title="Image:FFIIIUS Siren Censored.png">link</a> and link)</li>
</ul>
<p>That leaves three newspaper covers, and based on the wikipedia criteria, they might also violations of fair use.</p>
<p>I still think this image is a violation of copyright and fair use, but everything revolves around whether the image is good enough to make reproduce. I think it is good enough, but others diagree apparently.</p>
