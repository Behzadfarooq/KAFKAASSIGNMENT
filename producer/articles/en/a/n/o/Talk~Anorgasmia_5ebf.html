	    <p>I've once again removed the false claim that anorgasmia is caused by Doug's disfavored masturbation style. Please don't re-add it without citing an appropriate medical source for this unsupported health claim. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 23:21, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
There are now several articles that support the idea that prone masturbation is a cause of anorgasmia in men. Besides "Traumatic Masturbatory Syndrome" by Sank, there is now also a 2001 article by two physicians, BA Bartlik and MZ Goldstein, in Psychiatric Services 52:291-306 (2001) which states that patients with delayed ejaculation "often have atypical masturbatory styles, such as the face-down position, treatment may also involve masturbatory retraining." There is also an online article by another physician, Scott Gilbert, who says that an atypical masturbatory style is also a cause of sexual dysfunction. So, there is no active dispute over this point in the medical/psych. community. The only dispute comes from discontented Wikipedia editors. <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug22123_2d3b.html" title="User:Doug22123">Doug22123</a> 17:58, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's difficult to respond to someone who misrepresents his source material. Doug, you may not understand that utility in treatment does not indicate causality, though I've pointed it out to you elsewhere, or you may not care that you're injecting your own interpretation. You may not understand that the three articles (not studies) don't provide any empiric evidence for the suggestion you're making, only anecdotes and assertions. You may not care that Bartlik and Goldstein don't seem anxious to support your interpretation of their paper, but Wikipedia should. There is no consensus in the medical community that "improper masturbation" causes anorgasmia. -<a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 20:02, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>When case studies are properly crafted, as Sank's were, they constitute empirical evidence, not anecdotes. I must have missed the article about Bartlik &amp; Goldstein denouncing my citation of them. Three or four articles is actually not a small amount of work on a topic. AIDS was established as a disease based on a case study of three people. I repeat that an atypical (esp. prone) masturbatory style is not a point of dispute in the health community. <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug22123_2d3b.html" title="User:Doug22123">Doug22123</a> 20:31, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You can claim it, but it doesn't make it so. And it's utter nonsense to say that AIDS was established as a disease based on three case studies. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 20:38, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that due to the lifestyle constraints of spending so much time editing Wikipedia, some people here are considerably experienced wankers who may be biasing this article with their own POV (I speak from experience). Therefore it is perhaps even more important than ever that any claims made here be backed up by adequate sources. -Ok, joking aside now-</dd>
</dl>
<p>It seems that there actually is a school of thought which maintains masturbatory technique as a factor, in relation to associative psychology, in achieving orgasm through intercourse. So surely the correct way for this to be included in this entry is to present it as a theory rather than an established and untontested fact. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesTheNumberless_fbad.html" title="User:JamesTheNumberless">JamesTheNumberless</a> 10:05, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anorgasmia.html#Primary_Anorgasmia" title="Anorgasmia">Primary Anorgasmia</a> section mentions <i>a partner who has primary or secondary difficulty in achieving an erection</i>.

<p>I've removed two unsubstantiated claims from this page: first, the claim that anorgasmia dissipates for SSRI-users over time, and, second, the claim that anorgasmia can persist permanently after SSRI use has stopped. Unless a reputable source can be found backing these claims, they shouldn't be here. My psychiatrist directly contradicted them when I talked to her about these issues, dispelling them as common misconceptions about the SSRI drugs. Please do not add them back to this page unless a reputable source can be found to support them.</p>

<p>"In many contexts, anorgasmia whatever the physical factor can be solved through a mental process of conditioning, and as such hypnosis is a common and effective treatment for anorgasmia."</p>
<p>Um, I'm sorry, but radical removal of the clitorus (in females) and prostate (in males) are shown to cause a complete removal of the ability to orgasm. I've revised this to be more equivocal than appearing that Hypnosis is a cure-all.</p>

<p>Hi, I'm not sure exactly what the difference between primary and secondary anorgasmia is, even less so after reading this article. What is the difference between "a condition where one cannot physically orgasm" and "the loss of the ability to have orgasms." Those are the two proferred definitions, and the contrast is not readily apparent. Considering the examples, several hypotheses as to what might be the difference are shot down. For example, is primary anorgasmia something you're born with, whereas secondary is acquired? No, because genital mutilation is on there. Is primary anorgasmia concerned with psychological vs. physical causes? No, again because of mutilation being an example of it. I am very confused. Are all of the examples in the right category? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_75.69.31.46_d404.html" title="Special:Contributions/75.69.31.46">75.69.31.46</a> (talk) 08:01, 6 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>Additionally confusing is the article states <b>two</b> types have been defined, and goes on to discuss <b>four</b> types: primary, secondary, situational and random. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/e/e/User_talk%7EKeesiewonder_14b3.html" title="User talk:Keesiewonder">talk</a></sup> 01:04, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The two vs. four probably is something that was missed during an edit adding situation and random.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for what the difference is, I actually believe the distinction is primary anorgasmic is pre-orgasmic, and secondary orgasmic is post-orgasmic. --<a href="../../../p/u/e/User%7EPuellanivis_b7b1.html" title="User:Puellanivis">Puellanivis</a> 05:31, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
