<p>AnonEMouse, I wanted to ask if you could review some actions I've taken at SSP. As you know, I've been closing cases where all the accounts have been blocked. Since the page is backlogged, I've closed a couple of cases where there are accounts/IPs that aren't blocked, and I want to make sure I'm not doing something harmful. Specific cases are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Animesouth_5908.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Animesouth">Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Animesouth</a>--named accounts were blocked, but IPs were unblocked. Most IPs hadn't contributed since January, one IP has contributed recently, but the edits seem constructive, or at least not malicious.</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Damir_Mi%C5%A1i%C4%87_c62c.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Damir Mišić">Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Damir Mišić</a>--there was extensive discussion of the alleged sockpuppetry at Checkuser and ANI, and the consensus seemed to be that some of the listed accounts were sockpuppets, but not all. No action had been taken since January.</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Jefferson_Anderson_13bb.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Jefferson Anderson">Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Jefferson Anderson</a>--the alleged sock was blocked as a sockpuppet of a user not named in the case, and the alleged puppetmaster has left Wikipedia. The rationale for closing this one seems pretty clear, but it's still a situation where I closed a case and one of the named users was unblocked.</li>
</ul>
<p>I just want to make sure I'm not being too bold here. By the way, congrats on the Jenna FA! <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 06:41, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Stub assessment is based on the stub tag at the bottom of the article. Change it if you disagree.

<dd>I'd say every few minutes, but that's still a lot, and different IPs, so we can't just block them. Semi-protected for 24 hours.

<dd>No particular reason at all. You were the first admin I saw. Back when I posted, it was being vandalized roughly every 30 seconds to a minute. Thanks for the break.

<p>You do realize that Jimbo has broken WP:AUTO dozens of times, despite making it? If it's important to the project, as you say, perhaps Jimbo doesn't understand the project, as I have said.

<dd>Oh, absolutely. He's also broken <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> lots of times, and lots of other things. But he's not doing it here.

<dd>That's because I want to improve, and he doesn't. All of us as Wikipedians should strive to improve ourselves.

</ul>
<p>Ivan's second account <a href="../../../r/t/s/User%7ERts_freak_5f1e.html" title="User:Rts freak">Rts_freak</a> was blocked indefinitely and he was strongly warned by you, long time ago. You can see that here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/Ivan_Kricancic" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/Ivan_Kricancic" rel="nofollow">Ivan Kricancic - sock puppet</a>. Ivan had second account which he created in order to nominate Bosniak-related pictures for deletion providing false information about the authors. He is an ethnic Croat, so he created the second account presenting himself to be an ethnic Bosniak who doesn't speak Bosnian, because he is from Australia. According to his user page (original user page) he doesnt like Bosniaks so much, and makes funny of them.</p>
<p>I noticed similar behaviour from the above IP addresses on Bosniak-related topics. Here is another earlier case that proves this, just compare his address <a href="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=58.165.126.17" class="external text" title="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=58.165.126.17" rel="nofollow">58.165.126.17</a> and his edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/58.165.126.17" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/58.165.126.17" rel="nofollow">58.165.126.17</a> in his original user page.</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK, I'll look at these one at a time.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The problem is in his Bosniak-image obsession, here are some examples when he was logged in:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bosniaks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83627378" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bosniaks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83627378" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>So, on Oct 25, 2006 he removed a deleted image, Image:Bosniak Muslim Flag.PNG. It was deleted on the 24th. Do you contend he should have left it in the article as a red link? It was nominated for deletion on Oct 14, 2006 by User:YellowDot, on the grounds of no source information. The way to fix that, surprisingly enough, is to include source information.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Srebrenica_massacre&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95269086" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Srebrenica_massacre&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95269086" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Dec 19, he removed 3 more deleted images. They were nominated November 30, 2006 by Psychonaut as (db-copyvio).</dd>
</dl>
<p>(It should be noted that he first nominated those pictures for deletion)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, actually it should be noted that he didn't.</dd>
</dl>
<p>And here is an example how he put false information when he was not logged in, about the Bosniak-related picture in order to nominate it for deletion:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Markale.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107251063" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Markale.jpg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107251063" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>What makes you think this is him?</dd>
</dl>
<p>And here is an example when he promoted his ideas using his second blocked account, <a href="../../../r/t/s/User%7ERts_freak_5f1e.html" title="User:Rts freak">Rts_freak</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3ASarajevo6.jpg&amp;diff=82810189&amp;oldid=40603570" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3ASarajevo6.jpg&amp;diff=82810189&amp;oldid=40603570" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>That's been blocked, as you notice.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The worst thing is that he wrote lies about other users who donated pictures to Wikipedia. He said:</p>
<p><i>This image was unlikely to have been taken by <a href="../../../a/s/i/User%7EAsim_Led_0836.html" title="User:Asim Led">Asim Led</a>. He has a history of providing dubious sources, and lying about source info. Impropper licence. Since the image is probably unfree, it is also missing a fair use rationale.</i></p>
<p>Now, I want to show you few edits, just about Bosniaks and Bosnian language, he really hates them, when he was not logged in:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Bosniaks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107244478" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Bosniaks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107244478" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bosnian_language&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107245061" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bosnian_language&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107245061" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Again, what makes you think this is him?</dd>
</dl>
<p>and when he was logged in:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bosniaks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97674814" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bosniaks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97674814" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>He changed some uncited numbers -- without being an expert on Bosniak population figures, how am I to know which are right? The way to fix that is to include a citation: <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>There are so many examples...</p>
<p>When I found those evidence he became mad, and he started to go around and accuse me of insulting him. I earlier had a lot of problems with nationalists, and I was not aware of so many rules in Wikipedia, so I used to break 3RR rules (And I was blocked fairly). I felt I should defend articles from nationalists. Now, I am aware of that. Ivan damaged Wikipedia, because he nominated so many good photos providing false information. And after that photos were removed. I think after earlier strong warning it is time to block Ivan original account, because I don't have will anymore to discover the damage he prodoced to Wikipedia every now and then. <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmir_Arven_887c.html" title="User:Emir Arven">Emir Arven</a> 13:09, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I addressed each example above. In sum, it looks like you are wrong about his image nominations, haven't provided evidence he was <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_58.165.115.192_caca.html" title="Special:Contributions/58.165.115.192">Special:Contributions/58.165.115.192</a> (for one day, mind), and Rts_freak is already blocked. While that doesn't rule out further misbehaviour (I'm not at all happy about that Rts_freak business), it hasn't been shown that he has been abusive since then.</dd>
<dd>Meanwhile, please note this. We're here to make the world's best encyclopedia, not refight wars in text form. That means that the thing to do here is not to make enemies and try to have them blocked, the thing to do is to write good articles. When someone says "I don't think there are X million Bosniaks, I think there are Y", the thing to do isn't to go running to an administrator, the thing to do is to find a good reliable source that says there are X million, and include that in the article. If the other person then finds a good reliable source that says there are Y, then you include that too, and note in the article that there is a substantial disagreement. Remember also that while people are human, and will get mad, and will have bad days, and will make mistakes, the odds are good that most editors you will find here at least at first came here to try and make the world's best encyclopedia. Try to cooperate with them. Honestly. <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a>. So many of your examples above could be taken either as good faith edits, if a little brusque, that I really don't think you are doing that all the time. Try it. Sometimes just the act of assuming good faith will convince someone to work with you, instead of against you. It won't always work, but sometimes it will. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><strong class="selflink">(squeak)</strong></sup> 14:13, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I missed your comments, only noticed them today. Thanks for the input, you made some good suggestions. The evolution/colonisation issue is interesting, though probably ultimately unanswerable given current knowledge (there are far too few molecular phylogenies of palms, which is a shame, and too little resolution in fossilised parts to get below genus at best). The issue of economic use didn't really cross my mind - there <i>are</i> sources for that sort of info.

<p>Thanks for your comments at <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_Politics_9d6d.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Politics">Wikipedia:Peer review/Politics</a>. I'm quite gratified to note that most of the criticisms you made referred to parts of the article that I did not write, and hadn't got around to improving yet. (In particular, I didn't write the very first paragraph, or most of the sociological stuff about political power.) I have since done the following to address your concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed the <i>(and non-human)</i> comment to which you referred - that was added by another editor, and I had my doubts about it as well, particularly as it was unsourced.</li>
<li>Unbolded <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_science.html" title="Political science">Political science</a> and decapitalised <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_philosophy.html" title="Political philosophy">political philosophy</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_administration.html" title="Public administration">public administration</a> per your recommendations. They were already bolded/capitalised when I started work on the article, but I see why you didn't like it that way, as it might confuse the reader as to the precise topic of the article.</li>
<li>Clarified the statement about Aristotle, and used a consistent past tense ("Aristotle asserted", etc.) in all the statements about historical books.</li>
<li>Removed the unsourced references to specific politicians who "transcend the left-right divide", although I kept the sourced comment about Christian democracy.</li>
<li>Expanded the Authoritarian-Libertarian subsection and added sources, and also expanded the "post-modern and post-structuralist" subsection on political power, after trawling through some rather verbose sociology articles. As I said, I didn't write most of the stuff on sociological perspectives, but I've done my best to make it clearer and add appropriate sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, thanks for your advice on the article. If you could take a look at the revised version and comment at <a href="../../../p/o/l/Talk%7EPolitics_c32b.html" title="Talk:Politics">Talk:Politics</a> or on my talkpage, I'd be very grateful. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89"><font color="purple"><b>Wal</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/a/l/User_talk%7EWalton_monarchist89_7ca3.html" title="User talk:Walton monarchist89"><font color="silver"><b>ton</b></font></a> <small><sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/WP%7EBRoy_e296.html" title="WP:BRoy"><font color="purple">Vivat Regina!</font></a></sup></small></font> 18:17, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, AnonEMouse. I noticed that <a href="../../../e/p/b/User%7EEpbr123_cec0.html" title="User:Epbr123">User:Epbr123</a> had deleted several sections of text at his <a href="../../../e/p/b/User_talk%7EEpbr123_49b9.html" title="User talk:Epbr123">talk page</a>.

<dd>Sigh. What warnings you can and can't delete from your user talk page is a perennially contentious issue on <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_noticeboard_d516.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators noticeboard">Wikipedia: Administrators noticeboard</a>. The arguments for them not to be deleted are that they serve as a notice to other people giving warnings that the user has been warned before, and perhaps to escalate the issue. The arguments for them to allow being deleted are that warnings aren't primarily supposed to be a notice to other people but to the user themselves, and by deleting the user has clearly taken notice. The usual WP:AN/I consensus is not to block someone <i>just</i> for that, but to treat it as an aggravating factor in borderline cases.</dd>
<dd>Personally I try to archive rather than deleting, and recommend it to others, but I wouldn't make a federal case out of it ever since I noticed a respected user or admin using "archiving" as a comment when deleting large swathes of talk page comments. I asked about that, and was told, not just by them, but by a couple of others, that since it still existed in the revision history it wasn't, technically, deleted. (Maybe I can find that incident in my contribs...) I don't know if I accept that fully, but at least it's something.</dd>
<dd>Deleting a <a href="../../../s/s/p/WP%7ESSP_fb6b.html" title="WP:SSP">WP:SSP</a> notice from the user page has definite rules associated with it, but there's nothing specified about the talk page notification <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_Notes_for_the_suspect_5c56.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry/Notes for the suspect">Wikipedia:Sock puppetry/Notes for the suspect</a>.</dd>
<dd>Specifically in this case, I am inclined to urge leaving Epbr123 alone a bit. Yes, he did push the boundaries of making a point by a string of AfD nominations, but his explanation that he did it in good faith to determine deletion standards is also possible, and I am impressed that in at least one case he changed his mind due to good arguments. And some of his nominations were fully worthwhile ones; note that such noted champions of <a href="../../../p/2A/_/WP%7EP__934d.html" title="WP:P*">WP:P*</a> as <a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabercil_a2ff.html" title="User:Tabercil">User:Tabercil</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Beaudoin_Jr._f03b.html" title="User:Joe Beaudoin Jr.">User:Joe Beaudoin Jr.</a> are also known for nominating not notable porn star articles for deletion. We're not solely inclusionists - even I occasionally argue to delete something.&#160;:-) In short, I think Epbr123's heart may be in the right place, and if we give him a fair chance, he may turn out an asset to both <a href="../../../p/2A/_/WP%7EP__934d.html" title="WP:P*">WP:P*</a> and the Wikipedia as a whole. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><strong class="selflink">(squeak)</strong></sup> 07:14, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks, as always, for the thoughtful advice, AnonEMouse. OK-- I just wanted to make sure selectively deleting chunks of text from one's user talk page is acceptable. Personally, I find it dishonest. In the heat of discussion, I've probably made some statements on my own talk page that I'd like to erase, but, out of respect for a true record, I won't.</dd>
<dd>As far as being an "inclusionist," I wouldn't characterize myself as one, because I do believe in notability standards, and that they should be used to keep out truly non-notable vanity pages. Also, I would not do anything as dishonest as voting <b>Keep</b> when I really believe the subject is non-notable. I'd like to point out, that I have voted for delete in several AfDs, including at least two on Japanese porn subjects. I hope my editing history also shows that my own policy is not to create an article until it is fairly lengthy and well sourced, or can soon made to be so. Even if I start an article as a stub, I make sure it is sufficiently sourced for easy expansion. When another user creates an insufficiently-sourced article on a subject I feel is notable, I try to improve it rather than delete it. And I recently voted to delete an article on a Japanese subject on which I did work, but which I could not sufficiently source-- I did, however save it in my own workspace to work on later.</dd>
<dd>The work I have done on articles recently put up for AfD which are outside of my usual area of interest stems more from a hatred of censorship and a firm belief in intellectual freedom than an "inclusionist" philosophy. (Even if the impulse behind these nominations was not the typical prudery or moral outrage, the result of their successes would have been censorship.) I've taken a week out of working on the area which really interests me-- Japanese erotic cinema-- to fight what seemed to me an attempt at censorship, and, if some of these articles are now better-sourced, I feel it was time well-spent. Even if one or two of the-- what? 2 dozen articles?-- that have been been nominated for AfD recently are truly non-notable, I see this, "Kill 'em all, and let God sort 'em out" approach as censorious in its lack of discrimination. I've attempted to improve the article first, and vote <b>Keep</b> only when I've proven that the subject is notable.</dd>
<dd>As for the editor account that has made mass-AfD nominations within a couple weeks of its creation-- showing a prodigiously swift capability for learning the ins &amp; outs of Wikipedian procedures-- I join you in hoping it will be a productive member of the Wikipedia community. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 16:27, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Furthermore, prior to your post on his talk page, he removed a majority of his talk page, without showing where his archives are. Since his deleted contents are not sequentials, and in responde to the deletuion he said "mind your own business", I would say that he actually deleted them in bad faith, and I <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">cannot assume good faith</a> of him any more.

I did not start nominating articles to prove a point about the Sharday article.

<p>Hi, AnonEMouse. It appears that after that very well-reasoned advice you gave Epbr123, he has, instead of thinking his actions over, re-doubled his efforts at disrupting Wikipedia. A dozen in one 24-hour period. Whether they're made in good faith or not, it's clear that these AfDs have become a disruption, and are wasting a lot of people's time in the process. Whatever his <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> is (I do him the favor of assuming there IS a point, because if there ISN'T, this is simple vandalism), it should either be discussed at WP:BIO or WP:PORNBIO, or be handled in some other constructive way. We have all suffered the pain of a deleted article which we care about. I gave him some advice on how to handle this constructively, but he deleted this text from his talk page and clearly has no more intention of thinking over that advice than he did yours. I am not, and I doubt any of the other editors are, looking forward to another day of following Epbr123 around, trying to catalogue his AfDs. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 17:09, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, no. Thalia festiny for example is hardly a bad faith nomination.

<dd>I would likely agree-- I haven't even looked at the article. Sure, shoot willy-nilly into a crowd of pedestrians and you're bound to hit a crook now and then too, but that's hardly constructive. The thing is, there are so many of these AfDs coming up so rapidly, I don't even have time to look into them all. But isn't that a good a sign of what this is becoming? Twelve nominations in one day? There's no way I can look into each one of these sufficiently, or even in passing, not to mention the fact that I'm not really interested in the American models anyway, except in preventing POV mass-deletions... I'm on the verge of saying, 'To Hell with it,' and just sticking my nose back into researching Japanese subjects, and leaving the rest of the AfDs up to whoever has the time and interest to fight it. Meanwhile he's attracting an "Ew! Porn! Delete" group of followers. Is that, maybe, what he's going for?

<p>Oh Mickey and Minnie. Why do this and Betacommand have to come up at the same time? <small>Someone send me a simple straightforward vandal I can just block!</small> Sigh. An AfD takes 5 days, and saving a good article takes a bit of research which takes time. Betacommand, on the other hand, has shown that he can take out external links faster than a speeding bullet; he's also an admin, which is a separate can of worms.

<dd>All right, it's Monday, I looked at a bunch of his nominations. He really is nominating stuff worthy of deletion; a few so clear but not yet unanimous that even I had to support deletion on them. I only wrote keep on one or two. (I avoided the obvious snowball keep or delete ones) I was amused by Dekkapai's supporting deletion despite the nominator on a couple - and one where Dek was supporting Ebpr123 defending one of his porn star articles from deletion!&#160;:-) Come on guys, he is rough around the edges, but clearly means well. He's gotten better since the first days. I think he'll be a valuable WP:P* member, and that, frankly, is worth a few marginal articles that will never be more than stubs. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><strong class="selflink">(squeak)</strong></sup> 06:45, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, he actually changed it back to 100 from 75, which is a good thing, as I didn't notice the drop either. As for changing the nomination statement, that's not a capital crime - for legibility it probably should have been put as a response to the keep argument, but that's a fine point. It was quite short before, one word. He did evidence a misunderstanding about the 100 film rule in a few places which I addressed at his talk page. Come on, he's making useful comments on the <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a> talk page, give him a bit of a break. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><strong class="selflink">(squeak)</strong></sup> 21:37, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Also, you said in the FA review that <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Snelling_8493.html" title="Fort Snelling">Fort Snelling</a> doesn't mention the Dred Scott affair.

<dd>I'm not sure what you mean here. CN is for discussing community blocks, right? Are you proposing one? Seems unnecessary. Personally I see poor Deathrocker as a well intentioned user who doesn't do well with things like rules (what a shock for someone focusing on heavy metal music). If there is a way to keep him from being indefinitely blocked (I agree a year is almost the same thing) then I'd be in favor of it, I just don't know how to do that. If I knew anything about heavy metal, I could try and deal with the individual issues, but I don't. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><strong class="selflink">(squeak)</strong></sup> 17:51, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm proposing we ask the community: is this it? One more and its a year, no questions asked? Can someone be his buddy for a time? etc. Basically, is there anything we can do to save the user and/or is he definitely at the last of his lives. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 17:46, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not quite sure myself.&#160;:-). At first, I thought every party should create their own subsection, like mine, and I even created the headings for you other 3. Then Tony Sidaway, who was an arbcom clerk for a long time, took those blank sections away, saying everyone should create their own. If you have something to say, you should probably create your own section, but note that for now, this is supposed to be the time when the arbcom decides to take or not to take this case, so this really should be about that. If you have something about Betacommand that I haven't written, please do write it. (For example, as I recommended to Chris: "I think Betacommand is the salt of the earth and should be entrusted to the keys to the city; dismiss this case at once...") While your block of Bc was probably notable, I don't think it will make the difference to the arbcom taking or not taking the case, so if you just want to defend yourself, then you probably want to build your statement in a user subpage or something, then put it on the Evidence subpage if and when the case is accepted. (BTW, don't be scared because Tony thinks your block was spectacularly inappropriate or whatever he wrote - though he is an experienced clerk, so I'll trust his word for the procedural side, the impact of his statements on recent arbcom cases have been <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_InShaneee_Proposed_decision_7d3e.html#Tony_Sidaway_banned_from_Arbitration_pages" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/InShaneee/Proposed decision">not quite what he might want them to be</a>.) --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><strong class="selflink">(squeak)</strong></sup> 20:01, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm never sure if Tony's little splenetic outbursts are just because the venom has built up and needs to be released, or because he's trying to get back at me for past disagreements. No matter. I've left a short comment on the RfArb, just to justify my having a section. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 20:22, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

Since you started the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html#Betacommand" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">Request for arbitration</a> for Betacommand, we wanted you to be aware that we've officially sanctioned Betacommand for his actions regarding bot activity by removing him from the BAG and forcing his bots to undergo another approvals process. This aspect includes regulating deletion scripts running on his main user account. We want to be sure that you've taken our opinions into account with regards to this issue, since we consider this issue to be closed. We also do not want to get involved in this process unless we are called as witnesses to the case. Could you perhaps provide a link to the approvals group page discussion so that everyone is aware of it?

<dd>I think I stuck that in the middle of my statement (chronologically): "As part of the fallout, he apparently lost Bot approval rights: <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EBots_Approvals_group_b90f.html#Betacommand" title="Wikipedia talk:Bots/Approvals group">Wikipedia talk:Bots/Approvals group#Betacommand</a>; <a href="../../../b/u/r/Wikipedia%7EBureaucrats%27_noticeboard_d1a6.html#Another_bot_deflagging" title="Wikipedia:Bureaucrats' noticeboard">Wikipedia:Bureaucrats' noticeboard#Another bot deflagging</a>" - is that good enough, or would you like me to do something more? --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><strong class="selflink">(squeak)</strong></sup> 17:47, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually that's probably fine for now. I'll most likely draft a separate statement in a few hours clarifying the issue.
