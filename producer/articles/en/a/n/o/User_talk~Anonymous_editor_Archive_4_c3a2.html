To get our attention, the easiest thing to do is join #wikipedia-en-vandalism, but if you aren't an IRC user, you can post to one of our talk pages and we'll get the message through.

<p>Hi. It's not even just that the stuff being added by user: Rfcom is PoV, but also that the article dosn't need to be that long about one incedent.

<p>Hello Anonymous editor,</p>

<li>Well, first of all, I usually edit without influence from my affiliation, religious or otherwise. I'm not a Sunni Saudi BTW, but that doesn't mean I'm just being biased against Wahhabis. If I am by mistake, please let me know. Regards. -- <a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagleamn_0ac3.html" title="User:Eagleamn">Eagle</a><sup><a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagleamn_7aeb.html" title="User talk:Eagleamn"><b>a</b></a></sup><sup><a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagleamn_7aeb.html" title="User talk:Eagleamn"><b>m</b></a></sup><sup><a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagleamn_7aeb.html" title="User talk:Eagleamn"><b>n</b></a></sup> 03:34, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Christian Saudi? Is there such a thing? I heard about atheist Saudis, but not Christian. Anyway, I am Muslim (even though people who talk to me for the first time usually think I'm atheist, I think because of my "NPOV" regarding many issues), but I really am a Shi'a Muslim. I know many Sunni Saudis personally, even though I might have a "problem" with Wahhabis, but definitely not all Sunnis. All in all, I try to keep all that away from here. -- <a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagleamn_0ac3.html" title="User:Eagleamn">Eagle</a><sup><a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagleamn_7aeb.html" title="User talk:Eagleamn"><b>a</b></a></sup><sup><a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagleamn_7aeb.html" title="User talk:Eagleamn"><b>m</b></a></sup><sup><a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagleamn_7aeb.html" title="User talk:Eagleamn"><b>n</b></a></sup> 03:45, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><font color="#7FFFD4"><font color="#40E0D0"><font color="#7FFFD4"><font color="#40E0D0"><font color="#7FFFD4">Thanks for the note. I voted "no" because I generally oppose expanding the number of admins except in very special cases. This is because there are too many admins already and many of the current admins are some of the most edit &amp; revert war-prone editors on wikipedia. Because of that about the only people I'll support for admin are ones that have proven histories of very strict neutrality and a hands-off pro-consensus "moderator" type approach to editing. With all that in mind, I noticed that many of the comments on your nomination indicated you've been in many revert wars in the past. While I'm not in a position to judge whether you were justified or not in these disputes, they're just not something I'm looking for in an administrator. Also, please don't take this as anything personal - it's just my philosophy of what i'm looking for in administrators. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangerdude_981c.html" title="User:Rangerdude">Rangerdude</a> 19:46, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</font></font></font></font></font></p>

<p>Hey, I've been having a hard time knowing how to vote on this. I think you're pretty much a good user... sometimes I think you do act too "pro-Islamic" in some cases but I do understand to a certain degree. I also tend to think that six months is a good amount of time to be around wikipedia before being an admin, but that's just my <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Standards_ce02.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Standards">basic standard</a>, not gospel. To an extent I am worried because you seem to take "POV vandalism" as vandalism. That is, there are definitely some additions that are not good and should be removed... but they are not vandalism per se and therefore can't be treated as such. Which of course can be frustrating but, I suppose it might be for the better even in the face of being called an Islamist and other silly things. Overall you're a good editor even though I tend to see you more in the "Islamic camp" than the fully neutral camp but you aren't as bad as some of your counter-parts on the other side -- that's for sure, and you keep the name calling to a minimum. Complaining about the 3RR thing doesn't really matter at this point since it was so long ago when you were new. But, I just want to let you know that I have some misgiving... mostly about time and then about how I sometimes think you are too quick to call vandalism or sockpuppet when the material is POV... and I think you're a little more Islam POV than neutral... but, not too bad. I don't want to neglect all of the great work you've done because I do appreciate that and your willingness to talk in so many cases. Maybe I'm wrong but I think you get overly excited sometimes. Most importantly (to me) is the policy of, "<i>[a]dmins must not protect pages they are engaged in editing, except in the case of simple vandalism</i>". To me this goes into reverting and blocking editors, etc. I have in my RfA made it clear that I am not going to be policing the Islam-related pages as an admin. I may do some work there but we must keep our editing in that capacity separate from our role as admin. I am currently between neutral and support. I wouldn't oppose you since if anything I think you need more time to prove yourself. You've proved to be a good editor in general but there are some areas of contention. I just want your response and how you plan to edit (as admin) around pages that you are involved in controversy. I would think that using the revert function (unless it's <i>simple</i> vandalism) would not always be the best idea and partisan protecting of pages would be bad... I want you to comment on this to me. Also ask me any questions about my view. I have some of the same issues with you that Zora does, and in fact I expected her to be closer to the dilemma I'm in than oppose... in any case, comments and questions would be nice. Sorry to see that the vote is getting contentious, especially that whole thing about being an Islamist ~_~.

<dd>Gren, I have no intentions of abusing the revert button. You know that I am strict but fair. I am willing to relax and become more tolerant against particular constant pov pushers.

I am also willing to relax my vandalism criteria, although it really has gotton relaxed in past weeks.&#160;:) I hope you will trust me to carry this trend.

<p>Hello Anonymous one,</p>
<p>I'm not sure why you deleted the reference to God in Aramaic ("Alaha") from the Islam article, but -- presuming that it was intended in good faith on your part -- permit me to explain. Aramaic is an ancient language, developed from Phoenician, and is a root to both Hebrew and Arabic. Of particular note, it was the <i>lingua franca</i> during the era of Jesus, and was inarguably the language that he used when speaking to the masses. Perhaps based on anti-Semitic grounds, perhaps not, some claim that he may have used Koine Greek/Hebrew when speaking in the temples, but even this is much disputed.</p>
<p>In any case, as I'm sure you are aware, Jesus is considered to be a major prophet within Islam. Notably, how Jesus would have pronounced "God" in Aramaic -- "Alaha" -- is highly germane to the Islam article.</p>
<p>All too often, I've read unlearned commentary from some anti-Islamic "Christian" who opposes the idea of God being called by the name "Allah". As I've just shown, the fact is that Jesus himself both spoke and prayed to the One God as "Alaha," thus refuting such unerudite nonsense.</p>
<p>Kind Regards, --AustinKnight 21:25, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I fully know what Aramaic is my friend.&#160;:) But I don't think we need to reiterate aramaic "Allaha" in all other articles with Allah in them. That is already written in the main Allah article. Writing Allah in every way possible won't make sense. If people desire to learn who Allah is and other prononciations, they will go to the main article.

<dd>Glad to hear that you "fully" know what Aramaic is. But you are going substantially out of your way to miss my point, which I thought was quite clear, but I will clarify and reiterate:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>No, we do not need to write "Allah" in every possible way. No one is requesting that, and it doesn't frankly make sense that somehow you (mis)read that into my intent.</li>
<li>No, we do not need to write "Allaha" in all other articles with Allah in them. No one is requesting that either.</li>
<li>Yes, we should and do need to show this <i>major</i> point of agreement between Christianity and Islam in the introduction.</li>
</ul>

</dd>
<dd>You seem to be overly defensive and reactive, to the point of deliberately misreading clear and good faith intentions. Please allow for the possibility that you need to be more flexible in your thinking, as clearly you went down some paths in your thoughts that had nothing to do with the change to the article...which others have embraced and improved in a very Wiki-social fashion. --AustinKnight 03:10, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry if I sounded overly defensive&#160;:), that was not my intent.

<p><i>In reply to your original message:</i> Look Klonimus, I had nothing against you personally, but since this rfa began, you have started to gather people to vote against me in <b>bad faith</b>. Much of what you do I interpret as POV too, especially these personal attacks against BYT or other Muslim editors. I barely have ever contacted you or even met you, so it seems highly odd that you would go to such lengths to try this and exaggerate this bias towards me. However, I am assuming good faith over the part of your last message that was not personal attack and I would like to hope that we can get along whenever we meet later in the future.

<dd>You yourself have been doing alot of work to draw attention to your RfA. You can hardly complain if anyone else draws attention to your RfA. Unless you are a hypocrite. Are you? And if you can't handle this process with maturity, can you really be trusted as an admin? I don't think so.</dd>

<p>Hi, There was so much written that it was very hard for someone who had not been involved to work out what had really been going on. In a few months of quiet editing it should be much easier to reach some balance and I'd certainly hope to be able to support then. Many of the areas in which you have been editing are very emotive ones and it is naturally difficult for people to reach NPOV conclusions. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 19:47, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Truth be told, anonym, I am strongly anti-"anti-Muslim" (in the sense that I recognize WP needs to work to correct a probable systemic bias in favor of Western Christianity, and I see editors who decry "Islamophilia" here as bit... er, wrong), and I've learned to question some of the editors who voted against you. So, in a few weeks even, barring new problems, I'm sure I'll be a firm strong supporter, and I note you've got praise from good folks on your talk page.&#160;:) Recent "Ignore All Rules" controversy just makes me extra-sensitive about admin promotions right now. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 21:10, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Drumming up votes! Shocking! ^_^ Hve you looked over my admin votes? I think I'm running about 6/2 oppose right now. I haven't leant my support yet, I'm always careful and go over contributions pretty throughly. That being said, SV's words alone makes me fairly certain what I'll find. More generally, there are two possibilities: either the BCs will discount some of the votes against you as obvious bad faith, or they won't. I think that it will be tough at this stage for you to pass the bar if they don't, it's just down to numbers and getting an extra twelve (eleven?) "supports" may be tough. Regardless, there is not much question that another run in six weeks would be successful.<br />

<li>Hey, isn't that admin cliché number 2? No, not an admin, but what I <i>meant</i> was that I generally "oppose" nominations. However, if I <i>did</i> have a RfA right now it would probably run at about that rate. Although I've generally been an even-keeled contributor and tried to calm the waters, I've had a few lapses of late that would probably doom me.</li>

<p>Well, my concern is more what I wrote in my original comment. The campaigning note I added as an afterthought once I saw it on my watchlist and checked your contribs again. I don't think it's entirely reasonable to claim that your messages were exactly neutral. Even though I opposed (on different grounds to most), I do think you are being unfairly hauled over the coals. It's part of the nature of RfA but there is fairly clearly some POV-pushing afoot. It worries me when this happens on an RfA: if we scare all our editors into never editing controversial areas for fear they may never be able to contribute as an admin, we will eventually leave those articles to the most righteously indignant and those incapable of writing encyclopedically. Still, I do think you might float around Wikipedia: space a little more. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 02:33, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the congrats. I was just curious if you were going to add that question or if you thought I should? I mean, I figure it might be a good sign to acknowledge your a part of the debate on certain pages and won't use admin to influence it. That was just my feeling. I'm sorry to say that it seems on your RfA things aren't going well... and I hope it's not because some of the stuff that I think is inflated. Anyways, I do think it was a premature nomination, but I kind of think six months at least, but, just keep doing a good job on the things you do... people appreciate it, and I've appreciated your input many times... much more than the few times we've had our disagreements. Unless of course you're really a monster everywhere else&#160;:D I do wonder how much saying you're a Muslim does to influence things, as in, if I editted the same way but said I was a Muslim how would my vote have gone.

<dd>Nope I wasn't selecting a particular voting bloc, just all the editors I know and some I have seen around. Aside from that I had only good faith, no bad intents.

<p>I can relate. Some of the support voters are among my most unreasonable opposition. I assure you however that everyone changes, and that I make no judgement regarding you as a person, but only regarding the small bit of information I have seen regarding you.

<p><a href="../../../o/y/_/Oy_vey.html" title="Oy vey">Oy vey</a>. That went a bit south in a hurry, didn't it? Even if some of the initial opposes are discounted, you'd now require close to the record number of supports that any admin has ever recieved to pass the 80% mark. On the plus side, you've now received some <i>positive</i>, <i>actionable</i> feedback from people for whom I have a lot of respect. Were I you, I'd craft a nice withdrawal statement where you indicate that you'll widen the scope of your activities, apologise for any offense given by campaigning, and ask that a reputable admin mentor you over the next month. Of course, another fifty odd supports could come floating in...<br />

<dd>Yikes. Without any offense, perhaps a little more experiance in policy space wouldn't hurt. The standard is a (poorly defined but in pracitice well set) minumum of 75%, and over 80% is expected. It does say that on the <a href="../../../r/f/a/RfA_dea2.html#About_RfA" title="RfA">RfA page</a> at the top! ^_^<br />
I'd think about taking that advice above soon, too. If a BC decides it is hopeless, or causing too much disruption, they can close it early and you don't get a chance to back out gracefully. Talk to Slim first maybe, I could be reading this whole thing wrong!<br />

<p>If you recall, we had an earlier discussion where you claimed that Christianity and Islam are the same religion, that Allah and Christianity's Jehovah are one. I would just like to point out: Muhammed said, "Allah would not take unto himself any son!" In other words, Muslims do not believe that God has a son. Well, Christians do. Muslims believe that Jesus was just a prophet, but we Christians believe that He is God's Son, and that He is God. That makes a world of difference between these two religions. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpionman_ba8b.html" title="User:Scorpionman">Scorpionman</a> 19:23, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I never said that at all. I said that there is one God and this belief is shared by both religions. The fact that God has no son in Islamic belief and christianity does is the <b>major</b> difference and I would never say that both religions are the same now (however they were orginally). This is a very common fact, not one that needs to be pointed out. It is just like apples are red and oranges are orange.

<p>Listen deepak, the material added by you completely removes the subject away from the simple definition the paragraph had before and makes it very redundant (mentioning 1989 more than once). I only reverted intro paragraph edits before by reddi before to make it back into a version which was agreed upon. Now the paragraph has become nothing but an attempt to bold terms and not give a clear definition of the issue. I even compromised and added a bolded statement of yours to the intro.</p>
<p>But you still reverted. A definition of insurgency does not need to be in the article and this revert seems unnecessary. There are pages on wikipedia which have dozens of redirects to them, but that does not mean that each definition of every term that redirects needs to be given. Whatever the title is, is the main intro subject of the article, including the <b>only</b> bolded term. Hope you understand. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 00:48, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh you meant the government itself. Well I think that would require some research although it is fairly known that Ahmedinejad looked over the past education for positions in his cabinet.

<p>Your reverts in <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> is confusing. That line is not sourced properly. As someone with knowledge on the subcontinent history will tell you there has been NO exact number specified and rightly so for they are hard to come by. The numbers vary from 250,000 as mentioned by some neutral estimates all the way to millions. The British put it initially at 1 million while India and Pakistan put it at 2 million. A few Pakistani and Indian authors say the death toll was as high as 5 million. The exact demographics of the people killed is not known and any historian talking on this only quotes that an equal number of people (mainly hindus, muslims and a small proportion of sikhs) were killed. Infact it was the darkest moment and statistics on the number of people dying were not given a priority back then. So I don't know how anyone can arrive at the precise 1.4 million figure which you are interested in showing? A mention of 1 million is accepted by both India, Pakistan (and to some extent even Britain). And that's still an estimate, not the accurate figure and no, it does not specify if there were a large number of muslim/hindu/sikh deaths. I hope you understand.

<dd>Fine. Then there should be no problem in saying estimated 1 to 5 million Muslims, Hindus etc. Btw, I do have knowledge on subcontinent history, after all I have taught classes about it; being from the subcontinent makes no difference. Also I only did one revert, the other was a grammar edit. And obviously not an equal number of each ethnic background were killed, it varies. That is why I proposed keeping "large" number.

<dd>Let me just inform you that removing tags from articles with the excuse of "tag pollution" is not a good excuse and in fact that is against wiki policy; my revert of the tag removal is fully compliant of wiki policy. If you can reach consensus then the tags can be removed, but so far there is none. In other words, my readding a tag after you deleted it without consensus is anti-vandalism.

<p>Hi - thank you for your advice. I was also advised by another editor not to respond to statements, unless they are direct questions, so that I wouldn't look confrontational. So I'm taking a careful approach, in which I replied to Zeq's question 4 and also responded to a criticism about my user page, but I'm not sure I want to respond to each and every one of them, such as pointing out that some people who accuse me of having "POV issues" have either 1- had no interaction with me whatsoever, or 2- dislike me because I stood up to one opposing editor's claim that "sexual repression among Palestinians is so high that rape and incest are quite common" and then go on to claim that I have POV issues! I'll try the best I can, but it doesn't look good for me right now. By the way, I am truly sorry that I didn't notice your RfA earlier, my attention was brought to it too late, and I'm sorry for that. Lastly, I was going to thank all those who supported my nomination after the vote was over, but let me just say thank you now in advance! <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamallite_7adc.html" title="User:Ramallite">Ramallite</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamallite_904e.html" title="User talk:Ramallite"><font color="DarkBlue">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 20:51, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Salam!</p>
<p>I have a question. Suppose that <b>a person</b> creates a Wikiproject, spend lots of time to give the project the correct headlines and categories - to the point where other users see it meaningfull to particpiate in it, calling themself for "Guild members" and then start themselve contributing to the page. Then, suppose that <b>a second</b> person creates a really great picture for the guildmembers to use when associting themself with the guild on their Userpage. Assuming the above case, would you conclude that the positive contribution to Wikipedia by those two persons where <b>(A)</b> equally good, or <b>(B)</b> unequal, the one deserving more mertits than the other. In case of <b>(B)</b>, wich one do you conclude deserves most merits, the <b>first</b> or <b>second</b> person?</p>
<p>Thanks and ma Salam! --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 13:43, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Isnt it obvious? Why is me doing a entire guild from scrath, and giving it structure not even commented, but doing a great picture to it is rewarded with a Barnstar?

<p>Please could you help out on the <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_bin_Qasim_417d.html" title="Muhammad bin Qasim">Muhammad bin Qasim</a> articles, as I'm getting really frusted at, a member who keeps adding false information to the article or quoting from weak websites. And he just generally likes bashing Islam. The thing is historical documents of the time show that Bin Qasim did not impose Islam on anybody. <b>The Chachnama</b> has reproduced extracts from the historic <b>Brahmanabad Charter</b> which for the eighth century represents a particularly high level of <b>humanistic social order and values</b>. He is deliberately adding biased information into the article when he for a fact knows this was not true. Bin Qasim was reinforced by Non Muslim jatts, who helped him out. Now why would the oppressed help out the oppressor? it just shows have illogical this claim is that Islam was forced upon the population.</p>
