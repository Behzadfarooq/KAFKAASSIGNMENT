<p>Just FYI: there is no broad policy or grand strategy of Czech government about foreign Czechs. It is more chaos.</p>
<ul>
<li>The law about Volhynian Czechs was approved ex-post to formalize position of people who moved because of fear of soon-to-come civil war in post-Soviet area. These people were initially provided with some housing but not really cared much after.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Some uncoordinated actions were done during Yugoslavian wars (small groups of Czechs lived just in the middle of war zone in Hrvatia). There are several very poor villages in Romania inhabited by ethnic Czechs and when someone from there wanted to live in Czech Rep. he was treated more benevolently than typical Romanian.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There's quite large (est. 170-300 thousands) diaspora of emigrants from 1948-1989 period living in the West and Czech state was not very helpful toward them (they bitterly complain). For example they cannot obtain dual citizensip and their grabbed property was generaly not returned.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Small stream of Czechs from Soviet Union (typically Ruthenia, Volhynia) came in during communist era. These people were handled case by case and bribery often helped to speed the things out.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>An even earlier event happened during 1945 (after the war): the Czechs (few thousands) living around Polish city <a href="../../../r/a/t/Ratibor.html" title="Ratibor">Ratibor</a> (on border with Czechoslovakia) were expelled together with local Germans. (There was almost border war between Poland and Czechoslovakia at that time.) The state set up an office to help the refugees.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
All in all, absolute majority of Czechs lives in well defined geographical area with no overlap and things like "right to return" sound as something from the other planet to Czechs. I don't know whether that much of article space is deserved. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 06:38, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Pavel -- very interesting. There is no disagreement that most Czechs live in the Czech Republic or in well-defined communities of Czechs living outside the Czech Republic, which is what I think you are saying. But the points you raise are important about the Czech government not being all that solicitous of ethnic Czechs living in the West, particularly who emigrated in the 1948-1989 period. I will edit the page accordingly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As to the term "right of return", I think it is inevitable that every nation-state will have its own terminology for what duties, if any, it owes to the national majority with which it has a special link. So I am not so worried about the terminology. Some term must be used to describe the general class of policies, and none is better than any other unfortunately!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, there does nonetheless seem to indicate some broad policy in this direction in the post-1993 era, although I can see it is nuanced and it would be good to know more about the specific reasons driving these nuancing. Clearly the state has felt a duty to ethnic Czechs living in some areas (FSU?) and not others. Sources discussing it include:</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, Report on the Czech Republic´s Implementation of the Outcome of the World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen, 1995 (only in Google cache now, I think, <a href="http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:vP_iaEqNg6kJ:mpsv.cz/scripts/clanek.asp" class="external free" title="http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:vP_iaEqNg6kJ:mpsv.cz/scripts/clanek.asp" rel="nofollow">http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:vP_iaEqNg6kJ:mpsv.cz/scripts/clanek.asp</a>): "The aid program for resettlement of ethnic Czechs to the Czech Republic continued in 1998. The program is based on the Czech government's policy principles regarding the resettlement of foreigners of Czech origin living abroad."</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think your edit on <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right_of_return.html" title="Right of return">Right of return</a> is correct although <i>broad policy</i> is IMHO too big word. The people from former Soviet Union came in and the government saw it as the fact and ex-post created a policies (read: an ministerial officer wrote something boring and it was quickly approved to get rid of this annoyance before dinner). To the people from Romania the state sent some material help, partly to keep them there since those few who came in (typically young ones) often had hard time to find a job.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The policy toward emigrees in the West was initially formed by few politician (who disliked them) and since no one really cares it somehow stayed intact over years. It is not stringly limiting in practice: because of many holes in the law system quite a few people got Czech citizenship and retained previous one. I can provide few examples how absurd the sytem can be. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 23:44, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks. That's really helpful. <i>Broad policy</i> is no longer there at all, and I think the current version may capture the sense of arbitrariness or lack of consistency which you explain well.

<p>Hello AnotherBDA. I am in the process of rewriting a number articles I started on language demographics in Quebec and Canada. If you are knowledgeable on the subject (and interested of course), you are invited to contribute to my drafts here:</p>

<dd>Hey, it's no longer a duplicate -- there are some heavy edits there! But, yes, the base article is from the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia, which a foundation has digitized and placed online at the Web address to which you link. I think your premise is that either permission has been secured, or it is a copyright violation. There is a third possibility, though -- that the source is in the public domain. That is the case here. The 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia is in the public domain. Although the foundation which digitized it asserts copyright, that copyright can apply only to the digitization in its entirety -- in other words, one does not have the right to reproduce the entire Web site, because the data array is protected by copyright as a collection. The individual articles cannot be recopyrighted, because copyright has lapsed. (If public domain could be reversed by asserting the contrary, then it would not be a very useful concept.) <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnotherBDA_0c9c.html" title="User:AnotherBDA">AnotherBDA</a> 02:50, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
