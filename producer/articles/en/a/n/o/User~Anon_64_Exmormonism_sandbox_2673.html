<p>Research shows that 43% of Mormon disaffiliates left due to unmet spiritual needs. Of former Mormons surveyed, 58% switched to other faiths or practices (mostly <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a>). Of those with no current religious preference, 36% continued to pray often or daily<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[5]</a></sup>. However, "single reason disaffiliates are rare among former Mormons" <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[6]</a></sup> Reasons for leaving may include: logical/intellectual appraisal, belief changes/differences, spiritual conversions to other faiths, life crises &amp; poor or hurtful responsiveness by Mormon leaders or congregations <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[7]</a></sup>. Although many leave to be true to themselves or to a new belief structure, they leave at a tremendous cost <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[8]</a></sup> feeling ostracized, pressured and missing out on major family events such as temple weddings.</p>
<p>An informal internet poll has shown that disbelief in Joseph Smith as a prophet and the Book of Mormon as God's word leads most Exmormons to leave the LDS Church.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[9]</a></sup> Privately affirmed belief in both ideas is officially required, by interview, to actively participate in Mormon meetings and ceremonies, including the privilege to have a signed recommendation in order to witness the temple marriage of a family member <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[10]</a></sup>. Public disavowal of either belief can result in church <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disfellowshipping.html" title="Disfellowshipping">disfellowshipping</a> <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[11]</a></sup>. All members and potential converts are encouraged to seek and express a spiritual confirmation that the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Mormon_f6c8.html" title="Book of Mormon">Book of Mormon</a> is true, inferring that <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr._b262.html" title="Joseph Smith, Jr.">Joseph Smith, Jr.</a> is therefore a prophet <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[12]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Commonly, Exmormons begin to reject LDS teachings because of <a href="../../../s/k/e/Skepticism.html" title="Skepticism">skepticism</a> regarding a spiritual witness encouraged by Mormonism <sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[13]</a></sup>. Concerns might also exist regarding the morality, historicity, or revelatory truth of LDS teachings, embodied by inconsistent or suppressed teachings of early church leaders such as Brigham Young's <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam-God_theory_1919.html" title="Adam-God theory">Adam-God theory</a>, declared to be a false doctrine by the LDS church. <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanist.html" title="Humanist">Humanist</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminist.html" title="Feminist">feminist</a> positions may view LDS doctrine as racist and/or sexist. In these cases, traditional LDS doctrines regarding the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blacks_and_Mormonism_f4a0.html" title="Blacks and Mormonism">spiritual status of blacks</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> or the role of women in society are cited <sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[14]</a></sup>. Some leavers cite their incompatibility with Mormon beliefs or culture due to their <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_orientation.html" title="Sexual orientation">sexual orientation</a> or from having <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal.html" title="Liberal">liberal</a> views that challenge predominant Mormon <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conformism.html" title="Conformism">conformism</a><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[15]</a></sup> and political attitudes.</p>
<p>Some Exmormons have left for specific reasons that led them to a conviction that the LDS religion is false. These include perceived scriptural inconsistencies within the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>, perceived inconsistencies with the anthropology and archaeology of Mesoamerica and Egypt <sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[16]</a></sup>, and objections to earth's history as taught by Mormonism on the basis of DNA evidence. Some Exmormons argue that the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Mormon_f6c8.html" title="Book of Mormon">Book of Mormon</a> and the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Abraham_c04c.html" title="Book of Abraham">Book of Abraham</a> are fake historical documents <sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[17]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[18]</a></sup>, and others object to what the present hierarchy teaches, on the grounds that it dismisses or contradicts the teachings of the early leaders such as <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigham_Young_eeef.html" title="Brigham Young">Brigham Young</a> or <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Fielding_Smith_2ffa.html" title="Joseph Fielding Smith">Joseph Fielding Smith</a>.</p>

<p>In terms of their post-Mormon religious beliefs, many leave Mormonism for more mainstream <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christian</a> religions, while others become <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">atheistic</a>, non-religious or non-Christian <sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[19]</a></sup>. Exmormon attitudes toward Mormons and Mormonism also vary widely; some Exmormons actively proselytize against the religion, some prefer to help those in need of support but not actively argue against Mormonism, and others prefer to avoid the subject entirely. Former Mormons also differ in attitudes regarding their church membership; some resign (the LDS church refers to this "name removal") while others simply become inactive. At least one website is devoted to helping LDS Church members who wish to process their resignation with the LDS Church.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>

<p>Exmormons decide whether or not to be private about their decision to separate from Mormonism. Often, those who are open about leaving face intense pressure to return. Friends, family members, and ward members who are active church members strongly believe that someone who leaves is in danger of negative eternal consequences. Thus, they may feel strongly motivated to try to steer the departed member back into belief <sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[21]</a></sup>. The social aspect previously provided at church is often replaced by new friends, frequently including other Exmormons (see Exmormonism and the internet below).</p>

<p>A former Mormon Bishop described his disaffiliation as recovery from group expectations and overcoming <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognitive_dissonance.html" title="Cognitive dissonance">cognitive dissonance</a>,<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[22]</a></sup> as well as recovery from fraud or abuse.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>

<p>There are precepts in LDS scripture and doctrine concerning those who openly disagree with church hierarchy as those to be potentially cursed or condemned. <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korihor.html" title="Korihor">Korihor</a>, a person mentioned in the Book of Mormon <sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[29]</a></sup> who preached disbelief, challenged prophecies and church leaders,<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[30]</a></sup> and who was miraculously struck deaf and mute by a chief judge as evidence of divine authority, is often compared to or identified with Exmormon authors<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[31]</a></sup> or any reasoning that leads to disbelief in Mormonism.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>LDS scripture teaches that <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">Satan</a> is actively seeking to destroy the souls of men <sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[33]</a></sup> and that those who <i>depart from the truth</i> will be judged in the final judgment <sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[34]</a></sup> for being deceived or deluded by Satan.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[35]</a></sup> Some who have left the LDS church have claimed to have been blamed for their disaffiliation accordingly. LDS history points to trivial reasons why some members have left, such as the misspelling of a name in church records (History of the Church, 1, p. 261) or inability to get a seat at a church service (George A. Smith, Journal of Discourses, 11:09).</p>
<p>Some LDS adherents view apostasy in terms of their doctrine of <i><a href="../../../o/u/t/Outer_darkness.html" title="Outer darkness">outer darkness</a></i> for <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Son_of_perdition.html" title="Son of perdition">sons of perdition</a></i> who <i>deny the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Spirit_e4ea.html" title="Holy Spirit">Holy Ghost</a></i>, although this doctrine has other interpretations.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[36]</a></sup> This may cause an Exmormon to be regarded as a candidate for eternal damnation based on their former devotion to Mormonism, as others will be judged more lightly, having no previous knowledge.</p>
