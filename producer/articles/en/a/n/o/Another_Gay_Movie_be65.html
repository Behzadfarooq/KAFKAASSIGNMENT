<p>We see one of the main characters, Andy, sitting in class as everybody around him sits and does their own little thing. Andy is looking at something dreamily and we see that he's looking at his teacher's buttocks. Mr. Puckov (<a href="../../../g/r/a/Graham_Norton_6522.html" title="Graham Norton">Graham Norton</a>) calls Andy up to the chalkboard. Seeing that Andy has an incredible erection, Mr. Puckov pulls down his pants and begins to engage in anal sex with Andy. The other students do not pay attention and go about their previous engagement. Then we see that it was all just a day dream. We see Andy in his room moving his hand in rhythmical motions, inserting a carrot into his buttocks. As Andy gets more into the fantasy, his mom (<a href="../../../l/y/p/Lypsinka.html" title="Lypsinka">Lypsinka</a>) then walks in to get all of his dirty laundry. She questions where Andy's gerbil "Sparky" has gone. As Andy explains that he ran away, his mother takes a shirt off of his bed revealing a cucumber with a condom rolled onto it. His mom stares in shock as his father walks in. Explaining that "This is a man's thing" to his wife he rushes her out of Andy's room.</p>
<p><i>Another Gay Sunshine Day</i> by <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nancy_Sinatra_0b21.html" title="Nancy Sinatra">Nancy Sinatra</a>, plays as the opening credits role.</p>
<p>It is graduation day at San Torum High School. We see two more main characters, Jarod, and Griff, exit from the school building cheering. Andy and another main character, Nico, see the pair and go running to congratulate them on their graduations. The group began asking who's going to get laid at their friends party tonight. The friend "Muffler" exits the building yelling "WHAT THE FUCK!?" (Muffler is a lesbian). Muffler explains to them that they should use their manhood already. Nico explains how he's used his for other things but sex. Muffler then explains how they are still virgins. At the characters office (a video store), Nico's mother walks in from storage and fixes his collar. The others all wonder why he has not told his mom that he's gay yet. (Nico is highly effeminate which is the reason the boys wonder) He explains that his mother suffers from a syndrome and that she just thinks he's "Special".</p>
<p>Later that night at Mufflers party, Griff sees Jarod with his date. Jealousy begins to slowly takes it is course. Then we see Jarod and his date, alone in a bedroom making out. Outside in the living room Andy is checking out Mr. Puckov. Muffler pops up and throws Andy on the ground beginning to playfully act as if she were giving him anal sex. Andy begins to scream Mr. Puckov's name and say dirty phrases right as Mr. Puckov walks right by. Seeing Mr. Puckov, Andy immediately stops and explains that he was talking about another Mr. Puckov. We then see that Jarrod is about to engage in anal sex with his date. Explaining he's allergic to rubber, his date tells him to bareback him. Possibly grossed out, or too much semen was indulged during oral sex, Jarrod throws up all over his dates back. The following morning the boys witness Muffler saying goodbye to the cheerleaders. Mad that Muffler gets "half the cheerleading squad," the for make a pact to lose their "Anal virginity" by the end of the summer.</p>
<p>The next day in Nico's bedroom the four of them must decide whether their a top or bottom. Jarod announces he's top but would not mind someone to take control. Andy asks if anyone is bottom curious. Nico explains that he's a for sure top. Hearing all the commotion, Nico's mother walks in asking what Andy is curious about. Playing it off coolly, Andy asks where she gets her hair done. After Nico's mother goes, Griff cannot decide his position. Andy says he a top, of course. Realizing he's in denial, Nico checks him down as "in denial". The deadline to come by is Muffler's labor day bash. All of them begin preparation for "the big A". Nico's blind girlfriend takes pictures of Nico in a raunchy thong, posting the picture on Nico's online profile, "Twinkerbell".</p>
<p>At Andy's house, we see Andy "grooming" himself, legs spread apart with a mirror blocking his genitals and anus. His father comes into the room with a bag of goodies for his son. Totally embarrassed, Andy covers himself up. His father get him anal toys and a book on anal sex. Finding a lengthy string of beads Andy questions his use for them. His father explains those are for his wife.</p>
<p>At the sandlot, a game is being held by the boys and their team and by a rival gang by the name of "Bad News Bears", (bears being in the sexual term). As Andy steps up to the plate, he sees Mr. Puckov cheering for him telling him to focus (because of Mr. Puckov's foreign accent it sounds like "Fuck us"). Hitting a homerun, Mr. Puckov begins engaging in anal sex once again with Andy. Just like before, it was just a fantasy. In reality Andy does not hit the ball at all. As Jarod steps up to bat, the pitcher, for the other team, Bau, begins to flirt with Jarod. As Jarod hits a homerun, the teams begin to celebrate in victory.</p>
<p>Later at Nico's house, Nico fills Andy in on a rumor spread by Muffler that Mr. Puckov's online screen name is "Rodzilla". As Jarod arrives, Nico gets a response from the dating website he's on. Showing the picture of the man (<a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Rush_70be.html" title="Matthew Rush">Matthew Rush</a>) Nico is hooking up with, the boys all see that his penis is visible. Being ashamed about his size, Jarod excuses himself to go to the restroom because of his headache. Looking for the Aspirin, Jarod finds a penis enlargement device in the bathroom cupboard. Realizing this is exactly what he needs Jarod straps the device on and pushes the on button. The device begins to make suction noises as Jarod smiles and giggles. Just as he's almost done, the device begins making strange noises. Jarod repeatedly pushes the stop button but the device will not shut off. Screaming for help, Andy's father comes up and sees the problem. After trying to rip it off, Andy's father repeatedly beats it with a towel rod. The device breaks off leaving Jarod with a sagging red penis. Down on the couch, Andy's father explains that it is alright to have a small penis and reminisces about his days in the navy. The showers he took with his ship mates. Starting to become grossed out, Andy thanks his father for rescuing Jarod and asks him to leave. As Andy's father gets up the boys see that he has an erection. Andy's father goes to pat Jarod in the back, his erection colliding with Jarod's face, and then a lamp as he leaves.</p>
<p>Next we see Griff at a Gluteus Maximus work out center. Being unable to follow the dance routine, the trainer asks the boys to go for a break. Griff complains about the size of his buttocks. Angel, the trainer, informs Griff that he's looking fine. He explains to Griff that if he wants someone to notice him, he needs to "work it on out". Asking the DJ to turn it up, Angel begins to erotically dance for Griff. When finished, Angel informs that he works at "Bodangles".</p>
<p>In some other part of town, Jarod is playing <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croquet.html" title="Croquet">croquet</a> with another male. Jarod complains on how he's doing, then the other player comes up to him and asks him to put his arms on his to show him how it is done. As he instructs, the player nudges his buttocks into Jarods pelvic region. At Griffs house, Griff contemplates whether or not he should call back Angel. Exasperated with how his try for anal is happening and the wanting to be with Jarod, Griff goes over to lay on the bed to dream. In Griffs dream, he looks into a mirror wearing a dress. Staring into the mirror, his rage makes the mirror break. Parodying the 1976 film <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carrie.html" title="Carrie">Carrie</a>. Then Griff is at senior prom, Jarod walks onto the stage with Griff dressed up like <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Katt_a5c4.html" title="William Katt">William Katt</a> (also in Carrie). As Griff goes on stage to accept the award, we see Beau underneath the stage parodying <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nancy_Allen_d957.html" title="Nancy Allen">Nancy Allen</a>'s character in Carrie. During the moment of ecstasy, Beau pulls a rope, making a bucket of what is presumably semen onto Griff. Waking up in a panic, Griff sees that he had a wet dream.</p>
<p>Later that evening at Nico's new boyfriend's house, we see the two sitting and listening to dance music. His boyfriend talks about the time he woke up to find a blue glowstick up his buttocks. The two then dance around to the jumping music. Having some form of a seizure, Nico's boyfriend collapses on the ground. When the paramedic arrive they try to give mouth to mouth, but instead French him. They explain they must open his belt up because it is too tight. After reviving him, he begins to dance again. Getting frustrated, Nico goes home. Then we see Andy at his house. He sees that his parents are gone and that his mom left him quiche. Remembering what Jarod said earlier, he prepares to have sex with the quiche. But before he can do that, he lifts a top off of a cookie jar revealing his "missing gerbil". His parents then arrive home to see Andy humping the quiche and a toilet paper tube inserted into his anus with Sparky's tail sticking out of it. As the parents look in shock, Sparky's tail slides into Andy's anus all the way. Andy apologizes and limps off, as Andy's mother explains "I'm not mad at you, I'm mad at the crumbs!" Quoting a famous line from <a href="../../../m/o/m/Mommie_Dearest_82ba.html" title="Mommie Dearest">Mommie Dearest</a>.</p>
<p>As Nico enters his home, he sees his mother playing the piano. He then tell his mother that he likes guy's. His mother replies with a "DUHHHHH". Wondering what took him so long, she sits him down and shows him all of the feminine things he did as a child. Like play out all of one of <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madonna_%28entertainer%29.html" title="Madonna (entertainer)">Madonna</a>'s concert, wearing ladies shoes, dressing up as <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karen_Black_fe38.html" title="Karen Black">Karen Black</a> in <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airport_1975.html" title="Airport 1975">Airport 1975</a> for a plane trip. Later at Jarod's house, Jarod invites Griff to come into the pool. Griff answers with a no, but Jarod grabs him and throws him into the pool. Sitting on the edge, the two flirt a little then go one with their business.</p>
<p>Later at Andy's house, Andy is on his computer chatting with Mr. Puckov while <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbating.html" title="Masturbating">masturbating</a>. Mr. Puckov (now knowing he's chatting with Andy, asks is he's into <a href="../../../b/d/s/BDSM_7cde.html" title="BDSM">BDSM</a>. Not knowing what it is but replying with a "of course", Andy then gets invited over. Meanwhile at Griffs house, Nico walks in whining about how there better be a good reason he came there. Jarod and Griff explain to him that they have tapped into the school locker room cameras. Nico tells them their "ill" but begins to enjoy their private peek-a-boo. Over at Mr. Puckov's house, Andy tells him he has a nice hammock (actually a leather holding device for S&amp;M), going over to try to lay in it, his shorts rip on his backside. Mr. Puckov comes dressed in leather and has an exaggerated penis and nipples. As Mr. Puckov begins to play with Andy , Andy accidentally presses a bicycle horn making Mr. Puckov freeze and stick his hands into the air. Andy escapes running down the street. All of this can be seen on a website by the boys and Muffler.</p>
<p>Awhile later, at Andy's house, Andy is recovering from the rough stuff with "Rodzilla". Nico then explains that he is going to see Richard Hatch. A million dollar bear, the survivor of the television series Survivor who is holding a book signing. The other guys are asked if they have any prospects for the upcoming weekend, Griff asks Jarad if he would like to check out Bojangles.</p>
