<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:All american rejects on trl.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a> but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. When you use a generic fair use tag such as {{fair use}} or {{fair use in|article name}}, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use.</p>
<p>Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a <a href="../../../i/m/a/Help%7EImage_page_09d1.html#Fair_use_rationale" title="Help:Image page">fair use rationale</a>.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Anom8trw8_be91.html" title="Special:Contributions/Anom8trw8">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box. Note that any fair use images lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>.

<p>You said: "Ok, first off let me apologize for my rude behavior earlier. I know that after a talk with some others that the Ciara image can't be used since it is replaceable, and that the Mel image was put up for speedy deletion (I also put up the Ciara deletion which was deleted recently). The All American Rejects photo is still being used but with the appropriate tag since it can't really be replaced since any other concert of them would have the same issue."</p>
<dl>
<dd>I took a look at the image you mention and I agree in principle, but you do need to establish on the image page <i>why</i> it is important to depict them in concert. We can not use this image simply to illustrate what they look like, it must add meaningfully to the article. To take an example, Madonna is (or at least was) known for her extremely racey concerts. It would be reasonable to have an image from a concert attached to a paragraph discussing this fact (though I have no idea of this is the case with the article on Wikipedia right now). On the other hand, it would <i>not</i> be appropriate to have a fair-use image of the All American Rejects being used solely for illustrative purposes. If you don't see the difference between these two cases, please let me know. And apology accepted. Everyone violates Wikipedia policy from time to time and I certainly won't hold it against you. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 19:51, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please note that the claims made above are incorrect. I have not examined even a significant fraction of the last 100 contributions from this user and absolutely nothing before then, as far as I can recall. Second, as has been pointed out to this user, the ciara image may not be used solely to depict Ciara, a living person, as per <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a>. See criteria #1 and counterexample #8. Even if it could (which it can't), you can not remove a no-rationale tag from an image <i>until the rationale is provided</i>. Doing so is considered vandalism and the user was warned about this. The tag provides a week for the user to add the rationale before the image is removed. As to point #2, I simply have no idea what the user is talking about. AAR? What does that stand for? What image is being discussed? And for point 3, what point is being made? That I noted the image was missing additional information? How is that an attack on the user? As to the point about t.v. screenshots, I have repeatedly pointed the user to <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a>. That other images also violate Wikipedia policy is not an excuse to remove the tags from other images. Also, please note that creating a new account to get around a block is abusive behaviour (see <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>), and a threat to do so makes it harder to assume good faith. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 05:54, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Note also this user has claimed that t.v. shows are not copyrighted, or that portions of a t.v. show are not copyrighted. This is not the case. It is possible that a t.v. show may use some portion of non-copyrighted material, but then the source of the image would <i>not</i> be the t.v. show but the original provider of the information. Additionally, the license would no longer be tv-screenshot. In the case of the t.v. shows in question, however, no evidence has been provided that the t.v. show in question used outside, uncopyrighted, content. Concert footage would be copyrighted, for example. Finally, <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a> very clearly states that fair-use images may <i>not</i> be used to depict living people, as has been pointed out over and over again to this user. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 05:58, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, you didn't exam my last contributons is definitely a lie. I bet there's a one in a millionth chance you looked up Mel Peachey and AAR (All American Rejects) images on random. The Mel Peachey tag is the same one for the Ciara image so basically you also had a problem that it was a TV screenshot. I explained the tags to the images do NOT violate Wikipedia policy. Specifically All American Rejects on TRL. And with the Ciara image, it is for identification. I could name HUNDREDS of articles with TV screenshots of people that were taken from TV of people on their article. I know that it's not illegal to put Christina Aguilera's taped concerts or her "Dirrty" music video on her profile, so same goes for Ciara.</dd>

<dd>You do realise that your contributions are a matter of public record? Can you provide a single edit of yours older than the newest 100 contributions which I have examined? If not, I will thank you for not calling me a lier. That hundreds of Wikipedia articles have violations of policy is reason for you to mark the violating images with the appropriate tag, <b>not</b> an excuse for you to remove these tags from images you have uploaded. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 06:16, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And with new account, I am assuming good faith.

<p>If THAT were the case, it would mean that I created the image, so why would it matter for copyright. If what you are saying is that the portions of these shows aren't copyrighted means that the image is for the holder of the work, I. AM. THE. HOLDER. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnom8trw8_a091.html" title="User:Anom8trw8">Anom8trw8</a> 06:08, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not understand how you come to this false conclusion. I am not claiming there are portions of the t.v. show with non-copyrighted material, though I'll admit this is a possibility. But even if there were, your taking a screenshot of this does not make you the original provider. In the interest of minimising conflict, I will not respond to any more comments for a number of hours. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 06:16, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Concerts are not copyrighted. Period. Ciara is singing. There is no provider of her voice or whatever you are trying to explain. If Ciara were on Roomraiders, then it likely wouldn't be possible to upload that. However, since it's a concert, it's the same thing as me driving to LA and taking a photo of her (or their for AAR) performance. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnom8trw8_a091.html" title="User:Anom8trw8">Anom8trw8</a> 06:24, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
