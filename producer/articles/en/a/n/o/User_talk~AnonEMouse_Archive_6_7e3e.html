<dd>Makes sense... click the WHOIS button at the bottom of the IP's talk page. It comes up as one of two things, but edit history includes the school and makes it obviously a school IP. You try not to block schools for too long. Certain 48 is more than necessary IMO. I block schools for half an hour. That's usually enough to have them leave the lab, go to class, and allow the rest of the school to edit. - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">crz</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">crztalk</a></small> 15:12, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My rationale for 48 was that vandalism has been once a day for the last 4 days, so 24 might not have any effect. A half hour certainly wouldn't have any effect. There had been a 24 hour block a few months ago. If it's a school and it's Friday, the distinction between 24 and 48 may be moot, of course. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 15:18, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Arbcom and transparency</span></h2>
<p>While you're entitled to your opinion, I don't think we disagree on the basics. Regarding transparency, I believe that the core problem with the arbcom is that, the way things are structured presently, there is no clear and unified rationale for them to communicate. We've been seeing fragmented decisions because they are voted on in pieces. The way most of the arbs work is that they read through the evidence and the summaries and proposals and then vote based on what they have read. For many of the cases, you see all of the decisionmaking there is to see on the case pages themselves; the only discussion on the private mailing list is "hurry up and vote so we can close &lt;name of case&gt;." So the problem isn't that there's hidden discussion, it's that the thought process behind each vote is in each of the arb's heads and never gets written down or communicated at all (except to the extent that they make comments when they vote). This is why I've been putting the emphasis on improving the workshop/proposed decision process and lobbying for more cohesive opinions written by one individual speaking for the committee.</p>
<p>I was an initial advocate for the presence of a private mailing list for the arbcom members, and it was in fact initially hosted on one of my servers. The purpose of doing so was to provide a discussion space where the arbs could each figure out where they stood and what the points of agreement and disagreement were for each decision. The idea was that then representatives from the one, two, or N schools of thought involved would then go and put together an organized summary of all that for the community to read. I don't think that goal has ever been realized, certainly not as much as I would have liked to see. Ultimately, the arbcom itself is best served articulating its reasoning clearly and concisely since it relies so much on widespread support and respect from the community to implement its remedies.</p>

<dd>Considering you have more support than any other candidate, as well as a history of support from <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">our founder</a>, I really, really hope that's true.

A star chamber is more efficient than an open process, no way around it. It just causes resentment.

<p>My compliments on your synthesis of questions to ask the candidates in the ArbCom elections. They do a very good job of drawing out the opinions of the candidates on very important issues.

<p>Got another one for you: <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incredible_Hulk_%28cocktail%29_6895.html" title="Incredible Hulk (cocktail)">Incredible Hulk (cocktail)</a>. It was successfully AfD'ed several months ago. Someone recreated it. It was deleted again. Someone recreated it (again). This time I noticed some good info in it (not much, but better than what we currently have in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cocktails.html" title="List of cocktails">List of cocktails</a>), and I requested (uselessly it appears) that the article remain alive until we finish our cleanup (on or before March 1). Sadly, it was deleted again before I had time to cull the usefull stuff. It sure is frustrating when people delete stuff right and left on you while you're trying to improve things. No pity, no mercy, I guess. An AfD appears to be a permanent seal of doom no matter how someone tries to fix it. *sigh* (Yes, I'm frustrated, can you tell?)

<dd>Oh, and more general advice? Don't take it so hard. It's not the end of the world that Wikipedia sits a few weeks or months without this information. Really. It will all turn out for the best in the end - eventually someone will find or write a better source for this information, and we will be able to write a good enough article with sufficient content and references. Meanwhile, even if a few people did come looking for a recipe for the Incredible Hulk, and had to find it elsewhere, or even make Martinis or Screwdrivers instead, I don't think they suffered long. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 15:00, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for your clarification on <a href="../../../f/r/i/WP%7EFRINGE_f64f.html" title="WP:FRINGE">WP:FRINGE</a> and whether it relates to non-scientific fringe theories or not. I would like your advice on just such an application. I am in the middle of a very contentious AfD dispute. The article in question is <a href="../../../j/a/h/Jahbulon.html" title="Jahbulon">Jahbulon</a> (there is a link to the AfD on the article page). Here is the debate in a nutshell (and I will try to be NPOV in discribing this)... Some of us (including me) feel that the article has problems with WP:Fringe, and should be either deleted or merged (into another article where FRINGE would not be an issue). Obviously, those supporting the other side very much disagree, and say we are misapplying FRINGE. At this point, I don't know what to think anymore. I think I need a neutral party to read the article, the AfD discussion and the debate on the talk page, and tell me FRINGE applies or not. I will not quote you (you can add your two cents if you fell like it)... I just want a reality check to see if I am completely off the radar or not.

<dd>Whoo. Deep waters. Yes, from reading the article, it seems the main backing for the controversy is a single book by Ankerberg and Weldon. (By the way, the links pointing to it don't work for me.)

<dd>Err. On the other hand, the <a href="../../../j/a/h/Talk%7EJahbulon_cc5d.html#Mainstream_sources" title="Talk:Jahbulon">Talk:Jahbulon#Mainstream sources</a> talk page note about the <i>Religion in the Contemporary World</i> makes me change my mind. That seems to be a mainstream book, and if it really says, "They have therefore been repeatedly embarassed by repeated accusations that theirs is an occult faith which worships a composite deity called Jahbulon, who is different from the god of the world's great religions.", then it clearly thinks this is a notable concept. FRINGE calls for extensive discussion, and while this source isn't extensive discussion in itself, it does assert that there has been such. That's close enough. "Jahbulon" also seems to get 18,000 Google hits, which isn't everything, but isn't chopped liver either. Sorry.

<dd>Thanks for the imput. It is good to know that I was not losing my mind, and that my initial interpretation of FRINGE was sound (as the reference to <i>Religion in the Contemporary World</i> was just added and was not among the references when we filed the AfD). I can accept your take on things. Disappointing, but so be it. I think both sides in this debate (and I will include myself in this) have let their personal POVs about Masonry influence their arguments on the AfD, and in editing the article ... and it is nice to have a reality check from an outsider. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 19:37, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is a funny coincidence. I'd like to direct your attention to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2006_December_15#Rachel_Hudson" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2006_December_15#Rachel_Hudson" rel="nofollow">this AfD debate</a>. Whether you agree or not, the nominator raises an interesting point about notability re: things that have gotten media coverage. When I read this article after seeing it on DYK, I immediately thought pretty much all the things the nominator says in the AfD of this Rachel Hudson article, but I just let it go. But now that I see this blossoming debate, I wonder if you think the situation applies doubly so to this article - after all, nobody died at the Heart Attack Grill, and it got far far less media coverage than Rachel Hudson. In other words, I would consider nominating this article for deletion based on the reasoning used in the above cited debate - but I thought I would get your feedback.

<dd>Wow. Amazing. Just a few thoughts, yes.
<ol>
<li>The nominator's arguments in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rachel_Hudson_056c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rachel Hudson">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rachel Hudson</a> are a prime example of the <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_true_Scotsman_3eed.html" title="No true Scotsman">No true Scotsman</a> fallacy. Sure, he writes, it may look like the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> wrote 4 articles on the case, but they didn't <i>really</i> consider it important. Nominator has psychic powers that the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> criterion lacks. Thank God.</li>
<li>Looks like <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Hudson_d2f1.html" title="Rachel Hudson">Rachel Hudson</a> is going to be kept in a landslide of epic proportions. Thanks for telling me, I'm going to go join the landslide.</li>
<li>Even if RH were deleted, I strongly question your assertion the the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heart_Attack_Grill_8f25.html" title="Heart Attack Grill">Heart Attack Grill</a> got less coverage - RH's coverage are all from one source, and arguably a local source only (BBC Nottinghamshire). HAG's coverage is multiple stories from multiple sources, on several topics, including international coverage.</li>
<li>Finally - let's see. I wrote the article over several days, found a good number of sources, edited, re-edited, nominated it for DYK, edited the DYK nomination repeatedly, and apparently care about this sort of thing, given that I plaster DYK banners all over my user page. Hmm. Is it really that much of a mystery how I would feel if that article were casually deleted for not being important? <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 17:38, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Advice on a work in progress</span></h2>
<p>Hi, AnonEMouse. You seem to be a major editor in the subject and to know Wikipedia's policies in the area much better than I do. So I wonder if you have the time and interest, if you could look in on a work in progress of mine, User:Dekkappai/List of Japanese AV actresses, 1980s. Any advice you can offer on how to improve it, and how to pre-emptively safeguard it against deletion would be most appreciated. I have a few areas of concern/doubt regarding the list myself, but will discuss them with on my talk page if you are willing. Thank you.

<p>Hi there. I have a question for you concerning external links in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cocktails.html" title="List of cocktails">List of cocktails</a>. An anon user continually wipes out the three links that I have placed there, along with the notes I have left advising people to 1) list the links alphabetically, 2) what types of sites should and should not be listed, and most importantly, 3) before making changes bring it to the talk pages for discussion.</p>
<p>Here is how I leave it (dashed lines are HTML comments):</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>External links</b></dd>
<dd>- Please alpabetize named links. Do not link the description, just the name. Thanks. -</dd>

<p>Previously the user had left only the goodcocktails.com site, and the entire description of that site was linked. I guess we are making <i>some</i> progress.</p>
<p>The only dialog I am seeing comes in the comments made during the reverts:</p>

<dd>I noticed the changes, read the reverts, and reviewed each listed link by visiting the sites again specifically checking to see if the links were good resources or not, and if they were overly spammy. I dropped one site and created the list and notes I have now. Created a corresponding talk page entry explaining my actions.

<p>This feels like what could become the start of an edit war. If so, it would be my first. Actually, it won't be, because I refuse to get dragged into one. I'm the first to admit that I do not know all the policies around here, but I do know that repeated reverting can lead to problems (I know there is some jargon for it like 3RVR or something). Furthermore, it's no fun for anyone involved. Additionally, I admit my choices of links are just that -- my choices. I am open to other people's choices and their decisions if the consensus goes contrary to my opinion. Usually after hearing the other side, we can easily reach compromise (thus the reason I have avoided edit wars in the past). This person, however, is not participating in discussions, so I am at a loss.</p>
<p>What are your feelings on the links I selected? Yes, 1001 Cocktails is a commercial site. Is that against Wiki policy? I do not see how when many commercial sites are linked to all the time. The site does contain ads, but they are easily ignored and non-offensive. I weighed the value of the information contained in the site vs. the commercials, and weighed that against several other drink sites I've encountered in my research, and I feel 1001 Cocktails <i>is</i> a worthwhile and useful site, no matter if it is commercial or not. Goodcocktails.com appears to be commercial, but even less so in appearances. It just does not offer as much useful information to me when I am researching artciles for the Project. It's a good site, however, which is why it is one of the three I selected. It certainly shouldn't be the only one listed, because it is too incomplete a resource.</p>
<p>If you see holes in my logic (or think I am outright in the wrong), please let me know so I can mend the errors of my ways. On the other hand, if I appear to be in the right, please advise me on what steps I should try next. Sorry this is so long, but it <i>is</i> the first one of these, so I was probably overly explanatory.

<dd>I'm the anon user that removes his ongoing spam link. Its extremely simple: the Goodcocktails site is completely free of ads, its not commercial (despite Willscrlt's false description of it being so) and does not contain an online store or affiliate links to sites that sell products. The one link is adequate, there's no point in adding a link to an online store that uses drink recipes to increase their customer base. I can only imagine that it's his site, as much as he tries to spam with it. He can takes whatever steps he likes, it doesn't change the fact that it's a commercial spam link that doesn't contribute anything to the article that other non-commercial sites couldn't. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.155.70.148_0897.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.155.70.148">68.155.70.148</a> (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.155.70.148.html" title="User talk:68.155.70.148">talk</a>) 23:22, 17 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>Ha ha. It is too funny that you would think I am affiliated with 1001 Cocktails.&#160;:-)</dd>
<dd>It is not that I am trying to spam with it. Quite the contrary. I have been doing 95% of the cleanup of the Wikipedia articles related to Cocktails on here (and I don't even drink them, and I am not affiliated with any cocktails sites, bars, alcohol brands, distributors, etc.; I'm a computer consultant). In the process of all that cleanup, I have regularly Googled many drink terms and drink recipies. Cocktaildb.com and 1001Cocktails.com are two of the sites that repeatedly comes up with highly useful information related to my searches. They are commercial, of course. Most of the sites on the Internet are commercial unless they are run by non-profit organizations (and even those solicit through fundraising) or individuals passionate about a topic. Many sites run by individuals without corporate backing are inferior to commercial sites simply because the Webmasters also have to go to work and school, spend time with families, live their lives, and so forth. Commercial sites can pay one or more people to sit around 8 hours each day to improve their sites. I stated that Goodcocktails.com also <i>appeared</i> to me to be a commercial site. I should have verified that before making that observation. According to the <i>About Us</i> page, it appears the site is run by an individual (José Manuel Quezada). The fact that it is an individual's site instead of a commercial site does not change my opinion of it at all. I still feel it is a good site, but not as comprehensive or useful as either Cocktaildb.com or 1001Cocktails.com when researching cocktail-related information, and that is from my actual experiences doing so. I have no connection (affiliate, stockholder, paid, unpaid, or otherwise) with any of these sites, except for using them.</dd>
<dd>I really wish you would discuss this on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_cocktails_1544.html#External_Links" title="Talk:List of cocktails">talk page</a> so that we could get the feedback from other people who visit that page. That is why the notes are included with the links. By blanking the notes, and repeatedly tossing out (in my opinion) perfectly useful links, and not engaging in discussions about the links, it gave the appearance of vandalism (especially since the edits are done anonymously). I see now it is a matter of heartfelt concern on your part, rather than spite or unsavory motives. Let's put it to a discussion and see how other people feel about the value of the 1001Cocktails site. If people are offended or think it sucks, then no problem--it goes bye-bye. If people find it useful and informative, then it stays. Can we agree to that compromise? And in good faith, I will re-post the notes, but leave out the 1001Cocktails link until, and unless, there is consensus that the link should be included. In exchange, you agree to not revert that section after I make those changes. Is that fair enough?</dd>
<dd>Most of all, thank you for finally engaging in dialog with me. I really appreciate it.&#160;:-) P.S. Sorry for filling up <i>your</i> talk space with all this, AnonEMouse. It really belongs on the article's <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_cocktails_1544.html#External_Links" title="Talk:List of cocktails">talk page</a> instead of here. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillscrlt_a1d7.html" title="User:Willscrlt">Willscrlt</a> 03:27, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The second one is better, naturally (I gather you uploaded that one), however I would guess that Angr's objections are that the books aren't really discussed in the article enough to qualify for fair use claims. If that is the objection, I'm afraid I'll have to go along with him. The only mentions of the books that I can find in the article are:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>XXX: 30 Porn-Star Photographs</i>—A photograph of Ridgeston was used for the back cover</li>
<li><i>Edition Euros 11: Photos of Lukas</i>, photographed and published by the renowned photographer Bruno Gmünder in 1999.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>That's not really discussion of the books, that's two list entries. There is nothing that indicates the books were in any way special to the article, it bears a list of a dozen of them. The intention of the {{<a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBookcover_74f4.html" title="Template:Bookcover">bookcover</a>}} tags are for articles primarily, or to a large part about the books themselves. To cite one example we both know&#160;:-), the <a href="../../../h/o/w/How_to_Make_Love_Like_a_Porn_Star_068f.html" title="How to Make Love Like a Porn Star">How to Make Love Like a Porn Star</a> article is about the book itself, and the <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenna_Jameson_fd39.html" title="Jenna Jameson">Jenna Jameson</a> article devotes almost as much space to the same book's major effect on the career of the performer - those can be standards to shoot for. If the article discusses how Lukas got a significant portion of his fame from one particular book, that would be a good fair use justification for the cover being used there. It's also useful as a specific counter-example - <i>XXX: 30 Porn-Star Photographs</i> uses Jenna Jameson on its front cover, but there isn't anything special about it in her career, she's appeared on quite a few covers, it wouldn't be fair use in her article either. Of course Jenna is an article we've worked hard on specifically for it to be a model to others. Here are a few uses that aren't quite as polished, but still fair use, I believe: <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gang_bang.html" title="Gang bang">Gang bang</a> - where over half of the article is indirectly about the effect of the series being portrayed, and two paragraphs are specifically about the first two specific films in the series whose covers are shown. Here is another, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clare_Short_d7f9.html" title="Clare Short">Clare Short</a>, where the book is directly described in only a few sentences, but it is an autobiography, and covers the events of the article. That last one could probably use more on the book itself, actually. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 13:56, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I went back and looked at earlier versions of the article and found that I'm the culprit here. In making edits to tighten the article and "listify" some of the information I eliminated the text that was more specific about the books. In particular, the <i>...Photos of Lukas</i> can be considered fairly notable as it is a single-subject book; not many porn stars get their own books. Absent any real information about the books, however, the removal of the images was certainly justified.</dd>
<dd>I wrote to this exact topic regarding the <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desire%C3%A9_Cousteau_8e7f.html" title="Desireé Cousteau">Desireé Cousteau</a> DVD covers in her article at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Porn_stars_c447.html#DVD_Covers" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Porn stars">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Porn stars: DVD Covers</a>. I'm still of the opinion that there doesn't need to be gobs of information about the item the illustration is for. In the case of the <i>...Photos of Lucas</i> image, referencing the fact that it is a single-subject book about him by a noted photographer should be sufficient information to justify the inclusion of the image in the article. I think that a short reference to the book and its importance is enough to justify using the images. As long as the reference provides some brief, but descriptive, information about the source of the image.</dd>
<dd>This probably doesn't justify anything:
<dl>
<dd>"He appeared on the cover of the <i>foo</i> book."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>But this might:
<dl>
<dd>"He was chosen as the model to appear on the back cover of <i>foo</i>. The book, by renowned photographer <i>whoever</i>, included an introduction by <i>someone notable</i> and essays on pornography from well-known artists such as <i>artist 1</i> and <i>artist 2</i>. The book also became the basis for an HBO documentary of the same name."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>In my mind, this sort of reference provides enough substantive information about the book to justify showing an image from its cover (or interior). Whatever illustration is used needs to be low-resolution; it would proabably be best to include an image of the front cover, as that is where the title of the book being referenced appears. Perhaps side-by-side images?</dd>
<dd>I may or may not spend the time revising the article in such a way as to justify the restoration of the images. My perception of late is that I'm one of the (mighty) few people that does any serious work on these articles. After "rescuing" <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falcon_Entertainment_1f26.html" title="Falcon Entertainment">Falcon Entertainment</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Dalton_%28porn_star%29_6e01.html" title="Mark Dalton (porn star)">Mark Dalton (porn star)</a> I came to the realization that there just aren't very many folks out there that really grasp the importance of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>; they're just convinced that if they know and/or it is common knowledge that the topic of the article is notable/important/significant, then the article belongs here, with or without references to sources.</dd>
<dd>The latest illustration of this is at <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandre_Frota_f73d.html" title="Alexandre Frota">Alexandre Frota</a> (<a href="../../../a/l/e/Talk%7EAlexandre_Frota_48b1.html" title="Talk:Alexandre Frota">Talk:Alexandre Frota</a>); I started to write more about that topic here, but realized it was turning into a rant, so I'll skip it.</dd>
<dd>The bottom line for me is that I'm becoming less and less willing to step in and clean up articles that no one else seems to care enough about to spend time <i>writing</i> them instead of just slapping a few statements on the page and calling it an "article". (I'll stop there, too; I seem to be afflicted with a stronger "ranting bug" at the moment than the one I usually experience.</dd>
<dd>Any road, thanks for your assistance. Just in case I wind up not nagging you again before then, I hope you thoroughly enjoy your holidays.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Concerns</span></h2>
<p>Hi again, AnonEMouse. I'm still learning how Wikipedia works, so I'm not sure if some things that I personally think are not quite right are the way Wikipedia works normally, and I should just get used to them... Anyway, I have some concerns about some recent actions here-- An editor acquaintance of mine (<a href="../../../h/e/x/User_talk%7EHexvoodoo_b309.html" title="User talk:Hexvoodoo">User talk:Hexvoodoo</a>) had posted invitations at related pages to join an outside project he had started. The last instance of this posting was several weeks ago, yet he was blocked without warning for "spamming." Also, the admin who did this has stated that inviting concerned parties to AfD discussions constitutes spam, and implied that a user could be blocked for doing this. Are both these correct? <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 19:46, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The first seems overreaction, I'll ask JzG if we can unblock. The second is correct, though it would have to be rather extreme to cause actual banning (but has happened). You want to see <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html#Votestacking" title="Wikipedia:Spam">Wikipedia:Spam#Votestacking</a> and similar sections. The relevant issue is the formation of "factions", that would prowl the Wikipedia and be able to set policy or delete or keep articles by sheer weight of numbers, rather than argument. Since there really are thousands of editors here, if you work at it just a bit, by looking through edit histories of likely articles and see how each edited, you can probably build up a good sized voting bloc for nearly any issue you feel like. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 20:06, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
