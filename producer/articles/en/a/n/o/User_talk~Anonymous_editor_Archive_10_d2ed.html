<p>Dear Wikipedai administrator, can you help settle a dipsute for this article; <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamism.html" title="Islamism">Islamism</a>. See the following section of that article's talk page; <a href="../../../i/s/l/Talk%7EIslamism_a150.html#POV_Tags_added_April_4.2C_2006" title="Talk:Islamism">Talk:Islamism#POV_Tags_added_April_4.2C_2006</a>. Thanks a lot. Your help would be greatly appreciated. In my opinion, this article is 90% speculation with no sources. I think it should be deleted and completely rewritten with actual citations and facts. Thanks for taking the time to read this. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMuslimsofUmreka_ab05.html" title="User:MuslimsofUmreka">MuslimsofUmreka</a> 04:27, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have reverted once today.

These users bully others from the discussion page in order to have the article all to themselves. I am happy to rejoin the discussion if this behavior ends.Timothy Usher 20:58, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Anonymous Editor,</p>
<p>I am curious as to why you chose to take me to task for one revert while overlooking MuslimsofUmreka's multiple violations of wikipedia policy, including this morning's transparent sock puppitry and a personal attack right here on this page, then freezing his version of the article immediately after a revert by yet another sock puppet (whether his or not, I can't say). At first glance, and without knowing your reasoning, it seems less than fully impartial.Timothy Usher 23:50, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi Timothy. I was just warning you when I gave you the message not to revert anymore because that will get both of you blocked. Looking at the article for the first time I really don't know who is which editor or who is reverting to which version, because there are so many different new editors involved. Good luck solving the dispute. Regards. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 02:22, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks. In the meantime, is there any way to stop him from evading wikipedia rules via sock puppets? (Any doubt you might have about this charge I'm sure will be removed if you look at User:165.230.73.18's edits, e.g. his requests for arbitration - same issues, same time, same stylistic/spelling errors, etc.).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I believe the underlying problem here is an editor who doesn't sincerely attempt to follow wikipedia rules, yet plays the victim and games the system, thusfar successfully.Timothy Usher 02:58, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Meanwhile, although I've called his attention to<a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> on several occasions, MuslimsofUmreka continues his personal attacks against other users. The latest, he is accusing some other editor of being homosexual and even included this in his edit summary.Timothy Usher 03:50, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Additionally, his ally on the discussion page, User:24.7.141.159, constantly resorts to personal attacks, most recently including: “Let me demonstrate to everyone who insane and unstable you are.”. “Not only do I disagree with that statement, I find it extremely offensive because of your elitest mentality”, “ Liar and fabricator." and probably others I haven't spotted in his lengthy screed. I have again posted <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> but have no reason to think it will be heeded this time when it's been ignored thusfar.</dd>

<p>Dear Anonymous Editor,</p>
<p>If you read the latest post by User:24 on Talk:Islamism, you'll clearly see that User:Timothy is not innocent at all. He has been removing comments and making a lot of false accusations (i.e. calling User:24 an Islamist in hope of censoring User:24's opinions). User:24 and the rest of the gang were actually being productive until User:Timothy started disrupting the talk page with, what amounts to, trolling. I agree with User:24 in terms of asking User:Timothy to explain why he is calling other editors names and why he is refusing to back up his false accusations against User:24. Furthermore, User:Timothy needs to be accountable for deleting comments. Also, User:Timothy's ally User:67.188.110.197 keeps disrupting User:24's comments. Please read the long post by User:24 from which User:Timothy is pulling his quotes from. I'm going to suggest putting User:Timothy on a wikibreak because of his whining after losing an argument. Thank you for listening. <a href="../../../h/r/a/User%7EHrana98_bf7b.html" title="User:Hrana98">Hrana98</a> 08:14, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Sock puppet...or v.v., depending on one's point of view. Until just now, Hrana98's edits ended long before anonymous editor User:24.7.141.159's began. He is just picking up his old address, as the literary style of this post makes quite evident. And like 24 etc. he ignores <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>Timothy Usher 08:21, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Can you please explain my literary style? In that explanation include how my desire to not edit for a few months automatically makes me an anonymous user. <a href="../../../h/r/a/User%7EHrana98_bf7b.html" title="User:Hrana98">Hrana98</a> 07:23, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So I guess it's a full-scale coordinated onslaught now? Great. Don't suppose you'll stop to thank me for my frequent reverts of anti-Muslim vandalism on this same page? (e.g. inserting "Answering Islam" and the like)</p>
<p>Please note on my talk page the comment of the other editor, with whom I've never spoken prior to today:</p>
<p>"Absolutely, I didnt mean to imply that your edit was vandalism, I definitely know Red Crescent has a pretty poor track record. I just thought that paticular edit of his wasnt exactly debatable or vandalous information, although i didnt notice that he had deleted your bit about view from outside. I like the way youve changed it to read now. -<a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELanoitarus_7ca8.html" title="User:Lanoitarus">Lanoitarus</a> 08:18, 7 April 2006 (UTC)"</p>
<p>Also note Red Crescent's highly personalized comments on the talk page, and on this one - as per the title of the section, it is about me, not the Muhammad article, which I've put a lot of work into; see the discussion page. As is so typical, those with very strong POV's in one direction or another cannot abide NPOV versions.Timothy Usher 09:20, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for all your hard work on behalf of Wikipedia? I wanted to take a moment today to talk to you about your username. It seems that it might be confusing to have someone named "Anonymous editor", since "anonymous" has a specific meaning in Wikipedia jargon, referring to IP editors who don't have accounts. Would you please change your username to something else? That would be great. Also, while you're at it, I always recommend to everybody that they choose a username that is either their real name or else just some name that <i>sounds</i> like someone's real name. So you might want to consider that, too.

<p>Hi Anonymous editor,</p>
<p>The article <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">dhimmi</a> is protected and I can not edit it myself. Can you please add the original research tag ({ {OR} }) to the article? There are lots of problems with this article to my mind. One but not the only disputed passage is for example the following(in the "Sources of dhimma" part)</p>
<p>"The verse calls upon Muslims to fight against the People of the Book until they pay the jizya head tax and are humbled:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold forbidden that which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I disagree with usage of the word "humbled" and taking this passage out of the context(the first sentence does not mention the context of the verse and to my mind contains original research). There are many disputed passages. In any case, I think the tag should be added to the article if any of the parties dispute it. I would be thankful if you could add the tag to the article.

<dd>It's wasn't indisputably vandalism or bad faith. The editor may have thought - as I'm sure did Netscott - that he was striking a perfectly deserved blow against religiously-motivated censorship (q.v. the incessant vandalism of the Muhammad image that is on the page now). I do agree that the link shouldn't be there, and will revert it if I'm around if and when it pops up again.</dd>
<dd>However, I will say that it is somewhat intimidating, for you as an admin to edit from above, so-to-speak, without explaining yourself on the discussion page. There is a POV here, which is fine. It's the potential intersection with the admin part that makes me wary.</dd>

<dd>Obviously it was vandalism/bad faith and others though so too. Reverting to a vandalized version just because you agree with it is very wrong. So he needs to learn from this than taking sides with people who have clearly done something wrong. I doesn't need an explanation when it's clearly vandalism/bad faith. Editors shouldn't find the opportunity to start a fight over something when an anon adds it just because they agree with it and the 3rr was violated with four reverts of the same thing. I don't see any debacle on the other issue by the way, the page was protected because of an edit war. Having to revert and then protect a single version out of the ten editors working on the page would be very much against policy. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 05:01, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

Only the <i>result</i> must be NPOV, this requirement does not hold for individual contributions. A simple example: imagine that only criminal converts were added, it would take a very "unbalanced" edit, i.e. the addition of a representative number of reputable converts in order to make the article NPOV. As the vast majority of names on the list belong to established celebrities such as pop singers, politicians and sporters, I still fail to understand what is the problem with my additions, which happen to be well-referenced. The article now reflects a broad spectrum of Muslim converts, which I think, makes it more balanced and as NPOV as it gets.

<p>Hi Anonymous editor,</p>
<p>I have another request. I am sorry for bothering you again and again. Can you please give a revert to the Al-Ahbash article and then lock it. The reason is that we don't still know if the table should be there or not, and moreover it seems to be offensive to Ahbashis. So, it is better not to have it there while we are discussing it on the talk page.</p>

<p>And it should be added that Timothy first called edits of McKhan as "one of the most offensively one-sided and mean-spirited articles." which I still don't have any idea about it. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 01:52, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, I did say that, but I didn't start talking about his name, where I thought he lived or what I thought he did for a living.Timothy Usher 01:58, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I see your point Timothy and know you were editing in good faith, but he interpreted your sentence in that way. Let's forget about it. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 02:06, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Anonymous editor, is it possible to unlock the article just to see if people will engage in revert war again or not? I am not familiar with the rules, would you please let me know if this is a possibility.

<p>Salam! I uploaded an image <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Shaheen_P1080390.jpg" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Shaheen_P1080390.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Shaheen_P1080390.jpg</a> but I mistakenly named it "Shaheen" for Shaheen Airlines, whereas it was infact Aero Asia.

I did find the deletion list, but those are probably the images that have copyright issue and need someone else to fix them, or otherwise be deleted in 7 days or whatever. This case is different, the image is redundant and has to be deleted, so please delete it and also let me know whether only an admn. can delete it or an ordinary editor can do that as well.

<p>I also would like to draw your attention to the fact that the topic was continuously vandalized by anonymous users. And at the time the topic ‎was protected from editing it held the vandalized version of the anonymous user 151.151.21.99.‎</p>
<p>The content of the current vandalized version hold a clear attack against an ‎organization solely for its beliefs (Racial, sexual, homophobic, religious or ethnic epithets ‎directed against another contributor), leaving no fare space for constructive discussion. Noting, that the auther of the vandalized version has ‎been banned from wikipedia twice this month.‎</p>

One of the articles in which I'm said to have edit-warred is <a href="../../../a/i/s/Aisha.html" title="Aisha">Aisha</a> -- and two of the arbitrators are crediting the charges. I know you also monitor that article and do a lot of reverting of PBUHing and charges that Muhammad was a pedophile. Could you explain to the arbitrators the situation at high-profile articles like <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a>, and <a href="../../../a/i/s/Aisha.html" title="Aisha">Aisha</a>, where it takes constant reversions to keep the articles in reasonable shape?

I've created a new Category under "Category:Northern Areas, Pakistan", and added a sub-category of "Category:Cities and towns in Northern Areas, Pakistan" and another sub-category of "Category:Regions in Northern Areas, Pakistan" which lists the previous or current states that are now consider as "Northern Areas" (cities are not included in this list).

<p>I noticed that you blocked some IP address with indef blocks, with the reason: "another rajput editor using IPs for rv war" While I certainly trust that you are more familiar with the revert war in question that I am, I do wish you to explain the unspecified length of the block - AFAIK, a revert war, as idiotic and frustrating as it certainly is, isn't vandalism, and perma-blocking an IP addres, which may be shared by multiple, different users, does not seem justified.

<p>Hi Anonymous editor,</p>
<p>I've expanded Tom harrison's USC Qur'an template to accomodate several other display options, as follows:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/00009.qmt.html#00009.0010" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/00009.qmt.html#00009.0010" rel="nofollow">009:010</a> (the original template)</p>
<p>Template:Quran-usc-num</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/00009.qmt.html#00009.0010" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/00009.qmt.html#00009.0010" rel="nofollow">009:010-015</a></p>
<p>Template:Quran-usc-numrange</p>
<p>As you see, the link is the same. All these do is allow us to choose whether the word "Qur'an" displays (in case it's already been mentioned, seeing "Qur'an" everywhere can be redundant), and to include the range in the link display (even though of course it still starts in the same place) where appropriate. Shame about the zeros, but I don't know how to automatically pad the inputs.</p>
<p>Don't use them yet; I still want to make sure the template names are good and won't need to be changed.</p>
<p>I'm also cooking up some Hadith templates for the same site. Any feedback?Timothy Usher 07:48, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. I'll see it when it's done. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 19:19, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>joturner has made some improvements - we no longer need to input or display three digit values, as the zeros are now magically added. Also, we've decided not to include "Qur'an" in the display, so the four templates will be reduced to two, if not one (still haven't heard back about the range problem).</p>
<p>In the meantime, I've taken a chance in the intro to Islam. After all the controversy on Muhammad re central figure/major figure/founder etc., what's your opinion of this:</p>
<p>"Islam is a monotheistic religion centered on the text of the Qur'an."</p>
<p>Do you think that fair?Timothy Usher 05:15, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That seems fair.

<dd>Anonymous editor, I agree that clarifying things in the intro makes things more clear for many people. But let me show you a counter example. I was moving around changing some of the words "Allah" to "God". Guess what? Someone asked me: "Just want to be clear on this... When Jews refer to <a href="../../../y/a/h/Yahweh.html" title="Yahweh">Yahweh</a> they are actually referring to <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a>?" Then I provided quotes from Maimoinds and so on to PROVE that they are the same. Please note that these are educated editors. The sentence ""it isn't so clear to me that Garbiel is referring to the angel that talked to Muhammad. However, it is clear that Jibril is." was written by an "admin". --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 01:18, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anonymous editor, I completely agree that if someone really knows a little bit about Islam will know that "Allah" is God. The problem is that most of the people don't know Islam. It is potentially very easy for people to think that "Allah" is a different God, because they have different words. I think our understanding of the words are based on the contexts that those words are spoken (and I think a child learns the words through their usage). In natural language no two words are 100% synonym. They maybe very close but not 100% synonym. So, our mind likes to make distinction between different words. I think having two words for the same thing is considered something extra and will be removed through evolution of language. Now, we have imported the word "Allah" from outside to English language. I believe it is quite natural that people think Muslims are worshipping a different god named "Allah". I was particularly annoyed when I saw the article "Islamism" just because of the word "Islamism". I believe it is a conspiracy. I need to go now but will be back soon and will explain more.--<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 01:39, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But the problem is that the majority of people don't learn about the words in wikipedia. They learn the words from media and others <i>within the context they are used</i>. If the word "Allah" is only used in an Islamic context, then most of people (especially uneducated ones) will think Allah IS the God of Muslims (and this the reality we are observing now). I believe unless we use the word God over and over in Islamic contexts, we will not be able to correct this view. Another way and maybe a better way is using the word Allah in christian or Jewish religous contexts which I don't think I will be able to do that in wikipedia. I think if we import the word "Isa" to english language, we will make the situation even worst. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 01:51, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>An important point to both of you, as relative to all of this talk of transliterated Arabic terms and the English language on Wikipedia it may not be clear in your minds.: Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary" title="WP:NOT">not a dictionary</a> and thereby is not a <i>usage guide</i>, or <i>slang and idiom guide</i>. To quote that policy here for absolutely clarity, <i>"Wikipedia is not in the business of saying how words, idioms, etc., should be used. "</i>. Editors are to write articles on how <i>things are</i>, not to write articles based on how <i>things should be</i>. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> 18:39, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Netscott, of course Wikipedia is not a dictionary. The issue is rather one of translation. As en.wikipedia.org is an English-language encylopedia, we can all agree that the vast majority of foreign terms ought be translated into English wherever adequate equivalents are well-established. Typically this is accompanied by the original language gloss following the first words of the article, which themselves are usually identical to the article’s title. Counterexamples fall into two categories: 1) where there is no well-established English language equivalent (e.g. <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dharma.html" title="Dharma">Dharma</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deen.html" title="Deen">Deen</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/f/Kafir.html" title="Kafir">Kafir</a>) 2) where the article is about the foreign term itself (<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a>, <a href="../../../y/e/s/Yeshua.html" title="Yeshua">Yeshua</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesu.html" title="Jesu">Jesu</a>).Timothy Usher 07:38, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, "Allah is God" and I am writing the articles on how things are. Allah is a glorified proununciation for the God that People of the Book already know. It is a misconception that Muslims are worshipping a different God than People of the Book worship.</dd>
<dd>There is no reason that all religons except Islam should have the right to use the word "God" but when it comes to Islam we need to mention Allah. That's discrimination and utter injustice to Muslims. It is like forcing Jews to use Yahew instead of God in their articles.</dd>
<dd>A good compromise suggested by Timothy which I think is really good is using the word "God" within the typical texts of wikipedia but using "Allah" in Qur'anic verses and quotes. This should make everything clear. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 20:21, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Aminz, moving the article specifically will not really clear the misconception. People who don't want to believe the figures are the same will always do that. But in Wikipedia, we can use the actual name for Isa as the Islamic figure that exists in his own importance not because an article on Jesus exists. It doesn't mean that if a figure also exists in Christianity too that this figure becomes only an article based on the perspective. Isa in his own self can have an article just like <a href="../../../y/e/s/Yeshua.html" title="Yeshua">Yeshua</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesu.html" title="Jesu">Jesu</a> that do exist. It's a different belief and the entire reason why the articles is here in the first place. It isn't just that because a figure exists in two religions that we can not have the real name of the figure being used as the name. The argument is not just the English language translation, which like I said is not a good argument since we have many articles named on figures in other languages. Just about all the other language biography articles and articles on important figures are that way. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 01:53, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well if you read my comment, you can start with Yeshua and Jesu as examples. I wasn't talking about "pov-forks" specifically. I said we have many articles named on figures in other languages.

<p>Dear Anonymous editor,</p>
<p>I believe what we are discussing here is more like a real life problem rather than a mathematical problem. I don’t believe we can say one is true and the other is wrong. One position maybe better than the other but I don’t believe one of them is right and the other is wrong. Arguments for both sides could be presented. And I think all of us have our own underlying motivations which will dominate our position towards the issue. The arguments can always be produced. My underlying motivation is of course very clear. I want to avoid misunderstandings of Islam as much as possible. I guess your underlying motivation is to make sure that people do not look at the Islamic concepts from their own (e.g. Christian) perspective. I guess you believe that having different words helps the readers to distinguish between the concepts (or beliefs) and clear up their minds for new information. Am I right? Though we should not mention our underlying motivation in wikipedia, but can you please let me know if I have understood you correctly. I believe unless we don’t discuss the matter at the level of underlying motivations, we will not be able to get at consensus regarding this issue. <b>Maybe we all look for the same thing at a higher level.</b> Thanks, --05:18, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Anonymous Editor,</p>
<p>Timothy asked me to look into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Isa&amp;diff=51247552&amp;oldid=51244640" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Isa&amp;diff=51247552&amp;oldid=51244640" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> in which you wrote about Timothy that “You already admitted it was arbitrary.” Timothy gave me the following reference for this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Isa&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51155143" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Isa&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51155143" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> that reads: “Yes, were they arbitrary. But translating Arabic terms into English cannot be reasonably described as arbitrary.”</p>
<p>If this is the reference for Timothy’s admission of making arbitrary changes, I can not see how that sentence could means that he has admitted that his changes were arbitrary since 1. the above sentence is in question form and also 2. is followed by another sentence that makes the meaning clear: i.e. He believes the translations are not arbitrary changes. This is the only way I can read that text. I can not see how the above sentences substantiate that “Timothy has admitted that his changes are arbitrary” if that is the only reference for this.</p>
<p>Timothy claims that your comment “You already admitted it was arbitrary” implies that he is doing something he believes arbitrary and he considers this as a charge against my character which I believe is true if he has not accepted this charge in reality. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 05:43, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't care if he admits it was arbitrary or not. Moving a page, making 20-30 disputed edits and changing all the names while there is still disagreement on the talk page is arbitrary whether he admits it or not.

<p>Greeting Anonymous editor, thank you for writing me on my talk page. I must admit that while I fully do not support User:Timothy Usher's edits I was concerned about his block only because I didn't see a 3RR violation report anywhere and <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Black_d709.html" title="User:Sean Black">User:Sean Black</a>'s block of him seemed to have spontaneously occurred (and it mentioned only "edit warring", not specifically 3RR violation). You don't already have the diffs corresponding to his violation do you? <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> 12:27, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well there are at least three independent (and rather varied) editors expressing concern about his block. Having just reviewed the history on the article I can only find 3 reverts in 24 hours:</dd>

<p>Am I missing one somewhere?</p>

<dd>That said there's no doubt about it that after the unprotect of the article it was poor form of User:Timothy Usher to immediately revert. Also one can see that you two have been going back and forth and the types of edits that he's doing shouldn't be done without a wider (than that one article) general consensus on it. Still, unless I'm mistaken about his diffs it is rather wrong to accuse him of 3RR when such is not the case. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> 12:50, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Exactly the case and as I mentioned reverting constantly to a version that he changed arbitrarily while discussion was still going on with much disagreement is edit warring by itself. What really makes it worse is that he reverts <i>right</i> after unprotection <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Isa&amp;diff=51191736&amp;oldid=51153319" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Isa&amp;diff=51191736&amp;oldid=51153319" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. He has to learn without reverting. Even if it's not an exact 3 revert block does not make it so that it's any better for him to start pushing his version while discussion is going on with much disagreement. And changing all the names of the article when the title does not fit it is a also very wrong. If he was blocked, it's because he needs to cool off otherwise he would just revert again. I didn't edit the article <b>yesterday</b> at all for the very reason that I want to avoid any problems like this. But Timothy has done this on many pages, always making people accept his version, and then edit warring. Read <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3rr_66ae.html" title="WP:3rr">3rr</a>, a block is certainly deserved simply because of repeat reverts to a version which is currently controversial and <b>being discussed</b>. I thought that he would have learned to stop, but it still continued into yesterday. He should not excessively push his version which we are already trying to discuss on the talk page. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 13:06, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I completely understand your points and they are valid but in <i>good faith</i> I believe you should unblock him for your having <i>falsely</i> accused him (thereby prejudicing others against him) of 3RR violation.

<dd>No because it's certain that the edits were reviewed before according to what Sean said when blocking him. It itself was disruption and excessive reverting over the past few days to a version that's being discussed. Just because he reverts every day and makes sure that he doesn't exactly make four in a day doesn't make it acceptable. It's disruption when other editors are trying to work out his largely changed version and he's just reverting and he does the same afte unprotection. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 13:18, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No Timothy was involved in the disagreement on the talk page.

<dd>Please stop altering my comments. I am allowed to clarify what I mean. Your actions are, regardless, still a block under edit warring and the 3rr policy because it was excessive reverting to a completely arbitrary and controversial version while the discussion is going on on the talk page. You knew it was controversial and there was a large disagreement so why did you make massive changes like changing all the names in the article? You can't make huge changes and expect all editors to keep them. It could have waited till discussion was over, but you kept reverting even after the article was just unprotected. That is reverting excessively only to push your largely changed version of the article and for your argument to rename the article. That's not a rename is done as I'm sure you know. The block is too cool off and stop reverting. I didn't edit the article at all yesterday to avoid this problem. You keep reverting and never care about compromise or wait for any consensus. You can't make such large arbitrary changes to the article all at once and then make it worse by trying to revert every day 3 times until all editors accept it. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 19:10, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Anonymous. Thanks for your message on my talk page. I'm a little uncomfortable jumping into someone else's battle, but I see what happened the other day as not giving an impression of fairness. I have no involvement or interest in the article in which the reverting took place. I have very little experience of Timothy Usher. I have none of you, but I imagine that someone whom SlimVirgin nominated for adminship would be pretty decent and trustworthy. My experience with Sean Black has been very positive. So, what do I see when I jump in? I see the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you too for the message and for organizing this. I don't agree with you defending because I feel that if someone makes arbitrary changes and then reverts to their version is not acceptable. I will discuss your concerns here but I am not interested in spending time on it much more than that.</dd>
<dd>Block was necesary. He would keep reverting otherwise. Just because he does it less than four times a day doesn't mean it can't be blockable. If I was an admin that viewed the entire case and saw that his version was one that completely <b>ignored</b> the discussion on the talk page and was completely arbitrary, I would do the same. He kept reverting even after protection when the whole purpose of it was to cool both sides down. He never took the hint. I didn't even edit the article the day after, because that's what protection is for. And even what he was doing to the article is silly. An article is related to what it's named after. He continued edit warring and for something completely silly. Changing all the names in an article is wrong and is equivalent to vandalism. He definitely knows that is not the way to move an article. His was a completely arbitrary version, an arbitrary move and he has no justification to change all the names while the article is still controversial (being disagreed with on the talk page) and then revert to an <b>arbitrary</b> version that is being disagreed with while discussion is going on. We can't have editors change already controversial articles with a hundred edits all at once and then revert war to keep that version. That is blockable under 3rr. I warned him several times and so did other editors. He needs to respect concensus versions and stop making arbitrary changes. Respecting the talk page discussions more and that you shouldn't make large changes while your version is . He did this again on another article even three days after his block. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 19:30, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since nearly seven hours elapsed between Timothy's last revert (which was <i>not</i> a 3RR violation) and the block, I cannot see that the block was necesssary — to give a cooling-off period.</p>
<p>This seems to have been a content dispute between you and Timothy. I can see that it would be considered disruptive if someone came along and reverted even only three times when his reverts were contrary to the general consensus. But as far as I can see, nobody supported you at the time, and nobody supported him. So I don't think he was trying to force his version any more than you were.</p>
<p>He made one edit and five revets; you made six reverts. (Note that I count consecutive edits by the same editor as one.) So, if he was edit warring, you must have been as well. Yet you weren't blocked. I'm not saying you should have been, just that perhaps he shouldn't have been — or at least that he <i>needn't</i> have been.</p>
<p>You made at least four claims that Timothy violated 3RR; these claims were made at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=51246196&amp;oldid=51243716" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=51246196&amp;oldid=51243716" rel="nofollow">19:36 on 2 May</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Isa&amp;diff=51247552&amp;oldid=51244640" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Isa&amp;diff=51247552&amp;oldid=51244640" rel="nofollow">19:47 on 2 May</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Timothy_Usher&amp;diff=51354714&amp;oldid=51346750" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Timothy_Usher&amp;diff=51354714&amp;oldid=51346750" rel="nofollow">12:13 on 3 May</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Netscott&amp;diff=51355376&amp;oldid=51348280" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Netscott&amp;diff=51355376&amp;oldid=51348280" rel="nofollow">12:19 on 3 May</a>. Contrary to what you said on my talk page, Sean Black did make one claim that Timothy had violated 3RR; the claim was made at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sean_Black&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51464349" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sean_Black&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51464349" rel="nofollow">01:18 on 4 May</a>. Sean did not make that claim in the block log or in the message he sent to tell Timothy he had blocked him.</p>
<p>I don't get the impression that Timothy is looking for blood, but while he is aware that one can be blocked even when staying beneath four reverts, I think he wants, and is entitled to, an acknowledgment from you that he did not make four reverts, and that you were mistaken in claiming that he had. It seems almost certain that the block, nearly seven hours after his last revert, was made as a direct result of your false claim at <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html" title="WP:AN/3RR">WP:AN/3RR</a>. He doesn't want that in the event of a future dispute, it will be said of him, "Oh, he violated 3RR before." Sure, he reverted after the article was unprotected, and yes, it would have been better not to do that; but protection is not an endorsement of the current version, reverting after unprotection is not forbidden by policy, and he was not warned about that.</p>
<p>Since you made that inaccurate accusation of 3RR violation four times, and since Sean said <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sean_Black&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51464349" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sean_Black&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51464349" rel="nofollow">here</a> (after the block):</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I did review the situation fully, or at the very least, to the best of my ability, before making the block. He</i> did <i>violate the three revert rule</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>it's reasonable to suppose that he made the block under the false assumption that a 3RR violation had taken place (even if he just described it as edit warring in the block log), and that Sean <i>might</i> have made a different decision if he had not been under that false assumption.</p>
<p>So far, in response to Timothy's requests for clarification, you seem to have continued to make the 3RR accusation at first, and then to have simply changed the subject and to have said that he was edit warring anyway. (Well, he made five reverts and you made six.) Sean's response was simply <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sean_Black&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51570891" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sean_Black&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51570891" rel="nofollow">Blech</a>, which I find completely out of character for an administrator that I think extremely highly of.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually that was my mistake to say that first, but even still that is blockable under the 3rr. I explain this below. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 19:30, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm sorry to make this such a long post, and I mean no disrespect, but I think this has not been settled satisfactorily, and that Timothy has reason to feel indignant at the way it has been handled. I'm coming to this as an outsider, with know knowledge of the article in question, and no opinion on your edits or his (neither of which I have properly examined), and I feel you may be influenced by your opinion that your version was better. To <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>, we must accept that he sincerely believes his version is better also. Can you take a moment to consider how you'd judge the whole case (false 3RR accusation, more reverts from the opponent than the accused, block nearly seven hours after last revert, no warning given about reverting after unprotection, several requests for clarification, insistence that there was a 3RR violation then changed to "well he was edit warring anyway", and "Blech") if you had had no previous involvement with that article and that editor?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"I feel you may be influenced by your opinion that your version was better". It wasn't <i>my</i> version. The version was the original; they way the article should be in it's original encyclopedia title. Again we must keep the topic in the article the same as the title and not ignore the discussion on the talk page just because you feel the discussion isn't going your way. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 19:34, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The 3RR report page has not been archived yet, and so it is still possible for you to amend your accusation <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html#User:Anonymous_editor" title="WP:AN/3RR">here</a> that he violated 3RR.</p>

<dl>
<dd>As I said before, it was the fact that Timothy made several changes as the article was still being discussed with much disagreement and controversy, He first moved the article, and changed all the names to make a completely arbitrary version that ignored the discussion on the talk page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>After the article was moved back, he continued to change the names even after I pointed out that an article uses the names that are found in the title. That is almost vandalism and violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>He continued reverting until the article was protected by admins, and then continued reverting to his arbitrarily changed version only 6 hours later after it was <i>unprotected</i>. All this time, I continued discussion on the talk page over him arbitrarily changing it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Isa#Stop_reverting_undisputed_changes" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Isa#Stop_reverting_undisputed_changes" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> and also about the disagreement itself. His excuse was that he is too lazy to go back to change all the verse links again. I pointed out that his version was arbitrary and he shouldn't have done that</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The protection should have cooled him off as that's what it's for but apparently he found it necessary to continue reverting again. I didn't revert at all the entire next day because I was hoping he would continue discussion over the next day but the discussion on the naming didn't continue and more reverts were made by him. That was not the point of protection and violates why protection is done. But he never took the hint and reverted again minutes later as it was unprotected</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Btw, Sean did not say 3rr, that was my mistake, it was continuing edit warring right after protection. But as I said <i>even the 3rr policy</i> says that reverting excessively is wrong especially in the case when disagreement was already found on the talk page. He can't change an already controversial article with dozens of changes all at once that are being discussed and disagreed with then expect editors who regularly work on the article to keep the edits. It's timothy's own fault for making arbitrary changes. It's not my job to clean up his mess by going back and individually restoring small links to a template that he made along with his arbitrary edits.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>He's made this a bigger deal then it was, when clearly he was edit warring over a version that was changed arbitrarily and reverts that should have never been made especially after unprotection. He's going to need to respect the consensus that goes with arbitrary changes, and he's done the same thing on other pages too only a couple of days after his block<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muslim&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muslim&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>. Here, he's the <b>only one</b> that agrees with his version, and he continues reverting without respecting consensus. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Muslim#Arabic_.E2.89.A0_.22Islamic.22" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Muslim#Arabic_.E2.89.A0_.22Islamic.22" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>. Like I did on Isa, I mentioned this again as a warning to him <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMuslim&amp;diff=51803539&amp;oldid=51800490" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMuslim&amp;diff=51803539&amp;oldid=51800490" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>. He denies it and reverts again <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMuslim&amp;diff=51803900&amp;oldid=51803813" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMuslim&amp;diff=51803900&amp;oldid=51803813" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>. And I point it out again that arbitrary edits that don't respect the consensus are wrong <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMuslim&amp;diff=51804262&amp;oldid=51803900" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMuslim&amp;diff=51804262&amp;oldid=51803900" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>.</dd>

<dd>He's unfamiliar with several wikipedia policies including how articles are written after what their named and not to revert if their is no consensus for your version and also not to do it minutes after the article is just unprotected. Also moving pages arbitrarily when there is disagreement on the talk page will get him blocked again soon. He can't keep using the fact that 3rr isn't violated to keep reverting. Sean's actions were certainly fair considering that the purpose was to stop him from reverting to a largely changed version less than 4 times everyday. He definitely can't keep playing this game.

<p>Anon, as you well know, several points you've made above are lies. Were it the case that my changes on <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> were supported by no other editor, whereas your version obtained consensus, the article history wouldn't look the way it does. You've also reiterated your claim that Sean Black didn't say 3RR, even after you've been shown the diff on AnnH's talk page. And though you concede that 3RR was your mistake (which Sean made the mistake of believing without checking), you refuse to apologize for the block which, by your own earlier admission (before you realized you'd erred) was based upon it, implicitly admitting that your false 3RR claim was nothing more than a fig leaf for an underlying content dispute. You've no apologies for false statements you make about your fellow editors, nor for the consequences which result from them. Rather, it seems that you're quite proud of them.Timothy Usher 07:27, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Anonymous editor, I believe Timothy is an excellent editor and one of the best wikipedians. He also didn't break the 3RR rule and Sean made a mistake in blocking him. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 07:33, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No he was fine in blocking him.
