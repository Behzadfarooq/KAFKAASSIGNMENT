<dd>Take a look at <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trish_Stratus_f40c.html" title="Trish Stratus">Trish Stratus</a> and this article side-by-side.

<p>The reason I made the Abe Levy article is because in my article about my school, "<a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Heritage_School_%28Texas%29_875f.html" title="Christian Heritage School (Texas)">Christian Heritage</a>" I mention that the 8th grade school teacher, Suzanne Levy, is the mother of Abe Levy. So I made the article so people could know who he is and what he does. I'll try to get some more information about him, and I guess I'll put up an external link to an article he wrote.--<a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWatchHawk_555f.html" title="User:WatchHawk">WatchHawk</a> 15:29, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I assume your are talking about Mike18xx. The <i>Infidel</i> page looks not that bad in relative terms. I didn't spot any obvious 3RR's, but I may have missed them. I see personnal attacks in the edit summaries, but he's hardly the only offender (that's still no excuse, for anyone).</p>
<p><i>Dhimmi</i> looks worse. There may well be some 3RR violations in there, but it's tangled; I can't say for sure by who or where. There is incivility (at least) on the talk page. I think protecting was a good call (likewise <i>Infidel</i>).</p>
<p>I'll watch both pages for a while, but that's about all I can do for now. Feel free to seek help from other more experienced admins. Maybe some kind of informal mediation would be useful.

One the improved image the text was still unreadable and it had been resized to less than one thousand pixels in height.

<dd>I don't know what resolution. The current image was limited to its size because of resolution restrictions which is why I think that that is its limit for size under this particular fair use licence. If you can get permission for your resolution from the newspaper then that can solve the problem easily. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 22:32, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can make a pretty good argument that an image no taller than 1000 pixels can be considered fair use and web resolution since it can be shown on a Monitor screen at whole. A violation of the Fair Use doctrine would occour if the version of the images we had could be used for republishing. Thus if someone came to wikipedia, got the image, and used it for publishing. Here's what I propose: I'll upload the file AGAIN, copy this conversation over to the talk page, while you protect the updated image.

<dd>You are wrong in your belief that permission would affect any image under fair use. Even if the publisher came out and said you are not allowed to use it, (as it's the case with AP images) we still may use them if fair use applies.

<p>Regarding the copyright issue. It is a copyright violation regardless. The Danish newspaper allows a single personal copy for persons (and make explicite that it is not for companies or anything else) <a href="http://www.e-jp.dk/jp_ophavsret.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.e-jp.dk/jp_ophavsret.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. The e-mail says that the cartoonists needs to be approached <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Poulsen#Billeder_.28Parken_og_spillerbilleder.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Poulsen#Billeder_.28Parken_og_spillerbilleder.29" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, and I have not seen any evidence that that has happened . Wikipedia says it also, the question that remains is whether it is fair use (assuming it is at a US based server, as it propably does not apply to countries outside the USA):</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Images and photographs, like written works, are subject to copyright. Someone owns them unless they have been explicitly placed in the public domain. Images on the internet need to be licensed directly from the copyright holder or someone able to license on their behalf. In some cases, fair use guidelines may allow a photograph to be used.</i> (<a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_8c2e.html#Image_guidelines" title="Wikipedia:Copyright">Wikipedia:Copyright#Image_guidelines</a>)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>So, as there is no copyright obtained (see above), the question is whether this constitutes fair use. The copyright disclaimer at the image page says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The image is low resolution and of no larger and of no higher quality than is necessary for the illustration of an article, and the use of the image on Wikipedia is not expected to decrease the value of the copyright, eg, <u><b>there is no risk this image can be taken and republished on another newspaper</b></u>.</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_drawings.png" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_drawings.png" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I loaded the image in some image software, and I could without much loss of quality enlarge the image by 100%. And based on my experiences (although limited), the quality of the images is such that reasonable (although smaller) copies can be made, in full color and at sufficient resolution. That violates the not-republishable clause and in that sense, I would say that it is not fair use of the cartoons. But what would a judge say? Than comes the whole larger context in paly, such as the extreme controversy it invoked, etc. And in that sense, the outcome is completly unpredictable. (And the final question, will this result in court case over copyright issues, not likely because there are so many copies in high quality that go over the internet at locations you can not tough them (Belarus for example), that these cartoons will probably remain there for a VERY long time.)</p>
<p>BTW, other images that have the same characteristics as this image (see the list at the image page), does not imply that other images automatically can be considered "fair use".</p>
<ul>
<li>The two edited versions are explicitly covered by AP ( <a href="../../../t/i/a/Image%7ETianasquare.jpg_9374.html" title="Image:Tianasquare.jpg">link</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/i/Image%7ERaising_of_the_flag_-_colored.jpg_e196.html" title="Image:Raising of the flag - colored.jpg">link</a>)</li>
<li>One manipulated is a private picture ( <a href="../../../s/u/n/Image%7ESunglass-c.jpg_dc0f.html" title="Image:Sunglass-c.jpg">link</a>)</li>
<li>Two sceenshots are from game/movie, and only a fraction of the work, not the whole cartoon, which makes it fair-use ( <a href="../../../f/f/i/Image%7EFFIIIUS_Siren_Censored.png_7ec6.html" title="Image:FFIIIUS Siren Censored.png">link</a> and link)</li>
</ul>
<p>That leaves three newspaper covers, and based on the wikipedia criteria, they might also violations of fair use.</p>
<p>I still think this image is a violation of copyright and fair use, but everything revolves around whether the image is good enough to make reproduce. I think it is good enough, but others diagree apparently.</p>

<p>Hi Anonym, thanks for voting and for your comments in my (successful) RfA. All the voters who voted neutral or oppose had the same criticism – lack of involvement in the Wikipedia namespace. This is nice, because it is a weakness that I can endeavor to fix. Although I don't think I have the disposition or diligence to be actively involved with, say, VfD, I've recently started to participate in the Featured Article discussions and will start participating in some policy discussions now that I am starting to grasp the way the project runs. –<a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJoke137_8677.html" title="User:Joke137">Joke</a> 16:51, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Right now there is some discussion going on regarding the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People_of_the_Book_3f79.html" title="People of the Book">People of the Book</a> article. The "original" article can be found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=People_of_the_Book&amp;oldid=36879859" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=People_of_the_Book&amp;oldid=36879859" rel="nofollow">the 26 January version</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike18xx_f1c0.html" title="User:Mike18xx">User:Mike18xx</a> made some significant changes, most notably reordering one section to first present the point of view that People of the Book are treated badly and then mentioning the positive references to the People only slightly. Then <a href="../../../f/a/r/User%7EFarhansher_7fdc.html" title="User:Farhansher">User:Farhansher</a> and <a href="../../../y/u/b/User%7EYuber_3068.html" title="User:Yuber">User:Yuber</a> reverted back to the <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_26.html" title="January 26">January 26</a> version while <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike18xx_f1c0.html" title="User:Mike18xx">User:Mike18xx</a> kept reverting back to his.

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I nominated the article for deletion because I thought that it would not be a significant event after it was no longer headline news. As I reread the article, I realize that nominating it was a mistake on my part- please accept my apologies.</p>
<p>However, I wasn't aware of any rule making main page articles immune to deletion...in fact <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> explicitly states that Wikipedia should not have articles for news stories not worthy of standing on their own.</p>
<p>I don't agree that it being on the main page should be considered a reason to prevent it from being deleted, but either way, nominating it was a mistake on my part. Sorry for that, -<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrazzydee_a9f9.html" title="User:Frazzydee">Frazzydee</a>|<a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFrazzydee_457f.html" title="User talk:Frazzydee">✍</a> 00:31, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I reverted back to my version for three reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Qiyamah is <b>not</b> a future event. It is a 50,000 year period and many have claimed it began a long time ago. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has repeatedly stated, though I need to find the diffs before I add this to the article, that he believes Imam Mahdi is about to return and that the end of the world is coming.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2. The anonymous user who first reverted me is a persistent vandal. A range block on the IP would be nice.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>3. Both of the above points are actually moot because all Wikipedia articles are written in the present tense, unless specifically referencing past or future events. <a href="../../../k/i/_/User%7EKI_05a2.html" title="User:KI">KI</a> 02:43, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>From <a href="../../../q/i/y/Qiyamah.html" title="Qiyamah">Qiyamah</a>: "The Qu'ran mentions the <b>duration of the day of judgement as 50,000 years</b> (Qur'an 70.4) and that some signs of its forthcoming have already begun (Qur'an 42.17, 47.18, 70.6-7). People beseech the prophets to intercede on their behalf, first <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham.html" title="Abraham">Abraham</a>, then <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses.html" title="Moses">Moses</a>, then <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_and_Eve_6ed9.html" title="Adam and Eve">Adam</a>, and finally <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah.html" title="Noah">Noah</a>, all of whom decline to do so and instead point to the prophet <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>, who intercedes on behalf of the world (Qur'an 74.48; <i>Sahih Bukhari</i>, book 55 "accounts of the prophets", number 555, 569)."</dd>
</dl>
<p>The point is not that it has already happened, it's that it's <i>happening</i>. Remember that the chronology of Qiyamah is anybody's guess. <a href="../../../k/i/_/User%7EKI_05a2.html" title="User:KI">KI</a> 17:43, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not understand what are you saying... do you mean the coming of Imam Mahdi? Or are you distinguishing between al Qiyamah and Yaum al Qiyamah? Please clarify. I am relying on the text already present in the article, though I once again draw atention to the point that whether or not Qiyamah is a future event, what takes place within Qiyamah is supposed to be in the present tense. <a href="../../../k/i/_/User%7EKI_05a2.html" title="User:KI">KI</a> 17:57, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am not a Muslim and far from an expert on the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a>, but by <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maulana_Muhammad_Ali_bfd7.html" title="Maulana Muhammad Ali">Maulana Muhammad Ali</a>'s interpretation of this ayat, I thought the the entire 'day' is 50,000 years long: "The angels and the Spirit are spoken of here as ascending to God in a day of fifty thousand years. Al-Ruh or the Spirit very often stands for Divine revelation or Gabriel, who brings the revelation to the Prophet. But here it seems to be a collective name for the spirits of the faithful, because it is through the Divine revelation that a new spirit is awakened in the faithful; see 78:38a. The angels are mentioned along with the faithful because it is through an angel that spiritual life is breathed into man, and he starts life as a spiritual wayfarer. A day of the spiritual advancement of man is spoken of as being equal to fifty thousand years to show immense vastness of that advancement. Or, the day of fifty thousand years may be the day of final triumph of Truth in the world, from the time when revelation was first granted to man." <a href="../../../k/i/_/User%7EKI_05a2.html" title="User:KI">KI</a> 18:12, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Anonymous editor,</p>
<p>My main reason for adding to the Quran article was to mention that:</p>
<p>"From a mathematical point of view, Rashad’s argument may be true but is incomplete. Critics usually point out that it may be possible to find such structure in any random book. Thus to strengthen the argument one must first define a rigorous mathematical definition of numerical structure and then show that based on that particular criterion, Quran’s score is much more than any random book’s score."</p>
<p>I think this is what many Muslims are unaware. I just wanted to let Muslims know that this is an open research problem for them. It is a really hard problem and can be a PhD thesis for a computer scientist. Is there any place I can add this point?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Good Idea! Thanks. I'll do it soon.</dd>

<p>Hi again Esperanzians! Well, since our last frolic in the realms of news, the Advisory Council has met twice more (see <b><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_ACM2_d652.html" title="WP:ESP/ACM2">WP:ESP/ACM2</a></b> and <b><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_ACM3_e83b.html" title="WP:ESP/ACM3">WP:ESP/ACM3</a></b>). As a result, <b><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_CHA_cf77.html" title="WP:ESP/CHA">the charter</a> has been ammended</b> twice (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AEsperanza%2FCharter&amp;diff=39263854&amp;oldid=33097525" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AEsperanza%2FCharter&amp;diff=39263854&amp;oldid=33097525" rel="nofollow">here</a> for details) and all of the shortcuts have been standardised (see the <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_ACM2_d652.html" title="WP:ESP/ACM2">summary</a> for more details). Also of note is the <b>Valentines ball</b> that will take place in <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/wikipedia-esperanza" class="external text" title="irc://irc.freenode.net/wikipedia-esperanza" rel="nofollow">the Esperanza IRC channel</a> on the 14th of February (tomorrow). It will start at 6pm UTC and go on until everyone's had enough! I hope to see you all there! Also, <b>the spamlist has been dissolved</b> - all Esperanzians will now recieve this update "newsletter".</p>
<p>The other major notice I need to tell you about is the upcoming <b>Esperanza Advisory Council Elections</b>. These will take place from <b>12:00 UTC on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_20.html" title="February 20">February 20th</a> to 11:59 UTC on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_27.html" title="February 27">February 27th</a></b>. The official handing-over will take place the following day. Candidates are able to volunteer any time before the 20th, so long as they are <b>already listed on <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_M_38a8.html" title="WP:ESP/M">the members list</a></b>. Anyone currently listed on the memberlist can vote. In a change since last time, <i>if you have already been a member of the leadership, you may run again</i>. Due to the neutrality precident, I will not vote for anyone.</p>

<dd>Thank you very much for the feedback. I will try to shorten the article as much as possible. By the way, I think the article on "Quran" lacks Semantical Analysis. Toshihiko Izutsu has a nice book on this topic: "God and Man in the Quran". It shows how creative Quran is in the sense of giving new meanings to the words used by Arabs before Muhammad. Unfortunately I am not knowledgeable enough to be able to write a summary of the work of Izutsu. Again, Thanks for the feedback. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 02:51, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I'll explain. Striver disappeared for a while, then returned and started editing a number of minor articles, or articles he had started and which had been tacitly "ceded" to him (as in, they're not needed, but an AfD would be too much trouble). He stayed away from articles with lots of editors. Within the last few days, he started editing the high-profile Islam-related articles again. In my opinion, his edits are usually detrimental rather than helpful, and I deleted a lot of them. I was very insistent on removing his edits to <a href="../../../m/u/a/Muawiyah_I_c2c7.html" title="Muawiyah I">Muawiyah I</a>; he was intent on adding every accusation that Shi'a Muslims had ever made against Muawiyah. I felt that -- and still do feel that -- it is unencyclopedic to use WP articles to pursue a sectarian agenda against certain historic figures, and unfair to give the Shi'a view so much more prominence than the Sunni view. He blew up and cursed me out on several articles and announced that he was leaving.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I feel upset by all of this, and wish that I hadn't been as curt as I was in some of my edit summaries and talk page comments. However, I can't regret my edits. As you know, I feel strongly that we should be FAIR to the Shi'a, and that means giving their POV even though it's a minority POV. However, I don't think that means giving them special treatment, or giving them carte blanche to add as much material as they please. Or perhaps I shouldn't say "they", as it's not at all clear that the Shi'a editors here represent all Shi'a. I would rather believe that Reza Aslan represents the best of the Shi'a POV. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 23:25, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_in_Denmark_67e3.html" title="Islam in Denmark">Islam in Denmark</a> article, I found three sources indicating that the Qur'an is required reading in upper-secondary schools in Denmark. Two of them were by authors who have a history of writing against Islam, while the other was a newspaper article. The newspaper article seems not to be working at the moment, but I provided a cached version on the talk page. Does the authors background invalidate it from being reliable, especially if it was published in atleast 2 journals. Perhaps you can weigh in. Furthermore, can non-English sources be used to verify something? <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPepsidrinka_5aab.html" title="User:Pepsidrinka">Pepsidrinka</a> 22:09, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thus far, I have found 3 citations, 1 by Robert Spencer, a second one by someone who I infer to have a bad reputation when it comes to being balanced on Islam, and a newspaper article. The newspaper site is done, so all I have is a cache. The thing is, most of the sources are in Danish, or atleast non-English. One thing I don't understand is how saying something like this furthers Spencer's agenda. Nevertheless, I can't seem to find anything sufficient (besides my now defunct news source). I guess I'll keep looking. <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPepsidrinka_5aab.html" title="User:Pepsidrinka">Pepsidrinka</a> 22:39, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't wanna start another revert war with you but that doesn't mean that I don't wanna try improving the article and remove that factual accuracy tag. By reverting my edit you added stuff to the article which is not backed by sources. C'mon you are an admin now.. What about the Wiki policy of citing sources. There is so much of crap in the article which is not backed by sources. And for once, instead of reverting my edits and adding POV tags, make some <i>other valuable</i> contributions to the article --<a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeepak_gupta_071e.html" title="User:Deepak gupta">Deepak</a>|<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeepak_gupta_f27b.html" title="User talk:Deepak gupta">वार्ता</a> 15:25, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And if you feel that my edit gives only one sided view.. then go ahead and the other side's view. Why can't you ever make an effort to improve the article and keep arguing all the time.. so unproductive.

<dd>Hello Deepak, my point isn't to edit war. What you did by changing that info is making it so most of the paragraphs have India says this and India says that without the other side. I agree the article is in pathetic shape but almost all the edit you did were one sided and at the end the only other POV that was given you said "India however rebuffs these allegations as an attempt to create a false anti-India propaganda." That does not seem biased to you? Having four paragraphs on how India accuses these groups and Pakistan and then the numbers of "terrorist camps", but only one sentence on India's responsibility and then claiming that sentence as unikely. We are not here to cover up anything, so the best thing for you to do is to make the information shorter and not repeated. Try doing small edits to each section. Also sources is not the problem here, sources can be found but it should be clearly said whose sources. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 17:21, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>AE, fact will remain a fact. You very well know whats going on in Kashmir but you are trying to hide the truth. Those who play foul will face doom one day or the other. History proves it. The Nazis, the fascists, taliban, Saddam regime all did face doom. My family has suffered a lot in the past. First they had to leave Jammu due to anti-Hindu violence and then Kuwait due to the <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_war.html" title="Gulf war">Gulf war</a>. Well, Saddam did meet his doom and I'm sure those responsible for the violence in Kashmir will meet their doom too. Anyways. I've made up my mind to leave Wikipedia. So this is probably my last edit to Wikipedia. Thanks and happy reverting --Deepak 03:56, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course I can say the same thing Deepak. That you are trying to hide it. I didn't say that the separatist militants are innocent, but it's very hypocritical to call the Indian forces innocent too. over 100 000 people have been killed, not only hindus and Indian military human rights violations are recorded. I suggest you look at the numbers, clearly Muslim Kashmiris, Buddhists and others have suffered too. In fact more Muslims have been killed than hindus and many have also been driven from their homes. I know Muslim kashmiris who left Kashmir because of the Indian military here in Canada, so the doom will probably come on the military too. However I am not taking sides on the article at all as you saw with my edits&#160;; I am just trying to say that even if it is hard that we should at least mention the violations by the military. So I'm sad to see that you have decided to leave but I understand since many have already left. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor">&lt;font color="green"&gt;<b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 00:17, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Then why restricting to <b>Saudi Arabia</b>. A medina is just any city in Arabic. Is it wikipedians who decide conclusions. Shall we not put raw info and let the time unravel a prophecy. Where Mahdi shows such place would be medina. A hustling bustling city of his time. Be it LA, London, Medina, Mecca, or Riyadh.</dd>

<dd>Technically:
<dl>
<dd>Prophet migrated to Yathrib. Till late of times it wasn't the Medina as one calls today. Nor prophets prophesize clear facts. No scholar of any stature may solve it, rather the prophecy unwinds itselfs. Take the Quranic notion of Biblical Ahmed which turns out to be Islamic Mohammed. Then so many others as such, they find, prophesizing Islam's Prophet.</dd>

I was fairly stressed yesterday as well (external factors not because of Wiki). Thanks for telling me that it was not acceptable.

<p>I appreciate your well done assistance on thet Islamic view of forgiveness. Considering how important the concept is to many religions and philosophies the topic has had very little input, however, I am not suprised. I hope to help turn it into a good resource over time. I may pick your brain down the road. I am rather new to this, but am starting to catch the bug. I would welcom any suggestions. Thanks again. --<a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERSpeeter_fe4a.html" title="User:RSpeeter">speet</a> 23:15, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I could use a bit of help with a dilemma I have. I have been researching forgiveness for about 5 years, hence my interest in working on that article. A confusing thread seems to keep cropping up due to the ambiguous concept of condoning. I am striving to keep a NPOV on this. This may seem like a trivial matter, but if you bear with me a minute I see it as a real problem for many people struggling with forgiveness. (For example see the discussion in the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forgiveness.html" title="Forgiveness">forgiveness</a> article). In my view the concepts of forgiveness and condoning are separate and distinct. Dictionaries however often cite forgive as a synonym of condone. On the other hand, condone is rarely if ever cited as a synonym of forgive. The reason I believe is apparent from the history of the word condone, which had a legal meaning of forgiveness, especially in old “fault” divorce cases. The word now for most, in my experiance, means some half-hearted affirmative approval. That leaves some people struggling with forgiveness because they bump into the mistaken belief that they cannot forgive something because that means they have to condone or approve of the action.</p>
<p>Every recent article I have seen flatly agrees forgiveness is not condoning. But we have dictionaries that say condoning is forgiveness, because of arcane legal definitions. However I have no cite for my conclusion as to how this occurred. I don’t really want to muddle up the forgiveness page on this, so I thought the approach may be to do a page for the word condone. However, it has been flagged for the dictionary, and I must admit it does seem like such a definition unless I fully spell out the competing theories. Perhaps it should be a disambiguation page? But as I am relatively new to this I don’t have the proper “feel” for how to handle this. I think my theory is correct, and certainly as well founded as some of the information I have seen on Wikapedia</p>
<p>On another note, I see a unique potential opportunity for this page as bringing input from all walks of life together on a uniting value. Any thoughts on a more effective way of soliciting input from the various religious pages? Again thanks for your addition. --<a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERSpeeter_fe4a.html" title="User:RSpeeter">speet</a> 17:08, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for any help you can give on condone. On the religious pages, it is amazing that what is a central concept is essentially ignored by all. So much for content, I guess it is more fun to argue about form. --<a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERSpeeter_fe4a.html" title="User:RSpeeter">speet</a> 17:36, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Anon.. Yes, I decided not to leave Wikipedia. However, I will remain inactive till May or so. All I hope is that everything between us is cool. Regarding the sockpuppet issue, I think I would have responded in a similar manner the way you did. There were many factors backing yr claim too: the user started making edits soon after I decided to leave and reverted Terrorism in Kashmir to my version. But at the same time, I would have taken up the issue to <a href="../../../r/c/u/WP%7ERCU_f1af.html" title="WP:RCU">WP:RCU</a> before making accusations. I think you shouldn't have accused me of creating a sockpuppet account without any concrete evidences. But I understand the way you responded because in the past many Wikipedians have used sockpuppet accounts to defame you. Anyways.. I wouldn't be bothering you anymore. When I return I will concentrate mostly on Science, Space Exploration and Engineering- related articles as there is much less arguing there (now please don't come running behind me there too&#160;:P). I wish you good luck in life --Deepak 01:09, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Welcome back and yes, it's cool. I guess I'm also glad that you know that there are some socks that had been used before. Although I didn't agree with your actions after the accusation about trying to get several different editors interjecting, I think we will both be fine as long as you don't start messing up those science articles&#160;:p.

<p>Hi Anonymous Editor,</p>
<p>I need another suggestion yet. On <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=People_claiming_to_be_the_Mahdi&amp;oldid=30825426" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=People_claiming_to_be_the_Mahdi&amp;oldid=30825426" rel="nofollow">10th December 2005</a> you had needfully created the page <a href="../../../p/e/o/People_claiming_to_be_the_Mahdi_8143.html" title="People claiming to be the Mahdi">People claiming to be the Mahdi</a> moving the contents from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mahdi&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=30825296#Claims_of_being_the_Mahdi" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mahdi&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=30825296#Claims_of_being_the_Mahdi" rel="nofollow">the page Mahdi as it was then</a>.</p>
<p>Probably, you were the one to add an introductory text at the place <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahdi#Claims_of_being_the_Mahdi" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahdi#Claims_of_being_the_Mahdi" rel="nofollow">where the original section</a> used to be, necessary as a summary for any curious visitor.</p>
<p>Another piece of text as a leadline is also found on the People claiming to be the Mahdi new page.</p>
<p>Acknowledge how would it be if the word 'mainstream' in that piece of text is replced by 'majority of'??</p>
<p>Once a mainstream nation of homosapiens deemed Abraham false, the next mainstream rendered Moses a rebel. Then comes other mainstreams crucifying yet another icon of a phrophet. While the current mainstream trend never finds prophethood in Islam's prophet.</p>
<p>Wont 'majority' fit? Mainstream hurts, wont some feel? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/z/g/User%7EAzgs_1c40.html" title="User:Azgs">Azgs</a> (<a href="../../../a/z/g/User_talk%7EAzgs_d1aa.html" title="User talk:Azgs">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Azgs_c6f4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Azgs">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi Azgs the problem is that those people who consider people aside from Imam Mahdi to be the Mahdi usually don't belong to the main Shi'a and Sunni sects, and belong to other sects. I don't understand what you mean by "While the current mainstream trend never finds prophethood in Islam's prophet."</dd>
<dd>But since the majority is the mainstream then maybe that word can be changed. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 15:58, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi again! Thanks for lending an ear.</dd>
<dd>This may not be a good place for passing detailed arguments, opinions. Nor do we talk religion. Just the clarification &amp; a hint.</dd>
<dd>Believers in Islam's prophet argue that it was prophecized by earlier streams, then the mainstreams, semetic religions. A person claims to the same, and a group departs from the mainstream. The majority holds he is false, even today. He neither belongs to the Jews nor the Christians, the same who wait for him.</dd>
<dd>The day he appears how are they going to know him. (Have the conditions in the prophecies shown?!!)</dd>
<dd>Hence the word 'majority' seems to show neutrality of groups quality-wise. 'Mainstream' induces one to be wrong.</dd>
<dd>Should we judge?? Already? <a href="../../../a/z/g/User%7EAzgs_1c40.html" title="User:Azgs">Azgs</a> 02:14, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've just posted a message on <a href="../../../b/h/a/User_talk%7EBhadani_d9c4.html#Mediation" title="User talk:Bhadani">Bhadani's talk page</a>. I've explained him your stance as to why you think he was canvassing for votes. I personally don't believe he was canvassing for votes, (reasons being manifold), but I believe that it was a case of bad timing. However, I may like to add that the tone of your replies has much to be desired of and people often misunderstand you. I've noticed this from many of your posts including your own RFAs. I suggest that before you post something, please read it aloud. This would help avoid a perceived accusatory or agressive tone and clear potential misunderstandings.

He has been here long enough to have known in the end of October to know how to talk to people and not act uncivil as he did. I don't think that he has improved in the last 4 months if he couldn't do it in the 12 months time when he was here and other evidence from users also says that he didn't.

All of the sudden I receive warnings in the Arabic Wikipedia so I removed my account from there altogether. Now I receive them here in English Wikipedia. Apparently someone didn't like me showing their mistakes. In any case, in the talk page of these articles there are a few comments, but in my talk page I receive personal attacks (the second comment by Classic 971).

<p>Hi Anonymous, my name is Jared and I'm having a little problem. Another user and I recently put up three users for a possible sockpuppetry claim (<a href="../../../c/h/e/WP%7ECHECK_3f44.html#User:Medalstats_is_User:Them_medals_is_User:Wintermetal" title="WP:CHECK">see here</a>) because of overwhelming evidence that states so (and its taking a long time to get this over with; only one user has posted a comment). My problem is that <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermetal_4d6e.html" title="User:Wintermetal">User:Wintermetal</a> keeps taking the sockpuppery template off of his home and discussion pages, stating in his edit summary that I should "ruin my own home page". He has done this every time I revert it back, and I warn him of a potential block every time, but he doesn't care (and I'm not an admin). Could you please help me....maybe block him or something...let him know he is not supposed to take the notice off of his page (which incidentally makes him more suspicious of sockpuppetry!) Thanks a lot! (P.S. I contacted another user about this, too, but she hasn't responded as of yet, and it is sort of important.) --<a href="../../../j/p/0/User%7EJP06035_fdfe.html" title="User:JP06035"><font color="blue">Jared</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../j/p/0/User_talk%7EJP06035_4c31.html" title="User talk:JP06035"><font color="green">[T]</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:JP06035&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:JP06035&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow"><font color="#DC260C">[+]</font></a></sub> 21:25, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Salam - would you have time to take a look at the introduction of this article? I feel it is quiet uninformed as it stands now. There seem to be editors who are applying their own personal opinion of what it means, from what I can tell. In Arabic, kafir is simply one who willfully acts in a manner 'unappreciative of' or 'rejecting of' God and the teaching of his prophets, but even Arabic and Islamic sources describe controversy associated with defining this word.

<dd>Well I think you are clearly doing it in bad faith especially when it happened a month ago and Deepak and I already settled this. Bhadani you are just disrupting wikipedia more. Once again, the sockpuppet doesn't have to be Deepak, but it could be someone Deepak knows even some editors who have used socks abusively before. As far as I can see you have no objective here but bad faith and disrupting Wikipedia more. Clearly all your talk about "for the better of wikipedia" does not apply to your actions.

<dd>It is a community and not a private delibearations – we are here to keep the trsut of the donors of Wikimedia Foundation, and acordingly we have to keep the standard high, and refer the serious issues to the proper forum, which I have done as a wikipedian. Why are you taking this as a personal issue? I was just trying to help you out of a difficult position. BTW, I am not going to be de-motivated inspite harsh words used against me, now as also earlier. I know that I owe a debt to those who donate to keep the wikipedia runing, and I believe that <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> loves volunteers like me who continue to work here to build the sum total of human knowledge, in spite of gravest personal attacks and threats. I also wish you a happy weekend. Now, as I have to continue building the encyclopedia, I shall not be able to clear all your doubts immediately.

<dd>Please Bhadani don't kid yourself since you have shown what you really want now and made this personal. You have also shown that you will exaggerate anything even as old as this to use against a fellow editor when you can't settle a simple dispute on something completely unrelated. This is <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_faith.html" title="Bad faith">bad faith</a> and surely you know that too? All you are doing is making this situation worse as I said it would. A sockcheck does not have to be conclusive and the evidence is still there so in either case, you won't be able to get a final conclusion on if it was right or wrong. I just hope for the better of Deepak that it does come in false. The standard should be made high and that means not having sockpuppets running around.</dd>

<dd>And no we are not being paid by the wikipedia foundation and we are not slaves here either. We are here to make this encyclopedia better voluntarily and that's it. Not to impress donors or whatever. I am a donor btw, and a volunteer too. But I don't understand how disrupting wikipedia a month after a dispute has already been solved is going to help anything or, as you say, make Jimbo love you. I think I should remind you that you were here only to interject in the issue, but you have made the issue far larger than even the editor who was accused who I already have a friendship with again. I wish you a happy weekend too and hope that you understand how hypocritical and disruptive your actions are when you come back.

<p>Should the guild go? I am the only one finding it usefull? I am a burden to wikipedia?</p>

<p><br />
I could consider it if it was suggested in the maner you did, in a polite and civilized way, but i get hostile when i see the accusations they throw at me there.</p>
<p>To the topic: Dont you think the guilds servers the purpose of giving a overview of Shi'a specific articles? I fear that effect would be lost if it where merged to the Muslim guild. On the other hand, it would be refreshing to get rid of "Shi'a are not Muslims".... Maybe if we categorized it in a maner where Shi'a and Sunni specific articles where on different categories?</p>
<p>Basicly, i dont feel to warm about the idea right now, but im open to talking about it. However, right now in this second, i wont vote for that, i feel that would be giving in to the stalking and bad faith nominations, these guys are stalking me all the way to the Islamic topics, brandning <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahih_Bukhari_0b24.html" title="Sahih Bukhari">Sahih Bukhari</a> as a "questinable source" as a afd nomination arguement. They have no idea about anything related to Islam. I feel very defensive about anything they are haunting me in. I mean, look at this <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betty_Kelen_27e2.html" title="Betty Kelen">Betty Kelen</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/Muhammad%7E_The_Messenger_of_God_%28book%29_6b02.html" title="Muhammad: The Messenger of God (book)">Muhammad: The Messenger of God (book)</a>, the guy didnt even bother to chek if the books and writer was notable, he just followed my user contribution and afd'd it for the sole reason that i created it. See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Qur%E2%80%99an_and_the_Bible_in_the_Light_of_Science_308f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Qur’an and the Bible in the Light of Science">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Qur’an and the Bible in the Light of Science</a>.
