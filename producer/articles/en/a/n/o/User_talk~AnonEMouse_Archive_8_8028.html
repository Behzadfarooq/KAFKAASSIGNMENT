<h2><span class="mw-headline">Re: Adminship?</span></h2>
<p>AnonEMouse, I'm honored that you would think of it, but right now I have to decline--too much going on in RL to devote the time/energy to an RfA. Honestly, I'm not sure I would pass right now--I'd like to have more substantial mainspace edits, for one thing. Also, if you go back a little farther in my edit history, I've been involved in some contentious situations, and while I don't think my behavior has been awful, I haven't been as level-headed as I should have been. (I'm thinking particularly of stuff in the September and October 2006 archives of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Talk%7EAlexander_the_Great_2250.html" title="Talk:Alexander the Great">Talk:Alexander the Great</a>, if you're curious about the gory details.) Probably best to let some time pass. At some point I probably will pursue an RfA, though--if nothing else, I'd like to be able to help out more effectively at WP:SSP. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 00:59, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe it's redundant to say so, but thanks for the thanks on WP:AN.

<p>Several issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>I did not create User:YouNeedASmackBot. This user came into a discussion in December and attacked several other editors at the same time as VacuousPoet. I'm not sure why you thought I created him.</li>
<li>I am vehemently opposed to your allowing VP back into the good graces of Wikipedia. He was permanently banned, and, frankly, there are so many more polite editors who may not agree with me, why is it necessary to bring this person back. And as the editor who filed the original Sockpuppet charge, and had to deal with the revenge charges against me, why do I not have an opinion in this matter? The various Evolution and Creation articles have less intrusive editing and discussion ever since he and a couple of other users were permanently banned.</li>
<li>Finally, why have a permanent ban, if you don't really mean it. I don't get it.</li>

<dd>VP was blocked for being a sock puppet of <a href="../../../k/d/b/User%7EKdbuffalo_898d.html" title="User:Kdbuffalo">User:Kdbuffalo</a>, which I am not convinced he is. They seem to have a different style, edit from different networks, and from the contributions I read, VP does seem to make arguments rather than vandalize. That implies strongly that there may be a constructive user there if we can be civil to him rather than continue to block him on reflexive and questionable grounds. Also, you may notice that the current strategy, of blocking IP addresses as they are used, isn't tremendously effective. VP seems to have no difficulty picking another IP address as the previous ones are blocked. You write "The various Evolution and Creation articles have less intrusive editing and discussion ever since he and a couple of other users were permanently banned." but that's clearly not true, as you can see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_199.62.0.252_060a.html" title="Special:Contributions/199.62.0.252">Special:Contributions/199.62.0.252</a> edited Talk:Evolution <s>just today</s>.

<dd>This sounds like one of those legal arguments where some technical point is the reason to find the accused innocent. I have no clue if he is a Sockpuppet of Kdbuffalo or not, because that never was my accusation. I would assume you could check IP addresses, but I'm wondering if that assumption is incorrect. He was blocked for deleting talk pages en masse. He got around that block, blatantly and without remorse, by creating what I called Sockpuppets. He didn't even bother to pretend. I believe that is the reason he deserves a permanent block--he willfully violated Wikipedia rules in fact and in law. You're right, there will continue to be editors who use the <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">Evolution</a> article as a soapbox to push a Christian agenda on the rest of us. However, let's not add an editor who has show that's what he will do. I cannot, under any circumstance, agree to your compromise. I may not have any rights here, but I will file this <i>amicus curiae</i> commentary with you. <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemarlin_8532.html" title="User:Orangemarlin">Orangemarlin</a> 18:14, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

Nothing there or in his <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_VacuousPoet_ccc4.html" title="Special:Contributions/VacuousPoet">Special:Contributions/VacuousPoet</a> about deleting talk pages en masse - his contributions are merely reasoned argument, fervent, but not really more so than those he is arguing against.

I, and most admins, can not check IP addresses, that is limited to a small group of accounts with <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/CheckUser_policy" class="extiw" title="m:CheckUser_policy">m:CheckUser policy</a> rights. However, the Kdbuffalo account was accused of editing from the <a href="../../../s/u/n/SUNY_Buffalo_a831.html" title="SUNY Buffalo">SUNY Buffalo</a> campus network, while the VacuousPoet IPs use FrontierNet and NJ networks.

The DNS entry points to Frontier Communications, Rochester, NY, same as all other VP Sockpuppets. The User signs his posts "VacuousPoet", so it's not like he's really hiding things. The Sockpuppets are what were problematic and caused me to file the charge against him. As for my comments...yeah, I was appropriately reprimanded, and I've changed my demeanor. This sockpuppet would be irritating under any condition. Although I am not even going down the path of equating VP with kdbuffalo, but you do realize Rochester and Buffalo are closer than say Los Angeles, CA and Buffalo? Say about 2000 miles closer. Nevetheless, the problem with VacuousPoet was not the main account, it was the 10-20 sockpuppets of his that did everything from avoiding the ban to filing false charges of sockpuppetry against me and N6.

<dd>I didn't say you used the word "honorable", I used it to mean that he can be trusted. Whether the deletions were warranted (and I'd dispute that), he had no right to delete them. But we really digress. He tried to evade and, in fact, did evade bans. Not once, but several times. And he kind of laughed about it.

<p>My experiences with Vacuous Poet were overwhelmingly negative. He seemed to view WP as an arena to engage in baiting and fights. If he is allowed back in, it would have to be with the strictest understanding that any return to his previous disruptive behaviors would have serious negative consequences. I think that even if banned users can find new IPs to come in on, we inconvenience them by making them use different IPs.

<dd>It's a stunning piece of work. Very well done. Some nitpicks:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>As long as you have the decades as one section and the years as another, make the years subsections of the decades (more ='s signs!).</li>
<li>In line citation style - <a href="../../../f/o/o/Wikipedia%7EFootnotes_5088.html" title="Wikipedia:Footnotes">Wikipedia:Footnotes</a>: the &lt;ref&gt; should be directly after a punctuation mark, without a space, and not have a period following the &lt;/ref&gt;.</li>
<li>Ref [20] is in parentheses for some reason.</li>
<li>Per <a href="../../../d/a/t/WP%7EDATE_3c44.html" title="WP:DATE">WP:DATE</a>, wiki-link the citation dates so user preferences can work. If you plan to make this a <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_article_3e1a.html" title="Wikipedia:Good article">Wikipedia:Good article</a> (not unlikely), add Retrieved-dates to citations. You may want to use the {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_web_57d4.html" title="Template:Cite web">cite web</a>}} {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_book_c666.html" title="Template:Cite book">cite book</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_news_5e9e.html" title="Template:Cite news">cite news</a>}} templates as appropriate, at least to see what fields are recommended.</li>
<li>I'd link the first mention of an actress's name in the paragraph, not wait for the list. In fact, I wouldn't even provide a separate list except for "other actresses" that aren't mentioned in the paragraph, and/or didn't have their own article. The repetition is redundant, and it's a long article already.</li>
<li>Leave out the empty debut lists and sections until they have something to put in them.</li>
<li>What was "weekly show Tokyo Rock TV"? A TV show on a public network? On what subject? A talk show, a news magazine?</li>
<li>"was an innovative" - innovator?</li>
<li>Several sentences need rewriting to be more text like, and less listy. "Kuroki Kaori (Debut: 1986) followed him" -&gt; "Kuroki Kaori, who debuted in 1986, followed him..". Others include "1988 debut, Murakami Keiko would star in the Apartment Wife film," the next one after that, there are probably more.</li>
<li>Some sections seem to allow for expansion, for example 2001 and 2002 seem to have lots of actresses but relatively little text, 1998 has no text.</li>
<li>"Principal sources", not principle</li>
</ul>

<dd>Many thanks for taking time out to look at this, AnonEMouse, and thanks for the compliment. You've given me lots of good suggestions to work on, some of which will take a little while to put in place. Some I might quibble with-- As you know, the article started as a list, and I do see that some listy aspects remain. I'll work on taking them out of the text. Still, I do like the yearly debut lists after the yearly summaries, since it highlights the name outside of a paragraph of text. But if others raise objections, those can go. The textless years, naturally, are the ones I haven't been able to find text on yet. This will eventually be remedied.

<dd>Heh. In a way, you've got an easier task with <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_Cochran_29b0.html" title="June Cochran">June Cochran</a> since that image clearly shows her resemblance to <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Annie_Fanny_8525.html" title="Little Annie Fanny">Little Annie Fanny</a>, so irreplaceably illustrates an important part of her article. That makes the image itself "critical commentary" per <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAIR_1f27.html#Images" title="WP:FAIR">WP:FAIR#Images</a>. In fact, I would add a picture of Little Annie Fanny for comparison.&#160;:-) But you probably want to cite the statement that she was the model. Similarly if you can cite someone saying that was Sue Williams' most famous pose, and say as much in the article, that should be fair use.</dd>
<dd>For the others, it might be tougher. <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAIR_1f27.html#Counterexamples" title="WP:FAIR">WP:FAIR#Counterexamples</a> says "# An image of a magazine cover, used only to illustrate the article on the person whose photograph is on the cover. However, if that magazine issue itself is notable enough to be a topic within the article, then fair use may apply." I would think that means that Playboy covers featuring them would be fair use with a bit of discussion. It doesn't take a lot of discussion, most <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">Wikipedia:Featured articles</a> about actors have a 3-sentence paragraph about a movie accopmanying a still or poster from that movie. Similarly, if you can be sure an image is from the Playmate photo session, that would probably be fair use, given as that is what the person is mainly famous for.</dd>

<dd>If you could make changes responsive to the comments I made just before the FAC was closed (at <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Jenna_Jameson_3e57.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Jenna Jameson">Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Jenna_Jameson</a>), I'd appreciate it. I'm not saying make it less comprehensive, but I think there are plenty of unnecessary details that could be cut. IMO WT's complaint that <i>It is very poorly written, presenting quotes as if they are fact rather than summarising in the voice of the encyclopaedia. Her words express her own point of view, of course, and the author of this article adopts that point of view without question.</i> refers to the nearly exclusive use of interviews and her autobiography as sources rather than actual secondary sources. What the article basically says is "Jenna Jameson has said ...". She's had a lot to say in lots of interviews, reported in lots of places, so it looks like numerous sources, but they all basically amount to her words. If someone else had written a biography about her or even a book about porn stars that could be referenced, this would be an actual secondary source (not "her words"). I hope you don't take this as overly critical. I'm concerned about WT's state of mind. I'm concerned about yours as well (all editors are important to me). It's been long enough now that it's pretty clear Raul654 is not going to change his mind and "defeature" it pending further improvements. I'm fine with this (really), but I do hope you make an effort to respond to my suggestions. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 03:05, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With all due respect, Wt's complaint is basically wrong. I could only find one example of a quote that could be read as if it were presented as fact; I changed it, and <a href="../../../w/o/r/User_talk%7EWorldtraveller_a971.html#Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates.2FJenna_Jameson" title="User talk:Worldtraveller">asked him for others</a> - he never provided any, and it has been a week. (Feel free to find some yourself, by the way.) If you read my opening to the FAC, you will notice that most of the article was written from articles, not using her autobiography at all, specifically to forestall such an objection. (See <a href="../../../j/e/n/Talk%7EJenna_Jameson_Archive_2_c545.html#Jenna.27s_autobiography" title="Talk:Jenna Jameson/Archive 2">Talk:Jenna_Jameson/Archive_2#Jenna.27s_autobiography</a> for the long discussion where I was finally convinced to use it in a few places.) Just from a sheer count of citations from the <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenna_Jameson_fd39.html#References" title="Jenna Jameson">references</a>, you will see the main sources are the New York Times article, the Forbes article, and the E! biography, which are all as much secondary sources as any biography. Read them, they're not interviews, they don't state "Jenna Jameson has said ..." or I would have written that. They have satisfied themselves that the things they write <i>are facts</i> to their standards, which are pretty high; they would stand up to those of a hardcover biography any day. Did they use her words? Probably. Did they rely on her words? Don't know. We'd face the same problem with a book length biography - except that <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kitty_Kelley_963b.html" title="Kitty Kelley">Kitty Kelley</a> doesn't have the cachet of Forbes or the Times. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 15:13, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As for your more specific objections:
<ul>
<li>Lead paragraph, second sentence - has been changed (though not by me), see if it's better.</li>
<li>"Parentheticals are nearly always just sloppy prose." This seems a general observation, rather than a specific criticism. If you have a specific suggestion, I'd be glad to hear it.
<dl>
<dd>The specific suggestion is to look at every use of a parenthetical phrase and to try to rewrite it without using parentheticals. Using parentheticals amounts to using a footnote - it interrupts the flow of text and distracts the reader from topic at hand. If the point is not important enough to include inline in the text, consider deleting it. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 16:44, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

</li>
<li>"Early life - unnecessary details include where her mother danced, how much time her father spent working." I'm afraid I disagree. She first tried to follow in her mother's footsteps, and the distance from her father while growing up had a major impact on her life.</li>
<li>"Is the beating and rape a documented fact?" To the satisfaction of the cited sources, and no objections have been raised from anyone else. Also be aware of what you are asking documentation for - a victim's testimony is all that most rapes have. "both could be condensed" - again, they had a very strong impact on her life. Even if we believe her quote that it didn't shape her psychology (I can't say I do), it seems hard to believe she could have been an underage stripper if she was still living with her policeman father.
<dl>
<dd>The cited reference seems to be a PR blurb related to the release of her book. I know this is a delicate issue and I'm not claiming I think it didn't happen. On the other hand, stating this as <i>fact</i> in an encyclopedia article fundamentally based on one autobiographical reference strikes me as inappropriate. I'd be happier if we directly cite the autobiography, and have text like "she says in her autobiography, ...". -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 16:44, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Not a PR blurb, but an article published in two reputable newspapers, a fine secondary source. Will look at rephrasing anyway.--<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 16:59, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
<li>"Even though it has two references, I'd cut the first sentence completely (the references are no doubt two different interviews)" - Disagree strongly, the motivation for someone entering their primary career is quite important.

<dl>
<dd>Again, this is a case of elevating what she's said to fact. The wording in the Forbes reference is <i>... at 19 she quit stripping to act in adult films--mainly to retaliate against her beau, who had been cheating on her, as she tells it.</i> We've dropped the <i>as she tells it</i>, and now present this as a pure fact. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 16:44, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
<li>"lubricated with plenty of saliva" - bizarre perhaps, but that is what makes it the signature. <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bette_Davis_3a1a.html" title="Bette Davis">Bette Davis</a>'s eyes, <a href="../../../v/i/v/Vivien_Leigh_c566.html" title="Vivien Leigh">Vivien Leigh</a>'s lightning changes of moods are all over the place in their articles.
<dl>
<dd>The askmen.com reference is an interview, and she volunteers oral as her signature move. The Salon article is also an interview and the interviewer calls this her signature move. I'd imagine "signature" move would have tons of more authoritative sources (for example, a quote from a wll known reviewer). These two strike me as PR attempts to establish this as a signature. This is another case where an actual secondary source would be helpful. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 16:44, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

Why is the span of those years particularly important?
<dl>
<dd>You mean the estimate in the infobox? The point is that this is a fact that I'd expect to find in this section. I don't really care about the specific years, but this appears to be the period in which she was most active. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 16:44, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
<li>"famous boyfriends" - maybe if someone else agrees, but they are referred to prominently in quite a few articles on her.</li>
<li>"scion of a wealthy cattle-ranching family" - disagree, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Thatcher_2770.html" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>'s article describes Denis.</li>
<li>Roman Catholic-style ceremony - strongly disagree, that she is trying to be religious and a porn star is important

<dd>Important to whom? -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 16:44, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To her, and to the article. It's a serious effort to try to join those two rather contradicting modes; that she tries to do so is worth a few words. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 16:59, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
<li>ring finger tattoo - has been removed</li>
<li>where they lived - disagree, that's encyclopedic; also note she became (in)famous where she chose to live, with the Babes Cabaret stuff</li>
<li>how much their house cost - maybe, but goes to what she did with her wealth</li>
<li>gossip column level details about her current relationship - partly agree, and have been trimming the gossip stuff, but two items are notable - first, how she began ending a long term marriage with someone who is also a very important business partner, and that her current one is actually losing work due to associating with her. Note how much space <a href="../../../v/i/v/Vivien_Leigh_c566.html" title="Vivien Leigh">Vivien Leigh</a> gives to Jack Merivale for much the same reasons.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>So in short, I did some, disagreed with others, especially the "cut by half" parts, and there are a couple of bits I could agree to remove if I could be convinced they were motivated more by the effort to genuinely improve the article rather than just shorten it for Wt's less than satisfactory reasons. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 16:44, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Thanks for your comments to the FAC; I didn't see them until recently, as the FAC was closed soon after you posted. Responding to your points:
<ul>
<li>"a half-hour, Saturday morning CBC Radio show" - needs either more, or fewer, commas.
<ul>
<li><i>Comma inserted after morning</i>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"That summer, Jennings married for the second time to Annoushka Malouf" needs a comma after "time", otherwise it's implying they had been married to each other before.
<ul>
<li><i>Good catch; comma inserted</i>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"His first wife had been childhood sweetheart Valerie Godsoe." Surely a marriage deserves more than an off-the-cuff mention. Dates, did she die, did they divorce, why, what was her profession...?
<ul>
<li><i>I tried to find out more information, but unfortunately, none seems to exist on her. Most of the research I did on Jennings didn't even mention her at all.</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Jennings also found renewed success in his personal life. In 1979, he married for the third time to fellow ABC correspondent Kati Marton. That same year, he became a father after Marton gave birth to their daughter, Elizabeth." - Aiee! So much to write here about three sentences. Multiple marriages are considered success? Especially considering how the marriage to Marton went? If that is success, I'd hate to hear what you consider failure! How and when did the second marriage end? He became a father "after" Marton gave birth - in other words, he wasn't the father of Marton's child, but of some other child, later? Maybe "when"?
<ul>
<li><i>I meant "<b>renewed</b> success" in that he remarried. Unfortunately, barely any information is out there on his second marriage either; seems like the press didn't care about his personal life until he became anchor. After changed to when; good catch.</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"As part of ABC's troika," surely you don't mean he was part of a three horse drawn sled.
<ul>
<li><i>I meant it in the sense of "triumvirate"; changed to that instead.</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"his former girlfriend, Hanan Ashrawi" - whoah! His girlfriend was a prominent and controversial Palestinian politician? You need to describe that more, when, in what context, etc.
<ul>
<li><i>It actually is described earlier in the first graf of "Foreign correspondent".</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Walt Disney Company - specify its relationship to Jennings/ABC
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../g/r/e/Image%7EGreen_tick.svg_fb97.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ac/Green_tick.svg/20px-Green_tick.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="20" longdesc="../../../g/r/e/Image%7EGreen_tick.svg_fb97.html" /></a> <b>Done</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Growing Up in the Age of AIDS, a frank, 90-minute-long discussion on AIDS in February 1992[33] and Prejudice: Answering Children's Questions" - needs a comma after 1992 for sentence legibility, whatever you think of the serial comma otherwise
<ul>
<li><i>I'm actually religious about the serial comma; not sure why I missed it there. Thanks.</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Thank you! I missed the line about Ashrawi above. It is a shame that you can't find more about his marriages, but if you can't, you can't, and given that, one sentence about Ashrawi will have to do, since we could hardly give more to that than a marriage. It is a fine article, good work. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 15:24, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi again, AnonEMouse. I should probably be asking this at a project page, but you always seem willing to give feedback (for which I thank you again). I am thinking about putting the video/film lists at these Japanese actress articles I edit in a table-like format. I'm experimenting with the idea at: <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_Work_space_6846.html" title="User:Dekkappai/Work space">User:Dekkappai/Work space</a>. Do you think this is a sensible idea? And should I notify/question other editors before making a format change like this? <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 19:55, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's always a good idea to ask other active article editors for advice and consultation, yes. Presumably you know which ones have other active editors. But note that this is a wiki, so one of the ways to do that is to actually make the change, then, on the talk page say: "I'm trying this out for this reason, if you disagree, feel free to revert and we'll talk." That's called <a href="../../../b/o/l/Wikipedia%7EBold%2C_revert%2C_discuss_b0cb.html" title="Wikipedia:Bold, revert, discuss">Wikipedia: Bold, revert, discuss</a>, including a link there on the talk page also helps. Naturally for it to work you have to be willing to accept being reverted in good humor!</dd>
<dd>For this specific question, I went to see how <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">Wikipedia:Featured articles</a> do it. I found <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Bana_b43e.html#Filmography" title="Eric Bana">Eric_Bana#Filmography</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Fonda_filmography_2379.html" title="Henry Fonda filmography">Henry Fonda filmography</a> (not a FA itself, but clearly a sub-article of <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Fonda_b169.html" title="Henry Fonda">Henry Fonda</a>, which is) which both use tables somewhat like yours. So you're at least on reasonably safe grounds, and at least have a model to follow. I would recommend removing the yellow color (especially when talking about Japanese actresses!); otherwise you have a few more columns, but I doubt that will be a major problem. Different titles in Japanese and English are probably important. You lack "role", but given the genre, I doubt that's important. Company, Director seems OK. If all the entries are going to be about 70-90 minutes in length, that column can probably go - it could be important if some are 30 and some are 120. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 20:14, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks again for taking the time to offer more excellent advice. I think you're right about the bright yellow heading at top being overly distracting-- I copied it off the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Academy_Awards#Picture_of_the_year" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Academy_Awards#Picture_of_the_year" rel="nofollow">Japanese Academy Awards</a> article. I like the Eric Bana &amp; Henry Fonda ones better. Wondering if it might wind up just being a lot of busy-work when I should be doing real work on the articles though... Anyway, I'll tinker around with the idea. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 22:06, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
