<p>Hi jayjg. I think it is easier to just call them Ahmadis rather than Ahmadi Muslims. Why? Because Muslims don't consider them to be Muslims, Ahmadis consider themselves to be Muslims. However, Ahmadis and Muslims can both agree to calling them Ahmadi.

<p>No it isn't. It avoids writing that they are considered heretics and also calling them Muslims. It is a name that both they and Muslims will agree to. And the Lahori Ahmadi movement might actually consider a reference to the Ahmadi Muslim Community to be pov. So this avoids this little tangle.

<dd>Once again. Still they prefer called Ahmadi or Ahmaddiya or Ahmadiyya community, even though most of them classify themselves as Muslims. I actually researched them and worked on their article, I actually know quite a lot about them. So to avoid both POV isn't is better to just give a wording that both sides agree to? --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 02:22, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Really? Well then I guess that's a difference between you and me. And it's not controversial to the other regular editors in the article. However, I will note this for the future. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 02:24, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sure it's on their site and that is what they classify themselves as, but that does not mean that they don't agree to being called Ahmadis, they call themselves the Ahmaddiya at many occasions. And isn't calling them Muslim a pov?Look at this page from their official website &gt; <a href="http://www.alislam.org/library/shaheed/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alislam.org/library/shaheed/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and notice how they don't refer to themselves as Muslims in the title there. I believe the exact term is Ahmaddiyat. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 02:30, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes, but if the Messaianic Jews did not mind being called "messianites" or something and the mainstream didn't either than wouldn't it be easier to use the term that they both agree to? --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 02:32, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Also notice that the site you were looking at is only of one sect of the Ahmadiyyat which is the Ahmadiyyat Muslim Community. This ignores the smaller Lahori Ahmadiyyat .

<p>Jayjg, just one question. Don't they also call themselves just the <i>Ahmaddiyat</i> or the <i>Ahmadi movement</i>? Isn't it better to avoid a dispute and just go with what both sides agree to? Look at their site once more and see how many times they also use stand-alone terms. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 02:39, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Jayjg it is their view on Jesus, which has in part made them heretic and to call them that on the Jesus page is pov. It would be taking the Ahmadi side.

<p>No, the Muslim was removed because this is not the proper name of the Lahori ahmaddiya and it would be pov not to apply to them, but glad to hear that you are happy.

<dd>They call themselves Muslim, part of Islam, and there's no evidence that "they" agree to the removal of that designation from themselves.

<p>Since the controversy is, in fact, over whether or not they are actually Muslim, removing the word "Muslim" from their name is not a good idea, but rather Wikipedia taking sides in a dispute.

<p>"Ahmadiyya Movement" is not their official name. I've used the official names they use to describe their movement, on their official website - Ahmadiyya Muslim Community/Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam. By the way, they are quite clear that they are Muslim - in fact, that they are the "true Islam".

<dd>Oh and regarding the Lahore community, the official website is at www.<b>muslim</b>.org , and it makes quite clear that consider themselves part of <b>Islam</b>. Even the page you linked to describes them as part of Islam, and finding a webpage here and there that doesn't explicitly say "Muslim"/"Islam", or that doesn't use it in the exact place you think it should, is hardly an argument that they don't consider themselves to be Muslim. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 03:02, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
