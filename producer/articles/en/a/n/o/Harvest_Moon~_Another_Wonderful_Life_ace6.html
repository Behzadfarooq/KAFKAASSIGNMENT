<p><i>Harvest Moon: Another Wonderful Life's</i> gameplay is very similar to its predecessors, involving planting, growing, and harvesting crops while taking care of the variety of animals inhabiting the farm that the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Player_character.html" title="Player character">player character</a> inherits. The game also includes being able to court three <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor.html" title="Bachelor">bachelors</a> and marry one of them by the end of the first chapter of the story. In later chapters, the character gives birth to a son, whom she must take care of.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/o/Harvest_Moon%7E_Another_Wonderful_Life_ace6.html" title="Edit section: The farm">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The farm</span></h3>
<p>The character player runs the farm throughout the game and has a variety of chores to do. The character first starts off with one cow and can later acquire additional, higher-quality cattle as well as male sheep, male and female <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicken.html" title="Chicken">chickens</a>, a male <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse.html" title="Horse">horse</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duck.html" title="Duck">ducks</a> and a <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goat.html" title="Goat">goat</a>. The ducks appear not to incubate eggs of their own as some of the eggs the player character harvests from chickens will hatch as ducklings. The cow produces milk for one year but won't for another unless mated with a bull. On the other hand, a goat will dry up after a year, regardless of mating with a male goat. The player character also starts the game with a choice of two dogs to whom she may train. The character may later receive a cat if the character cultivates friendships with Romana, and a <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chihuahua.html" title="Chihuahua">chihuahua</a> from Carter if befriended and assisted. However, these pets serve no particular function on the farm.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> In addition to these animals, the player character's farm has three fields with varying levels of <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fertility.html" title="Fertility">fertility</a> along with plants that must be watered more than once per day, particularly during summer, and nourished with fertilizer to obtain high-quality fruits and vegetables. Each crop has its ideal growing season and will do poorly if planted at the wrong time of year. The fruits and vegetables available are tomatoes, melons, watermelons, strawberries, turnips, potatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes, peaches, oranges, grapes, bananas, and apples. The player character also has the ability to create hybrid crops, which she can do by feeding any two different seeds or crops to the talking plant, Tartan, who appears at any point after the first year is over. There are a variety of tools that can be used to assist the player character in these farming tasks, including a <a href="../../../h/o/e/Hoe_%28tool%29.html" title="Hoe (tool)">hoe</a>, a <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watering_can.html" title="Watering can">watering can</a>, and a <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sickle.html" title="Sickle">sickle</a>. The player character starts with the heaviest tools that consume large amounts of stamina, but can later obtain lighter tools that don't deplete stamina as quickly. The player character can buy tools from Van, such as the brush, and may also acquire some from certain NPCs.</p>

<p>Like most Harvest Moon games, the player character can marry <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-player_character.html" title="Non-player character">non-player characters</a>. In <i>Harvest Moon: Another Wonderful Life</i>, the NPCs that are potential husbands are Marlin, Gustafa, and Rock. As in <i><a href="../../../a/_/w/Harvest_Moon%7E_A_Wonderful_Life_4531.html" title="Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life">Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life</a></i>, the character must get married by the end of the first year or else one of the NPCs will propose to the character, giving her the choice to accept their proposal and continue the game or to not accept their proposal and end the game. These potential husbands keep diaries in their houses and write down their feelings about the player character. Once four red hearts appear in their diary, it means that they will be ready for marriage. Special cutscenes that can triggered at different times increase or decrease their affection for the player character, depending on the choices the player character makes. The player character's rivals for their love also have special cutscenes with them, which increase their relationship together. In addition to this, each husband represents a wife from the first game. Rock resembles Muffy, Gustafa resembles Celia, and Marlin resembles Nami. For instance, Muffy and Rock both like the player character in the beginning of the game, Gustafa and Celia are medium difficulty, while Nami and Marlin are the hardest love interest. When the player character marries one of the potential husbands, they give birth to a son, who grows up as the years and chapters progress. The objects the player character show him or the people he meets will influence what career he will pursue when he grows up.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> When they are an adult, they will choose their wife and job. The careers available are a musician, artist, scholar, athlete, breeder, and farmer. Marlin's child is calm, yet playful, and starts off being interested in being either a farmer or rancher. Gustafa's child is shy, quiet, and loves to snuggle when the player character holds him and always asks to get picked up. He starts off being interested in being a musician or an artist. Rock's child is outgoing and a little naughty and starts off being interested in becoming an athlete.</p>

<p>In the game, the player character has a limit on <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endurance.html" title="Endurance">stamina</a>, which can be seen through the character's dreams or by looking in the mirror. In addition to this, the player character needs to eat, or else her stomach will continually growl, causing the character to pause in whatever she is doing.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> She is able to eat food found outside, or she can cook from the stove in her house, which will give her more stamina. The stove can be used to cook food ranging from soups to main dishes. At first, the player character is only able to make soups and salads, but as she makes more meals, other options are available, including salads, <a href="../../../h/o/r/Hors_d%27%C5%93uvre.html" title="Hors d'œuvre">hors d'oevres</a>, desserts, and main courses. The easiest are soups, which only need at least two ingredients, which are often plants, while the hardest are main courses, which involve mixing together food from other meals. In order to recuperate stamina and exhaustion, the player character must go to sleep or take medicine.</p>

<p>There are two mini-games in <i>Harvest Moon: Another Wonderful Life</i> - a milk drinking contest and a shape one. The first one involves the player character trying to drink as much milk as she can under a one-minute time limit by pressing the A-button. The player character's rivals for the game are Rock, Hugh, and Grant, with Grant being the easiest and Rock being the hardest. The second one can be played with the pyrotechnics twins, Patrick and Kassey. They are both equal in difficulty, but one will let the player character start first. The game is played on a squarish grid and the goal is to claim as much territory as possible with triangular figures. Winning these mini-games, however, does not win any prizes nor contribute to the storyline.</p>

<p>The game progresses through 6 chapters in the game, which shows the player character going from young adulthood to old age. However, numerous years are skipped as the game is progressed. NPCs in the game, including the main character's son, also grow older as time passes. The game takes place in Forget-Me-Not Valley, populated by a variety of characters, who can move out as new characters move in while others grow older or die. The plot is that the main character, a young woman from the city, inherits a somewhat run-down farm in Forget-Me-Not-Valley after the death of her father, and tries to make it successful with some help from her father's old friend, Takakura.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> Each chapter is one year long (which is four seasons with ten days each in Harvest Moon time) and narrated by Takakura. The first chapter is called "The Beginning," the second is called, "A New Family," the third is called, "The Harvest," the fourth is called, "Farm Life," the fifth is called, "The Journeying Chapter," and the final one is called, "The Twilight Chapter." The chapters all show how the character takes care of her farm, befriend others, and court men according to how the player controls the character. Starting from the second chapter, the player character will have given birth to a son, whom she will have to take care of for the rest of the story.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/o/Harvest_Moon%7E_Another_Wonderful_Life_ace6.html" title="Edit section: Characters">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Characters</span></h3>
<p>There are a variety of characters in the game, but they aren't significant to the chapters in the game. The character the player controls, the potential husbands, and Takakura, however, contribute to the story.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> The player character is a young girl that the player can name and control. She has inherited the farm after her father's death and is trying to make it successful. She virtually has no personality and does not speak throughout the game, except when she faces the mirror in her house. She gives birth to a son in chapter 2 and grows older as the story progresses. She is also able to change her clothes. Takakura is the player character's father's old friend. He helps the player character run the farm and with other problems. During some point in the story, he gives her a talking plant called Tartan that mixes together seeds. Takakura is enigmatic, mysterious, and seemingly grumpy, but he's actually a kind, good-hearted man. He has good knowledge of the farm and can give good advice. He narrates each of the chapters in the story.</p>
<p>The potential husbands are Marlin, Gustafa, and Rock.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> Marlin, known as Mash in the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japanese</a> version, is Vesta's younger brother who has moved to Forget-Me Not-Valley for his frail health. He used to work in the city but now works for Vesta on her farm. He is 32 years old and has a crush on Celia, but may fall in love and eventually marry the player character if she wins his affections. He acts silent and moody, but is sensitive and gentle at heart. He has a hard time expressing his feelings and gets embarrassed easily. He enjoys curry, Bodigizer and Bodyhyper and Turbojolt (three medicines found in Forget-Me-Not-Valley), milk, eggs, crops, Tomamelo Salad (a salad made from tomatoes and melons), and drinks. Gustafa, known as Gusa in the Japanese version, is a traveling <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minstrel.html" title="Minstrel">minstrel</a> that came to Forget-Me-Not-Valley for a peaceful place to play the guitar. He has also been searching for a nice place to write a song for a girl that's special to him. Although at first he sees Nami as a friend, they start to fall in love, unless the player character wins his interest. He acts similarily to a <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippie.html" title="Hippie">hippie</a> and enjoys tranquility and nature. He likes flowers, normal milk, and things from the ruins, but dislikes mugwort (a plant found in Forget-Me-Not-Valley), tomatoes, fish, and fishing gear. Rock lives at the inn with his parents, Tim and Ruby, and is a fun-loving party goer. He is rather flirtatious and enjoys the company of females. He seems to be interested in almost every girl, but his main interest will be towards either Lumina or the player character. He likes Mist Moon flowers, Toy flowers, fodder, coins, statues, light pickles, Tomamelo salad, Veggie Burgers, and wool, but dislikes goat milk, failed recipe dishes, and tools.</p>

<p><i>Harvest Moon: Another Wonderful Life</i> has been critcized by several sites for being very similar to <i><a href="../../../a/_/w/Harvest_Moon%7E_A_Wonderful_Life_4531.html" title="Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life">Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life</a></i>. Multimedia website <a href="../../../i/g/n/IGN_e112.html" title="IGN">IGN</a> thinks that the game "feels very much like Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life. And that’s because both titles share almost everything. They look the same, sound the same and play the same,<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup>" while <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameSpot_fd17.html" title="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> belives that it's "still pretty much the same game as A Wonderful Life.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup>" <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_Games_Magazine_58ca.html" title="Computer Games Magazine">Computer Games Magazine</a> had even called it a "Rip-off.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup>" This critcism is generally summarized by <a href="../../../g/4/_/G4_%28TV_channel%29_6dd5.html" title="G4 (TV channel)">G4's</a> comment that it's "more an enhanced remake than a true sequel.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup>" GameSpot has also noted that the "farming chores can get tedious after awhile," and that "the camera is hypersensitive."</p>
<p>However, GameSpot also commented that "Female character provides a different perspective on familiar places and characters," and had praised the graphics for its "detailed world with plenty of activities to partake in." Others have commented that its "simple and cartoony, which contribute to the light and upbeat mood going on.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup>" Some believe that "the best parts about the visuals lie in the environments," but some have noticed that "other background items like roads are blurry," and that the "characters lack any real detail and all sport what look like flat 2D faces on 3D models with simple expression changes.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup>" Other sites have also acclaimed it for its "countless hours of gameplay [that] keep you coming back for a long time,<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup>" while IGN had even commented that it had "a very unique play experience" and that the game "remains enjoyable for a long time." The sounds in the game, however, are "nothing special,<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup>" but although the same as <i>Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life</i>, Game Spot has noted that "they fit well to begin with." However, some websites, such as Gamer Within believe that the sound effects are annoying and that "you’re better off turning the sound down all together."</p>
<p>Overall, <i>Harvest Moon: Another Wonderful Life'</i>s critical reception has been quite average, with Gamer Zone summarizing it as the game having a " repetitive nature of the core mechanics," and Nintendo Dojo commenting that "Another Wonderful Life is an interesting look at a different side of Forget-Me-Not Valley that's sure to please fans of the series." The game maintains a 72% approval rating on <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_Rankings_40a1.html" title="Game Rankings">Game Rankings</a><sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup>, a 70% rating on <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metacritic.html" title="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>,<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup> and has a 7.0 rating in the Japanese <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_game_magazine.html" title="Video game magazine">magazine</a>, <i><a href="../../../f/a/m/Famitsu.html" title="Famitsu">Famitsu</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
