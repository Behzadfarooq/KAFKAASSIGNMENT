<p>Can you cite that? I've never heard that in my life and I doubt any of the multiple people who worked on the article have heard that either, and they understand Hebrew better than I do. One can argue "Elohim" might be plural, but "Adonai" is not. Remember, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a>. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarimarie_b8a5.html" title="User:Karimarie"><span style="color: #002BB8; font-weight: bold;">Kari Hazzard</span></a> (<a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarimarie_9af9.html" title="User talk:Karimarie"><span style="color: #002BB8;">T</span></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Karimarie_ee5d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Karimarie"><span style="color: #002BB8;">C</span></a>) 20:54, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I said this before and I'll say it again: <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No original research</a>. If every other Hebrew speaker in the world understands that "Adonai" is either singular or does not fit anywhere into the conjugation system at all, under Wikipedia policies, you are incorrect.

<p>I acknowledge that Ruth is not counted as a saint by the Catholic Church according to the listing I have just searched, which somewhat surprises me, as I am a Catholic and have noted how many other Old Testament personalities are. However, I do note that as included in the article now Ruth is included in at least one calendar of saints. I'm going through the calendars of saints one by one, so I don't yet know how many others she might be on. So, on that basis, I can't answer your question as to how often she is called a saint, because I haven't checked all the calendars yet. Also, like with all the other articles being put in the Saints project, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Ruth_856a.html" title="Book of Ruth">Book of Ruth</a> is going to be added to the project watchlist, so that the rest of the members of the project can also monitor it for changes, vandalism, and what not, as well as, at least potentially, help improve it. Based on the article's talk page, it's the only project so far that can say that. That actually surprises me, because I thought that the Bible project might have already marked it, but evidently they haven't. You are free to remove the banner if you see fit, however. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarlordjohncarter_bcc1.html" title="User:Warlordjohncarter">John Carter</a> 16:15, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There isn't a <b>single</b> list that I know of to refer to, as the different churches all use their own liturgical calendars. I initially created the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Category%7EOld_Testament_saints_0e39.html" title="Category:Old Testament saints">Category:Old Testament saints</a> in what I now know was the mistaken idea that most or all of the individuals who are regarded as saints by the Christian churches from the so-called Old Testament would be basically fairly universally included in the calendars of all the Christian churches who keep calendars of saints. I was more than a little surprised to find that the Catholics don't regard Ruth as a saint. She is listed in the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calendar_of_Saints_%28Lutheran%29_3e1f.html" title="Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)">Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)</a>, which was my basis for including her in that category of individuals from the Old Testament considered saints by the Christian churches. As I don't yet know her status in any of the Orthodox or other churches, I think it might be more than reasonable to change the category, in this case, to <a href="../../../l/u/t/Category%7ELutheran_saints_054f.html" title="Category:Lutheran saints">Category:Lutheran saints</a>, and maybe later change it to something else if and when I find that she is included in other lists as well. Please let me know what you think of the idea. Sorry for any unnecessary confusion and extra effort this has caused you. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarlordjohncarter_bcc1.html" title="User:Warlordjohncarter">John Carter</a> 17:08, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The transsexual and transgender people category is not only for transsexuals, but also for transgender people, who by definition subvert the rules of gender representation, which all these women did. It is essentially an umbrella category for people who were transexual OR transgendered. I personally think that the transgender people and behavior category is poorly named, but I have added it for the sake of inclusiveness. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsarelah_4a68.html" title="User:Asarelah">Asarelah</a> 02:24, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Am Yisirael Chai has been a long time rallying cry as well as a Jewish song. I have edited the article to reflect this (removing the word "ancient"). As for the "Black Hebrews", I could not verify "kai" was their spelling for&#160;??, so I removed it. And even if it was, it shouldn't be included. They are a tiny (hate filled) group with a non-standard transliteration. <a href="../../../e/p/s/User%7EEpson291_78d2.html" title="User:Epson291">Epson291</a> 03:36, 8 March 2007 (UTC) Oh, and your nonsense about the verb stuff makes no sense.

<p>I hear you and Hal are fighting over what the Zanj were. Here's a quote from another article that Hal says is ignorant but I want a second opinion:</p>
<p>According to J. Phillipe Rushton, Arab relations with blacks whom the Muslims had dealt as slave traders for over 1000 years could be summed up as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<table align="center" style="border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; background-color:transparent;" class="cquote">

<td width="20" valign="top" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:35px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;padding:10px 10px;">“</td>
<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;"><i>Although the <a href="../../../k/o/r/Koran.html" title="Koran">Koran</a> stated that there were no superior and inferior races and therefore no bar to racial intermarriage, in practice this pious doctrine was disregarded. Arabs did not want their daughters to marry even hybridized blacks. The <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethiopia.html" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopians</a> were the most respected, the "<a href="../../../z/a/n/Zanj.html" title="Zanj">Zanj</a>" (Bantu and other Negroid tribes from East and West Africa south of the Sahara) the least respected, with Nubians occupying an intermediate position<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></i></td>
<td width="20" valign="bottom" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:36px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:right;padding:10px 10px;">”</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>Judging from the above quote, Zanj seems to mean unhybridized black person or <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negroid.html" title="Negroid">negroid</a>. So the Nubians and Ethiopians were not considered zanj because they were very much hybridized with the Arabs and/or had much exposure to Arab culture.</p>
<p>According to <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavalli-Sforza_26a3.html" title="Cavalli-Sforza">Cavalli-Sforza</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The mixed genetic makeup and use of Afro-Asiatic languages reflect the history of the Ethiopians, who for a long time had close contacts with the Arabs. In and around the earliest Christian times, there was an empire that took in both regions. Its capital was first at Saba (Sheba) in Arabia and later at Axum, in Africa. According to Ethiopian tradition, Makeda, the Queen of Sheba, visited King Solomon and had by him a son, Menelek, founder of the Ethiopian dynasty, which has only recently been overthrown. The Bible tells of these events</i>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>Indeed it is, but I do it with the idea that a person will either understand why I added it or ask me why, in most cases it's obvious the article needs it.

<p>Hi. Ok, I found some time to explain further why the image needs to be corrected. Please, don't refer to my argumentation as stupid since there are some good reasons and I am not sure if you are fully familiar with the situation. The thing is that the border is not defined, neither on the sea nor on the land. Prior to 1991, Slovenia exercised a full jurisdiction over the whole Bay and the official standpoint of the government is that the border is according to status in 1991. Croatian claim is according to traditional principles but that doesn't mean that it has a better background to claim the territory. Untill the border is not agreed by both sides, saying <i>claimed by one of the countries</i> is therefore POV. So, my suggestion would be (as I see that you are the author of the map):</p>
<ul>
<li>If the map illustrates Drnovšek-Račan agreement, the <i>claimed by</i> area should be marked as Slovenian, since this is what the agreement says. And the map can omit the central line.</li>
<li>If the map just shows the Piran Bay, name the area as disputed territory and omit the corridor, since there is no corridor. So, Italian waters, Slovenian waters, Croatian waters, international waters and disputed area.</li>
<li>Perhapes the best solution would be to have 3 maps in the article, one with Slovenian and one with Croatia view and one with a compromise solution (but corrected as mentioned in the first paragraph).</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you see my point now. Well, personally, this border dispute has been in our media far too long and I am really fed up with it since the only thing it does is it worsens the relations between the two countries.

<dd>I agree that an image is badly needed. However, the present image does not correspond to the caption. By the Drnovšek-Račan agreement, the disputed area belongs to Slovenia and should be marked as such. So, as I said before already, possible changes are either to correct the map so it will correspond to the agreement or to put there a map without the corridor, as the corridor is something "invented" by the agreement. So, if the map shows just the geography, name the area as disputed territory and omit the corridor, since there is no corridor. So, Italian waters, Slovenian waters, Croatian waters, international waters and disputed area. I am trying to be objective but I realize it is sometimes hard. So, what do you think about modifying the map? --<b><a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETone_f843.html" title="User:Tone">Tone</a></b> 16:39, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sure, there is no major problem, it's only my opinion that modifying the captions would be more appropriate. Perhapes we should leave it for a while or ask a third party. --<b><a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETone_f843.html" title="User:Tone">Tone</a></b> 10:03, 9 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, concrete suggestion. Put: Slovenian waters, according to the agreement (or a shorter formulation maybe...). Or, without the corridor and marked Disputed area (and the text below the image without mentioning the agreement.)

<p>Anon, you never did answer my question about where the J came from in other Hebrew names which contain Gods name, Names such as <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehoshaphat.html" title="Jehoshaphat">Jehoshaphat</a>. If through the course of time the name meaning "YHWH is salvation" came to be pronounced as "Jehoshaphat" then that is enough evidence of how the tetragrammaton may be pronounced as "Jehovah". since it is a simple matter of pronunciation ie. Michael is Migel, Paul is Pablo, John is Juan (you follow?) then there can be no arguement against pronouncing the name as Jehovah. But to say one is wrong for doing so,is wrong.(I personally believe that opposition to pronouncing Gods name in any of it's various forms is opposition to people calling on the name of God, which is...we don't need to go there,right? I would not fight against pronouncing Gods name.) I don't dispute your knowledge of language. Please though,leave your personal opinions out of your editing and let the articles be edited objectively by others, then you will be better off. You tend to use words like "most" and "the Majority of" instead of "Many" which seems to be supporting your own view that your beliefs are correct,you yourself being in the majority. How many mondern linguists are there? where are the stats? the interviews? have all modern linguists taken a poll on this? where is the evidence that most of these educated people are saying this? if this information is not available then it is only your opinion saying that most of the modern scholars blah,blah,blah.
