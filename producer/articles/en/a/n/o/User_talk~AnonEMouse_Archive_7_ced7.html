<h2><span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenna_Jameson_fd39.html" title="Jenna Jameson">Jenna Jameson</a> article</span></h2>
<p>Took a hard look at it, and I can't see anything missing. Very well done! <a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabercil_a2ff.html" title="User:Tabercil">Tabercil</a> 19:14, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do have one question concerning this article: did you actually read her autobiography? I'm reading it right now, and although I have only reached page 170 (of 570), I already noticed several contradictions to what is written in the article (paragraphs "Early life" and "Early career"). Also some interesting facts from the book seem to be missing in the article, e.g. that she initially wanted to become a showgirl like her mother and actually achieved this (but stopped after a month or so and instead turned to stripping), and that the name she used as a stripper was "Jennasis". Regards --<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosenzweig_438e.html" title="User:Rosenzweig">Rosenzweig</a> 13:18, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have the autobiography as well and I haven't reread it since I bought it with an eye to seeing what can be lifted from it for use within the article... since you're going through it, why not make a list of the items you think should be included, put that list on this talk page and we all can hash out what should &amp; should not be folded in? <a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabercil_a2ff.html" title="User:Tabercil">Tabercil</a> 15:19, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>OK, but I can't make any promises about how fast I'll be. I'll try to list the contradictions &amp; possible additions so far (to page 170) tomorrow. Regards --<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosenzweig_438e.html" title="User:Rosenzweig">Rosenzweig</a> 17:50, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Contradictions or unclear passages that have caught my eye so far:
<ul>
<li>The article says that "Massoli's brother Tony, who later owned a tattoo parlor himself,[1] added the inscription "HEART BREAKER"." In the book, Jameson implies that Jack added this description two weeks later (page 10).</li>
<li>... "in 1991, though underage, she began dancing in Las Vegas strip clubs using a fake I.D." The book does not mention anything about a fake ID. She describes that she said she was seventeen, was rejected because of her age, pleaded with the owner saying that she would make him a lot of money, and was then allowed to work there anyway (p. 35).</li>
<li>"Initially rejected from the Crazy Horse Too strip club because of the braces on her teeth, they quickly relented when she removed them with the aid of her brother and a pair of needle-nosed pliers." In the book, she writes that she did this alone, using the already mentioned needle-nosed pliers and a wire cutter from her boyfriend Jack's toolbox (p. 34).</li>
<li>"She was soon earning US$2000 per night, before finishing high school." She writes that she made two thousand to four thousand dollars per night (p. 49).</li>
<li>"She finally decided on Jameson for Jameson Whiskey, which she drinks." She writes in the book about scanning through the "J" section of the phone book, rejecting several names for various reasons, including Jameson because it was "too alcoholic". On second thought she decides that she likes it, because "it was the name of a whiskey, and whiskey was rock and roll." No mention that she actually drank it (p. 86/87).</li>
<li>Her height is given as 5 feet 7 inches. In the book, she writes she is five feet six inches (p. 30). That was when she was 17, perhaps she was still growing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Possible additions:
<ul>
<li>The name she used as a stripper was Jennasis (pp. 36, 86).</li>
<li>She wanted to become a Las Vegas showgirl like her mother and applied at several shows. Most rejected her because she didn't have the required height of 5 feet 9 inches, but at the Vegas World show in the Stratosphere Hotel, she was hired. She left after two months because "the schedule was brutal" and "the money was terrible" (pp. 30/31).</li>
<li>She decided to get her breast enlargement just after her 20th birthday, because while stripping and during her early movie career she had always lost customers and box covers to other girls with "bigger, faker boobs". For years on every July 28 she celebrated her "boob day" (presumably that's when the surgery was). After the surgery, she thought the implants were "way too big for my frame". She even compares them to Barnum and Bailey's Circus (pp. 169/170).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One should keep in mind that her autobiography may not be entirely accurate in all details. Concrete dates, e.g., are rare. so we'll have to decide in each case whether the book or the other sources are more reliable. --<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosenzweig_438e.html" title="User:Rosenzweig">Rosenzweig</a> 20:19, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hmmm, time to check exactly what is said by what:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tattoo: checking this reference take us to E! Online... on the second page which a timeline here is the exact text: "Later in 1990: Her first serious relationship is with the man who gives her the trademark double-heart tattoo on her butt. The tattooed word Heartbreaker was added later...by her brother." So that clearly states that her brother did the text, but the book does not clearly state the text was done by Jack. I would leave the text as is.</li>
<li>Fake ID, braces and nightly earnings: from E! Online's timeline again: "1991: She uses a fake ID to apply for a job stripping but is told to reapply after she has her braces removed. That night, her brother helps her use needle-nose pliers to remove the braces. She goes back to the strip club the next day and gets the job. After six months, she is making $2,000 a night." The fake ID would be needed irregardless, so I would leave that in. The earnings part I would change to read&#160;:"She was earning $2000 to 4000 a night" and add a reference to the book as well. The only flat-out contradiction is the braces removal. I'd say either drop the reference to her brother doing the work, or fold it in a stated contradiction (with double references). So we would have either:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"she removed them with the aid of a pair of needle-nosed pliers[1][2]", or</dd>
<dd>"she removed them herself with a pair of needle-nosed pliers[1] (though some accounts say the removal was done with her brother's aid)[2]"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Stage-name: One cite leads to E Online again: "Later in 1991: Jenna Massoli chooses her new last name, Jameson, out of a phone book. She likes that it is also a brand of whiskey.". The other leads to a video online at Metacafe of her on a red carpet somewhere explaining how she got the name. My transcription of her words: "So I actually looked through the phone book, and at first I came up with James, as in Jenna James, but i thought that oh sounds too porno. So, I drink a lot of Jameson whiskey. So, there you go - Jenna Jameson. I'm named after a liquor". No indication in either reference that she was actually drinking the whiskey at the time, so I'd drop the "which she drinks" text.</li>
<li>Height: that comes from the NY Times, dated 2004. I'd leave that it in as 5' 7" and chalk up the difference to her still growing (as you suggest).</li>
</ul>
<p>As for your additions, definitely add her stage name, and also her time as a showgirl. I'd also add the breast enlargement info, but only stating it as "she got her first breast enlargement just after her 20th birthday", as she's had multiple surgeries (both additions and removals - see <a href="http://www.fleshbot.com/archives/porno-plastic-surgery-jenna-jameson-022447.php" class="external text" title="http://www.fleshbot.com/archives/porno-plastic-surgery-jenna-jameson-022447.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>) <a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabercil_a2ff.html" title="User:Tabercil">Tabercil</a> 02:05, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just thought I should comment that the article, when using the Jameson book, currently doesn't use specific page numbers. In this I mean Note 19 specifically. If this was rectified, this would improve the article - hope you don't mind the message. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 01:55, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello AnonEMouse,</p>
<p>I'm mostly done. I've read the autobiography and all the sources that are cited in the article, and right now there are only two minor inconsistencies left that I want to address. Please give me until the weekend to do that, I want to have some quiet to do it, and the last few days have been a bit hectic. In 90 minutes, I'm off again (Wikipedia meeting IRL&#160;:-)), so I guess it'll take until the weekend. Then we can sort out anything that's still left to do. Btw, the AVN awards ceremony is this weekend, so there just might be a chance that Luke Ford or someone on Flickr will take new pictures of her that we can use. The ones that are currently in the article are good, but a bit atypical because of the brunette hair.

<p>That's fine that you reverted it, cool with me. But I do think once the divorce is final it should read as "ex-husband" because it technically is her ex-husband. I know the picture is taken when they WERE husband and wife, but it is still mislabeled as that is now changed. Whenever I see photos of something...say well...anything but maybe an ex-political leader, and its an old photo the caption would read something like "President bush with former president blank" or something like that.

<p>As background, I traced and reported at least one long term sock-vandal, and his future incarnations with enough evidence to overturn a doubtful RFCU and obtain a "confirmed block on behavior" decision from the relevant checkusers.

Also, standard vandalism blocks, but more so - a sockpuppet created for vandalism is blocked as fast, if not faster than a separate account.</li>
<li>Second, of course, were the instructions at the top of <a href="../../../s/s/p/WP%7ESSP_fb6b.html" title="WP:SSP">WP:SSP</a>. Important things I got from the first was that easy cases are closed without being sent to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_3b77.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser">Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser</a>. I've been trying to do that as much as possible, and, frankly, the few cases I did send to CheckUser have so far been turned down, so I guess I should do that even more.</li>
<li>Third was <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Administrators_876f.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Administrators">Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Administrators</a>. When I work, I keep that open in a tab to refer to and to copy and paste templates from. It seems to be much more focused on blocking rather than any other ways to close, but I guess the more balanced guidelines from the earlier two take precedence. Important note from there seems to be that puppet masters aren't always blocked. It's not specific as to when they are blocked and when not, but I guess the standard rules of judgement apply - if I think the puppet master may be productive after a warning and blocking of the puppets, then I don't block them, if I think the puppet master is solely or almost solely abusive, then I do.</li>
<li>The instructions on top of <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_3b77.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser">Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser</a> are even stricter in terms of what can be sent there, and again emphasize blocking obvious disruptive sockpuppets without CheckUser. They also made for good reading.</li>
<li>Finally, if in doubt, don't block. Better that a guilty suspect be set free, than an innocent one punished. That's not written down in any policy specifically, but is a standard rule of blocking in general. If I let a debatable vandal go, and they do vandalize again, someone else will eventually get them later, while the Wikipedia will recover - it's vandalized thousands of times a day, after all. If I block a good contributor, I'm actually doing harm to the encyclopedia myself, in addition to making a well meaning person feel bad.</li>
<li>Then I got to work. At first I skipped the harder ones, and went to the easier ones, before I got enough courage to tackle the harder ones. Since they've been waiting for 2 months, they mostly weren't burning issues, so I could afford to do that. I'll have to close a lot more before I get to the <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Mobile_01_5f05.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Mobile 01">Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/Mobile_01</a> case, thank goodness!</li>
<li>Reading the evidence as presented is never enough, I always check the block logs and contributions logs and follow links myself, especially reading remarks made on talk pages - those are usually the most explanatory ones.</li>
<li>A couple of cases were lessons in themselves. <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_ran_16f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/ran">Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/ran</a> was probably the most interesting - it started with excellent circumstantial evidence in terms of contributions logs, even supported by an uninvolved third party. However, investigating thoroughly showed that the accuser was a <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a> himself, while the accused editors made extensive contributions to many subjects, wrote well reasoned arguments in what appeared to be the article that brought the accusation, and two of the three were actually administrators (which doesn't exclude abuse, of course, but is a sign of being trusted by a fair number of others). I looked hard to find times when their contribution times overlapped, but couldn't find any. Still, I closed without blocking, considering all of that. Checking the accuser's contribution history was invaluable, and may have stopped me from making a bad mistake. It later turned out the accused weren't informed of the accusation, and one of them did find a contribution overlap: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Danielfolsom&amp;diff=100311903&amp;oldid=100310629" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Danielfolsom&amp;diff=100311903&amp;oldid=100310629" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Fortunately the accused were kind enough not to complain to me - but it certainly was a lesson not to jump to block on lack of overlap of contribution times.</li>
</ul>
<p>All right, that's "what one mouse learned about SSP". I'll be trying to close a few more cases off and on, but would certainly appreciate all the help you can give. Good luck. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 18:06, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for all that! I'm familiar with the named policies, but will re-read them once more in case. Following good advice, I'm watching a while before diving in. What I am doing though is where it seems there are policy related issues, explaining those in a couple of SSP pages. For example, in <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Rjensen_3e24.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Rjensen">Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Rjensen</a> (4 posts). The aim being to help explain to those involved (who often come from heated disputes) the policy related issues that arise, for their future editing. I figure it's probably safe to do that, while learning about judgement in such cases.</dd>

<dd>Your comment about "Better that a guilty suspect be set free, than an innocent one punished" is what's most in my mind and inclined me to ask guidance in the first place. I look at even the obvious cases and think "Am I <i>really</i> sure?" and "Do I <i>really</i> want to block an account based on this evidence?", and it makes me very sure I would like some hand-holding lest I accidentally misjudge some matter. A good attitude to start with, but ultimately not useful overall. But that's what inclined me to ask for your help getting the hang of the bottom-line judgement of blocking/not blocking.</dd>

<dd>That's from an article by CNN, however CNN got it, that makes it perfectly good enough. It is not for us to question <i>their</i> methods, they're the reliable source, we merely report on what they say. Frankly, 90% of the information in any CNN article will come from what people say, we have to trust their judgement in what they print. It's not as if this were a particularly controversial fact. If you want to rewrite the sentence so it makes this more clear, feel free, but if you strike it as unsourced, I'm going to have to revert you. Personally I don't have a stake in Elonka's fame or fortune, but her article has been a target for many people with no good reason. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 13:35, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi again, AnonEMouse. I'm still plugging away at the big project, and doing what I can on the littler ones in the meantime. I've come across one problem just now though-- one of the articles I've been using as a reference source (Fornander, Kjell. (1992) <a href="http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html" class="external text" title="http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html" rel="nofollow">"A Star is Porn"</a> in <i>Tokyo Journal</i>) appears to have been taken down.

<dd>OK, nevermind on this one anyway-- I've found a reference to the article in a print source-- the July 1992 issue of <i><a href="http://www.tokyo.to/" class="external text" title="http://www.tokyo.to/" rel="nofollow">Tokyo Journal</a></i>. The concern still lingers though. What do I do in case I'm not able to track down a print copy of a good, legitimate web article which is subsequently removed? <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 18:54, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sockpuppet Case</span></h2>
<p>Hi There, I am wondering if you can have a look at this case and close and archive it if you feel it is no longer valid. The page is continuing to get comment unrelated to the sockpuppet investigation and has turned into a bit of a slanging match between the initiator and other editors. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/Mobile_01" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/Mobile_01" rel="nofollow">Sockpuppet Case Mobile_01</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The sockpuppet case basically claims that I, <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Australia.svg_9b78.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b9/Flag_of_Australia.svg/25px-Flag_of_Australia.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Australia.svg_9b78.html" /></a> <a href="../../../m/o/b/User%7EMobile_01_c54b.html" title="User:Mobile 01"><font size="2"><font color="green"><b>Mobile 01</b></font></font></a><a href="../../../m/o/b/User_talk%7EMobile_01_2f77.html" title="User talk:Mobile 01"><i><sup><font color="red">Talk</font></sup></i></a> used a sockpuppet <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeilinOz1_4855.html" title="User:NeilinOz1">NeilinOz1</a>. Check the edit logs of this users contribs and you will see that they have not edited since late 2006 and before I became a member. They made some edits to <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smallville.html" title="Smallville">Smallville</a> and some to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridgestone.html" title="Bridgestone">Bridgestone</a> The assumption that because they edited the same article as I did 2 months later and appear to also be from Australia is the sum of evidence in this case.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As I have pointed out on the case page, There is no overlap of edits between <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeilinOz1_4855.html" title="User:NeilinOz1">NeilinOz1</a> and myself, no illigitimate use by either accounts to support each other or rig any voting has occured. This is a case brought about by Travb who started an edit war on a page that I was editing. This user has started other unsupported sockpuppet cases against other editors he has started an "Edit War" with. He has a history of disruptive behaviour as per his block log which shows he has been Indef blocked, Resurrected and then blocked again for uncivil behaviour, he has numerous warnings from Admins about his NPA violations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeilinOz1_4855.html" title="User:NeilinOz1">NeilinOz1</a> never edited the <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firestone_Tire_and_Rubber_Company_c186.html" title="Firestone Tire and Rubber Company">Firestone Tire and Rubber Company</a> page. This case originally accused me of being a sock of LucaZ but that has been withdrawn once the IP was traced to USA. I am in Australia. Some of the Anon posts he claims are sock, may well be me forgeting to log on. However none have been used to circumvent rules, provide support for my opinions or disrupt Wiki in any way. Where possible I have tried to correct ANON posts later once I have identified the mistake.</dd>
<dd>The 10 days is over since this was first placed on my userpage and another user has removed the Tag left there. The checkuser request was denied by another Admin.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If after looking at this case you believe it is finished then I am asking that it be closed and archived so we can prevent further NPA to all parties and get back to the discussion page of the article that prompted all this. <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firestone_Tire_and_Rubber_Company_c186.html" title="Firestone Tire and Rubber Company">Firestone Tire and Rubber Company</a> which is still protected. Discussion on this article has commenced with interested editors and a request to join these discussions was offered to Travb which he declined.</dd>

<p>Hi AnonEMouse, since you've been pulled into this sock puppet case, I wanted to get your opinion on this matter. I have been involved in it, as you may or may not have noticed while reviewing the case. Through it all, I've been dismayed by the aggressive behavior of Travb, but I have limited my opinions of such to purely comments. However, it seems that TravB has gone beyond proper editor behavior with the recent inclusion of this messaging on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bridgestone#Information_for_future_Firestone.2FBridgestone_editors" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bridgestone#Information_for_future_Firestone.2FBridgestone_editors" rel="nofollow">Bridgestone</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Firestone_Tire_and_Rubber_Company#Information_for_future_Firestone.2FBridgestone_editors" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Firestone_Tire_and_Rubber_Company#Information_for_future_Firestone.2FBridgestone_editors" rel="nofollow">Firestone</a> talk boards:</p>

<p>This behavior seems directly to contradict proper editor behavior on avoiding attacks of other users on article discussion pages. It seems to have been spurred by Travb's inability to prove his sockpuppet case, and this is his last attempt to discredit and run <a href="../../../m/o/b/User%7EMobile_01_c54b.html" title="User:Mobile 01">User:Mobile 01</a> off of the articles in question, and perhaps, even Wikipedia. As I have never been involved in problems of this nature, I would like your opinion as if I should take this to the Administrator's notice board.

<li>Did I mention Aieee&#160;? I guess not. Anyway, the two sections you mention seem to only duplicate other information already on that talk page. So they're redundant, and heavily misspelled, but not really anything new. They're clearly <i>not nice</i> but taking it to <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> would either continue or escalate the conflict. How about offering to make peace instead? Compromise, collaboration, consensus are much more productive. In the end, we are all trying to make a free encyclopedia, that's a pretty good thing. Surely we can do it nicely. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 18:15, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Aieee pretty much sums it up. I'm a strong believer in making nice and working together. However, Travb posted this information <i>after</i> Mobile 01 attempted the very same thing, by making a statement working on the Firestone page together on his user page. This was referred to on the Sockpuppet page you closed. He ignored it. By all appearances, he refuses to let the sockpuppet thing go, and has no inclination to even attempt to join in a collaborative effort on the pages in question. Regardless, I don't want escalation, but he has been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Travb" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Travb" rel="nofollow">blocked from Wikipedia</a> in the past for apparently going overboard in arguments over edits and/or users. Ultimately, I feel its unfair and uncivil for this behavior to continue. Regardless, thank you again for your opinion! It can't be all fun having to deal with two sides squabbling! <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebelAt_3723.html" title="User:RebelAt"><font color="#3333CC">~ <font size="1" color="red">(The Rebel At)</font> ~</font></a> 18:34, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
