<p>You have been doing a lot of surgery on the Amateur radio article. Would you care to look at <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antenna_%28radio%29.html" title="Antenna (radio)">Antenna (radio)</a> as well? I think it is getting too long, but perhaps not. I authored a significant portion of that page, and thus don't feel qualified to cut it down as much as I'd like, especially when what I'd like to cut is what other people wrote. 8-P I think the overview section needs a rewrite. I think the list of antennas is disorganized (although that might be ok) and the descriptions in it are too long. If they stay as long as they are, perhaps it should be converted to headings from the current bulleted list. If they are shortened, I'd suggest shortening the ones that have their own articles to a sentence or two. Am I thinking too drastic (is the article OK as is) or do you agree with any of this? --<a href="../../../s/s/d/User%7ESsd_e9c6.html" title="User:Ssd">ssd</a> 07:08, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. You seem to be a fairly experienced editor, so I would have thought you would notice that the Racine Megacycle Club article was obviously not formatted according to Wikipedia's style guidelines, but you removed the cleanup tag without making any changes. So, instead of reinserting the tag, I made some changes now that I had the leisure time to do so, and I have noted the changes at <a href="../../../r/a/c/Talk%7ERacine_Megacycle_Club_b3bd.html" title="Talk:Racine Megacycle Club">Talk:Racine Megacycle Club</a>; I made some other suggestions there too that I ask you to consider.

<p>Hi! Please don't make articles which simply state that "so-and-so is an amateur radio club" and then put an external link to it. These types of are speedy deleted as having lack of content or as serving strictly as placeholders for the external link. Thanks. - Lucky 6.9 17:39, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please stop adding single-sentence articles/weblink placeholders. These are not considered stub articles. Thanks again. - Lucky 6.9 17:43, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No prob. It's hard to determine what someone has in mind when things like this come on <i>en masse</i>. Just so no one else comes along and tags these for no content, simply add a sentence or two about the clubs, maybe a bit of history or some other notable activity. Have fun; sorry about the inconvenience. - Lucky 6.9 17:46, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yesterday, the Hamsexy article, as part of Wikipedia:WikiProject Amateur radio. Now I'm not so sure the article deserves to live, don't get me wrong.... (I'm not so sure it should stay) Just c'mon... gone so fast??? (I am not asking for the article to be restored) please look at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Amateur_radio_0cc8.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Amateur radio">Wikipedia:WikiProject Amateur radio</a> It's disgusting. The WikiProject Amateur radio isn't even that old. It was created to help get us together to fix those very articles... and they are dropping so fast we can't keep up. I mean, they just disappear for apparently no reason (until we figure out later what happened) And it's like some kinda shenanigans are going on. Some of these articles lasted quite a while, and only after they were just added to a project then they start getting deleted! We need time to organize the project. I work and I can't keep hitting refresh every ten seconds on my watch list to look for speedy deletion notices it's impossible and unfair to expect that. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonym1ty_c12e.html" title="User:Anonym1ty">Anonym1ty</a> 21:32, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ah, that one. I actually deliberated on that one for some time due to its history. I noted that it was a recreation of a previously-deleted page as well. However, it very much did not make any assertion of its subjects importance either generally or to a specific subculture (note that importance to a subculture is disputed as being relevant, though). This qualified it for <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#A7" title="WP:CSD">speedy-delete criteria A7</a> easily. Any article that satisfies any of the speedy-delete criteria is at risk of being deleted without notice.</dd>
<dd>Of course, if the subject can be demonstrated to be important and <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">notable</a>, I'll undelete the article. If you like, I can undelete the article right now and move it to your userspace where it can be worked on until it is no longer at risk of speedy-deletion. As for the Amateur Radio project, though, I'd recommend that a major initiative of the project should be rescuing deserving articles from speedy-deletion by editing them to indicate their importance. Speedy-deletion is important for the integrity of the encyclopedia, and we can't have a special exception for certain kinds of articles. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 21:43, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am going to quote you... "I actually deliberated on that one for some time due to its history." You said it yourself that immediately qualifies it for a NORMAL deletion policy over a speedy one. I do not care the article is deleted. I think now it should be... I am arguing with you over these speedy deletes... it's really getting to be a load of horse manure. Another qualifier would have been the PROJECT NOTICE on the discussion page. It's in a PROJECT. Notify the participants!!! I mean just look at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Amateur_radio_0cc8.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Amateur radio">Wikipedia:WikiProject Amateur radio</a> Do you not see a problem here? <b>SLOW DOWN</b> remember #1 WIKIPEDIA IS NOT A PAPER ENCYCLOPEDIA. Leaving some time for people to understand and respond isn't a whole lot to ask. I think CSD though not intentionally is being abused <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonym1ty_c12e.html" title="User:Anonym1ty">Anonym1ty</a> 21:53, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I did slow down, as you pointed out. It still qualified for CSD A7 regardless of being in a project. I didn't deliberate on it because I doubted whether it qualified, but because I wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something in its history that made it qualify. Finding nothing, I deleted it. Speedy-deletion is an important tool, and there's currently a huge backlog at <a href="../../../c/s/d/CAT%7ECSD_4339.html" title="CAT:CSD">CAT:CSD</a>. Sending everything there AfD because speedying it wouldn't allow poeple to respond would be a nightmare, and we can't be making special exceptions for certain kinds of articles. Articles aren't speedied when they're borderline, but when they're so far below the requirements of Wikipedia that no discussion is necessary. If this is happening often to amateur radio articles, that's an indication that many are completely inadequate, not that they should be given special exceptions. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 22:04, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's the rub, ain't it? look at it this way. The articles need work, no problem, the group editing them starts a Wiki Project... Part of which is to fix the articles... Then some one goes down the list of the articles and starts taging them CSD. You say we should try to fix them... but in the time it takes to fix them 3 get deleted. it's draconian. You say you have a backlog, but with the speed of these delete I don't see how. What about FIFO? First ones in are the first ones out, that alone would afford the time to contest or fix the articles. Randomly (and yes it's randomly) deleting articles with no explanation, no notice isn't helping, it's confusing users and needs to stop. Speedy-deletion is indeed important for spam and vandalism pages, it's being over-used on A7. A campaign of normal deletes for this would be beneficial to the wikipedia community and help educate users. Just gone... Just gone that's what happens and it makes no sense... There's no way for a normal user to figure out what happened without a whole lot of reading and it just invites the same kind of articles to be created again and again.<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonym1ty_c12e.html" title="User:Anonym1ty">Anonym1ty</a> 23:15, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Note that I said not that they should be fixed, but that the WikiProject should consider setting up some kind of rescue / article shelter system. Articles in the article space that meet the criteria for speedy deletion risk deletion at any time, and no one admin sparing an article can save it if it qualifies as there are always many admins trying to clean out the backlog. (For the backlog, and technical reasons why your suggestion wouldn't work, take a look at <a href="../../../c/s/d/CAT%7ECSD_4339.html" title="CAT:CSD">CAT:CSD</a>: they're sorted alphabetically, not FIFO, and the list is huge and holding despite efforts to clear it.)</dd>
<dd>I'm afraid your objection goes far beyond anything I can do as it takes exception to the fundamentals of the speedy-deletion policy. You might want to bring up your concerns at <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia_talk%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_0059.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Criteria for speedy deletion">Wikipedia talk:Criteria for speedy deletion</a>. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 23:23, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Looks like I spoke too soon: the backlog is starting to clear up after a big push was requested at the administrators' noticeboard. In any case, the technical problem remains, and slowing down doesn't make articles any less qualified under the criteria. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 23:26, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just thought I'd view your user page after seeing what you wrote on the Wisconsin discussion page. Just letting you know, your user page says you're "OWNED" by one or more cats. I assume you mean "OWN". I notice you have a radio license. That is cool. I always wanted to be on radio but it requires a bunch of boring college so I forgot about that whole idea. Do you have your own radio station? Lonelyboy 08:20, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hey, delightful words. You're cool. And lol @ the cats owning you because they're the ones making the demands. Clever, clever! Oh by the way, my master is a dog. I do everything at his beck and bark. Not the same beck and meow situation you're dealing with. lol!</p>
<p>About the radio, I really pursued a lot of my interest this year since I am 20 and radio was a big one on my list. I must have e-mailed numerous radio people requesting if I could help them out in some way, to hopefully get started in that industry. I only got more and more discouraged and irritated. A lot of them made me feel like I'd spend forever working up to radio personality. Some made me feel like I needed to spend way to much time in college and be involved in certain colleges to get an intern. Others were telling me how I needed to pay my dues before I got such a job.</p>
<p>I never heard of getting a license from any of them, so that was fascinating. Yea, actually I've always wanted to be radio personaltiy and I wrote a bunch of e-mails stating what you said, convincing people. I wrote all about how I am able to be very eloquent as I have a passion for words and am very good with english language. It was just kind of irritating because it was getting nowhere and e-mailed a lot of radio people, and I really only got few responses back.</p>
<p><br />
Anyway, as to writing about my self. Thank you for your interest in me. That's nice. Gee whiz! There is really not much to say. I'm just a depressed, hapeless 20 year old person. That's about it. lol! Exciting and fascinating people like you should only have the user pages.&#160;;) Lonelyboy 18:34, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
lol, I'm too much of a pessmist to make a user page. I'd be willing to tell you all about me though.&#160;;)</p>
<p>I didn't realize there were so many routes into getting on radio as you said. That's interesting. The thing is I think the route that I'm most likely to become a radio personality with, is a long route that I don't want to take. I think the main route is the whole four year college business. First of all, I can't stand math and I'm not good at it, and the last thing I want to do is be more miserable doing it for four years in college. That's what I hate about stuff. It takes forever getting where you want to be.</p>
<p>But it's all good. I've accepted the fact that I will never be on radio and there are a couple of other things I'd like to be; Singer, TV show host, publisher, illustrator, and show creator. Those are all things I am interested in and think I would do well at. I've actually tried for each and it's just getting annoying waiting. A music producer even said I had a strong voice, but it's getting annoying poking around with him. It takes forever to receive e-mails and he'll say he's busy and will give my music to some other producer's because he's making a record or something, which is just taking forever so. Well, excuse me for going so far into all this. Just telling you a little bit more about me. HAPELESS!!! I really hate life. It sucks!!!</p>
<p>Anyways! Wow! It sounds like you have a great hobby. I bet your amateur radio gig will really take you places. I think it's fascinating how you're able to talk with like astronauts and such. I never heard of that before. I just always thought radio was broadcast like you hear on the radio, out to millions of people. What you were telling me sounds like a whole other category of radio. I think it's rules are very appropriate to regarding not discussing religious issues, cursing, and such. Religious people are too dogmatic in their beliefs and it would just get irritating listening to them anyway. Yea, but I like the whole concept of the amateur radio thing. I would think about looking more into it, but unfortunately being 20, I need to find a career fast before I can do a hobby. I need money and a way to get money in an exciting way. I feel like I am in jail living at my parents house stuck here 24/7 under their rules. I am supposed to be going back to college, but I am trying to hurry up and find something interesting before I go back in January, or else I'm getting out of this little nasty place for good. Lonelyboy 20:05, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you soooooooooo much for all that great advice on how to get into radio. wow-whee. Maybe I can actually consider that dream again because of you. You've got to have my e-mail. My e-mail is stat4manlulu@yahoo.com. Please e-mail me from now on.&#160;:) Such a nice, helpful person like you, we have to have each other's e-mails. I'll respond to you there once you e-mail me. I can say as much as I want there.&#160;:) Lonelyboy 22:19, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just e-mail me and say hi, so I can give you my response over your helpful advice for me. I would feel a little more comfortable talking to you privately. You can know about me. Not everyone on wikipedia. I know you're a nice person. A lot of people here just aren't.&#160;:) lol Lonelyboy 23:00, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. Someone just tried to put a prod tag on <a href="../../../c/u/y/Cuyahoga_County_Skywarn_26d2.html" title="Cuyahoga County Skywarn">Cuyahoga County Skywarn</a>, which you created back in February. It has been tagged for cleanup since June without any significant improvement. Can you add some information to the article to help in establishing notability on it? If someone doesn't, it will likely get canned through either CSD or AFD very soon. I went through something similar with <a href="../../../m/f/j/MFJ_Enterprises_088a.html" title="MFJ Enterprises">MFJ Enterprises</a> a couple of months back. Only that time, I didn't discover the prod until after it had been deleted.

<p>I just replaced your cites on the main <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_Radio_6b5b.html" title="Amateur Radio">Amateur Radio</a> page with links to appropriate source web pages. To be perfectly honest, many of them were plainly obvious to anyone who has been involved in Amateur Radio, like asking for a cite to prove that the sun rises in the East. But since it was so important, now you get to retrieve each of the the pages and convert them into proper Wikipedia references&#160;;-) GCW50 18:57, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;It is very important, and not obvious to those who are not Amateur radio operators.</p>
<p>Then you could have simply looked each of them up and added them in the first place instead of just putting in {fact} all over the place GCW50 19:44, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Well I was going to... part one is to identify them. Then to go back and add them one at a time.</p>
<p>I suggest that perhaps in the future you limit yourself to one section at time. The sheer number of them all appearing at once seemed to question the validity of the entire article.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;It's also a good idea to allow the people who wrote the stuff to have the opportunity to add the actual link.</p>
<p>That's passing the buck. I found them all with a simple Google search in a separate window for simple cutting and pasting as could the poster of the {fact}.</p>
