<p><b>Another World</b> (sometimes called <i><b>Another World: Bay City</b></i> as it was briefly known) was a <a href="../../../d/a/y/Daytime_Emmy_award_47e0.html" title="Daytime Emmy award">Daytime Emmy</a>-winning <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soap_opera.html" title="Soap opera">soap opera</a> which ran on the <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> television network from <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_4.html" title="May 4">May 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a> to <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_25.html" title="June 25">June 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>. It was co-created by <a href="../../../i/r/n/Irna_Phillips_ddcb.html" title="Irna Phillips">Irna Phillips</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_J._Bell_3e8e.html" title="William J. Bell">William J. Bell</a>.</p>
<p>There were 8891 episodes of <i>Another World</i> produced. <i>Another World</i> was created by Irna Phillips to be a spin-off of another soap opera <i>As the World Turns.</i> The shows were on competing networks, and CBS would not allow a spin-off on NBC. Ironically, the show spawned two official spin-offs: <i><a href="../../../s/o/m/Somerset_%28soap_opera%29.html" title="Somerset (soap opera)">Somerset</a></i> (1970-1976) and <i><a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_%28soap_opera%29.html" title="Texas (soap opera)">Texas</a></i> (1980-1982). A one-time primetime special was also aired in 1992, entitled <i><a href="../../../s/u/m/Another_World%7E_Summer_Desire_e3f1.html" title="Another World: Summer Desire">Another World: Summer Desire</a></i>. <i>Another World</i> was produced by <a href="../../../p/r/o/Procter_%26_Gamble_Productions_c75f.html" title="Procter &amp; Gamble Productions">Procter &amp; Gamble Productions</a>, which produced the majority of the American <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soap_opera.html" title="Soap opera">soap operas</a> in the 1950s and 1960s. It was one of the few soap operas to not be produced on the island of Manhattan. It was produced at the NBC studios in the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midwood%2C_Brooklyn_cbd8.html" title="Midwood, Brooklyn">Midwood</a> area of <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn.html" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> for the entirety of its run. (Somerset was also filmed there.)</p>
<p>In the beginning, the show was pure coffee-table high melodrama revolving around two branches of the Matthews family in a midwestern town called <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bay_City_%28Another_World%29_b615.html" title="Bay City (Another World)">Bay City</a>, a goal that was attained by veteran soap writer and creator Irna Phillips. By comparison, <i>Another World</i> focused on more melodramatic situations than Phillips' most popular soap <i>As the World Turns</i>, which was more ordinary and even mundane.</p>
<p>When Phillips created the show, she saw it as a sister program to her other creation, <i><a href="../../../a/s/_/As_the_World_Turns_1362.html" title="As the World Turns">As the World Turns</a></i>, and that there would be crossover storylines and characters between the two programs; even the title of <i>Another World</i> suggested similarity to <i>ATWT</i>. However, none of the other soaps on <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a>, on which <i>As the World Turns</i> aired, were in danger of cancellation, and <i>Another World</i> was picked up by NBC.</p>

<p>The first episode was a funeral: wealthy William Matthews had died. His widow Liz (most notably played by <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audra_Lindley_4a47.html" title="Audra Lindley">Audra Lindley</a> and later <a href="../../../i/r/e/Irene_Dailey_1c3d.html" title="Irene Dailey">Irene Dailey</a>) did not like his working-class brother Jim (<a href="../../../s/h/e/Shepperd_Strudwick_bebd.html" title="Shepperd Strudwick">Shepperd Strudwick</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Marlowe_7340.html" title="Hugh Marlowe">Hugh Marlowe</a>) or his family. The fights between upper class Liz and her middle class in-laws started the show. As the '60s went on, the lives and loves of Jim's children (Russ, Alice, and Pat) took center-stage. Jim's wife, Mary (<a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia_Dwyer_3945.html" title="Virginia Dwyer">Virginia Dwyer</a>), usually intervened when there was a crisis, which was most of the time.</p>
<p>In the first year, the show had a controversial storyline involving teenager Pat Matthews having an illegal <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">abortion</a> after falling <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pregnant.html" title="Pregnant">pregnant</a> to her boyfriend. This was the first time that American television had covered the subject. In the story, the abortion made her sterile, and the shock from the news caused her to find her ex-boyfriend and shoot him in cold blood. Pat was eventually brought to trial and acquitted. She then fell in love and married her lawyer, John Randolph (<a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_M._Ryan_7c92.html" title="Michael M. Ryan">Michael M. Ryan</a>).</p>
<p>After a one-year run, NBC was expected to cancel the program. But instead, former soap opera actor <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Lipton_1cd3.html" title="James Lipton">James Lipton</a> was hired to write the show. His ideas included pushing the Matthews family into the background and introducing a new family that was headed by a doctor. <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnes_Nixon_b660.html" title="Agnes Nixon">Agnes Nixon</a>, who was then the head-writer of CBS's <i><a href="../../../g/u/i/Guiding_Light_3221.html" title="Guiding Light">Guiding Light</a></i>, was hired to write for the program. <a href="../../../b/e/v/Beverly_Penberthy_58b8.html" title="Beverly Penberthy">Beverly Penberthy</a> replaced Susan Trustman in the role of Pat Matthews Randolph). Miss Trustman had been on nearly every show while Miss Phillips was the writer, and she was exhausted. Nixon created the roles of hairdresser Ada Lucas Davis(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Constance_Ford_bf24.html" title="Constance Ford">Constance Ford</a>) and her daughter Rachel (<a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Strasser_37a1.html" title="Robin Strasser">Robin Strasser</a>), which were immediate successes. Rachel was a schemer who grew up in a lower-class background, and fought for what she wanted, even if it meant she had to resort to underhanded means. Her mother Ada was much more honest and down-to-earth, and provided a good foil for Rachel, as Ada was the only person Rachel really loved, besides herself.</p>
<p>The next year, businessman Steve Frame (<a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Reinholt_1d8b.html" title="George Reinholt">George Reinholt</a>) was introduced. A shrewd businessman, he grew up in a poor background and earned everything he worked for. He and Rachel immediately bonded over their respective pasts, but he also became involved with Alice Matthews (<a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacqueline_Courtney_17c9.html" title="Jacqueline Courtney">Jacqueline Courtney</a>), who was more sophisticated, shy, and demure, something he really looked for in a wife. They courted and were to marry in 1969, but the marriage was called off when Rachel, who was married to Alice's brother Dr. Russ Matthews (<a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Groom_866c.html" title="Sam Groom">Sam Groom</a>), crashed the engagement party with the news that she was carrying Steve's child. She gave birth to a son, James (later referred to as Jamie), in November.</p>

<p>The show's popularity shot up, thanks to a love triangle revolving around Steve, Alice, and Rachel.</p>
<p>As 1970 began, Alice had a breakdown and went to live in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>. Steve and Rachel bonded yet again, this time over their child, but Alice eventually returned and she married Steve the next year.</p>
<p>After the departure of <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnes_Nixon_b660.html" title="Agnes Nixon">Agnes Nixon</a> (who left the show in order to create <i><a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Life_to_Live_efbc.html" title="One Life to Live">One Life to Live</a></i> for ABC), Robert Cenedella was breifly hired to replace her. He also created the spin-off show <i><a href="../../../s/o/m/Somerset_%28TV_series%29_1c91.html" title="Somerset (TV series)">Somerset</a></i>. It was decided that he should leave the original show to concentrate on the spin-off, so sponsor Procter &amp; Gamble hired a newcomer, playwright <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harding_Lemay_28d7.html" title="Harding Lemay">Harding Lemay</a>, to write the program. Lemay's screenplays took the form of tragic plays, as they were carried out in five dramatic acts. As the show rose higher in the ratings, NBC brass wished to expand the show to an hour; the first regularly scheduled hour-long episode was telecast on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_6.html" title="January 6">January 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>.</p>
<p>Thoroughly convinced that her child would be instrumental in breaking up the new Frame marriage and snagging her Steve once and for all, she enlisted the help of her drifter father, who tricked Alice into finding Steve and Rachel in a compromising position. She filed for divorce and again left town. Fed up with Alice's wavering ways, and already feeling an attachment to Rachel and a duty to have more of a role in his son's life, Steve married Rachel (now played by <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Wyndham_4765.html" title="Victoria Wyndham">Victoria Wyndham</a>, who succeded Strasser and Margaret Impert in the role). When Alice returned from Europe for a second time, she exposed Rachel and her father's scheme, which accidentally sent Steve to prison as an accomplice to <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embezzlement.html" title="Embezzlement">embezzlement</a>. When he was released, Steve reunited with Alice; although she had sent him away, he was too alienated against Rachel to rekindle any feeling.</p>
<p>As Steve and Alice were finally allowed to be together (they were married for the second time on the tenth-anniversary telecast), Rachel continued to scheme, even trying to evict Alice from the house Steve had given to her; Rachel tried to say that Steve had given <i>her</i> the house. After Alice had another mental breakdown, and Steve sided with Alice, Rachel decided to reform herself.</p>
<p>Rachel tried her best to stay away from the couple, and even found love with an older, wise magazine editor, Mackenzie "Mac" Cory (<a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglass_Watson_0397.html" title="Douglass Watson">Douglass Watson</a>). This was in tune with Wyndham's wish that Rachel be played with more facets to her character â€” for many years, her character was totally "black" in personality, compared to "white", good Alice. Both Lemay and Wyndham, who were at the time new to the series, wanted to change the character of Rachel as she was so blindly hated by many fans, who wrote to the <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> studios wishing that she be killed off.</p>

<p>Originally, Mac and Rachel were not planned to have a romantic coupling. Harding Lemay noticed the chemistry between actors Douglass Watson and Victoria Wyndham, and wrote a slow-developing love story for them. Fearing backlash from viewers who may have found an older man-younger woman relationship tasteless, Lemay penned chance encounters for the two characters, which led to innocent yet intimate conversations. By the time the characters had their first kiss, the story had gone on for six months. Continuing on the slow path, Mac and Rachel's relationship blossomed until they were wed.</p>
<p>Mac and Rachel were married by a <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_of_the_peace.html" title="Justice of the peace">justice of the peace</a> in the Cory mansion on <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valentine%27s_Day_56e9.html" title="Valentine's Day">Valentine's Day</a> 1975. The drama produced by Mac and Rachel's marriage and Mac's daughter's insane jealousy (Mac's daughter, Iris, was portrayed at this time by <a href="../../../b/e/v/Beverlee_McKinsey_262e.html" title="Beverlee McKinsey">Beverlee McKinsey</a>) fueled the storylines for most of the late 1970s. Iris, who was sheltered and wanted to be the only woman in her father's life, resented Rachel, who was her same age. Iris's schemes to drive Rachel away from Mac often backfired, and drove a wedge between father and daughter, instead of bringing them together. The presence of the Cory maid, Louise (<a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Meacham_73e9.html" title="Anne Meacham">Anne Meacham</a>), proved for sometimes comedic relief in an otherwise dramatic storyline. Other times, Louise served as a stern confidante and a sometime voice of reason for Mac during fights with either Rachel or Iris.</p>

<p>Steve was presumed dead in 1975 when his helicopter supposedly crashed in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>. Alice became a backburner character for the first time in 11 years, in tune with Lemay's wish that Jacqueline Courtney leave the show. She was replaced by actress <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Harney_3686.html" title="Susan Harney">Susan Harney</a>. Over time, Alice became a <a href="../../../r/e/g/Registered_nurse.html" title="Registered nurse">registered nurse</a>, and cared for her adopted daughter, Sally (first played by <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathy_Greene_33b9.html" title="Cathy Greene">Cathy Greene</a>). While Alice's story finally calmed down, her siblings' stories expanded. Her sister Pat Randolph experienced marital problems with her husband John. He ended up divorcing Pat and marrying the maniacal Olive (<a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Leak_cce6.html" title="Jennifer Leak">Jennifer Leak</a>).</p>
<p>The ratings for <i>Another World</i> had declined since its final peak at #1 in 1978. To keep the spot, executive producer <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Rauch_88fc.html" title="Paul Rauch">Paul Rauch</a> pitched the idea to <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> to make the show longer. Although not at its peak, the show was still the most successful soap in NBC's lineup, so they agreed. Lemay (with the help of Tom King), penned a <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_effects.html" title="Special effects">special effects</a>-laden storyline involving the fiery death of <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_M._Ryan_7c92.html" title="Michael M. Ryan">Michael M. Ryan</a>'s character John Randolph, who had appeared on the show since 1964. The storyline, which was meant to be kept secret from the press, was finally leaked a month before the scenes aired, prompting <i><a href="../../../g/u/i/Guiding_Light_3221.html" title="Guiding Light">Guiding Light</a></i> to counteract with their own shocking episode to air in the same timeslot: the rape of Holly by her husband Roger.</p>

<p>John's death on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_6.html" title="March 6">March 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>, as he was saving his former sister-in law Alice from a burning building, coincided with the move to 90-minute episodes each weekday. It was at that time that Lemay, who had written since 1971, decided to hand over his duties to Tom King, citing overwork. While the ratings got a slight boost, most viewers did not like the change to longer episodes; the new time format allowed the writers to introduce many new characters, most of whom did not catch on with the audience. Beverlee McKinsey got her own spinoff series, <i>Texas</i>, in 1980, and to accommodate her new series, <i>Another World</i> went back to 60 minutes, and was moved from the three o'clock hour to two o'clock. Another two million viewers defected, partly due to McKinsey's departure, partly due to the new time change, and partly due to new characters "taking over" the show (see next paragraph). Because of the audience erosion, the move to 90-minute installments is generally regarded as a failure.</p>
<p>In the final months of the 90 minute experiment, many characters debuted on <i>Another World</i> and interacted with Iris, as she planned to move to <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston%2C_Texas_c0fa.html" title="Houston, Texas">Houston, Texas</a> (and to her own series, <i>Texas</i>). In addition to the characters introduced solely to <i>Another World</i> who did not catch on, <i>Another World</i> viewers also saw characters for fleeting moments who were going to be moved to <i>Texas</i> in the long-term anyway. The viewers who defected from <i>Another World</i> either followed McKinsey to <i>Texas</i>, or tuned out entirely due to confusion, as their favorite characters were being showcased less to make room for the short-term <i>Texas</i> storyline.</p>

Rachel (Victoria Wyndham) learned a lot from her loving husband, Mackenzie Cory (Douglass Watson).</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Mac and Rachel had their own marital troubles, mostly regarding Rachel's decision to work full-time as a sculptress. Rachel did not want to pursue a career at first, thinking she could simply live off Mac's earnings as a publisher, but Mac encouraged her to find work in a field that interested her. When she found that she was very good at sculpting, it took up more and more of her time, even after giving birth to their daughter, Amanda, in 1978. After Rachel falsely accused Mac of infidelity (Mac was unfaithful years before, but this time he wasn't), Mac became involved with his secretary, Janice Frame (now played by Christine Jones), and in 1979, Rachel asked for a divorce. To crack a scheme that Rachel suspected Janice was spearheading, Rachel slept with photographer Mitch Blake (<a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Gray_Espy_c4f2.html" title="William Gray Espy">William Gray Espy</a>). The long-running Mac/Rachel/Janice/Mitch storyline carried on for a year until it culminated in a scene taped on <a href="../../../l/o/c/Location_shooting.html" title="Location shooting">location</a> in <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Croix_ff69.html" title="St. Croix">St. Croix</a>, in which Janice Frame's plan to kill Mac and acquire his estate was found out by Rachel. After a scuffle involving a knife, the two women fell into a swimming pool, and Rachel came out alive, having killed Janice.</p>
<p>Mac and Rachel were married again, but Rachel was saddened to find that she was pregnant â€” with Mitch's child. She was prepared to keep the secret until Mitch was "murdered." Rachel was forced to admit on the stand that the child (Matthew) in question was Mitch's. She was then sentenced to eight years in prison for Mitch's murder, and Mac started divorce proceedings, all the while believing that something wasn't right. Following his intuition, he tracked down Mitch, who was alive and didn't remember any events surrounding his supposed death.</p>
<p>In the end, Mac freed Rachel from prison and even dropped the divorce, but he was always jealous of Mitch; by this time he had returned to Bay City to be closer to his son. In the end, it could not be worked out and Mac and Rachel divorced a second time. Steve Frame came back from Australia, complete with daughter Diana (played by <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Rose_Brooks_b923.html" title="Anne Rose Brooks">Anne Rose Brooks</a>) in 1981 (it was revealed that he did not die in 1975; he also received a new look, thanks to <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Canary_1551.html" title="David Canary">David Canary</a> taking over the role). Steve and Rachel reminisced about their old love affair and even planned a wedding, after Rachel nearly lost Steve after a <a href="../../../c/o/l/Column.html" title="Column">column</a> pinned him to the ground inside a building slated for demolition. On their wedding day in February 1983, a car accident claimed Steve's life â€” for good. Rachel survived, and Mac told Rachel how much he loved her. A double wedding was planned in the summer of 1983, with Mac's son Sandy (<a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Rich_%28American_actor%29_9316.html" title="Christopher Rich (American actor)">Christopher Rich</a>) and his fiancÃ©e Blaine Ewing (<a href="../../../l/a/u/Laura_Malone_f478.html" title="Laura Malone">Laura Malone</a>).</p>

<p>As the show went through the 1980s, the Love family became more prominent, at the expense of the core Matthews family. In 1982, Beverly Penberthy was written out of the show.</p>

While these characters proved to be fan favorites, the importance of the Cory family on the show was shaken when Douglass Watson unexpectedly died while on vacation in Maine in the spring of 1989. With a heavy heart, Rachel and her family buried Mac on the <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_16.html" title="June 16">June 16</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> episode.

Although actress Victoria Wyndham tried to fill the void left by Watson's lack of presence, she ended up passing the central role of the show to <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jensen_Buchanan_1289.html" title="Jensen Buchanan">Jensen Buchanan</a>, who, by the early 1990s, had taken over for <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Heche_8015.html" title="Anne Heche">Anne Heche</a> as Vicky Hudson.</p>

<p>As the show moved into the 1990s, Felicia and Mitch got a divorce due to both of them straying from their marriage vows. Felicia found the love of her life in the form of Lucas Castigliano (<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Aprea_5e21.html" title="John Aprea">John Aprea</a>), who hunted her down in an attempt to find the daughter she gave up for adoption. He ended up finding his daughter and bringing her to town, but in true soap opera fashion, the reveal didn't come out until a very big gala.</p>
<p>Felicia and the woman in question, Lorna Devon (<a href="../../../a/l/i/Alicia_Coppola_632c.html" title="Alicia Coppola">Alicia Coppola</a>) had become enemies fast, especially after Lorna went behind the scenes at Felicia's talk show and switched live footage with a videotape of a pornographic video Felicia's adoptive daughter Jenna Norris (<a href="../../../a/l/l/Alla_Korot_3f19.html" title="Alla Korot">Alla Korot</a>) had unwittingly made. Felicia and Lorna ended up repairing their relationship, especially after Lucas's death.</p>
<p>Jenna found true love with rocker Dean Frame (<a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricky_Paull_Goldin_4b24.html" title="Ricky Paull Goldin">Ricky Paull Goldin</a>); their happiness, and Dean's success as a rock star, was chronicled in the nighttime special <i><a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer_Desire_1207.html" title="Summer Desire">Summer Desire</a></i>. After Kathleen was pronounced dead in a plane crash, Cass grew close to Reginald Love's daughter Nicole (by now, she was played by Anne Howard).

She was convicted of the crime and sentenced to prison time, and she was never heard from again. <a name="The_final_years" id="The_final_years"></a></p>

<p>The show was renewed in 1993, but the ratings still weren't good. The odds weren't in the show's favor that it would be renewed again in 1999. Early in 1995, news at the top signaled a change in executive producer. <a href="../../../j/i/l/Jill_Farren_Phelps_247b.html" title="Jill Farren Phelps">Jill Farren Phelps</a>, who had won Emmy awards for her work on <i><a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Barbara_%28TV_series%29_af16.html" title="Santa Barbara (TV series)">Santa Barbara</a></i>, was given the job. Veteran cast members were fired; both cast members over the age of 55 (<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Berjer_4fdf.html" title="Barbara Berjer">Barbara Berjer</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Hedison_259e.html" title="David Hedison">David Hedison</a>) had their contracts terminated, in an attempt to move the show in a more youthful direction. Show matriarch Rachel Cory Hutchins was placed in a storyline involving an evil countess, Justine Duvalier, who was a former lover of Hedison's recently-axed character, Spencer Harrison. The Justine storyline was panned by the press as being worthy of a <i><a href="../../../m/y/s/Mystery_Science_Theater_3000_b5cb.html" title="Mystery Science Theater 3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></i> level of ridicule. While in a scuffle, Grant Harrison killed his brother Ryan (played by fan favorite <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Michael_Valley_d2a5.html" title="Paul Michael Valley">Paul Michael Valley</a>), causing Justine to be shoved in front of a train. Justine did not die, and she caused more terror before finally being finished by Carl Hutchins and his letter opener. Actress Victoria Wyndham was quoted as liking the storyline at first, but after it was played out, she stated that she wished she had never appeared in it.</p>
<p>Budget cuts caused Phelps to institute a serial killer storyline, culminating in the gruesome murder of another fan favorite, Frankie (<a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Barrett_b9f2.html" title="Alice Barrett">Alice Barrett</a>). The story had actually called for Donna (<a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Stuart_bd50.html" title="Anna Stuart">Anna Stuart</a>) to be offed, but massive fan protest caused Phelps to rewrite the episodes. Phelps decided to then kill off either Frankie or Paulina, and when a focus group responded lukewarm to Frankie but warmer to Paulina, Phelps gave the greenlight to axe Frankie. However, this caused another massive rampage of upset protest from loyal viewers of the show and fans of Frankie, and Phelps quickly asked then-head writer Margaret DePriest to re-write Frankie's exit so that the character would at least still live. DePriest, eager to satisfy her wish to see Cass return to his former rogue ways, vehemently refused and left Frankie's death as written.</p>

<p>Rachel gave birth to twins, even though she was well into her fifties.

Lila Roberts (<a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_Peluso_da4e.html" title="Lisa Peluso">Lisa Peluso</a>) ended up bedding Matthew Cory and having his baby before falling in love with Cass.

<p>In 1999, <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> decided not to renew <i>Another World</i>. Many reasons abounded for <i>Another World'</i>s cancellation, one of the more notable events occurring in the summer of 1998; the then-<a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> NBC affiliate <a href="../../../k/r/o/KRON_6f8f.html" title="KRON">KRON</a>, one of the highest-rated in the nation, dropped the show off its schedule altogether, knocking it out of two million homes. Rumors abounded that <i>Days of Our Lives</i> might be the serial dropped, as renewal talks between NBC and <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_Pictures_Television_801b.html" title="Columbia Pictures Television">Columbia Pictures Television</a> were going poorly at the time. At the eleventh hour, <i>Days of Our Lives</i> was renewed, and it was the fate of <i>Another World</i> that was sealed. Its final episode aired the last full week in June.</p>
<p>After a series of 35th anniversary episodes, Rachel reminisced with Carl, remarked, "All's well that ends well," and the show ended with a shot of Mac Cory's picture.</p>
<p>Ironically, Irna Phillips' original plan of crossovers with <i>As The World Turns</i> was finally realized -- after <i>Another World</i> was cancelled. Another World characters Lila (<a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_Peluso_da4e.html" title="Lisa Peluso">Lisa Peluso</a>), Cass (<a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Schnetzer_1347.html" title="Stephen Schnetzer">Stephen Schnetzer</a>), Vicky (<a href="../../../j/e/n/Jensen_Buchanan_1289.html" title="Jensen Buchanan">Jensen Buchanan</a>), Donna (<a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Stuart_bd50.html" title="Anna Stuart">Anna Stuart</a>), and Jake (<a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Eplin_dbcd.html" title="Tom Eplin">Tom Eplin</a>) all moved into ATWT storylines. By 2002, Vicky and Jake had been killed off violently, and the crossover experiment had, for the most part, ended. Schnetzer continues to make occasional appearances, as his character of Cass is used as a "visiting lawyer" in As the World Turns trials.</p>
<p>The show was commemorated in print twice in 1999. <i>Another World, the 35th Anniversary Celebration</i>, by Julie Poll, was a coffee-table style book chronicling the show's history on- and off-screen. <i>Another World</i> was the last of all the long-running <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soap_opera.html" title="Soap opera">soap opera</a> programs of the time to be preserved in this way. The other book was decidedly different; <i>The Ultimate Another World Trivia Book</i>, by Gerard J. Waggett, listed several juicy tidbits about the show's stars and what happened behind-the-scenes. Many fans have treated Poll's book as they would a high school yearbook, getting <i>Another World</i> performers to sign their autographs in the book along with messages of appreciation or thanks for the fans' continued support in watching the program.</p>
<p>In July 2003, <a href="../../../s/o/a/SOAPnet_b2e5.html" title="SOAPnet">SOAPnet</a>, an American satellite channel, started rerunning old <i>Another World</i> episodes from <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_1987.html" title="July 1987">July 1987</a>. <i>The Another World Reunion</i> aired on the channel on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_24.html" title="October 24">October 24</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>. Hosted by <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linda_Dano_bd07.html" title="Linda Dano">Linda Dano</a>, the special program reunited fan favorites such as <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Schnetzer_1347.html" title="Stephen Schnetzer">Stephen Schnetzer</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandra_Ferguson_44bd.html" title="Sandra Ferguson">Sandra Ferguson</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Aprea_5e21.html" title="John Aprea">John Aprea</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alicia_Coppola_632c.html" title="Alicia Coppola">Alicia Coppola</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kale_Browne_a361.html" title="Kale Browne">Kale Browne</a>, and <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellen_Wheeler_012e.html" title="Ellen Wheeler">Ellen Wheeler</a>. On the special, Dano interviewed the members of the assembled cast, one by one, interspersed with classic <i>Another World</i> clips. Before and after commercial breaks, <i>Another World</i> quiz questions were posed to the audience at home, and audience members told the viewers at home their favorite <i>Another World</i> moments, supplemented with clips from the actual episodes (for example, one viewer said her favorite <i>Another World</i> moment was from 1980, in which Rachel, on the stand for Mitch's murder, was forced to tell Mac that Matthew was not his child. Another viewer cited Ryan marrying Vicky while in Heaven). This special was nominated for a <a href="../../../d/a/y/Daytime_Emmy_0337.html" title="Daytime Emmy">Daytime Emmy</a> for Outstanding Special Class Special in 2004.</p>
<p>SOAPnet will remove the show starting April 9, 2007. <a href="http://www.sitcomsonline.com/blog/2007/03/tv-land-upfront-2007-original-series.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sitcomsonline.com/blog/2007/03/tv-land-upfront-2007-original-series.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> SOAPnet was airing <i>Another World</i> episodes from April 1991. Another World has found a whole new set of fans from the SOAPnet reruns, as many people never saw the episodes the first time around.</p>
<p>In 2006, Procter &amp; Gamble began making several of its soap operas available, a few episodes at a time, through <a href="../../../a/m/e/America_Online_d3b0.html" title="America Online">America Online</a>'s AOL Video service, downloadable free of charge.

<p>While AW touched on important topics like the ones described in the article linked below, the show, for the most part, was never plot-driven. Unlike other popular soaps of the day, like <i>Days of Our Lives</i> and <i>General Hospital</i>, AW was written with characters as the primary focus, and not situations. This formula was maintained until the final years of the show when a switch to plot-driven stories, dictated by then-executive producer <a href="../../../j/i/l/Jill_Farren_Phelps_247b.html" title="Jill Farren Phelps">Jill Farren Phelps</a>, failed.</p>
<p>AW was the first in many aspects as well: it was the first soap opera to talk about abortion in 1964 when such subjects were taboo. It was the first soap opera to do a crossover with the character of Mike Bauer ("Guiding Light") coming from Springfield to Bay City. It was the first to go to one hour and then to 90 minutes and then back to an hour. It was the first soap to launch two spinoffs ("Somerset" and "Texas") as well as an indirect one ("Lovers and Friends", which would be re-named "For Richer For Poorer").</p>
<p>AW was also the first soap opera with a theme song to chart on the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billboard_Hot_100_a584.html" title="Billboard Hot 100">Billboard Hot 100</a> "(You Take Me Away To) Another World" by <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_Gayle_654d.html" title="Crystal Gayle">Crystal Gayle</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Morris_28b1.html" title="Gary Morris">Gary Morris</a>, in 1987.</p>

<p>For most of a 15-year period between <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965_in_television.html" title="1965 in television">1965</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980_in_television.html" title="1980 in television">1980</a>, <i>Another World</i> was NBC's highest-rated soap. During that time, NBC ran a 90-minute soap block consisting of <i><a href="../../../d/a/y/Days_of_Our_Lives_fe55.html" title="Days of Our Lives">Days of Our Lives</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Doctors_1328.html" title="The Doctors">The Doctors</a></i> and <i>AW</i>, all of which enjoyed great ratings and critical success before declining at the end of the decade. During the 1980s, NBC dropped <i>The Doctors</i> and added <i><a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Barbara_%28TV_series%29_af16.html" title="Santa Barbara (TV series)">Santa Barbara</a></i>, which somewhat improved the network's fortunes for a time, before declining again.</p>

<p><i>Another World</i> did not take long to establish itself as NBC's highest-rating daytime drama, although it was still behind the then-dominant CBS lineup which would usually occupy the first six places on the ratings chart. Making its debut at 3 p.m. Eastern/2 Central, <i>AW</i> slowly chipped away at ABC's <i><a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Hospital_da91.html" title="General Hospital">General Hospital</a></i> and CBS' daytime version of <i><a href="../../../t/o/_/To_Tell_the_Truth_0c2a.html" title="To Tell the Truth">To Tell the Truth</a>.</i> Its efforts resulted in a swift rise to second place in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967_in_television.html" title="1967 in television">1967</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/6/1968_in_television.html" title="1968 in television">1968</a>; the show would remain in the upper end of the ratings chart until <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978_in_television.html" title="1978 in television">1978</a>. CBS later tried <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Secret_Storm_3305.html" title="The Secret Storm">The Secret Storm</a>,</i> a soap that reputedly served as the model for <i>AW,</i> against it, but to no avail.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/o/Another_World_%28TV_series%29_9fdc.html" title="Edit section: The 1970s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The 1970s</span></h3>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_30.html" title="March 30">March 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>, <i>AW</i> became the first daytime soap to produce a spinoff series, <i><a href="../../../s/o/m/Somerset_%28TV_series%29_1c91.html" title="Somerset (TV series)">Somerset</a>,</i> which ran until <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976_in_television.html" title="1976 in television">1976</a>. For <i>Somerset's</i> first year, the two shows shared the same branding, with the mother show titled <i>Another World in Bay City</i> and the daughter show <i>Another World in Somerset.</i> NBC and P&amp;G discontinued this after a year, and <i>AW</i> dropped the reference to its location.</p>
<p>With the arrival of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harding_Lemay_28d7.html" title="Harding Lemay">Harding Lemay</a>, <i>Another World</i> would consolidate its place as not only the most popular and critically-acclaimed soap on NBC, but one of the highest-rated soaps of the decade. Between <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973_in_television.html" title="1973 in television">1973</a> and 1978, it consistently attained second place in the ratings chart and tied with <i><a href="../../../a/s/_/As_The_World_Turns_8c7d.html" title="As The World Turns">As The World Turns</a></i> for first place twice--in 1973-<a href="../../../1/9/7/1974_in_television.html" title="1974 in television">74</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977_in_television.html" title="1977 in television">1977</a>-78. The earlier triumph was no mean feat when one considers that CBS put up its star game <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Price_is_Right_eae9.html" title="The Price is Right">The Price is Right</a></i> against it for two years.</p>
<p>When the one-hour 10th Anniversary special in spring <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a> proved a massive ratings success, NBC and P&amp;G made the decision to expand to 60 minutes permanently on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_6.html" title="January 6">January 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>, replacing the original version of the game show <i><a href="../../../j/e/o/Jeopardy.html" title="Jeopardy">Jeopardy</a>,</i> in a scheduling shuffle with the in-house-produced <i><a href="../../../h/o/w/How_to_Survive_a_Marriage_d45e.html" title="How to Survive a Marriage">How to Survive a Marriage</a>.</i> The show took over the entire 3-4 p.m./2-3 Central period, the latter part of which witnessed it beating back CBS' huge <i><a href="../../../m/a/t/Match_Game_308e.html" title="Match Game">Match Game</a>,</i> then daytime's most popular program.</p>
<p>However, starting in 1978, <i>AW</i> began to experience an erosion in ratings caused mainly by the surge in popularity of <i><a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Hospital_da91.html" title="General Hospital">General Hospital</a></i>. <i>Another World</i> fell from a first-place tie in 1978 to eighth in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979_in_television.html" title="1979 in television">1979</a> (a drop from 8.6 to 7.5), but remained NBC's highest-rated soap. Despite the fall in ratings, <i>AW</i> became the first, and thus far only, soap to expand to 90 minutes, a move that proved unsuccessful--it remained in eighth place in 1979-<a href="../../../1/9/8/1980_in_television.html" title="1980 in television">80</a>.</p>

<p>Although it is widely thought that <i>AW's</i> expansion to 90 minutes was a cause of ratings erosion, the decision to expand the show was made at a time when its ratings (and that of NBC's other soaps) were already in steady decline. It should be noted that even during the period when Another World ran daily for 90 minutes, it remained NBC's highest-rated soap, as it had been for a decade. In the second half of 1980, after the show returned to 60 minutes, <i>AW</i> and fellow NBC soaps <i>Days</i> and, most dramatically, <i>The Doctors,</i> experienced a collapse in ratings from which NBC's daytime soap lineup never fully recovered. It would not be until <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984_in_television.html" title="1984 in television">1984</a> that both <i>Days</i> and <i>AW</i> would recover some of their lost ground.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/o/Another_World_%28TV_series%29_9fdc.html" title="Edit section: The 1980s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The 1980s</span></h3>
<p>It is possible that the 90-minute format was intended to be temporary, with the added time used to prepare a storyline for a spinoff, <i><a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_%28TV_series%29_460d.html" title="Texas (TV series)">Texas</a></i> in 1980. For upon its debut, the mother show contracted to 60 minutes again, this time moving to 2/1 Central, where it remained for the rest of its run. <i>Texas,</i> starring the hugely popular <a href="../../../b/e/v/Beverlee_McKinsey_262e.html" title="Beverlee McKinsey">Beverlee McKinsey</a> and attempting to cash in on the <i><a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_%28TV_series%29_fce9.html" title="Dallas (TV series)">Dallas</a></i> craze, while itself not a success, caused further erosion of <i>AW's</i> viewership, to the point that it was no longer NBC's highest-rated soap, losing that position to <i>Days</i> (which itself, along with the rest of NBC's daytime soap lineup, was in ratings trouble). <i>AW</i> fell from eighth to as low as 11th in the ratings chart, and by <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981_in_television.html" title="1981 in television">1981</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/8/1982_in_television.html" title="1982 in television">82</a> it sunk so low in the <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neilsen_ratings.html" title="Neilsen ratings">Neilsens</a> as 4.7 (a drop of 3.9 points in four seasons). Much like <i>General Hospital</i> won the 3/2 slot for ABC, <i><a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Life_to_Live_efbc.html" title="One Life to Live">One Life to Live</a></i> came in strong at 2/1, with CBS attempting to get its new <i><a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitol_%28TV_series%29_9907.html" title="Capitol (TV series)">Capitol</a></i> off the ground during that period.</p>
<p>After five years of sharply declining ratings, <i>AW</i> experienced something of a mini-revival, and for the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983_in_television.html" title="1983 in television">1983</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/8/1984_in_television.html" title="1984 in television">84</a> season, the show jumped to ninth place and 5.6 (compared with 10th place and 4.8 in 1982-83). It remained in ninth place through the decade (occasionally moving up to eighth), pulling in generally stable numbers against <i>OLTL</i> and its P&amp;G sister <i>As the World Turns.</i></p>

<p>In common with other daytime soaps, <i>AW</i> experienced a gradual erosion of viewership but, amazingly enough given its turbulent history, held on to ninth place on the ratings chart until the end of its run. While it never showed signs of moving up through this period, it was for most part never in danger of falling to last place. This was not enough for NBC, however, and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999_in_television.html" title="1999 in television">1999</a> marked the end of what has likely been the network's most successful daytime drama ever, a show that amassed a run of 35 years.</p>
