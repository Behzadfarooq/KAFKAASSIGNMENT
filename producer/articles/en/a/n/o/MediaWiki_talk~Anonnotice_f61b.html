<p>Upon request, Robchurch has created a version of the sitenotice only viewable by anonymous users (ie, most of our readers; the target audience for requesting donations), at <a href="../../../a/n/o/MediaWiki%7EAnonnotice_ab21.html" title="MediaWiki:Anonnotice">MediaWiki:Anonnotice</a> (not yet live). I'll ask the CFO and/or board members about this, but I think one of them originally suggested the idea. So, we would be blanking this one, and putting some form of it in the anon-only version.

<li>Well, both Jimbo and Mav have said that they don't expect editors to donate, since they already donate their time. Assuming that most of the non-editing readers are anons, this would be the best solution that would both target the largest audience while not causing an annoyance for regular editors (see any of this page for the annoyance I speak of&#160;:)). — <small><sub><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#444444">0918</font></a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left:-24px; margin-right:-24px;"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="#222222">BRIAN</font></b></a></span></sup> • 2006-01-16 02:25</small></li>

<li>Link more prominat in the side bar. Makeing the wikipedia logo link to the donations page rather than the main page. Looking to increase the sucess of fundraiseing drives. Getting mechendise produced by anyone other than cafepress (both pennny arcade and slahdot use thinkgeek I don't know what terms they would offer wikipedia though).

<li>Thanks to Rob for creating the possibility of this compromise. I think showing this to non-logged in users, and keeping just the donate link in the sidebar for logged-in users, should definitely be trialed. I don't want to make a permanent decision before we've seen the financial effects of this, so it should be done as an experiment which can be reviewed after a few weeks. If the anon version is used all the time, I would still like the sitenotice to be used during actual fundraising drives since it's important for everyone to be aware of these. Please keep whatever goes in the anon version tasteful. I'd hate to see it become an over-the-top demand for money just because regular users don't have to put up with it. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 02:37, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Yay, this is great! Despite my criticism of this notice, and my continuing concerns that permanently asking for money is what beggars on the street do with little success and much damage to their reputation, at least this version is properly targetted.

<dd>Great job, guys! Thanks! I agree with Angela, though, that this should probably be just a test at first - in my opinion, registered users would be more likely to donate than unregistered users, but I guess we'll see. I doubt this is possible, but is there a way to see (or perhaps ask?) when someone donates whether or not s/he is a registered user?

<p>I tried to modify <a href="../../../m/o/n/MediaWiki%7EMonobook.css_fb19.html" title="MediaWiki:Monobook.css">Mediawiki:Monobook.css</a> to avoid pushing down the entire header line with the notice, as I find that to be quite tacky. Despite tests showing it worked for IE and Netscape, my method (setting a negative bottom margin on #siteNotice) was quickly reverted by a firefox user who said it failed for him. Regardless, I would still like to talk about finding a way to not offset the header line just for the sake of the notice. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 04:33, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I would generally agree; the problem is that in Firefox, the entire page moves up 25 pixels, and the header text was overlapping the tabs, making it impossible to click them. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> <a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">(talk)</a> 21:22, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>What happens when page names are so long that they overlap the notice? — <small><sub><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#444444">0918</font></a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left:-24px; margin-right:-24px;"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="#222222">BRIAN</font></b></a></span></sup> • 2006-01-16 22:09</small>
<ul>
<li>I don't think they overlap - the sitenotice (or anonnotice) is higher up than the title. For instance, log out (in order to see the anonnotice) and check out this wonderful article: <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donaudampfschiffahrtselektrizit%C3%A4tenhauptbetriebswerkbauunterbeamtengesellschaft.html" title="Donaudampfschiffahrtselektrizitätenhauptbetriebswerkbauunterbeamtengesellschaft">Donaudampfschiffahrtselektrizitätenhauptbetriebswerkbauunterbeamtengesellschaft</a>.

<li>Also check out <a href="../../../r/i/n/Rinderkennzeichnungs-_und_Rindfleischetikettierungs%C3%BCberwachungsaufgaben%C3%BCbertragungsgesetz_3c28.html" title="Rinderkennzeichnungs- und Rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz">Rinderkennzeichnungs- und Rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz</a> - the title is broken up into two lines (because of the space, I think) and the anonnotice is still placed higher up.

<ul>
<li>They don't overlap at present because of that extra whitespace. My proposed solution to the extra whitespace (that failed because Firefox and IE can't agree on how to render CSS) would have placed them on the same line and then they would have overlapped in cases such as you cite. I would still like to do something, i.e. higher/lower/etc., to avoid injecting the blank space between the page title and the top of the page, especially since it now seems that the notice will be semi-permanent. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 01:02, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would suggest leaving it as is for a week, to try and gauge how much of a difference there is in focusing on anons only.

<li>Jimmy's appeal has obviously led to an increase in donations. My concern is that in continuing to use his appeal now, when we really needn't, users of Wikipedia will be less responsive to a future personal appeal. Shouldn't we just direct readers to the donation page rather than over-use the appeal?--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 04:39, 16 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The appeal has led to a big increase in donations. We are still very much in need of funds (if we plan on lasting for more than a year). I think this appeal is a one-time thing, since a second appeal would look kind of odd, as you suggeted. So, we should try to milk this thing for all we can. The next time we're likely to see such an appeal is when the site is going to shut down out of lack of funds. — <small><sub><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#444444">0918</font></a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left:-24px; margin-right:-24px;"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="#222222">BRIAN</font></b></a></span></sup> • 2006-01-16 04:43</small>

<p>CJ, your concern is one that is held widely. However a small number of very vocal people - e.g. Brian - are choosing to ignore these concerns. You are, of course, absolutely right, but I for one am tired of battling those who cannot see other's points of view (and seem to pull stuff out of thin air, like the statement "The next time we're likely to see such an appeal is when the site is going to shut down out of lack of funds", which is pure conjecture). <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan100_0edd.html" title="User:Dan100">Dan100</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDan100_803a.html" title="User talk:Dan100">Talk</a>) 09:31, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>A bit overdramatic, don't you think? I only suggested the wording remain for a while so we could see what sort of an effect switching from all-users to anon-only would have. I really doubt that Jimbo is going to regularly put out such desperate appeals. The only time I could see him putting out another one is when we are really in need of funding, such as.... when the site is about to go down. — <small><sub><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#444444">0918</font></a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left:-24px; margin-right:-24px;"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="#222222">BRIAN</font></b></a></span></sup> • 2006-01-17 14:12</small></li>

<p>Maybe we can decide on a lower limit.

<li>You confuse the content on Wikipedia vs Wikipedia website and project itself. True, the GFDL means that that content will remain free. But lots of donations are needed to keep the website at wikipedia.org free of advertisements, going down (can't be free if you are not online), or even pay for view type solutions..22: So is it not dishonest and you should be ashamed for ascribing bad faith.

<li>At some point this exponential growth in traffic (that has been going on for years) has got to saturate. It actually looked like it had started to before the whole Seigenthaler gave a big kick in exposure. If you had asked me a year ago, I would have said it would be many years before we made it into the top 10 websites, while right now it looks like it could in fact be soon. The top site on the web (Yahoo) only gets about 25 times the traffic we do right now.

<li>Well if you don't believe it, then don't be citing it all willy-nilly like you did above. We cleared ~$320,000 in the last drive, and we are apparently budgeting for continued 85% traffic growth per quarter. If donations can be made to grow at that same 85% rate per quarter then you'd clear $3M after 4 quarters, which makes that number somewhat less scary.

<li>According to Mav, the increase in donations has always been slower than the increase in traffic. I don't know by how much.

<li>hmmm run a comparison of donations against database server hits then.

<li>You're still missing the point. Yes, the requirements will drop, but they will still be higher than now, and most likely still increase much faster than donations. Simply sitting back and hoping for more donations is not going to fix this.

<li>In fact they do. Zero growth would mean that server expenditure would be reduced to whatever needed to be replaced. That could quite easyerly reduce the costs by a couple of orders of magnitude. Now growth isn't going to drop to zero but I suspect that either the 2006 budget is a massive overestimate or the 2007 budget will be a lot closer to 2 million than 20.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 23:00, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

Actually, the only projection done for 2007 is based on a model I created in October 2004. That model predicted that if we continued growing at the same rate of exponential growth as we were in the 2 years previous to that month, that we should expect to spend about 10 million dollars on hardware in 2007 (adjusted for Moors Law). However, our growth appears to be even more strongly exponential now than it was then. A more recent projection I made of PayPal donations indicates we should expect to bring in 1 to 2 million dollars per month by December of this year. So that makes the 10 million dollar figure not seem so scary. Much more systematic projections are needed and a consistent source of traffic data is also needed (the only one I can think of is Alexa&#160;; our server logs are an inconstant mess for the time periods we need to check). Oh, and so far it does not appear that we have felt any effects of saturation of our potential Internet audience. I do imagine we will start to see some of those effects as we approach the popularity of the top five websites on the Internet. So any projection we do on current growth rate will need to be adjusted because of that. My October 2004 model did not consider saturation plateau effects. BTW, by ‘plateauing’ I mean that we would only follow the much weaker exponential growth of the Internet itself instead of our past and current insanely exponential growth. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a> 18:41, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

Even with January's successful fundraiser, we came in at just under $300k for that month. — <small><sub><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#444444">0918</font></a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left:-24px; margin-right:-24px;"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="#222222">BRIAN</font></b></a></span></sup> • 2006-02-2 18:51</small>

<li>Via very rough analysis.&#160;:) Just input the total PayPal revenue from each month minus the current and first ones (both incomplete datasets) <a href="http://fundraising.wikimedia.org/ongoing/index.php" class="external text" title="http://fundraising.wikimedia.org/ongoing/index.php" rel="nofollow">here</a> into a spreadsheet program and then add exponential and logarithmic trend lines. Also note that our Q4 2004 fundraiser brought in about $50,000. We have exponential growth in donations as well as traffic. I'm less fearful now than I was previously that our traffic growth would eventually outstrip our donation growth. But much better analysis needs to be done to confirm that. -- mav</li>

<p><br />
killing indent Ok lets consider the following logic:</p>
<ul>
<li>At any given time there if a finite amount of traffic on the internet</li>
<li>This traffic grows at a slower rate than trafic going to wikipedia</li>
<li>There is a maxium number of hits per internet user</li>
<li>The biggest coast asscoated with servers is buying them</li>
<li>Servers have a life expectancy of more than one year.</li>
</ul>
<p>From this we can conclude that wikipedia's growth is not sustainable at anything like it's current rate for an indefinate length of time. We can also conclude that server costs will fall then stabilise when this happens.</p>
<p>So the problem becomes one of modling the various fall off rates. This is tricky in that there are no websites we can usefuly compare ourselves with. Still we can make a start.</p>
<p>The upperbound is probably yahoo we are not realisticaly going to overtake it so if we modle the worst case in cost per quater (no slowdown untill we hit saturation point) we end up with a situation where the cost for 2006 goes down to around $6million. Remeber that is from traffic greater than yahoo so it really isn't going to happen. If we settle for half yahoo's traffic we end up with a budget of maybe $3million. That includes a million for server replacements.</p>

<dd>Actually if you think about it, what a <i>hypothetically completed Wikipedia</i> represents is what a substantial portion of people come to the internet for anyway. Search engines only represent a chance to find what you want, while in a "finished" Wikipedia it would be there and be comprehensive. Now we all know we're <i>very</i> far from that, but the point is Wikipedia could eventually outstrip Yahoo, et al if the content here continues to improve. What Wikipedia's traffic limits are is the percentage of web uses that are for seeking reference information. The one's that are for social networking, real time info such as stock quotes, etc are not Wikipedia's potential market. So I don't know what that number is, but it's a substantial portion of web traffic. Of that, what does Yahoo pull in now? I think it's not even a percent of monthly overall internet traffic. This is all pie in the sky, but the point is Wikipedia's potential traffic is well larger than what any other single sites currently have. After the rambling, I disagree with the wording change, because without funding Wikimedia won't be able to support a free Wikipedia, and free is a very powerful motivator that we need to focus in on for bringing in donations. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 16:45, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yahoo.com has a daily reach of 296,000 per million, which is 29.6%. Wikipedia's daily reach is 35,550 or 3.56%. In other words, on a typical day, about a third of all people on the Internet visit Yahoo.com and about 3.5% visit Wikipedia. Yet Wikipedia.org is growing much faster than Yahoo.com in terms of reach. So the gap is narrowing.

<dd>29% visit the site according to Alexa's numbers, but those same people also visit many other sites, so Yahoo's share of overall traffic is much less than 29%. In other words the reach numbers for all web sites total many times 100% of internet users. Still I was way off on my guesses for the numbers. Then again, myspace.com has been growing as fast as Wikipedia so far.

Just so you know, the position is controlled in {{<a href="../../../s/p/o/Template%7ESpoken_Wikipedia_34ad.html" title="Template:Spoken Wikipedia">Spoken Wikipedia</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../s/p/o/Template%7ESpoken_Wikipedia_boilerplate_ef0e.html" title="Template:Spoken Wikipedia boilerplate">Spoken Wikipedia boilerplate</a>}}. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 07:53, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, that was my fault. I put the speaker where I did so that it was just to the left of the star for featured articles. I didn't notice a problem on any of the pages I looked at, because I was always logged in when I was looking at spoken articles. <a href="../../../t/_/j/User%7ET_J_McKenzie_be49.html" title="User:T J McKenzie">T J McKenzie</a> 10:28, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you have evidence (beyond conjecture) that this does more "harm" than "good", let me know, but those words are pretty subjective, so right now you could mean almost anything. — <small><sub><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#444444">0918</font></a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left:-24px; margin-right:-24px;"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="#222222">BRIAN</font></b></a></span></sup> • 2006-02-20 14:06</small></dd>

<p>Someone was trying to fix a similar problem with the featured article star by shifting the text over to the left with blank spaces. Maybe you could just add in more nbsp spaces into this notice? — <small><sub><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#444444">0918</font></a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left:-24px; margin-right:-24px;"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="#222222">BRIAN</font></b></a></span></sup> • 2006-02-20 14:04</small></p>

<dd>The position of the icon should now be only at {{<a href="../../../s/p/o/Template%7ESpoken_Wikipedia_boilerplate_ef0e.html" title="Template:Spoken Wikipedia boilerplate">Spoken Wikipedia boilerplate</a>}}. By the way, its current position conflicts with the line under the title in some browsers. It seems that this will be the case no matter what height we put it at. The only "safe" height appears to be the same height as the featured article star and this notice. <a href="../../../t/_/j/User%7ET_J_McKenzie_be49.html" title="User:T J McKenzie">T J McKenzie</a> 07:12, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Your donations" is plural, therefore it requires a plural verb. "Keep" is the conjugated plural, third-person verb.
