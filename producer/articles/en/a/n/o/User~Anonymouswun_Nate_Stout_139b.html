	    <p>Nate Stout is an author/poet and well known for singing voice. just be patient</p>
<p><br />
Born Nathanael Calder Stout on April 2, 1988, to Daniel D. and Cynthia Lee Stout. The fifth of seven, Nate had four sisters and two brothers to teach him the ways of the land. Although he would never tell you this, he hasn't said "I love you" to his family members since before his senior year in high school. Although quite the pessimist himself, he loves helping people see the good in life even if he is blind to it. He once told me he makes people laugh to improve their day because he knows what it's like to be miserable. Known to family and friends as a clown, his comedic genius is only recognized by those close to him. An aspiring author and actor Nate has been in 8 musicals, several Shakespeare productions, a handful of student directed plays and a few other high school productions including the lead in a student film. Even with all this, his only true high school play was As You like It, it being the only play he was in while attending high school that was directed by the drama teacher/director.</p>
