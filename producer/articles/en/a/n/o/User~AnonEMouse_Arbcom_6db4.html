<ul>
<li>Answered questions quickly</li>
<li>Minor language issues ("It maybe unfair to Fred Bauder who obliged to do more work than other admins") but he is understandable. But more non-English-first arbcom members are a good thing.</li>
<li>Proud of <a href="../../../r/f/s/WP%7ERFSL_0992.html" title="WP:RFSL">WP:RFSL</a>, but that hasn't gotten any feedback except a merge request. On the other hand, he is actively trying to do something that could be important.
<ul>
<li>Also note minor spelling and grammar issues there. Probably the most serious was the misspelling of "Wikipedia" in the <i>page name</i>. (moved Wikpedia:Request for solutions to Wikipedia:Request for solutions: spelling issue)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>My Q5, decision disagreed with, seemed to find one that went against a friend, rather than one that brought up larger issues. From evidence, did seem to be overblown, but still.</li>

<ul>
<li>Excellent evidence presentation in several arbcom cases.</li>
<li>Didn't seem to read my questions very carefully, even though claiming "I’ve looked over the questions everyone is asking". Q1, didn't understand what power was being asked about (everyone else understood). Q4 seems to think I have an agenda. Q8, didn't take the clear hint to give a reference to an important and rather controversial and famous arbcom case.</li>
<li>Q5 had a good answer where he actually changed the course of a bad ruling.</li>
<li>Regrets several important actions - userboxes, Giano, his resignation and redirecting AN/I - I believe in forgiveness, but that's a lot of regrets.</li>

<ul>
<li>From other questions, impressive <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Freestylefrappe_Evidence_7a18.html#Evidence_presented_by_Flcelloguy" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Freestylefrappe/Evidence">evidence in Freestylefrappe case</a>.</li>
<li>For my Q4, gave answers that were related to cases he himself had participated in. Not terrible, but sort of the easy way out, especially given that he doesn't completely disagree with the decision, just aspects - in one case that the censure be stronger, in another that multiple mentors be assigned instead of just one. I would argue that he partly misses both parts of the question, first that he prove his ability to do research, and second that he be able to show and explain where he disagrees with actual opinions. Of course he did excellent, well presented research for the Freestylefrappe case, above, but that was something that directly concerned him. On the arbcom, he will usually face cases that don't.
<ul>
<li>Also not quite sure what was the point of his Freestylefrappe decision disagreement - "I would have supported long-term civility parole and even a one-week ban for Freestylefrappe's constant disruptions.... the revocation of his admin rights did not solve the problem, as later demonstrated by Freestylefrappe being blocked several more times (under undisclosed sockpuppet accounts) and then being banned by the community." Well, then that implies that the long-term civility parole and one-week ban would not have solved the problem either, no? It would have maybe sped him on the road to permanent banning by one block earlier, hardly a major change.</li>

<p>I am running for the Arbitration Committee because I feel that there are not enough candidates already running to fill the open positions with acceptable nominees.</p>
<p>I stand specifically for a zero tolerance policy for administrative misconduct: any administrator who abuses administrative privilege (where "abuses" means uses in a manner inconsistent with policy where such use tends to create or intensify a disruption in Wikipedia") will be, at the very least, temporarily suspended as an administrator. Admins on Wikipedia have had a free hand for too long. I made many mistakes as an administrator, and it is my intention to see that no other administrator makes the same mistakes -- and that those who do, do not get the chance to make them again.</p>

<li>Strange way to answer Q6, addressed to Fred Bauder - "not the "king" of remedies/priniciples/findings" - why reproach Fred?</li>
<li>"If an arbitrator is responsible, reasonable, and coming up with agreeable settlements (things that at least a few people can agree on), then they're doing a good job. Simply put, not being a dick." -</li>
<li>In short, doesn't seem to treat arbitration as judging, but merely as mediation</li>

<li>Good answer to my Q1, emphasizing that in many cases the arbcom only has the power we give them.</li>
<li>However seems to be directly contradicted by answer to Q2. Watch: Q1 "... the arbcom is trusted to be correct about what the community consensus is." Q2: "... whether the community came to an acceptable consensus. That is not for the arbcom to judge." - so is it or isn't it?</li>
<li>Q5 seems to have objections, but not yet clear on what those objections are.</li>

<li>Q5 I really don't like: "I'd dig through and try to find one, but I don't feel the need as I won't really use all that time to do that much other than answer a single optional question that won't be used later."

<p>Warning: Most of these are intended to be <b>tough</b>. Answering them properly will be hard. I don't expect anyone to actually withdraw themselves from nomination rather than answer these, but I do expect at least some to seriously think about it!</p>
<p>The one consolation is that your competitors for the positions will be asked them too. Notice that there are about one thousand admins, and about a dozen arbcom members, so the process to become an arbcom member may be expected to be <i>one hundred times</i> harder. <small>(Bonus question - do you think I hit that difficulty standard?)&#160;:-)</small></p>

<li>A current Arbcom case, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Protecting_children%27s_privacy_df78.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Protecting children's privacy">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Protecting children's privacy</a> is concerned with the decision of whether or not a proposed policy has consensus or not, and therefore whether or not it should be a policy/guideline. Whether or not the Arbcom has or should have the power of making this decision is <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Protecting_children%27s_privacy_Workshop_9e7d.html#Role_of_Arbitration_Committee" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Protecting children's privacy/Workshop">hotly disputed</a>. Does Arbcom have this power? Should it have this power? Why or why not?</li>
<li>Similarly, a recently closed Arbcom case <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Giano_fdc9.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Giano">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Giano</a> barely dodged the possibly similar issue of whether the Arbcom can, or should, determine whether Bureaucrats properly made someone an administrator. (Discussed, for example, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Giano_Workshop_2a0c.html#Bureaucrat_decision_in_WP:RFA.2FCarnildo_3_overturned" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Giano/Workshop">here</a>). The current arbcom dodged the question (didn't reach agreement one way or the other, and ended up leaving it alone by omission), but you don't get to.&#160;:-) Does the arbcom have this power? Should it?</li>
<li>Various arbcom decisions <small>(can't find a link right now - bonus points for finding a link to an arbcom decision saying this!)</small> have taken into account a user's service to the Wikipedia. Several times they have written that an otherwise good user that has a rare instance of misbehaviour can be treated differently than a user whose similar misbehaviour is their main or sole contribution to the Wikipedia. Do you agree or not, and why?</li>
<li>If you agree with the above point, which service to the encyclopedia is <i>more</i> valuable - administration, or writing very good articles? For example, what happens when two editors, an administrator and a good article writer, come into conflict and/or commit a similar infraction - how should they be treated? Note that there are relatively the same number of current administrators and featured articles on the Wikipedia - about 1000 - however, while relatively few administrators have been de-adminned, many former featured articles have been de-featured, so there have been noticeably more featured articles written than administrators made. This is a really tough one to answer without offending at least one important group of people, and I will understand if you weasel your way out of answering it, but it was one of the issues brought up in the recent <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Giano_fdc9.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Giano">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Giano</a>, so you can imagine it may come up again.</li>
<li>While some Arbcom decisions pass unanimously, many pass with some disagreement. I don't know of any Arbcom member who hasn't been in the minority on some decisions. Find an Arbcom decision that passed, was actually made that you disagree with. Link to it, then explain why you disagree. (If you don't have time or inclination to do the research to find one - are you sure you will have time or inclination to do the research when elected? If you can't find any passed decisions you disagree with, realize you are leaving yourself open to accusations of running as a <a href="../../../r/u/b/Rubber_stamp_%28politics%29.html" title="Rubber stamp (politics)">rubber stamp</a> candidate, one who doesn't have any opinions that might disagree with anyone.)</li>
<li>It has been noted that the diligent <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">User:Fred Bauder</a> writes most of the initial Arbcom decisions -- especially principles, and findings of fact, but even a fair number of the remedies. (Then a fair number get opposed, and refined or don't pass, but he does do most of the initial work.) Do you believe this is: right; neither right nor wrong but acceptable; or wrong? When you get elected, what do you plan to do about it?</li>
<li>For those who are administrators only - how do you feel about non-administrators on the arbcom? Note that while "sure, let them on if they get elected" is an easy answer, there are issues with not having the ability to view deleted articles, and either not earning the community trust enough to become an admin, or not wanting the commensurate duties. Or do you believe that non-administrators are a group that need representation on the arbcom?</li>
