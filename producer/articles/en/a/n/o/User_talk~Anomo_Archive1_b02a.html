<p>Yeah, I was actually making my comment while being constantly interrupted at work; when I started it, the page hadn't been deleted yet&#160;:) But when I finally got around to finishing my comment and hit save, I got a conflict page, and just went in and stuck my comment in before reading the new changes (which of course indicated that the final decision had been made). But I liked my comment so much, I decided not to go back in and remove it. Because it really is less about limecat specifically (I mean, I don't think <i>I'll</i> ever forget limecat) and more about the general principle of the thing and Wikipedia policies.

<p>I noticed you run a lot of wikis, all on Wikia. I am curious why you chose them and not a different wikifarm that gives you more content control. Looking at Wikia it seems that once you sysop someone, you can't de-sysop them and they have the same power as you--true or false? Also they will merge your wiki at any time and you will lose control of it that way, too. And I also think it can't be offensive to minors, with means no sexual stuff, not even ASCII art? I don't know if I am right about any of this so can you please answer back and let me know. Thank you. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 10:40, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Anomo! The reason Creatures Wiki is on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikia.html" title="Wikia">Wikia</a> is because it was initially founded there by another person, <a href="../../../s/g/e/User%7ESgeo_6a36.html" title="User:Sgeo">Sgeo</a>. The reason I chose it for WikiFur was because I had had a good experience with <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/c:Creatures:" class="extiw" title="wikia:Creatures:">Creatures Wiki</a> and I felt it was the best place to be.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Wikia will indeed merge or even retire wikis if they prove to be unsuccesful in gathering contributors on their own. It basically only happens if you fail (or possibly if your wiki was never suited for Wikia in the first place, for example if there were only a handful of people who would ever be interested in the topic). If you succeed in making a good wiki - or even a not particularly good wiki that still has contributors - then it is not going to happen.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>I believe you are incorrect about being inoffensive to minors. See <a href="http://wikia.com/wiki/Prohibited_content" class="external text" title="http://wikia.com/wiki/Prohibited_content" rel="nofollow">prohibited content</a> and <a href="http://wikia.com/wiki/Terms_of_use" class="external text" title="http://wikia.com/wiki/Terms_of_use" rel="nofollow">terms of use</a>. You should read them and interpret them liberally, as that is how they have tended to be applied. Obviously, if you're looking to create PornoWiki, then you might want to talk that over with them first - if you include large numbers of pornographic or erotic images then that will mean that Wikia cannot use <a href="../../../a/d/w/AdWords_509f.html" title="AdWords">AdWords</a> on your community's wiki. However, WikiFur has one or two pieces that are of a "mature" nature (appropriate to articles) and that has not affected our status on Wikia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is true that when you give sysop status to others, then they technically have the same powers as you (except the power to grant other people sysop access - you have to grant that separately). However, most contributors will tend to defer to the founder to some extent, regardless of actual editing and administration powers. If you have a good reason to de-sysop someone, then you should be able to convince Wikia of that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The question is, are you making a wiki for yourself (which seems somewhat contradictory to the idea of a wiki), or are you making one for your community? If you represent your community well, it is very unlikely that you will lose control of the wiki, and also that Wikia will be a good place for you to build a wiki for that community. If in doubt, get on the "Live chat and support" (later this week, we're all at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimania.html" title="Wikimania">Wikimania</a> right now) and talk about it with a Wikia staff member.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 15:19, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for your information. The one thing is, I wanted creative direction for the wiki. The other thing is that I'd like to be able to de-sysop someone if they abuse their power. The only benefit I see of wikia is that it gets a better alexa ranking. You also run the Galactic Civilizations wiki, which looking at its recent changes, gets little contributions and looks like Wikia would merge it. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 20:00, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Being on something.wikia.com does not, as far as I know, get you a better Alexa ranking. However, their help may enable you to get it for yourself. Wikia staff have technical and community staff that know what they're doing - often the same people that have taken part in running Wikipedia in the past. They have people around in IRC to help out, pretty much 24-hours. They also have significant server resources, and with their background they know how to use them to make MediaWiki fast.</dd>

<dd>GalCiv could indeed be merged, though it's hard to see where it would be merged <i>to</i>. I doubt they would do it, as it has almost 500 pages on its own (plus it gets rather a lot of hits). It has demonstrated that the concept of that wiki is valid - it just lacks a leader, as I've been occupied with other tasks. Merging tends to happen only with those where that is not the case.</dd>

<dd>It sounds like what you want is not what Wikia is offering, though. In particular, if you demand creative direction (and do not allow the possibility that other members of the community may overrule you), then it is no longer a community's wiki - it is <i>your</i> wiki. I therefore suggest you look at other wiki hosts. I do not think you will find one with the services provided by Wikia, but I could be wrong, and you may not need these services anyway. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 01:13, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, how do you do Checkuser? Like on this one: <a href="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/User:Jewbo_Wales" class="external free" title="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/User:Jewbo_Wales" rel="nofollow">http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/User:Jewbo_Wales</a> you found out the IP (which is a match with Blu Aarvark on wikipedia--of course his list of sock puppet names give it away, though. I told an admin on wikipedia who promptly ignored it.). It says you're a Bureaucrat, but not Checkuser and I don't see any of these places giving Checkuser. Is there a way to do Checkuser and how do you do Checkuser as just a bureaucrat? <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 01:34, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I asked a member of staff on the live chat and support, who was more than willing to look up a vandal IP for me so it could be banned. They will do such things as long as the reason is good.

<p>edit summary: "<i>rv new user without even a talk page and anon IP who changed the article purely so someone could quote it</i>" - I'd be the one who made the modification. I changed the wording of the opening paragraph to make it a bit more clear and thorough. I had no intention of quoting it, nor knew of anyone who wanted to, before reading this page. I find Anomo's reaction and insinuations patronizing and insulting, to be honest. Anomo, was there a real reason to revert my modifications aside from snobbery directed at a 'new user'?

<p>I first became acquainted with you in the <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choral_Public_Domain_Library_d3f8.html" title="Choral Public Domain Library">Choral Public Domain Library</a> AfD discussions. After looking around some more, it appears to me that you are prone to overreacting on the matter of single purpose accounts and sockpuppetry. I get the feeling that you see a sockpuppeter in every corner. Really, this is a form of paranoia that you might do well to (self)examine carefully.</p>
<p>Yes, I have fewer than 50 posts, although I've been a registered user since October of last year. My posts have been about equally divided between <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">Mathematics</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music.html" title="Music">Music</a>. Does this make me a single purpose account holder? No, it does not. Does it make me a sockpuppeter? No, for I post only under <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuckHG_e510.html" title="User:ChuckHG">Chuck</a>.</p>
<p>Why so few posts over a period of about 10 months? Well, for one thing, I'm a busy person, even though I am officially retired for five years now, after 35 years of teaching and research in mathematics at a major university. This retirement has enabled me to pursue more avidly a lifelong interest in music - as a composer/arranger, editor, conductor, performer. These retirement years have been very busy, as I also teach and tutor part-time, work on home improvements and remodelling, be a father to 8 widely scattered sons and daughters and a grandfather to 7 young children. I'm also heavily involved with such things as bread-making, cooking, and (during the summer months) gardening. I have a vast number of friends and correspondents which deserve my attention (although perhaps at times they receive too little).</p>
<p>All in all, compared to you, I feel that I have a fulfilling life, whereas you seem to be involved in pitiful and arbitrary designation of users with fewer than 50 posts as single purpose account holders. I'm taking you to task here, because I think you deserve to be called to account for your rash behavior and actions.</p>
<p>As for the accusations of sock puppetry in the CPDL discussions, I can assure you (as a contributor to CPDL of early music scores and some of my own works), that you are way off base, here. The (presumed) candidates which you have in mind for sock puppetry in the CPDL deletion discussions are overwhelmingly distinct individuals, albeit mostly individual contributors of scores to CPDL. You would only have to take a look at the <a href="http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Category:CPDL_Editors" class="external text" title="http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Category:CPDL_Editors" rel="nofollow">CPDL Editors</a> list to find them (You'll find me as the only Editor whose initials are C.H.G.). I challenge you to provide the <i>massive evidence of sockpuppetry</i> you claim. If indeed, as I suspect, you cannot provide such evidence, then you owe a lot of people an apology.</p>

<p>I do not like that link and I don't think it has a place there. If you wish to add any links to 7chan's page please use the talk page. I do not wish to be rude, so please do not take it that way. Thank you. Lordvervex 68.39.114.92 07:29, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you are Lordvervex why aren't you signed in on that name? I explained on the talk page that the article was copy and pasted from another site and you remove the site. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 07:42, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>....who would pretend to be me? We have edited the page, that is not the problem, must you post it in the "bad joke" page also? That was my joke. I understand the copy right concern but becuase the same group of people wrote both articals I did not see a problem, if you still think it violates copy right rules reply if not simply remove your link.

<p>I'm not certain that incident should be brought into the discussion - unless you know something I'm not aware of, that might not even be a case of pedophilia (which implies the <i>cause</i> of the attraction was that she was 15) as opposed to attraction to someone who happened to be 15. —<a href="../../../a/y/s/User%7EAySz88_15e3.html" title="User:AySz88">AySz88</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AySz88_57ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/AySz88">\</a><a href="../../../a/y/s/User_talk%7EAySz88_f90d.html" title="User talk:AySz88"><font color="#FF9966">^</font><font color="#FF6633">-</font><font color="#FF3300">^</font></a> 20:42, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Depending on pickiness, the entire thing is original research under how sometimes this counts as viewing a website mention in the article and putting down what it says rather than seeing what a media source says.

<dl>
<dd>The no communication answer is verifiable if you email them and wait a week. That doesn't count as verifiable - verifying involves more than just <i>looking at something</i>. On the other hand a claim like "has ads" is verifiable directly by looking at the site. Therefore "has ads" and such is not original research - the site itself is a citation. --<a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogixoul_b212.html" title="User:Logixoul">logixoul</a> 17:01, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Anomo, can you tell me the date of the first raid or around when /b/ first noticed or started entering habbo? I have have found a very valuable source that would depend on when 4chan first started growing its presence on Habbo. (and I mean earliest; not necessarily the first major raid...didn't this "pool's closed" theme start as early as May?--<a href="../../../d/c/h/User%7EDch111_7169.html" title="User:Dch111">Dch111</a> 01:03, 15 October 2006 (UTC) <span id="63286040554"></span></p>

<p>I must have missed your message the first time around. My apologies.</p>
<p>About your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHappyCamper&amp;diff=82737912&amp;oldid=82653041" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHappyCamper&amp;diff=82737912&amp;oldid=82653041" rel="nofollow">query</a>, I'm currently not entirely comfortable with cutting and pasting deleted histories, so if you are still curious about it, I'd suggest asking another administrator. I haven't seen this happen too often on Wikipedia to feel good about doing it yet.</p>
<p>However, here's a reasonable compromise I've seen someone else do for an article like this - the article On Wheels has 5 deleted edits. The first, by an registered account with a single edit to the article, essentially creating a list. The second is an AfD nomination, again by an account with a single edit. The third, is another single edit account for vandalism. The fourth, is a reversion by an administrator. The final edit is a bot edit to update the AfD tag. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 04:05, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ryulong has ALWAYS done that. I saw someone asking for help with abuse on Wikipedia's IRC channel something about ops abusing their power and also ops were doing denial of service attacks and Ryulong and others blanked it out again and again. So of course it ended up on wikipediareview.com and several websites because Wikipedia chose to hide the issue. Somebody did that was Blu Aardvark on my talk page and Blu Aardvark went crazy thinking I couldn't see it (when I did) and I thought that was funny (Blu Aardvark is a funny angry person) so I left it alone. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 21:47, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../p/l/a/Plagiarism.html" title="Plagiarism">Plagiarism</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright_violation.html" title="Copyright violation">copyright violations</a> are similar but distinct transgressions. Primetime was guilty of both. Plagiarism is claiming the words or ideas of another as your own. Even a single phrase, a set of research, or an idea can be plagiarized, even if the material is in the public domain. Copyvios involve taking the expression that belongs to another and using it for commercial benefit (or impacting their ability to use it commercially. Copyright laws often have a "fair use" exemption that allow small quotations of a piece for critical purposes. Wikipedia gets tons of copyvios, by people who innocently think they can copy material from other websites. But it's pretty rare to get guys who actually claim to have written it themselves.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The bottom line is that there is no easy way to de-plagiarize copied text other than using the magic words, "this material is copied from ..." Primetime refused to ever do that, always insisting he was the author even when caught red-handed. We've never been able to determine his motives. On the one hand he claims to be doing it to help Wikipedia. On the other hand he's regularly condemned Wikipedia as a horrible project while idolizing the Encyclopedia Britannica and other print encyclopedias. Just recentluy he was found uploading pictures to the Wikicommons claiming that he'd taken them himself, pictures which have been found on sites like, you guessed it, EB.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for taking copyrighted material and converting it to usable material the rules are much more lax, especially for text. Text that was fully re-written would probably be acceptable, even if it parrots the ideas and research of another writer. Just changing a few words wouldn't be sufficient. Does that answer your question? -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 07:30, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perhaps I have misunderstood your questions, but it is obvious to me that admins can abuse their power and that if/when this happens it should be dealt with firmly. For instance, I have stated among my responses that <i>"one policy that I would like adopted relates to administrator accountability ... It states that any admin who engages in wheel warring ... or edit warring on a protected page, is immediately demoted without prejudice, while it is decided how to further deal with this person."</i></p>
<p>I have simply not seen the frequent practices you refer to (of deleting the pages to pester blocked people, or protecting pages to stifle discussion), but I fully agree that such is bad practice. In fact, regardless of whether or not I become an arbiter, please do point out to me any such pages deleted or protected, and I'd be happy to investigate and undo any deletions-to-pester and protections-to-stifle.

<p>Is there a way to undelete Wikipedia:B.R.I.T.T.A.N.I.C.A.? Here is my reasoning.</p>
<p>1. If you delete that article, you must also delete this one: <a href="../../../p/r/i/Wikipedia%7EPrimogeniture_3d04.html" title="Wikipedia:Primogeniture">Wikipedia:Primogeniture</a>, which was the basis of the B.R.I.T.T.A.N.I.C.A. article.</p>
<p>2. B.R.I.T.T.A.N.I.C.A. is not a wikipedia competitor, it is an evil organization.</p>
<p>3. The encyclopedia Britanica is spelled with only one letter "t", while B.R.I.T.T.A.N.I.C.A. is not a word at all, but an acronym consisting of several words.</p>
<p>4. The article was clearly marked as humor.</p>
<p>5. There is no Cabal.</p>
