<dl>
<dd>This is obsolete, but just to explain: For every flight there is a prime crew, and a back-up crew. The back-up crew is trained and ready to step in right up to the last moment before a flight. Before the medical disqualification of Enomoto, Ansari was back-up. For a professional astronaut, being back-up is (alas!) no guarantee of eventually getting a prime slot, but as Ansari paid Roskosmos to fly, it was probably guaranteed that she would fly eventually, most likely on the next available Soyuz third seat, unless she herself were disqualified medically. When the next available seat would have been is mainly up to the Russians. Still, there are probably 2-3 potential opportunities a year, as long as Shuttle is flying, and it's obvious that Russia is trying to sign up as many "clients" as it can, for the cash. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 22:45, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know, but according to the article in YAhoo to-day, she is an American and NOT an Iranian citizen. 211.225.32.57 00:42, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm confused about this myself, she is a U.S. Citizen, wouldn't that make her the first "Iranian-American" in space? Even the USA Today article that is quoted says:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Ansari will also be the first person of <b>Iranian descent</b> to fly in space. " So in fact she is not the first Iranian as she is a US Citizen, but rahter the first person of Iranian Descent, or <b>Iranian-American</b> to be in space. I think it needs to be clearified in this wiki article.</p>
<p>An example would be for astronaut <a href="../../../t/a/y/Taylor_Gun-Jin_Wang_82b3.html" title="Taylor Gun-Jin Wang">Taylor Gun-Jin Wang</a>, he is the first ethnic chinese and chinese-american into space in 1985, he was born in China but was an American citizen at the time he went into space. The first Chinese citizen (nationality) into space was <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yang_Liwei_56ca.html" title="Yang Liwei">Yang Liwei</a> which was done in 2003. As you can see a distinction is made, there are many other examples in the case of Nationality. That distinction should be made for Anousheh Ansari as well.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimitedexpresstrain_7b99.html" title="User:Limitedexpresstrain">Limitedexpresstrain</a> (<a href="../../../l/i/m/User_talk%7ELimitedexpresstrain_5bc7.html" title="User talk:Limitedexpresstrain">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Limitedexpresstrain_8572.html" title="Special:Contributions/Limitedexpresstrain">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>Unlike Mr. Wang, Ms. Ansari is financing her own trip and she's both an American and an Iranian citizen. Saying the first Iranian-American is pointless when there have never been any other Iranians in space, she's the first Iranian in space. <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2006-09-18T043256Z_01_L17716676_RTRUKOC_0_US-SPACE-SOYUZ.xml&amp;WTmodLoc=NewsHome-C1-topNews-11" class="external text" title="http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2006-09-18T043256Z_01_L17716676_RTRUKOC_0_US-SPACE-SOYUZ.xml&amp;WTmodLoc=NewsHome-C1-topNews-11" rel="nofollow">Reuters</a>: "<i>A Russian Soyuz spacecraft blasted off on Monday carrying a woman set to notch up three space records: the first female tourist, first female Muslim, <b>and first Iranian in orbit</b></i>." --<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManiF_8d90.html" title="User:ManiF">ManiF</a> 22:02, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Financing has nothing to do with who is first or not, I'm not sure why that was brought up, also there is nothing in the wikipedia article that says she is a duel citizen, if she is, then there should be something noted and referenced to in her biography, as I think thats an important thing to know about someone if you are reading their biography. As far as a reader is to know, she's just an American who immigrated from Iran if that were the case then she would not be the first Iranian in space, but if she did have duel citizenship then the situation changes. Another example would be Paul D. Scully-Power, was born in Australia, but was an American citizen when he went into space, therefore he would not count as the first Austrailian into space. If Anousheh Ansari is a duel citizen then it needs to be an indicated that she holds duel citizenship in both countries. I can't find anything that says she retains her Iranian Citizenship, but rather everything I'm reading says she attains US Citizenship, or became an American, or that she is Iranian born but American now, or ethnic Iranian. Reuters, may say she is the first Iranian, but there are many other news agencies that do not note that she is the first Iranian, but rather the first women space tourist, and that she is of Iranian decent or Iranian born. I do not think it is pointless to say that that she is the first Iranian-American in space, its not pointless because there have never been any other Iranians in space. Is it pointless to say Gary Locke was the first Chinese-American to become Governor of a US State, even though no other Chinese-American has become Governor of a State? She is Iranian-American, therefor is the first Iranian-American into space. I noticed she also flies with the US Flag on her outfit.

<dd>She is an Iranian citizen. She was born in Iran, and therefore, by Iranian law, a citizen, no matter where else in the world she goes. If she acquires citizenship elsewhere, then she automatically gets dual citizenship. Iranian citizenship is also passed through the father for people who are not born on Iranian soil, like Andre Agassi, who is also an Iranian citizen.<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 23:03, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is my point a general reader might not know this fact. All they read is she is Iranian-American, therefore is an American Citizen. It would be nice to know that by Iranian-law she is still an Iranian, this in a small notation on her biography page. As there are many different criteria to who is "first in space" based on Nationality, ethnicity, depending on what convention or organization that keeps these records. While news articles say she has broken these space records, it does not record based on what organization and what that organization's standards are for recording who is first.

<dd>She's an Iranian citizen by law. She was born Iran and lived in Iran until she was a young adult. It doesn't matter where an Iranian migrates or whatever citizenships he or she holds, an Iranian citizen is an Iranian citizen unless he or she revokes her Iranian citizenship, and there is no evidence of Ms. Ansari revoking her Iranian citizenship, she even has an Iranian flag on her official website: <a href="http://www.anoushehansari.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.anoushehansari.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.anoushehansari.com/</a>. --<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManiF_8d90.html" title="User:ManiF">ManiF</a> 00:27, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From an Iranian legal perspective to clear things up: Iran does not recognise dual citizenship <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3689095.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3689095.stm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Any one who is a citizen of Iran (by birth within Iran or by nationality of father or mother <a href="http://www.wluml.org/english/newsfulltxt.shtml?cmd%5B157%5D=x-157-543742" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wluml.org/english/newsfulltxt.shtml?cmd%5B157%5D=x-157-543742" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) remains a citizen of Iran and can technically not obtain foreign citizenship unless they renounce their Iranian citizenship. However, the government of Iran turns a blind eye towards the 100,000s of people who have obtained foreign citizenships from countries that do accept dual nationality (i.e. UK, US, France, etc...). Thus in practice accepting dual nationality, but not legally. This also raises questions as to precedence as can be seen in the case of Zahra Kazemi. <a href="http://www.commonlaw.uottawa.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=991&amp;contact_id=38&amp;lang=en&amp;l_opin_piec=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.commonlaw.uottawa.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=991&amp;contact_id=38&amp;lang=en&amp;l_opin_piec=" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></dd>

When it comes to "firsts" there's no authority that gets to set rules around these things. There are some facts - like is she a citizen? Was she born there? Did/does she live there? that we can use to qualify things, but in general for a first, one doesn't qualify it if there isn't some previous claim to the title that one needs to be able to seperate oneself from. for instance, if there weren't three men before her we'd be calling her the fist space tourist not the first female space tourist. She'd still be female though.

<dd>I suggest you read a bit more about the history, and also about the name of the countries in different languages, before blaming anybody on such matters. Here, I tell you about the names. About the history, I leave you with a question, so you may go on finding the answer yourself.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Many countries and languages have different names in other languages. For example, Germans call their country "Deutschland" but in English people call it "Germany", in French "Allemagne", and in Polish, "Niemcy". People of Greece, Armenia, Finland, India, Albania, Egypt, Algeria, Japan and China call their countries, respectively Ellas, Hayastan, Suomi, Bharat, Shqipëria, Mesr, al-Jaza'ir, Nippon or Nihon, and Zhōnggúo or Chung-kuo in their respective languages. Similarly, the native name of "Persia" is "Iran". The difference between the two names, therefore, is just a matter of language translation.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you still think that Persia is from 4000 years ago, and Iran is from today, here is the question for you: "In what time during the Persian history has the name of the country changed?" Let me say it in another way: "Was there a war or an invasion (like what happened to the Ottoman Empire) which destroyed Persia? Or was it just a switch between the names without any change in the country?" I let you find the answer yourself. Just a hint: you can find the answer in Wikipedia!</dd>

<p>Ansari is a space tourist. I have objections using the astronaut box on her page. The same applies to Christa Mcauliffe, who according to NASA was not an astronaut, but a mission specialist. Technically there is a difference.--<a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaysleeper47_cafe.html" title="User:Daysleeper47">Daysleeper47</a> 19:12, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Everybody who goes beyond 100 km or 120 km altitude is technically an astronaut. Ansari will become an astronaut a few minutes after Soyuz lift-off. But since we put astronaut on all astronauts in training as well, I think the infobox is fine.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding Mcauliffe, all Shuttle passengers who are not Commander, Pilot or Payload specialists are Mission specialists. There are generally 4 or 5 of them in each Shuttle. <a href="../../../h/e/k/User%7EHektor_6d63.html" title="User:Hektor">Hektor</a> 05:03, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I, too, object to calling her an astronaut until she has flown. She is at best a trainee astronaut. She has not earned her astronaut's wings and is not recognised by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale as such. See the definition of astronaut at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut</a>.</p>
<p>Deke Slayton was selected to train as an astronaut in 1959 but did not become one until he flew in 1975. It is clear and unambiguous. Wikipedia can only retain credibility and respect if it adheres to high standards of fact, not exaggeration and promotion of people by their fans, which is what is happening here. That is too arbitrary.</p>
<p>It is a weak statement to say "we put astronaut on all astronauts in training." Doing so does not justify it. "That is how it has always been done" is a poor argument. An astronaut is one who has flown in space. A child could tell you that. It couldn't be simpler.</p>
<ul>
<li>The definition you provide is: (an astronaut) "is a person who travels into space, or who makes a career of doing so." The "makes a career of doing so" covers precisely the astronaut trainees, and therefore Ansari. <a href="../../../h/e/k/User%7EHektor_6d63.html" title="User:Hektor">Hektor</a> 19:48, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I concur with the use of the term. NASA considers all astronauts-in-training to be "astronauts", because it's the job they were selected and hired to do. This is not the same as earning your wings. The astronaut box is informational and entirely appropriate. The blank mission box shows that she hasn't flown yet. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 19:11, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Despite the "plucked from obscurity" angle, Sharman did not pay for her flight, so she isn't considered a space "tourist" in that sense. Though sponsored by a private consortium, not a government, she had a great deal more training and probably more rigorous duties on her flight. She is akin to the many guest-country astro/cosmonauts that have flown, most similar of all to the US Teacher-in-Space program. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 19:02, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Later, in November 1962, when she passed her cosmonaut examinations she was commissioned as an officer, with the rank Junior Lieutenant.

<p>I can not understand the relevancy of "Azeri" in the phrase "She is set to become the first Iranian Azeri in space". I think she is not only an Iranian, but an American too. So, she is an American with Iranian origin. Of course she is an Azeri Iranian, but this is not the right place to mention than. I suggest "She is set to become the first Iranian American in space", without mentioning "Azeri" in this sentence. It can be mentioned correctly somewhere else in the article, for example "Born in 1966 in Tehran, Iran (Persia), in an Azeri family". However I can't understand correctly the relevancy of this piece of information. It's like saying "She is set to become the first Texan American in space" or "She was born in New York, in a Texan family" about someone who has emmigrated to England two decades ago!</p>

As I mentioned in another article, she the Azerbaijani press took this bogus news and spread it. If you look at her blog which is in both Persian and English, she mentions she is Mashhadi and not Azeri. And in her faviorate music sections she mentions Persian and English. Either way until there is actual interviews with her, we will not be sure, but it is certain she does not speak any Azeri which makes it likely she is not Azeri since if her parents and family were Azeri, she would speak the language which she does not. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 15:53, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Not that it's any of my business what her religion is, but <i>if</i> her religionous preference is publicly known, <i>does anyone know if she is a Muslim?</i> Regardless of her religious status (I still respect her whatever her religion), I'm glad to see a woman of Middle Eastern descent showing the rest of the world that Middle Eastern women have the right stuff. —Taka2007 15:42, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry if my edit offended anyone, but the source, an alumni magazine with presumably good access to Ansari, made this claim. I did not. As it is a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, if there is any objection to the claim it should be refuted by <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">citing</a> other material. Ansari may have had her own reasons for leaving Iran; she may believe what she told the interviewer. And while Jake@Prodea (whoever he is) may indeed have access, we should keep in mind that he seems to be a <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_relations.html" title="Public relations">public relations</a> flack and as such is professionally biased. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 07:51, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think the alumni magazine (especially not an alumni magazine from a US university) is a particularly reliable source for the claim that was made. It seems highly unlikely to me that an alumni magazine would have done anything other than a brief interview with Ansari and (maybe!) check their own records on her attendance at GMU. This does not make them particularly authoritive on education and gender in Iran. When you look at a reliable source, you have to look at not just the publication, but also the nature of the claim.</dd>
<dd>I have seen elsewhere that the family moved to America because they wanted Anousheh to be able to pursue science and engineering to the highest levels. That's a slightly different claim, for which a personal interview is appropriate (because it's about their perception of educational opportunity - for which they are reasonably authoritive sources&#160;:-). I'll try and find that article again.</dd>
<dd>We do, unfortunately, have a problem with sources on this article, because most of the biographical information is from sources that are unlikely to have done any actual fact checking. In most cases it's not too important. But when there is a controversial claim, we need to be particualrly careful about what we say and how. --<a href="../../../s/i/o/User%7ESiobhanHansa_73ec.html" title="User:SiobhanHansa"><font color="Orange">Siobhan</font></a><a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa"><font color="blue">Hansa</font></a> 11:49, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I attempted to remove ofensive material that was placed under the picture of this aspiring Cosmonaut. The words "Islamic Fundalmentalist and Jerks off Osama" were placed under her picture. When I refreshed the page however I saw that it had already been removed, her picture changed, and the word "Cosmonaut" replacing the existing words. I hope she makes her dreams come true.</p>

<dd>These are the exact comments from the same astronaut: <i>Astronaut Lopez-Alegria said just a few years ago he was skeptical of private tourists.

</dl>
<p>"If that's the correct solution... then not only is it good from the standpoint of supporting the Russian space program, but it's good for us as well," he said. Ansari's presence in space "is a great dream and a great hope not just for our country but for countries all around the world."</p>
<p>Cosmonaut Tyurin called Ansari "very professional" and said he felt like they had worked together for a decade. <i><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060918/ap_on_sc/russia_space" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060918/ap_on_sc/russia_space" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> The section is misleading. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 03:57, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<p>She has not multiple citizenship. She may be iranian under Iran's laws but she's only american by US laws because she has american citizenship. This is not an iranian Wikipedia, but of english language. The laws here, for fair use, for example, are under US laws. Then, Ansari is an american who was born in Iran, just that. The article is wrong. And she is not the first female tourist in space, Helen Sharman, from UK, is it (see Helen Sharman article here<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Sharman" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Sharman" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>).

<dd>It doesn't matter if this is a French or English or Persian wikipedia. English is an international language used by everyone. UK, Australia, US, Canada could have different laws. She is an Iranian citzen by Iranian law and Americanc citizen by American law. And to say which law is better or more important or should take primacy is pushing a POV (and also a bit arrogant).

<p>Of course it matters!! And of course all you said is YOUR POV. Ansari is an american who was born in Iran. Ansari is not the first tourist, she's the first one paying for it, what's a lot different. She's doing scientific work, read the newspapers, ok? As Helen Sharman did. Sharman is the first one and this is not a POV. Sources? Read her article.

<dd>English is the international language and does not belong solely to the US. So US POV's can not be imposed on English Wikipedia. Ansari is considered both American by American law and Iranian by Iranian law. As per space tourism, it is a new industry which started after the USSR. She is the 4th space tourist and first female one. Here is a source: <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=2455201&amp;page=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=2455201&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 07:23, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>People who acquire American citizenship by naturalisation are required to renounce former citizenship, however, their former nations usually continue to recognise them as citizens in the original countries. This would suggest Ansari is Iranian and American. Perhaps the resolution could be found in referring to her as "Iranian and American" rather than contentiously calling her "American," "Iranian," and "Iranian-American," even though all those labels are true.I regard her as Iranian and American since...she is!</p>

<p>I think as someone pointed out, the most important factor in determining Ansari's Iranian or American-ness is herself. If she regards herself as a citizen of both Iran and the US, and is legally accepted by both countries as a citizen, then there is no dispute. She considers herself both an Iranian and an American so she is both. Definite</p>

<p>All the press outlets are describing Ansari as a "space tourist". However, "tourist" significantly downplays her role. It implies that she paid the money and is simply along for the ride, whereas in reality she has a scientific background and will be conducting a variety of experiments during her trip (e.g. on behalf of the ESA). It's also notable that the Space Adventures website never describes her as a tourist. Instead they use the term, "private explorer". Is this enough to warrant a change in the article, do you think? -- <a href="../../../h/u/x/User%7EHux_eafc.html" title="User:Hux">Hux</a> 19:37, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

It's worth talking about her view of what she is doing in spcae, but I think the majority view is that a private individual who gets to go up in a Government space craft simply because they paid their own fare is currently a "tourist". It's not quite the same as a trip to Orlando, but it's still a matter of individual whim. It's also what WP's <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_tourism.html" title="Space tourism">Space tourism</a> article thinks Ansari is (not that WP is a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>). --<a href="../../../s/i/o/User%7ESiobhanHansa_73ec.html" title="User:SiobhanHansa"><font color="Orange">Siobhan</font></a><a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa"><font color="blue">Hansa</font></a> 20:01, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Given the constant changes to the firsts claims and the qualifications and explanations that get put in in an attempt to overcome whatever opposition each editor percieves, I thought we should try to come to some understanding of what were actually trying to say, why, and how it's best communicated.</p>
<p>My perspective on this is that it is great to be able to claim the "biggest" (by which I mean least qualified) first you can for a subject. but at the same time, I don't think firsts are a particularly important part of a biography once more than a few people have basically done what you're doing. So while I find the qulifications on the Iranian first inappropriate, I also wonder about the appropriateness of putting in all these claims anyway. I see Ansari's work in encouraging commercial space flight as a much bigger legacy than her flight to the space station. I wonder if some of the constant revisioning isn't a reaction to a perception that all these "firsts" claims are stretching things a bit far (I notice the main astronaught bios on WP rarely claim any firsts for their subjects).</p>
<p>So what are the arguments around the "first" claims anyway? Why do people object to Iranian on its own? First female muslim also seems to attract dislike. Is there a way for us to represent all major points of view here? Should we have this stuff in at all? --<a href="../../../s/i/o/User%7ESiobhanHansa_73ec.html" title="User:SiobhanHansa"><font color="Orange">Siobhan</font></a><a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa"><font color="blue">Hansa</font></a> 21:20, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Here is my views:
<ol>
<li>Anousheh Ansari is American first and foremost.</li>
<li>That said she also obviously maintains Iranian identity and has not nullified her Iranian citizenship.</li>
<li>Contrary to what another user says, becoming American citizen does not automatically nullify previous citizenship. That is 100% false. America is not dictatorship - when you become American citizen they do not force you to revoke other citizenships. She has dual-citizenship and all Americans have 100% right to multiple-citizenship.</li>
<li>Most important Anousheh has clearly stated that she is going to space as both an American and an Iranian.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>I don't think there is much room for argument here since she is clear about these things. The only issue may be "Muslim" but if she has stated that she is Muslim, then there is again no room for argument.</dd>
<dd>If you ask me the article looks good and is sourced and people who want to deny this and that are only vandalizing. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 03:41, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You are correct that becoming an US citizen does not automatically *remove* previous citizenship. However all people who become naturalized US citizens are required to *renounce* their former citizenship via the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/graphics/aboutus/history/teacher/oath.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.uscis.gov/graphics/aboutus/history/teacher/oath.htm" rel="nofollow">Naturalization Oath of Allegiance</a>, which begins, "I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen", and ends, "so help me God." So if she still asserts that she is an Iranian <i>citizen</i> (as distinct from culturally Iranian) then that's a pretty serious lie, especially if she is religious.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, your claim that "all Americans have 100% right to multiple-citizenship" is false. US law affords no such right. The ability to be a dual citizen is purely the result of the physical inability of the US government to take away a person's foreign citizenship. Only the nation conferring citizenship is able to take it away.</dd>

<dd>Hi Hux. In the first (currently!) reference on the page (CNN's Female Space Touris Blasts Off) Ansari is quoted as saying "<i>"Me being the first female has inspired a lot of women and girls in Iran, especially being <b>Iranian</b>, and I've received numerous e-mails, messages of different sorts saying how proud of me they are."</i>" (My emphasis). I think her (thwarted) attempt to wear both American and Iranian patches on her flight is also illustrative. In another reference (WAFF's Local space tourist's Iran patch spurs dispute) her husband is quoted "'She's from Iran no matter what,' Ansari said of his wife." Just a few examples from the references we have at the moment. --<a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa">Siobhan Hansa</a> 10:46, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Siobhan: Note that I drew a distinction between asserting that one is <i>culturally</i> Iranian (i.e. country of origin, upbringing, etc.) versus asserting Iranian <i>citizenship</i>. In bringing up the naturalization pledge I was simply noting the disconnect between swearing an oath before the US government and before God that one has renounced all other citizenship...and then going on to continue to assert citizenship of another country. From your quotes it seems that Ansari is not really talking about citizenship; her statements are more culturally oriented, so that clears up the third point in my post above. The other two points were simply attempting to address some misconceptions in Korshid's post and are not relevant to the article specifically. I hope that makes more sense! -- <a href="../../../h/u/x/User%7EHux_eafc.html" title="User:Hux">Hux</a> 10:39, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wouldn't say that there are 'constant' changes to the claims of firsts. Just clarifications. Wikipedia is a source of information for people curious about some subjects. We should include relavent firsts or whatever accomplishments/deeds for people. That is not to say that everyone needs a first. It is not always relavent. Of course relavence is in the eye of the beholder. Still, firsts, should deal in facts not opinions. There does also need to be a limit of relavence (e.g. "the first red-headed brown-eyed....")</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Being first does not necessarily disappear over time. <a href="../../../y/u/r/Yuri_Gagarin_8e95.html" title="Yuri Gagarin">Yuri_Gagarin</a> will always been known as the first person in space, and more than a few people have been in space.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A year from now, the firsts may no longer seem relavent. As such time, I would agree about possibly removing those firsts. Until such time, let's leave them in there. - Taka2007 06:40, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By Iranian law as long as her father is Iranian she is considered Iranian. To claim US law as more correct than Iranian law is not correct. Both governments have their own law. So Ansari is a Iranian citizen by Iranian law. And a US citizen by US law. The US law does not hold in iran and the Iranian law does not hold in the US. Finally here is quote from Anousheh herself: <i>"I'm hoping by portraying a different image of an <b>Iranian woman</b> I'll be able to help people's minds open to the possibility of Iranians not all being terrorists," she says.</i><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2006-08-30-female-tourist_x.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2006-08-30-female-tourist_x.htm" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>.

<p>To <a href="../../../h/u/x/User%7EHux_eafc.html" title="User:Hux">User:Hux</a>: You say that US law affords no right to multiple citizenship. Show me the law. As for the oath I was told it is <b>symbolic</b>. When you go for naturalization no one and I mean <b>no one</b> will attempt to take away your citizenships or demand that you revoke your citizenships or even ask what you are going to do about the other citizenships. No one tells you, "You have to drop all other citizenships". There are people who are citizens of 4 or even 5 countries and they are open about it and have no problems with US authorities. This is the wonderful thing about US, no matter what anyone says it is more free than most (if not all) other nations. This is my opinion of course. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 12:16, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Korshid: When I said that US law affords no <i>right</i> to multiple citizenship I was implying that there is no law saying that anyone has that right, hence the statement, "all Americans have 100% right to multiple-citizenship", is false. If you are asserting that one <i>does</i> have such a right under US law then the onus is on you, as the positive claimant, to prove it. Note, however, that my saying that no such right exists does not equate to saying that a person is <i>incapable</i> of having multiple citizenship. Like I said, even though one renounces all claims to other countries upon becoming a naturalized US citizen, the US government has no power to take away foreign citizenship.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the naturalization pledge, it's certainly not just symbolic! It's an oath that, in part, forms the basis of the government's legal justification to enforce the Immigration and Nationality Act, e.g. if a naturalized citizen joins the army of a country fighting against the US, the government is empowered to revoke US citizenship. There is also a very significant moral component to the oath if one is religious, given that it concludes, "so help me God." To suggest that it is nothing more than symbolism is to seriously downgrade the part it plays in what it <i>means</i> to become a naturalized US citizen.</dd>

So it's always possible there's another there that we don't know about.

<p>Is anyone really contending that the <i>majority</i> POV isn't that Ansari is considered the first female space tourist at this point? I read Machocarioca's edit summaries and followed the advice to read the Helen Sharman page. It doesn't talk about her being a tourist at all. There was one news article that refered to Ansari as the seconf space tourist, but this seems to be a very minority POV. How can we cover this porperly in the article?

But is clearly that Sharman was. How do you define a woman who worked as a chemist and was selected as "astronaut" beating 13,000 applicants responding to a radio advertisement? I call her a space tourist that do not paid for her ticket ( I didn't say she paid, read again.) And I'm not alone here or outside wiki. You know what an astronaust is all about?

<p>To Hektor: I think the trouble maker here are you, because you understand nothing about photo copyright, my friend, and want rule your POV to me as "The Truth".</p>
<p>I will repeat what I said and pay attention this time, please: Of course the image series has a credit, all photographs have, someone did that shots, right? The camera do not work by itself. But it doesn't have copyright, of course. Why? Did you read copyright in the credits? No.</p>
<p>Because Soyuz flights to ISS are a joint-venture among Russia and US. All press material belongs to both spacial agencies. And all press material by NASA is public domain. That photo(not the one you showed) was uploaded from Ansari's official biography on NASA site. That press kit and all in it belongs to NASA and is public domain, ok?

<li>Soyuz flight are Russian governmental flights which have nothing to do neither with NASA nor with the US government. The press material related to a Soyuz flight does not belong to NASA, but to Roscosmos, the Russian space agency. The pictures were taken on the Russian territory, at Star City, by a Roscosmos employee or contractor. The fact that Roscosmos allows NASA to use this material on their own web site does not mean that the use by a THIRD PARTY is allowed. <a href="../../../h/e/k/User%7EHektor_6d63.html" title="User:Hektor">Hektor</a> 08:10, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Soyuz flights are Russian governmental flights, I agree, but this is not just a Soyuz flight, is a Soyuz-ISS flight, an international misson to ISS, ( with a russian cosmonaut, an american astroanut and a space tourist}) and this type of missions are, you want it or not, a joint venture among both space agencies. All press material belongs to both agencies. Roscosmos didn't ALLOWED NASA to use the material, the material belongs to NASA too. All photographs of past three male space tourists are in the same case. "The pictures were taken on the Russian territory"&#160;?!?!? What?? What is this linked to copyright, man? If it was a mission launched from Cape Canaveral, with russian and american crew, image probably would be done in US Territory and the mission would be the same.</li>

<dd>Hi Machocarioca. Thanks for coming to talk about this. Hopefully we can all work to develop a good encyclopedic article here. I don't think the whole space tourist thing is very clear cut. It's a fairly new term, and those to whom it's applied seem to find it distateful (Ansari included). But it is a term in common useage at the moment and one that tries to make a distinction that people are very interested in. When it comes to who falls into the category, there's no one official body that we can turn to for a definitive list. Nevertheless, your argument above is a matter of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. We aren't supposed to be giving our opinions of what a term means. We should be writing an article that reflects all significant points of view in a way appropriate to their weight in the field of experts in the given area (difficult in what is currently, mainly a news-based story). Your view of Ansari as the second female space tourist does not seem to be widely shared, especially by those who study space exploration. --<a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa">Siobhan Hansa</a> 11:59, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Siobhan Hansa, thanks for your message. Nice words , let´s work to develop a good encyclopedic article here, this one is not and I´m not the "bandit" here, just an user trying to improve the article. Really, the whole space tourist thing is not very clear cut, then people can't say that Ansari is the first one. The only distinction here is who paid the ticket first . Tito, Ansari, Olsen,Shuttleworth paid their tickets. Sharman and Akiyama (first japanese in space, a journalist not an astronaut) not. All of them are space tourists but only the first four paid for the trip, right? Space tourist isn't who pay the ticket but who isn't an astronaut/cosmonaut/taikonaut.</p>
<p>If I am minority here, many agree with me. As you, I´m a space exploration student and afficionate too, and can't accept this thing on Ansari being the first tourist, she's obviously the first female who paid, just that. NBC ("Others, including British lottery winner Helen Sharman and Japanese TV journalist Toyohiro Akiyama, have flown to Russia's Mir space station under commercial arrangements as far back as 1990, but those passengers didn't pay their own way.")<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14452905/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14452905/" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> and BBC ("The telecommunications tycoon from Texas, became the fourth person - and first woman - to pay an estimated $20m to travel into space. Ansari is the first space tourist to have passionately pursued the development of private space flight, using her grounding in business and science to do this.")<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5345872.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5345872.stm" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> agree with me. Mr Hector do not like sources that disagree with his POV.</p>
<p>My friend, we don't have a consensus here and I can't accept what is written in the article. Now it's protected but is my right change it when it turns operational, until we agree in a consensus about how to write the hole thing. The fact is, we need appropriate terms there.

<dd>Machocarian, you provide one source that backs up your claim, but the other (the BBC article) does not. It states Ansari is the "fourth person and first woman to pay" (talks about her being female but no explicit definition of this being tourism or not), and the first "tourist to have passionately pursued the development of private space flight" (talks about her being a tourist but no reference to whether there were other women or not). So there's nothing in the article that shows a position either way on whether there were other female space tourists before her. So far you have provided just the one reference, which would make it a very minority POV given that there are 11 references in the article right now that label her <i>first female space tourist</i>. So I'm not sure how useful it is for you in the long term, to simply say "it's my right to change it." Sure (once protection is lifted) you <i>can</i> change it. But it'll just continue to be an ugly mess if there aren't a greater proportion or higher quality of external sources supporting your position. In this situation, if this ends up going through other dispute resolution channels, it is unlikely you'd find the support from the community to continue putting your wording in the lead summary. So we all need to open up a little and try to find a way that represents the external sources appropriately.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I wonder if we could change tack with this, and look for entirely different wording that will satisfy everyone. In the BBC article you linked to they label Ansari - <i>"The first space tourist to have passionately pursued the development of private space flight."</i> It seems to me this is a much more significant claim than "first female tourist", and one that better reflects Ansari's previous involvement in the X PRIZE and the partnership with Space Adventures Ltd. Would everyone be comfortable with that wording. --<a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa">Siobhan Hansa</a> 21:17, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are not going to allow the edit war to end until you get your issue resolved, thereby blocking other users from updating topics in this article that have nothing to do with your particular gripe. You are therefore bullying. If a consensus is never reached I suppose it wouldn't bother you to have this article protected for eternity? What you need to do is understand that conflicts happen, but edit wars are not needed to solve them.

<p>Hi again, <a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa">Siobhan Hansa</a>. Well, I think the point is: there are, by actual standards, reasonable doubts (not for me ) about this fact, "the first" one, including among press sources and among users here. This is an encyclopedia and we must try being exact. Then, this "first female tourist", isn't exact, right? So, I'll be confortable with that wording you found. It´s exact.

While Sharman may be closer in spirit to NASA's discarded "citizen in space" program, she was a working scientist with a Ph.D., had a full training regimen, and ultimately flew at the Soviet space program's expense (the Juno program failed to raise the money it promised). The RSA does not retroactively consider her a "space tourist" and neither should we. Finally, she did <i>not</i> win her place by lottery.

<p>I would just like to voice my disapproval of the way this issue has been handled. Machocarioca, the article is currently locked and thus cannot be updated <i>entirely</i> because of this edit war you have engaged in over something that is really very pedantic. Yes, there is room for discussion on whether Ansari is the first female space tourist, but continually changing the article to your personal opinion in defiance of, it seems, pretty much everyone else's views is not a reasonable way to deal with the issue. If your edits get reverted then the proper course of action is to raise the issue here and perhaps call for a vote in order to find a consensus. Right now your actions have simply screwed things up for everyone. Hopefully you'll learn from this and refrain from such edit wars in the future. There are established procedures for dealing with these situations on Wikipedia. If they're followed then we all benefit.

<p><a href="../../../h/u/x/User%7EHux_eafc.html" title="User:Hux">Hux</a> , if there's a room (a large one) for discussion on whether Ansari is the first female space tourist and a reasonable doubt about how this afirmation is exact, I think the expression "first female tourist" isn't apropriate, agree? Then, it can´t be there. I feel more confortable with <i>"The first space tourist to have passionately pursued the development of private space flight."</i> claimed by user Siobhan Hansa, meanwhile we discuss the final term here. What do you think about?</p>
<p>This is not just my POV.(this is not a POV really, is the fact) The fact is that I'm the only discussing the hole thing here, not the only one with this POV.

<dd>Machocarioca, this is POV-pushing and is getting out of bounds. "First female space tourist" is both the official description (NASA/Roskosmos) and the commonly-accepted one (wire services, major news media). I have no idea why it's important to you to muddy these waters, but you are not providing any citations for your <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Sharman did not buy her own ticket to space, she was an accredited research cosmonaut sponsored by a private organization. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 03:18, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Machocarioca: You seem to be making an assumption of, "if there is any doubt then [term x] should not be used". This is a poor assumption. The accurate assumption for Wikipedia would be, "use the most commonly used term; if there is <i>significant</i> doubt then note that doubt in the article and list alternative terms." Accordingly, we should use "first female space tourist" by default since that's what nearly every media and official outlet is using. (PS Could you please use colons correctly when adding your comments? It's getting difficult to know what part of this epic discussion you're responding to.) -- <a href="../../../h/u/x/User%7EHux_eafc.html" title="User:Hux">Hux</a> 18:46, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> It's important to me to muddy these waters as you said, because this statement is not an exact fact.

So, Sharman didn't buy her ticket? You need to buy one to be a tourist?? Can't you win one as a gift? She won hers. POV is people saying Ansari is the first one. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMachocarioca_6a66.html" title="User:Machocarioca">Machocarioca</a> 07:58, 23 September 2006 (UTC)machocarioca</p>
<dl>
<dd>Machocarioca: First off, your link doesn't support your position. The paragraph near the bottom that begins, "Anousheh Ansari would be the world's fourth..." clearly groups her with Tito, Shuttleworth and Olsen as space tourists. It then goes on to draw a distinction between these four and Sharman/Akiyama, the implication being that the latter two were not tourists.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, the distinction is obvious: Tito, Shuttleworth, Olsen and Ansari all booked their passage through Space Adventures, which is a <i>tourism company</i>, so it is appropriate to call them "tourists." Sharman's situation was very different: Project Juno could never reasonably be described as a project to select a space tourist. It was about finding Britain's first astronaut and she was picked from 13,000 applicants.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, Wikipedia, being a descriptive, explanatory source, should stick to the most commonly used descriptions wherever possible, particularly when they match the official description. As Dhartung notes, Ansari is the first female space tourist according official sources as well as the <i>vast</i> majority of news media. This fact alone should trump anyone's individual opinion. -- <a href="../../../h/u/x/User%7EHux_eafc.html" title="User:Hux">Hux</a> 18:38, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>You have been repeating over and over that she won her flight though it appears to me that she was selected just like any astronaut or cosmonaut from a pool of a large number of candidates.

<dd>"<i>Because the UK doesn't currently support manned missions, people in this country are extremely unlikely to become astronauts. The one exception to this was Helen Sharman, who was part of the crew on the Juno mission to the Russian MIR space station in 1991. This is because the mission was partly funded by British companies. Michael Foale and Piers Sellers, the other two Britons who have been in space, were both able to do so because they have dual British-American citizenship.</i>"</dd>

<dd>This is consistent with the statement that a lottery and other private funding was used to pay for the mission, but that Helen Sharman was selected through the normal cosmonaut selection process.--<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurzum_dc29.html" title="User:Burzum">Burzum</a> 21:42, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Zereshk: there are two issues in play here. Firstly, can the specific image you uploaded be used under Wikipedia's Fair Use policy? I argue that it cannot be for two reasons:
<ul>
<li>The image itself has had its copyright attribution removed</li>
<li>The copyright attribution on the image's hosting page is incorrect (azargoshnasp.net is not the copyright holder and is not authorized to give such permission).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The second issue is whether the original image (with the "Getty Images" text at the bottom) can be used. This is more open to interpretation, but I would argue that it still cannot be used, again for two reasons:
<ul>
<li>It falls foul of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode17/usc_sec_17_00000107----000-.html" class="external text" title="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode17/usc_sec_17_00000107----000-.html" rel="nofollow">statutory four point test</a> for Fair Use (points three and four, specifically).</li>
<li>It falls foul of the first three points of Wikipedia's <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFair_use_26b6.html#Policy" title="WP:Fair use">policy</a> regarding the use of non-free images.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Basically, the Getty company makes a living selling such images to the media, so we can't just use them for nothing when freely usable images are available unless there is something specific about that image that no other image can convey AND only a portion of the image is used, not the whole thing. -- <a href="../../../h/u/x/User%7EHux_eafc.html" title="User:Hux">Hux</a> 19:04, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think youre basically putting up an argument against all fairuse images, because getty isnt the only company that makes a living off of photos, and yet we see many other images (including getty) accepted and used here on WP. Furthermore, it's not a problem: like I said, we could change the link to BBC instead of Azargoshnasp and we could replace the image with the image that does have the copyright tag. But I see that youre highly reluctant to do even this. And that is sad, because such moves will only be seen in a highly negative light by many many (in fact millions) readers such as myself, and will discredit WP even further as a biased source of info. We will all be thinking: <i>see? they just <b>had</b> to erase the Iranian flag even for a single event like this. The only time they will put up an Iranian flag in the media is next to a nuclear warhead or some zealous Ayatollah.</i> Especially that NONE of the three points of WP:Fairuse are violated as you claim there are. Anyhow, you can enforce and hide the fact that she is Iranian, but that wont change reality.

<dd>Zerkesh, The argument has always been that there is no fair use argument when there is another image available that is not copyrighted. And you have not addressed that argument; an argument that is about the ability of wikipedia to operate in a legal (and for many participants - ethical) way. It makes no difference if some people are heartened that WP showed an Iranian flag if WP is no longer able to serve any pages at all. If you want your truth to be heard in the world through WP, you need to try and do so in a manner that is in keeping with WP objectives and policies, and won't get WP into too much legal trouble to operate. Copyright is one of the issues that could shut WP down. So find a reasonable quality, Free image of Ansari that shows the flag on her uniform, and it will be welcome on the page. I'm sure most editors here would thing it was fantastic and defend its inclusion. --<a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa">Siobhan Hansa</a> 01:41, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Zerkesh: Your objections to my earlier post make no sense. I'm not putting up an argument against Fair Use. <b>If</b> there was something about that image that was unique and <b>if</b> no free alternative was available then I would support it being used according to Wikipedia's Fair Use policy. That image does not satisfy this criteria so, as Siobhan notes, it should not be used. It's that simple.</dd>

<dd>Regarding your assertion of systemic bias, I'm sorry but that's weak. This has nothing to do with bias whatsoever. If you can find a freely usable image that shows Ansari with the Iranian patch on her uniform then I would have no objection at all. In fact, if it was a better quality image than the one we currently have then I would <i>actively support</i> it. Personally I think the quality of the current one is pretty nasty.</dd>

<dd>And as for your implication that I, personally, am trying to "hide the fact that she is Iranian", that's an amazingly ignorant, not to mention rude assumption. It reminds me of the people who immediately categorize anyone as antisemitic the moment they voice any disapproval with the concept of Zionism. Guess what: it is possible to remove an image that happens to feature an Iranian flag <i>for reasons that have nothing to do with that flag</i>. This is one of those occasions. And for your information, if anyone changed the article to remove the fact that she is Iranian (e.g by changing "Iranian-American" to "American") I would revert it ASAP. -- <a href="../../../h/u/x/User%7EHux_eafc.html" title="User:Hux">Hux</a> 19:11, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The image <i>is</i> unique, Hux. Please show us another image, even just one, with Ansari wearing the Iranian flag. Is there any? Furthermore, the image is highly significant because of the de-emblemed flag of Iran she is wearing. She's making a political statement right there, which is directly relevant to the article and very important. She is pro-Iranian, but not pro-I.R.I. and not pro-opposition (royalist, MKO, etc). That image speaks volumes about her position on feedom in Iran.--67.11.240.167 23:43, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>User:67.11.240.167 (perhaps you could give us a name instead of an anonymous IP address?): First, please do your research - Ansari wanted to fly with the US flag on one shoulder and the <i>pre-revolution Iranian flag</i> on the other. Both the US and Russian space agencies objected to this so she compromised by removing the emblem. If she was originally intending to make a political statement then it was clearly an anti-theocratic one. However, she and her husband have both said since then that she simply wants to indicate support for both the US and Iran. Secondly, the issue is not just whether it is unique, but whether that uniqueness is something that is vital to the article. Imo, the Cosmonaut infobox should show the best quality Cosmonaut image we can find. That one clearly isn't it, plus as has been said numerous times: if there's a choice between an image used under Fair Use and a free image, we should always use the free one. However, I <i>do</i> think it would be good to have an <i>additional</i> image showing the Iranian flag, perhaps in a section of the article that specifically talks about her choice of wearing both flags. I would support this particular image in that context since I don't think there is a better one. But frankly, having said all this why don't we just wait a while? I'm sure over the next ten days Nasa will get a great looking image of her with both flags, so why are we spending so much time arguing over this? -- <a href="../../../h/u/x/User%7EHux_eafc.html" title="User:Hux">Hux</a> 16:34, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It's part of the press kit at Ansari's website, so there's no copyright problem, and it was used previously in the infobox until it was replaced by the Getty Images one and, since then, the current image (which I believe comes from NASA). Is there a particular reason why it should <i>not</i> be used? It seems to be the most appropriate given the purpose of that infobox. The only reason I can think of for not using it is because it implies that spaceflight is her profession, when obviously she's a businesswoman first and foremost.

<dd>Unfortunately there is a "problem" with the copyright - it's copyrighted and not realeased under an Open License. Ansari is keeping the right to determine how the image is used by not releasing it under a license that protects the users - so she <i>could</i> demand it be taken down at a later date if she wanted. Under Wikipedia's rules we can only use it in fair use situations. Since we have a public domain photo of Ansari, it fails the fair use conditions. Wikipedia's intention is to create an encyclopedia of <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_content.html" title="Open content">Open content</a> as far as possible, so others can take that content and do as they please with it. If we include images that cannot be used under the same conditions as the text, we're not doing our best to get there. At least, this is how I undeerstand the situation. Hopefully we'll get more open content material soon. --<a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa">Siobhan Hansa</a> 16:14, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I take your points and agree wholeheartedly with the open content argument. However, your interpretation of Wikipedia's Fair Use policy is overly strict. Copyrighted images <i>can</i> be used under that policy if they depict something for which there is no free image available, which in this case would be "Anousheh Ansari the cosmonaut" as opposed to just a generic image of her. I haven't been able to find a freely usable image of Ansari in her spacesuit so in lieu of that I would say that this is usable under the context of the policy (although I accept that there is room for argument on this point). The free image that is currently being used is in the cosmonaut template but it doesn't effectively illustrate that she's a cosmonaut. I think this one is better, at least until we can find a free one. -- <a href="../../../h/u/x/User%7EHux_eafc.html" title="User:Hux">Hux</a> 21:39, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I would&#160;!vote, if possible, to get broader support for using the image first, because it seems we've had a lot of image changes on the page, and significant amounts of time with no images, and I don't think that's particularly good for the article. But if Wikipedia is going to let it stay, I think it's a grat photo. --<a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa">Siobhan Hansa</a> 22:48, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let me clarify what happened. The image we have there is copyrighted by Roscosmos / Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center. Images on NASA websites are PD "unless otherwise specified", and the picture here has been taken by Roscosmos. Normally NASA takes pictures from the crew when they come to Johnson Space Center for familiarization training, but unfortunately at that time <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daisuke_Enomoto_3c9f.html" title="Daisuke Enomoto">Daisuke Enomoto</a> was Prime so they took only good pictures of Enomoto, such as the one which illustrates the Enomoto article. The picture of Ansari with the space suit was taken at Star City, the "not-so-good image" of Ansari but free was taken at NASA JSC in Building 9 in the Destiny laboratory mock-up. It is a crop of a picture where she was with Enomoto. IMHO, there is no Fair Use justification since after all there are free alternatives. The "not-so-good image" being taken in an ISS lab mock-up it is a good demonstration she is indeed a cosmonaut. My suggestion&#160;: why don't you just wait for a while for a good picture taken while on board the ISS by the crew&#160;? They will be NASA and PD&#160;!!!<a href="../../../h/e/k/User%7EHektor_6d63.html" title="User:Hektor">Hektor</a> 20:26, 23 September 2006 (UTC) Otherwise, why not <a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/station/crew-14/html/jsc2006e39244.html" class="external text" title="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/station/crew-14/html/jsc2006e39244.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a>&#160;?</dd>

<dd>As far as I can see, people are confusing the former with the latter because they look so similar. I can't find any source that says the latter is a Roscosmos image. Therefore, given that it's on a NASA bio it's PD "unless otherwise specified," as you say. (I'm betting that both images were taken at the same time, one by the Roscosmos photographer and one by NASA's photographer.)</dd>

<dd>This is not question of harmlessness. This is question of verifiability. If this person <i>published</i> his opinion in a news report or journal or something, then that is something. But a newsgroup??? No way. Additionally as I said this issue of Ramadan has <i>nothing</i> to do with the article. For all we know Anousheh Ansari is a <i>secular</i> Muslim or <i>non-observant</i>. If the tourist in question was anyone else, we would not even be discussing this because so-and-so author would not decide to give his opinion about Ramadan. This is far from harmless, but insensitive and potentially misleading, among other things. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 07:44, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

She does not observe hijab obviously, and for all we know she does not pray (according to Islamic ritual method) or observe this and that. It is subjective. Perhaps someone like Oberg and many others like him assume <i>all Muslims are the same</i>. This is <b>false</b>. To add the information you call "harmless" is in fact controversial. This is a biography article and one should take care what is added, and there is a WP <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">policy</a> on this. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 07:47, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you're going to great lengths to interpret what is potentially harmful. (I just think it's interesting, for example. I have always found most Muslims are eager to have open-minded discussions about many things with regard to Islam, and would not expect this to offend.) This is not a fact about Ansari herself. Indeed, such religious questions have been raised before, when <a href="../../../s/u/l/Sultan_bin_Salman_bin_Abdulaziz_al-Saud_e35c.html" title="Sultan bin Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud">Prince Sultan</a> flew (directing figuring into Ramadan) and when <a href="../../../i/l/a/Ilan_Ramon_ba01.html" title="Ilan Ramon">Ilan Ramon</a> flew, and Malaysia in particular is formally investigating the issue for its Muslim astronauts.<a href="http://www.newscientistspace.com/article/dn9031-when-youre-in-orbit-which-way-is-mecca.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newscientistspace.com/article/dn9031-when-youre-in-orbit-which-way-is-mecca.html" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> That said, I agree the importance of the issue is low (and on her blog, she speaks of God as "it", the meaning of which choice is known only to her). --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 08:35, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In that quote the astronaut has directly stated that he is religious and observant and feels as though he is "representing all Jews". So you see he has already brought the issue of religion into play. And Salman Abdulaziz is a blood member of the House of Saud - a royal family and like all members of monarchies a "representative" of whatever religion they belong to which in case of House of Saud is the extremist Salafist/Wahabi sect of Islam which al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden also belongs to and are dedicated to imposing on the entire world.</dd>

<dd>Anousheh Ansari has neither made issue of religion nor has any connection to religion. She was simply asked in an interview if she is Muslim and she replied that she is "liberal Muslim" which could mean lots of things. She has nowhere stated that she feels she is representing Muslims or anything having to do with religion or that she will observe Ramadan nor has she requested <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halal.html" title="Halal">halal</a> food or anything like that. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 09:02, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What are you talking about? People like Oberg are <i>directly responsible</i> for the continuation of so-called "cultural divides" by assuming all Muslims are the same and that we have the same practices and beliefs etc. People like him are responsible for the misconception that "Middle Eastern" is a race and ethnicity or that everyone from that region is Arab or speaks Arabic or is Muslim. Cultural divides are put up by people who have racist views but who ironically deny that they are racist. Iran and America are more similar than people like him would like to accept. Before revolution there was no "divide" between America and Iran. It is people like him (and Jimmy Carter and BushCo. and the like) who wanted to see Iran become what it is today.

<dd>I'm really not keen on this link. Including it implies it's something Ansari is interested in, when as far as I can tell, she has nothing to do with it. Using external links doesn't let us off the need to have it be encyclopedic and <i>topical</i> for the article. It should go on an appropriate article, otherwise it's a form of link spamming - using an article to push a site to more prominence, whether that's in order to make money, or to promote a particular issue/POV. --<a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa">Siobhan Hansa</a> 20:54, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>(resetting indent) Septentrionalis, i don't want the use of one term to get in the way of communication. The question is - in what way is the link you want to see connected to the subject of the article? And is the content linked to encyclopedic? In general usenet groups are not cosidered encylopedic because (among other things) it is not normally possible to verify the identity of the poster and are not subject to fact checking. And with this post specifically - it is not related to this article. The fact that a poster uses Ansari as a jumping off pointto talk about Ramadan is not sufficient connection to the subject of this wikipedia article. It <i>might</i> have been a reasonable connection had Ansari brought it up - but this is not. --<a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa">Siobhan Hansa</a> 18:12, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Without the abuse and threats, I probably wouldn't have added it back, and I certainly won't revert war with a civil editor. (I take it that Ansari <i>wasn't</i> actually watching for the New Moon?) However, I don't see the post as jumping off into Ramadan; this is a space buff discussing a possible effect of space flight. As for verifiability: we can certainly take the link to <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Oberg_97d0.html" title="James Oberg">James Oberg</a> off; the rest of it makes no assertion except that the post exists and has that title.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Without Ansari (or someone else in a position to know) telling us, I don't see how we can know if she was watching or not. It's mere speculation. Which is one of the reasons I think the link is highly inappropriate. External links are still supposed to further the encylopedic purpose of the article. Even if the link was to a well respected, peer reviewed paper from an authority in the field, I think it would be inappropriate. But to a newsgroup posting? If we can't be sure the posting is by someone who's an expert then it's not really an appropriate link for any wikipedia article. Would you please consider removing the link yourself? With the recent increase in interest in the implications of space travel on religious experience and practice, it may be an appropriate subject for a well sourced article of its own, but it's relevence here escapes me. --<a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa">Siobhan Hansa</a> 19:15, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have to agree with Siobhan. Even if we completely ignore the fact that the source is a <i>Usenet posting</i>, at some point there is a line that must be drawn between "biographically relevant" and "connected, but tangental". The former belongs in the article; the latter does not. In my opinion, this particular example falls squarely in the latter category. It could prove very interesting and worthwhile as part of a separate article, but it's very much out of place in this one. -- <a href="../../../h/u/x/User%7EHux_eafc.html" title="User:Hux">Hux</a> 20:11, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This Wikipedia article says Anousheh Ansari is a cosmonaut? (normally used to identify the Russians). [Just below her image]. Can anyone correctly describe her official title? 130.194.5.129 06:35, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>She is a <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmonaut.html" title="Cosmonaut">cosmonaut</a> because she was launched aboard a Russian vehicle. Her cosmonaut <i>rank</i> is Spaceflight Participant, a title which was agreed on between the US and Russia for space tourists. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 08:03, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the reply. However, this explaination seems fussy and incorrect.</p>
<p>No where in NASA web sites state that Anousheh Ansari is a cosmonaut <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/157366main_ansari.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/157366main_ansari.pdf" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>. NASA web pages mention her as a <i>Spaceflight Participant</i>. Also, if the cosmonaut title is given to human who travels in a Russian spacecraft, then what about the commander of Expedition 14, Michael Lopez-Alegria?. He is called as an astronaut in NASA pages. Again Thomas Reiter is an astronaut <a href="http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/reiter-t.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/reiter-t.html" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> and has flown in both Russian and American spaceships (Euromir - 95) and the shuttle.</p>
<p>Hence, can anyone supply the exact defnition of the astronaut and cosmonaut titles&#160;?. Can Anousheh Ansari be called as a cosmonaut?</p>
<p>In one of the Johnson Space Flight Center's web pages <a href="http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/cosmo.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/cosmo.html" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>, the following is stated: <i>The term cosmonaut refers to those space sailors who are members of the Russian space program</i>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is a tricky question, because the word astronaut has a generic meaning as well as being an applied title. I'm going to open up a discussion at <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template_talk%7EInfobox_Astronaut_ba7c.html#Astronaut.2FCosmonaut" title="Template talk:Infobox Astronaut">Template talk:Infobox Astronaut#Astronaut/Cosmonaut</a>, because this applies to several different pages, not just this one. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 06:14, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That would be great. Yes, indeed it is a tricky one and that is why I thought of asking the question from Wikipedians. Once people/experts come to an agreement about using the words astronaut/cosmonaut, it could be applied to all Wikipedia pages. Personally, in Ansousheh Ansari's Bio, I would like her not calling as a cosmonaut [this is also consitent with NASA web pages]. As NASA and Russian space agency have agreed better to stick to the title <i>Spaceflight Participant</i>. 130.194.5.129 07:12, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think there are two solutions:
<ul>
<li>Use only the astronaut term as a term established in English language for all those people.</li>
<li>Use both terms based on official qualification/rank of a person. So a person travelled in space of received special training could be cosmonaut, astronaut, or both, or neither, depending on their qualifications, official status and certificates. At least in Russia there are official terms (qualifications) "pilot-cosmonaut", "cosmonaut-tester" etc. But then we maybe should use not generic, but more specific term "pilot-cosmonaut" for example instead simply "cosmonaut" as any Russian encyclopedy does. But this approach requires additional research on every person.--<a href="../../../n/i/x/User%7ENixer_51c2.html" title="User:Nixer">Nixer</a> 07:57, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>ASTRONAUT is a word in the dictionary meaning: a person who travels beyond the earth's atmosphere; also&#160;: a trainee for spaceflight <a href="http://merriam-webster.com/dictionary/astronaut" class="external text" title="http://merriam-webster.com/dictionary/astronaut" rel="nofollow">Source: Merriam-Webster</a></li>

</ul>
<p>End of the discussion, why?, because that's why we have dictionaries to resolve disputes in terms, not for us to invent them, 'space turist' is clearly and apocriphous term invented byt the uneducated press, now, who rules the language?, the press or the academy? Ansari, Tito, Shuttleworth, Olsen, Simonyi, are COSMONAUTS, period. now, COSMONAUTS have RANKS, their rank is SPACE FLIGHT PARTICIPANT</p>

<dd>Hi. Yelling doesn't make your point sound stronger. Certainly choosing the one generic term "astronaut" is one way of approaching this, but there is long-established usage precedent for calling everyone who goes up on a Russian vehicle a cosmonaut. On the other hand the Chinese government translates itself with the word "astronaut". Other countries insist on their own terminology. This will only become more difficult as more countries send people to space. We were unable to resolve this satisfactorily at <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template_talk%7EInfobox_Astronaut_ba7c.html#Astronaut.2FCosmonaut" title="Template talk:Infobox Astronaut">Template_talk:Infobox Astronaut#Astronaut.2FCosmonaut</a>, unfortunately. In any case, we are not limited to using only words that have dictionary definitions, especially since new words arrive all the time and dictionaries only come once every few years. The newspapers all use "space tourist", so are you going to write to them all and tell them they are using a made-up word? --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 20:41, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The whole current events section, especially the parts based on interviews, is excessively detailed and written in a conversational style, not appropriate for an encyclopedia.

<p>When I first wrote "Interview" I tried to note her interview was politically charged underneath. The sentence that helped this in the text were later trimmed.

"Interview" and the rest may be deleted, except for the flag story which would be kept briefly. Indeed I suggest we delete the whole "current events" and keep the flag story and the experiments.</p>

<p>As astute editors will see from the history, Machocarioca keeps changing the image in the infobox, after which another editor immediately reverts it. This has been going on for several days and each reverter has requested that Machocarioca build consensus on the talk page, something that he has thus far failed to attempt. I am opening this specific discussion to attempt to build such a consensus on the legitimacy of this photo's use on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>The photo in question can be found at the sites listed below, all of which are relevant to my comments here:</p>

<p>As you can see, the photos on the first two links above do not show any copyright attribution. Ordinarily, one could assume from this that it is a NASA image (since NASA's policy is that all images on their site are NASA images "unless otherwise stated") and thus public domain. However, the third link above clearly attributes this photo to "AP Photo/Prodea Systems Inc". If this attribution is correct then according to Wikipedia policy we cannot use it when there are freely usable images available that will serve equally well on a biography article.</p>
<p>I have emailed Mrs Ansari's press contact to see if she can clear up the copyright issue. Hopefully that will put a lid on this.

<dd>You have second hand information from the Ansari company guys, but you have no direct info from NASA. Frankly, I think now we need an email from NASA PR to confirm the rules at this point. This image seems like one from a set, and since one is copyrighted Roscosmos, I would like to be sure that all of them are not copyrighted by Roscosmos. Since we don't know the copyright agreements between NASA and Roscosmos, the fact that the image can be found in a NASA press kit is not definitive proof for me. All we know for sure is that a very similar image, taken in the same context, is copyrighted. <a href="../../../h/e/k/User%7EHektor_6d63.html" title="User:Hektor">Hektor</a> 09:13, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I take your point. Any idea how to contact NASA on this? I'd be happy to do it since I've already gone this far with it. However, I don't think that just because one is a Roscosmos image that all similar ones must also be. It could easily be that the Roscosmos photographer took the first one and the NASA photographer took this one at the same time. That would make sense given that they wouldn't want to set everything up for the official photo more than once. Much easier to get all the photographers together in one place and let them get their shots. -- <a href="../../../h/u/x/User%7EHux_eafc.html" title="User:Hux">Hux</a> 15:20, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But why then should NASA put Roscosmos images in the <a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/station/crew-14/preflight/ndxpage10.html" class="external text" title="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/station/crew-14/preflight/ndxpage10.html" rel="nofollow">image gallery</a> and not their own? You should note that all images of this set (cosmonauts in Sokol space suits in front of their land's flag) are credited to Roscosmos, many other images instead (see <a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/station/crew-14/preflight/ndxpage11.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/station/crew-14/preflight/ndxpage11.html" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>) are taken by the NASA photograph Victor Zelentsov and so credited to NASA. I fear the discussed Ansari image is indeed a Roscosmos one, but the best way to know this would be to contact NASA in the matter of using Roscosmos images (there are many of them in NASA's gallery, e.g. some of the official photos of Soyuz crews, which could be usefull for us). If someone could do it, it would be great. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBricktop_9636.html" title="User:Bricktop">Bricktop</a> 16:38, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>NASA say on their website that everything is available for free use unless otherwise stated. How does NASA normally state an image isn't free? Because while I see that the image is credited to Roscosmos, the page doesn't say that he has copyright. It is possible (some would even say good practice) to credit an author even if the work is public domain. --<a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa">Siobhan Hansa</a> 18:38, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

In addition to this, I have received a communication from Ansari's press contact that the image should be credited to NASA. Therefore, as it stands right now it should be considered a NASA image.

<dd>So you think that NASA shipped a photograph at 5000USD the roundtrip plane ticket from Houston to Moscow plus 300 USD the hotel night in Moscow these days, just for the fun to take the same picture as Roscosmos, and, by the way, not put this picture in their galleries and just on the Press Kit&#160;? <a href="../../../h/e/k/User%7EHektor_6d63.html" title="User:Hektor">Hektor</a> 05:52, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. A photo inside a press release is specifically released to the press to be used in news stories. Since the press release doesn't explicitly cite whether the photos are by NASA (being public domain) or a copyrighted work of Roskosmos, we are in sort of a tough position. I think we have a strong argument that use of the photo in Wikipedia is acceptable since there is a very strong indication that the photo was released specifically for news and information by a reputable government organization even if it doesn't properly cite ownership. If this image is copyrighted, then we probably have implicit permission to use it since it was in a press release (and presumably NASA received permission to include it for the purpose of disseminating it to the press for use). I think this is sort of a silly issue since there are many PD images with Anousheh Ansari on the ISS that can used just as easily. This image is not worth all the energy that people have been expending.--<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurzum_dc29.html" title="User:Burzum">Burzum</a> 06:19, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have one update: the NASA guy wrote back to me, but the email was pretty much useless. He basically doesn't know who the photo should be attributed to, but wrote the email in that way a lot of people do when they're deliberately trying to avoid actually saying "I don't know."
