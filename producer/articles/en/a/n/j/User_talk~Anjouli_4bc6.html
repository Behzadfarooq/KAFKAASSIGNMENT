<p>Wik, can you explain why you deleted several paragraphs of discussion by various parties on 22 November?

<dd>Curious as to what might provoke someone to refactor someone else's talk page, I looked in the page history. Oddly enough, the previous version doesn't appear to be in the page history.

<dd>Hi Orthogonal. Do you mean the Mecca/Makkah talk page? There was a recent "move war" and a sneaky cut-and-paste move that disconnected the history. It was fixed as far as I know. If you mean <i>this</i> talk page, as far as I know it was never refactored by anyone but me. (I removed some resolved chat between me and Angela that was just taking up space.) <a href="../../../a/n/j/User%7EAnjouli_71d8.html" title="User:Anjouli">Anjouli</a> 07:02, 24 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

This is standard Wikipedia usage, because the ex-President of Liberia is much more common than the other Charles Taylors (judging from the links). But, I'm not a sysop, and I couldn't finish the move. I'm really sorry. I've appealed to <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">User:Maveric149</a> to finish the move --- I don't think I can either complete the move or undo it.&#160;:-( --- <a href="../../../h/i/k/User%7EHike395_91ce.html" title="User:Hike395">hike395</a> 07:34, 5 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I finished the move. Normally, the software allows you to overwrite the redirects (w/o having to delete them instead), but this time (for some strange reason) it didn't.

I don't everybody will always reach a consensus on everything on WP - but I think that's healthy. Perhaps I was wrong on this issue.

<p>Anjouli, what on earth is going on at Talk:Carmen by Horace? I can't make any sense out of the discussion there! It's been listed on VfD for 10 days, so I'm assuming others are having the same problem and ignoring it. As far as I can tell, 80.255 wants to keep (but gives no reason why), RickK, yourself and Daniel Quinlan want to delete it. MIRV and Smerdis of Tlön either want it deleted or moved. Bmills wants it merged with Horace. But I honestly have no idea what Onebyone, Binky or Domatrios are talking about. You seem to have to been following the discussion closely. Do you have any feeling over whether consensus to delete it has been reached? By the way, my only thought on it is that I don't want it at Wikisource. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 10:47, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a>. Yes, it is a bit of a mess, isn't it!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Basically we have an article titled as a work by Horace (<i>Carmen</i>). It actually contains a <b>different</b> Horace work (<i>Bandusia</i>), in the original Latin and with no translation, and a "critique" that is utter drivel.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Onebyone wants it moved to <i>Bandusia</i>. Binky felt the title matched the work. I pointed out he was wrong - perhaps a little strongly, on re-reading my remarks. (Sorry Binky.) He made no response, so presumably now agrees. Domatrios is discussing the merits of the WP voting process in an unusual form of English - I suspect he may be translating from Greek, word-by-word. He was the original author, although the "critique" was probably not written by him as it exhibits a different standard of English. I suspected a cut-and-paste job, but couldn't find the source anywhere on-line. I think Domatrios now agrees with deletion, or at least he says "I agree with my democratic executor Anjouli".

<dd>Hi Dieter. Yes, that is a very interesting site. Unfortunately that site does not seem to give any of the symbols names, other than the very simple ones, like <i>circle</i> etc. <a href="../../../a/n/j/User%7EAnjouli_71d8.html" title="User:Anjouli">Anjouli</a> 12:37, 5 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, you are right, Anjouli, Symbols com doesn't give it a name, which is a pity. Circumpunct, circumpunction or circumpunctuate, although they ought to be in it, so far haven't made the OED. However, there is no reason why, quite rightly a Brionist expression of the above should not be started and propagated. It will ultimately reach all dictionaries. Traditionally, it actually belongs to the family of "roundels" or "roundles", originally an heraldic device meaning a round shield, and they include dots surrounded by circles or bands, or inner concentric circles surrounded in the same way. I wish the word luck and success. --<a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDieter_Simon_f22e.html" title="User:Dieter Simon">Dieter Simon</a></dd>

<dd>The term certainly exists in Latin, and I have been told by a marine biologist that it forms part of the name of a fish that has the circumpunct pattern on its skin - but I could not find any on-line reference to that. I'm also told that it is in the <i>Complete</i> Oxford English Dictionary, but not having a copy I can't confirm that. (Anybody reading this and having a copy, please verify or refute.) It certainly does not appear much in Google but, as some on Wiki have found to their shame, just because something does not appear in Google does not mean it does not exist. The Internet is still young, and there must be huge amounts of obscure knowledge that still only exist in paper form. <a href="../../../a/n/j/User%7EAnjouli_71d8.html" title="User:Anjouli">Anjouli</a> 14:31, 8 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am sure you are right about the Latin term, Anjouli, but what troubles me on second thoughts, after I had been convinced it was just a matter of time before it would be in all dictionaries/encyclopedias, is the lack of supporting reference material for the term. What it is actually about is whether we can really introduce neologisms in a general, even though free encyclopedia such as Wiki, rather than garner them from other sources who have created/used them first, or at least refer back to them.<br />
Now, I did in fact check it out in the OED Second Edition of 1989, the only one available in the local library, and it wasn't in there. So, as you say if someone can lay their hands on the most recent edition of 2002, and search for us that would indeed be a great help. The way it looks at the moment, it is as though someone is pulling our leg about this, and it doesn't look terribly convincing. In fact, it does come over like some kind of vandalism because it just isn't supported by any other than Wikipedia sources. Sorry about that.--<a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDieter_Simon_f22e.html" title="User:Dieter Simon">Dieter Simon</a> 23:20, 8 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am sorry to be so brusque about it, Anjouli, but Menchi did check the word out in the up-to-date version as I did in the preceding edition of the OED, the full edition that is, and <i>circumpunct</i> isn't there. I earnestly beg you to redirect the article to <i>roundel</i> because that is what it really is and where it belongs. You can elaborate as much as you like then, introduce all the other types of roundel and make it a pretty good article.</p>
<p>Here are the various relevant entries for "roundel" in the OED edition, the 1989 one, I looked at:</p>
<ol>
<li>Roundel
<ol>
<li>A circle drawn, marked out, or formed in any way. Now dial.</li>
<li>Something forming a circle or ring; a number of things or persons disposed or grouped in a circle</li>
<li>The outer circuit or rim of anything</li>
<li>A round hole or hollow</li>
<li>A small round table</li>
<li>A round mat for vessels to stand on</li>
<li>A circular wooden trencher</li>
<li>A small round shield</li>
<li>A small circular object; a little disk or rounded piece</li>
<li>A perforated iron disk placed between the stock and cheeks of a gun</li>
<li>An ornamental circle sewn or embroidered on a garment</li>
<li>A decorative panel, plate, medallion, etc., of a round form</li>
<li>A circle of painted glass; a small round pane or window</li>
<li>An identification disc painted on an aeroplane; spe(cifically) that of the Royal Air Force and Royal Naval Air Command, comprising a design of concentric red, white, and blue circles</li>
<li>A sphere or globe</li>
<li>A ball or bead-moulding</li>
<li>The ball of the elbow- or the knee-joint</li>
<li>A cylinder (of wood); a rung of a ladder</li>
<li>A round turret (Sc.)</li>
<li>A circular bastion</li>
<li>A rondeau or rondel</li>
<li>A round dance</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Roundle
<ol>
<li>A ring or circle; an object of circular form; a disk' a round plate, etc.</li>
<li>Her(aldics) One of various circular charges distinguished by their tincture.</li>
<li>A sphere or globe</li>
<li>A round of a ladder</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As far as I noticed a few days ago, there is no article for <i>roundel</i> as yet. Why don't you make it a circumscribed dot or point? "To circmscribe" means "to draw a line tound", among other things. I leave that up to you. At least it would make it quite legit. What do you think? I would urge you to bear in mind Nos 8 and 14 which seem particularly relevant, because more countries than not have these "roundels" on their military aircraft with various designs, including the United States ( a white star surrounded by a circle), and they all call them roundel. --<a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDieter_Simon_f22e.html" title="User:Dieter Simon">Dieter Simon</a> 23:23, 9 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>It should be moved to "roundel" rather than redirected. Moving a page moves the history as well to the new page (roundel). Redirecting a page does not. --<a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDieter_Simon_f22e.html" title="User:Dieter Simon">Dieter Simon</a> 01:06, 11 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Anjouli, thank you for drawing attention to Rex Mundy's open letter. I appreciate your note very much. Mr Mundy seems a man of integrity, and I find it highly regrettable that he should have been attacked through offensive e-mails and and that people have attempted hacking into his website's server. That is not the way to conduct a civilised discourse. If you can pass this on to Mr Mundy I would be grateful. I do, however still stand by my two main objections which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Wikipedia we should not create articles on expressions, such as "circumpunct", terms that really only exist in the glossary of a website that advocates a particular movement and that do not exist anywhere else, as yet, not even the full edition of the Oxford English Dixtionary.</li>
<li>An encyclopedia should not include an article about a concept, be it a movement or a particular philosophy that has not as yet been established sufficiently to have entered the main-stream of public discussion and discourse. We should be seen to and be able to refer to sources other than those of the originators and thus be able to describe what is already in the public realm of reference.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are still the points I adhere to. But of course, this is all subject to the vote of the Wickipedia community as a whole. Thank you again --<a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDieter_Simon_f22e.html" title="User:Dieter Simon">Dieter Simon</a> 13:54, 17 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello Dieter. Thank you for your reply. I was originally under the impression that Circumpunct was a regular English word. It seems it is not and I do not contest that. Brianism apart, it <i>is</i> a correct description of the symbol in Latin, but of course that does not mean it should go in WP. It is a shame that all the data about the symbol, whatever we choose to call it, was moved to <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun_symbol.html" title="Sun symbol">Sun symbol</a> as it is not <i>only</i> a Sun symbol. We may as well have moved it to Town center symbol. I have been toying with the idea of recreating it under Circle with a dot in it and removing any reference to <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumpunct.html" title="Circumpunct">Circumpunct</a> or Brianism. What do you think?</p>
<p>As far as Brianism is concerned, I have withdrawn totally from that argument. I remain privately a Brianist, but have no further interest in whether or not it appears in WP. It may well be that it is too obscure a movement and I do not dispute that. Some other Brianists have behaved like trolls over this and have not done Brianism any good. Since even I lost my temper and asked for The Anome to be blocked when he replaced the entire article, the only ones who emerge from the argument with any dignity or credibility are the owners of brianism.org.<a href="../../../a/n/j/User%7EAnjouli_71d8.html" title="User:Anjouli">Anjouli</a> 14:16, 17 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, no need to apologise. I just tend to get a bit overly defensive of the deletion policy. Regarding the notes on a vote that should not be counted; the only time I have ever done this was with RickK (a sysop). He took offense to some things said on the mailing list recently and reacted to that by voting <i>keep</i> on every single item on VfD. This was discussed on the talk page of VfD as well when Jiang noticed it. These votes were not made in good faith. I doubt he had even looked at the articles he was voting on, so I thought it only fair to mention it. I didn't do it <i>because</i> he was voting keep for everything, but because they were not real votes at all, but just statements to prove a point.</p>
<p>Regarding the VfD rules, the discussions on the deletion policy pages certainly imply that users must give a reason with their vote. I've reworded it now to make that clear. However, I would emphasise that the policy is flexible, so in reality, people's votes won't generally be discounted without reason. Anyway, all this could be set to change with the proposed new system being discussed at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EDeletion_policy_ab70.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Deletion policy">Wikipedia talk:Deletion policy</a>, where the reasoning and votes will occur on separate pages and at separate times.</p>
<p>I hope this makes things a bit clearer. Let me know if not.

<p>Would you consider changing your vote again? It's about 50/50 right now. I know you believe in this and you just ducked out because you were sick of the arguing. I think you voted against because this Rex Mundy said he did not want the article. I think that's just because somebody was hacking them and don't think they would mind if that stopped. <a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpellBott_96d8.html" title="User:SpellBott">SpellBott</a> 12:39, 18 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No hard feelings, but I would rather not. I'm keeping my Brianism "off wiki" for now as it seems to be a red rag to a bull to some. You seem to be doing a good job of holding up the Brianist end yourself.

<dd>Yes, sister. You can call me brother. Did you pull out of the vote on Brianism because you are afraid ******* will attack your other pages?

<dd>Another user has also listed him under vandalism in progress. Not quite sure I would go that far quite yet - but I'm getting there!. Just keep reverting and I'm sure he will get fed up.

<p>It looks like the sysop deleted the article for its csd tag. It met the csd criteria without question. I usually nominate csd articles if they have been tagged and contested for more than an hour or so. I went ahead and closed the debate, since there was no more article to debate. <a href="../../../n/a/v/User%7ENavou_3499.html" title="User:Navou"><font color="blue"><b>Navou</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/a/v/User_talk%7ENavou_af4c.html" title="User talk:Navou"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 08:54, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have no problem with that. But I think it would help if who deleted it and why was documented on the VfD.

<dd>
<ul>
<li>I agree, is should be notated in the result now. Some times folks will insert a CSD template into an article while its on afd, a little controversial, but if its csd, its csd.
