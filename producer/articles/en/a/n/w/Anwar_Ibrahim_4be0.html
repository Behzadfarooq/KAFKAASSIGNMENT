<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/w/Anwar_Ibrahim_4be0.html" title="Edit section: The early years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The early years</span></h2>
<p>Anwar was born in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherok_Tok_Kun%2C_Penang_d821.html" title="Cherok Tok Kun, Penang">Cherok Tok Kun</a>, a village on the mainland side of the northern Malaysian state of <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penang.html" title="Penang">Penang</a> to a hospital porter, Ibrahim Abdul Rahman (later to join politics and retire as Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Health) and Che Yan, a housewife (and later UMNO politician). He was educated at the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malay_College_Kuala_Kangsar_b3f4.html" title="Malay College Kuala Kangsar">Malay College Kuala Kangsar</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Malaya_89e3.html" title="University of Malaya">University of Malaya</a>, where he read Malay studies.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>, as a student, Anwar founded a <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> students organisation, <i>Persatuan Kebangsaan Pelajar Islam Malaysia</i> (PKPIM). He was also elected President of the Malaysian Youth Council or <i>Majlis Belia Malaysia</i> (MBM).</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>, Anwar was arrested during student protests against rural poverty and hunger. He was imprisoned under the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_Security_Act_of_Malaysia_f82b.html" title="Internal Security Act of Malaysia">Internal Security Act</a>, which allows for detention without trial, and spent twenty months in the <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamunting.html" title="Kamunting">Kamunting</a> detention camp for political prisoners.</p>

<p>In 1968-1971, he was first groomed in the National Union of Islamic Muslim Students (Persatuan Kebangsaan Pelajar Islam Malaysia, PKPIM) as the second president of the Union. He was very well known as one of the most prominent student movement leaders, and gave inspiration and as a symbol of student movement in Malaysia, especially in the south-east region.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 1982, Anwar, who was the founding leader and second president of a youth Islamic organisation called <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angkatan_Belia_Islam_Malaysia_%28ABIM%29_e4f9.html" title="Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia (ABIM)">Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia (ABIM)</a>, shocked his liberal supporters by joining the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Malays_National_Organisation_7fe0.html" title="United Malays National Organisation">United Malays National Organisation</a> (UMNO), led by Mahathir who became prime minister in 1981. He moved up the political ranks quickly: his first ministerial office was that of Minister of Culture, Youth and Sports in 1983; after that, he headed the agriculture ministry in 1984 before becoming Minister of Education in 1986. In 1991 Anwar was appointed Minister of Finance. In 1993, he became Mahathir's Deputy Prime Minister after winning the Deputy Presidency of UMNO against Ghafar Baba.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, Anwar was being groomed to succeed <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahathir_bin_Mohamad_b7d3.html" title="Mahathir bin Mohamad">Mahathir bin Mohamad</a> as prime minister, and the former frequently alluded in public to his 'son-father' relationship with Mahathir; for several months in early 1997, Mahathir appointed Anwar to be acting Prime Minister while Mahathir took a two-month holiday. Towards the end of the 1990s, however, their relationship began to deteriorate, triggered by their conflicting views on governance. Issues such as how Malaysia would respond to a financial crisis were often at the forefront of this conflict.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/w/Anwar_Ibrahim_4be0.html" title="Edit section: Financial crisis">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Financial crisis</span></h2>

He also instituted an <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austerity.html" title="Austerity">austerity</a> package that slashed government spending by 18%, cut ministerial salaries and deferred major investment projects. Large-scale infrastructure development projects known as "mega projects" were set back as well, despite being a cornerstone of Mahathir's plans for "developing" the nation. These measures aroused bitter opposition from Mahathir. Unknown to many, he actually raised interest rates to an effective 24%.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> But this stifled the economy further to an extent though eventually helpful.{fact}} This mainly angered many affected business figures some of whose business empires had developed through exclusive government contracts, cheap credit from public funds or commercial sources backed by government guarantees, concessions, and various other forms of <a href="../../../r/e/n/Rent_seeking.html" title="Rent seeking">rent seeking</a>.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Later Anwar claimed that Mahathir disliked the drastic cuts as they stifled the business interests of the latter's children and cronies.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> In particular, Tun Daim Zainuddin, the powerful Treasurer of UMNO and Executive Director of the NEAC (a front for Mahathir, also implicated in the METRAMAC scandal) had large holdings of Malaysian banks and other businesses that would be vulnerable to such actions. Daim was a close confidante of Mahathir (both being from the same town) and had been the Finance Minister before Anwar.</p>

<p>Although many Malaysian companies faced the threat of bankruptcy, Anwar declared: "There is no question of any bailout. The banks will be allowed to protect themselves and the government will not interfere." Anwar advocated a free market approach, sympathetic to foreign investment and trade liberalisation, whereas Mahathir favored currency and foreign investment controls, blaming (alleged) unchecked speculation by currency speculators like <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Soros_3686.html" title="George Soros">George Soros</a> for the shrinking economy.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> To this day, there is much disagreement among economists whether Anwar's policies would have been more or less succesful than Mahathir's.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> Newsweek magazine named Anwar the "Asian of the Year." However, that year, matters between Anwar and Mahathir came to a head around the time of the quadrennial UMNO General Assembly. The Youth wing of UMNO, headed by Anwar's associate, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi (also a member of ABIM), gave notice that it would initiate a debate on "cronyism and nepotism". In light of the recent fall of President <a href="../../../s/u/h/Suharto.html" title="Suharto">Suharto</a> of Indonesia, thought to have embezzled huge amounts of money from the Indonesian treasury, this was widely interpreted as a proxy attack on Mahathir.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> The response was swift, as Mahathir issued lists of "cronies" who had benefited from government share allocations and privatizations. To the chagrin of Anwar and his allies, several of them were on the list, including Anwar and Zahid.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/w/Anwar_Ibrahim_4be0.html" title="Edit section: Allegations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Allegations</span></h2>
<p>At the General Assembly, a book, <i>50 Dalil Kenapa Anwar Tidak Boleh Jadi PM</i> ("50 Reasons Why Anwar Cannot Become Prime Minister") was circulated containing graphic sexual allegations as well as accusations of corruption against Anwar. This book carried the byline Khalid Jafri, an ex-editor of the government-controlled newspaper <i><a href="../../../u/t/u/Utusan_Malaysia_633d.html" title="Utusan Malaysia">Utusan Malaysia</a></i> and former editor-in-chief of a failed magazine, <i>Harian National</i>. In a country where printing presses are licensed by the government, this implied the involvement of the Mahathir administration.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Shortly thereafter, Anwar obtained a court injunction to prevent further distribution of the book and filed a defamation action against the author.</p>
<p>In August, police charged the author of the "50 Reasons" book with malicious publishing of false news. In September, the judge who had banned the book's distribution was transferred to a lower court despite being a senior judge, further raising concerns among the public about the independence of the judiciary.</p>
<p>The author died in 2005 of complications caused by diabetes but not before the High Court found that the author had libelled Anwar Ibrahim in publishing the "50 Reasons" book and awarded Anwar Ibrahim millions of ringgit in compensation.</p>
<p>In July 1998, a visit by the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">Indonesian</a> opposition leader <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amien_Rais_1150.html" title="Amien Rais">Amien Rais</a> led to more pointed comparisons of Malaysia and Indonesia. Domestic critics accused Mahathir of tolerating cronyism, and the international financial press and the IMF demanded greater transparency in government and UMNO-managed enterprises.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/w/Anwar_Ibrahim_4be0.html" title="Edit section: Trial and conviction">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Trial and conviction</span></h2>
<p>Anwar was fired from the Cabinet on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_2.html" title="September 2">September 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, amid police reports that he was under investigation. The following day, he was expelled from UMNO. On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_14.html" title="September 14">September 14</a>, Dr. Munawar Anees, Anwar's former speechwriter, and Sukma Darmawan Sasmitaat Madja, Anwar's adoptive brother and also a speechwriter of his, were arrested under suspicion of engaging in sodomy. Five days later, they were given a jail sentence of six months after pleading guilty to "unnatural sex" with Anwar. They later recanted their confessions, and appealed the sentence, claiming to have been coerced into entering a plea of "guilty". Dr. Anees made a statutory declaration of how they were coerced into making a guilty plea. <a href="http://www.c2o.org/malaysia/democracy/reports/981203_stat_dec_munawar_01.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.c2o.org/malaysia/democracy/reports/981203_stat_dec_munawar_01.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Two of Anwar's secretaries, Ezam Mohamad and Mohamad Azmin Ali, were both held separately as part of police investigations into the "50 reasons" book. Both were later released.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_20.html" title="September 20">September 20</a>, Anwar addressed a protest gathering of nearly 100,000 people in <a href="../../../k/u/a/Kuala_Lumpur_b5d7.html" title="Kuala Lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</a>, after which a number of his supporters marched to Mahathir's then official residence "Sri Perdana" demanding <i>reformasi</i> (economic and political reforms) and Mahathir's resignation. This march, a rare event in Malaysia, caused concern in the Government, which feared that it could lead to chaos and racist fights amongst Malaysians. Anwar was seen as the new, liberal face of Malaysians and Mahathir as the protector of the Malays. Anwar's attacks on the suspected nepotism of Mahathir's rule were fortified by widespread discontent over the perceived suppression of democratic rights in Malaysia.</p>
<p>Mahathir's supporters questioned Anwar's actions, alleging that he had waited until he was sacked to publicly challenge Mahathir's actions. Mahathir's supporters also suggested that Anwar engaged in nepotistic and corrupt activities himself, and was using the issues to topple Mahathir. It was also possible that he harbored hopes of replacing Mahathir although Anwar was no longer a member of UMNO and every prime minister had been an UMNO leader.</p>
<p>That night, Anwar's home was raided by a masked and armed SWAT team from the Royal Malaysian Police. His arrest was announced several hours later, as was that of several of Anwar's supporters, although most of them were later released.</p>

<p>The black eye was implausibly explained away by the then <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_2cf9.html" title="Prime Minister">Prime Minister</a> <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahathir_Mohamad_3427.html" title="Mahathir Mohamad">Mahathir Mohamad</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/f/Rafidah_Aziz_4f4d.html" title="Rafidah Aziz">Rafidah Aziz</a> as being 'self-inflicted' and caused by "pressing a glass over his eyes".

<p>Anwar was accused of corruption relating to the police investigation into and arrest of the author of the "50 Reasons" book. He was also accused of sodomy with his wife's chauffeur, Azizan Abu Bakar. The trials were judged by Augustine Paul, a judge who wrote the authoritative Evidence, practice and procedure used throughout the country, and has become text book in prominent universities. He was appointed a Judicial Commissioner in 1995 (judge on probation pending confirmation but with all the powers of a High Court Judge) and later confirmed in 1998. He has been with judicial and legal service since his graduation and held posts such as Magistrate, Sessions Court President, Senior Assistant Registrar of High Court and Chairman of the Industrial Court before being appointed Judicial Commissioner. When Anwar Ibrahim was charged, several judges disqualified themselves politely citing that they knew Anwar personally or the witnesses involved in the case. It is Augustine Paul who agreed to try the case stating "I will base on evidence". Augustine Paul wrote 320 page judgment in the Anwar Ibrahim case, the longest judgment in the country ever. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> In that judgment, he explains meticulously point by point each and every piece of evidence involved and the rulings he made.</p>
<p>During the trial, Mahathir appeared on Malaysian television in a special appearance to clarify the arrest of his deputy. This was one of several occasions in which Mahathir declared Anwar guilty of sodomy and homosexual acts, even as the trial still was underway.</p>
<p>The government included the statements of the purported victims of Anwar's sodomy attacks, evidence that was widely considered to be tainted.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Furthermore, the prosecution was unable to accurately decide on a date that the alleged acts of anal sex had occurred - the government originally alleged that a sodomy had occurred inside a building that had not been constructed at the time of the alleged event.</p>
<p>The persecution and destruction of Anwar has widely been considered to have homophobic overtones<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, although Anwar himself is married and has several children and no evidence indicates that he is gay. Nevertheless, the allegations capitalized on the homophobia of certain blocks of Malaysian society and further humiliated the supposed "victims" as they were also charged with the crime of "allowing themselves to be sodomized."<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_14.html" title="April 14">April 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, Anwar was sentenced to six years in prison for corruption and, on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_8.html" title="August 8">August 8</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, nine years in prison for sodomy. The sentences were to be served consecutively, and Anwar was given no credit for the six months he spent in jail during the trial.</p>
<p>In a speech during the proceedings against him, Anwar explained what he believed to be the underlying motive behind his persecution. He told the court: "I objected to the use of massive public funds to rescue the failed businesses of his (Mahathir's) children and cronies."</p>
<p>Both <a href="../../../a/m/n/Amnesty_International_6202.html" title="Amnesty International">Amnesty International</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_Rights_Watch_35a7.html" title="Human Rights Watch">Human Rights Watch</a> expressed some doubts about the fairness of the trials. <a href="http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA280152003?open&amp;of=ENG-MYS" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA280152003?open&amp;of=ENG-MYS" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.hrw.org/press/1999/jun/anwar0610.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hrw.org/press/1999/jun/anwar0610.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Amnesty International subsequently designated Anwar as a prisoner of conscience.</p>
<p>Augustine Paul, the judge who convicted Anwar Ibrahim of sodomy (jury trials in Malaysia have been abolished), and sentenced him to jail, was not long thereafter promoted to the Court of Appeal, along with other judges unrelated to this case. In 2005, Augustine Paul was promoted to the Federal Court, Malaysia's highest court. Many critics attribute this promotion to Paul's decision on the case.</p>
<p>The trial also unleashed a flood of international criticism. US vice president <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_0261.html" title="Al Gore">Al Gore</a> denounced the sodomy trial of Anwar as a "mockery", but Mahathir rejected all such international criticism as "foreign interference." <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/873592.stm" class="external free" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/873592.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/873592.stm</a></p>
<p>Anwar's wife, <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wan_Azizah_Wan_Ismail_4cd4.html" title="Wan Azizah Wan Ismail">Wan Azizah Ismail</a>, subsequently formed <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parti_Keadilan_9e5c.html" title="Parti Keadilan">Parti Keadilan</a> (the National Justice Party), which based its platform on campaigning for Anwar's release and <i>reformasi</i>. The party joined the (Alternative Front) coalition, formed in response to the ruling <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barisan_Nasional_a4a3.html" title="Barisan Nasional">Barisan Nasional</a> (National Front).</p>
<p>The following year, Anwar's corruption conviction was upheld by Malaysia's Court of Appeal. In July <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, Anwar lost his final appeal against the corruption conviction in the Federal Court.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that Anwar's influence over the general public and politics in Malaysia has waned, except for a few dedicated followers of his — in the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaysian_general_election%2C_2004.html" title="Malaysian general election, 2004">following general election</a>, the ruling coalition under a new leader, Mahathir's successor, <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdullah_Ahmad_Badawi_8dc2.html" title="Abdullah Ahmad Badawi">Abdullah Ahmad Badawi</a>, regained <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terengganu.html" title="Terengganu">Terengganu</a> and nearly captured <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelantan.html" title="Kelantan">Kelantan</a>. By then, the Barisan Alternative had crumbled, with the socialist opposition <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Action_Party_9220.html" title="Democratic Action Party">Democratic Action Party</a> leaving the coalition, due to the differences with PAS over the formation of an Islamic state as part of the coalition platform. Before the election, the National Justice Party had changed its name to the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Justice_Party_bcf8.html" title="People's Justice Party">People's Justice Party</a> — it performed poorly in the election, only retaining a single parliamentary seat, that which belonged to Anwar's wife. Not surprisingly this was Anwar's old parliamentary seat of Permatang Pauh proving that in spite of his conviction, he still had the support of his old constituents.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/w/Anwar_Ibrahim_4be0.html" title="Edit section: Release from prison">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Release from prison</span></h2>
<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_2.html" title="September 2">September 2</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, a panel of three judges of the Federal Court (Malaysia's highest court) overturned the sodomy conviction by 2 to 1, finding contradictions in the prosecution's case. However, the judges noted "We find evidence to confirm that the appellants were involved in homosexual activities and we are more inclined to believe that the alleged incident at Tivoli Villa did happen."</p>
<p>Anwar had already completed his sentence for corruption, his sentence being reduced for good behaviour. Although the point was by now moot, an appeal on the corruption charges was heard on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_6.html" title="September 6">September 6</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>. Under Malaysian law a person is banned from political activities for five years after the end of his sentence. Success in this appeal would allow him an immediate return to politics. On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_7.html" title="September 7">September 7</a>, the court agreed to hear Anwar's appeal. However, on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_15.html" title="September 15">September 15</a>, the of Court of Appeal ruled unanimously that its previous decision to uphold a High Court ruling that found Anwar guilty was in order, relegating Anwar to the sidelines of Malaysian politics until <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_14.html" title="April 14">14 April</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2008.html" title="2008">2008</a>. The only way out for Anwar would be for him to receive a pardon from the Yang di-Pertuan Agong.</p>
<p>At the time of his release from prison, Anwar was reportedly suffering from serious back problems, which his family said was the result of the beating by the ex-police chief. However, the UMNO-owned <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newspaper.html" title="Newspaper">newspaper</a>, the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Straits_Times_4cbd.html" title="New Straits Times">New Straits Times</a></i>, reported in its <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_6.html" title="September 6">September 6</a> issue that the injuries had actually been caused by a fall from a horse in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> during Anwar's tenure as deputy prime minister, although why this injury had taken approximately ten years to manifest itself was never quite explained in that article. His wife had argued during his imprisonment that he required treatment for his condition at a clinic in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>. The government refused, claiming that such treatment was readily available in Malaysia, offering medical treatment if necessary. However, in September 2004, after the Federal Court quashed his conviction for sodomy, Anwar was free to travel to <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munich.html" title="Munich">Munich</a> for back surgery.</p>
<p>Since his release from prison Anwar has held a teaching positions at St. Anthony's College (Oxford, UK) where he was a Visiting fellow and Senior associate member and at Johns Hopkins School of Advance International Studies in Washington DC as a Distinguished Senior Visiting Fellow. He is currently a Distinguished Visiting Professor in the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University.</p>
<p>In March 2006 he was appointed as Honorary President of the London based organization <a href="http://www.accountability.org.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.accountability.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">AccountAbility</a>.</p>
<p>Anwar regularly returns to Malaysia where he meets with his political supporters. He is also the Advisor of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parti_Keadilan_Rakyat_5763.html" title="Parti Keadilan Rakyat">Parti Keadilan Rakyat</a>, the party of which his wife Dr. <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wan_Azizah_9ad0.html" title="Wan Azizah">Wan Azizah</a> is president.</p>

<p>In November 2006, Anwar announced he planned to run for Parliament in 2008, after his disqualification expired. Anwar has been critical of government policies since his release from prison, most notably of the controversial <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaysian_New_Economic_Policy_b090.html" title="Malaysian New Economic Policy">New Economic Policy</a> (NEP), which provides <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affirmative_action.html" title="Affirmative action">affirmative action</a> for the Malays. The policy sets a number of quotas, such as for units of housing and <a href="../../../i/n/i/Initial_public_offering.html" title="Initial public offering">initial public offerings</a>, that must be met. Observers have suggested, however, that Anwar has "offered no clear alternative to the policy".<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
