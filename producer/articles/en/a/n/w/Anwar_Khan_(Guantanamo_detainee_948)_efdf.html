<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>

<p>Khan reqested a witness named Mohammed Sadik.

<p>They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat -- or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.</p>

<p>In addition to being beaten, when naked, that Khan had mentioned earlier, Khan's statemnent described the following abuse at Guantanamo:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"They stopped me and told me they had five questions and then brought me to Bagram and in Bagram they punish me a lot and now I am here. It's up to you if you believe me or not, but they were unjust when they brought me here and they have to pay me back for that. The doctors beat me up and they did not give me medicine. They put me in mental facilities for people who are completely crazy for ten months and then injected me with some medicine that was not good. It damaged my mental status, when I told them that I could not see or read they did not give me glasses."</i></dd>

<p>Khan concluded his statement by repeating his assurance that he was not a danger to the United States, and offered to broadcast over that fact over the radio, so everyone could hear it.</p>

<p>Khan had moved to Pakistan, to look for work, approximately twenty years earlier, when he was a teenager. He had crossed back into Afghanistan approximately once a year, until the Taliban came to power. He returned to Afghanistan in the fall of 2001 to join in the fight to overthrow the Taliban. His brother was killed fighting the Taliban in <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tora_Bora_c05a.html" title="Tora Bora">Tora Bora</a></p>
<p>Khan was arrested by American forces.</p>
<p>Khan was told that the sole reason the American troops arrested him was their questions over his multiple ID cards. When Khan told this to his Board one of his Board members interjected: <i>"You were arrested by United States Forces and sent to Guantanamo for having an ID card?"</i></p>
<p>Khan said that when he arrived in Bagram he was confronted by false allegations, such as that his father was a Talib, that his uncle was a Talib.</p>
<p>Khan said that, while in Bagram: <i>"I helped them identify a couple of bad guys."</i></p>
<p>When asked how he would characterize his behavior in Cuba Khan responded:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"What do you expect from me? They put me with the Taliban and they are my enemies; I am a nice guy, but they are bad to me. If they are bad to me than I have to be even worse to them. When they take me to interrogations the Taliban and the other detainees call me a spy, they say I am helping the Americans and I am an infidel.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>When asked what he would do if he were released Khan said:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"I will do the same day labor or be a bodyguard or whatever there is to do. I am not going to go back to Pakistan. I am going to be a farmer."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Khan said he hated the Taliban because:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"The Taliban told us to give them our weapons and live like women. We didn't like that."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Khan explained that he acquired a Pakistani ID card because he said he was from the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Western_Frontier_Province_b617.html" title="North Western Frontier Province">North Western Frontier Province</a>.</p>
