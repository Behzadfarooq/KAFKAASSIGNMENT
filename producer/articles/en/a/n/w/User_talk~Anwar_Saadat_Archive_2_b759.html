<dd>Who decides if those images are illegal or not? Are you all going to investigate if the studios paid taxes as well? ROTFL! Kollywood is not recognised as an industry yet by the TN government. Those producers don't even issue vouchers for their production expenses! So industrial copyright policies are not applicable here.

<dd>Yes, if you want a <i>normal</i> link to an article on another language/project, you would start with a colon.

<p>Hi Anwar,</p>
<p>I always liked your work and the stubborn attitude you showed on <a href="../../../a/j/i/Ajith.html" title="Ajith">Ajith</a>'s article. But when I saw your edits on <a href="../../../v/i/j/Vijay_%28actor%29.html" title="Vijay (actor)">Vijay (actor)</a>'s article, really i was disappointed. You might not be a great fan of him, but why do you add those debut with a "Flop film", Aathi's red card issue describing very harshly.</p>
<p>As you edit more on Ajith, When it comes to Ajith's flop film it is a musical hit and never mention the film flopped badly. But in the case of Vijay, the film is a flop and big slump in his career, why this partiality? If you edit in a such a way for Vijay, do the same with Ajith describe all his flop films and the continuosly flops he gave. Be neutral on dumping ...</p>
<p>We must be neutral when we present an article at wikipedia. I wish and request you to improve Vijay's article as Ajith's. Keep doing your good work. --<a href="../../../m/2E/a/User%7EM.arunprasad_aa7e.html" title="User:M.arunprasad">M.arunprasad</a> 05:09, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Arun, I am not anti-Vijay. I didn' say anything about Vijay's early films bcoz I didn't have the data. But Aathi is a wash-out and I have given the sify link. So I can't change that. But I have removed the prefix "flop" from Naalaya Theerpu. As regards, Ajith's "so-called flops", I have access to trade registers that say Nesam and Red celebrated 100th day in southern districts. Raja was dubbed into Telugu. I don't know where you get the idea that Vijay films never flop while Ajith films never win!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I hope you appreciate that I added Jana as the biggest flop for Ajith but Madhu wants to paint a rosy picture for Vijay and blank links saying Aadhi is his biggets flop. He is quoting Sun TV's circus ranking as a proof! If you have link from sify saying the film is a flop, please add it. Vijay gave half-a-dozen utter flops before Thirumalai. But I didn't post that article. So please don't blame me as partial. All know Ajith (not Vijay) is the King of Opening. <a href="../../../a/n/w/User%7EAnwar_saadat_808d.html" title="User:Anwar saadat">Anwar saadat</a> 13:45, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I never mentioned Vijay's never gave flops. I accept and know very well of his flops. I don't know about the King of opening, but i do have some idea on film business. Vijay has given more hits consistently than Ajith and no one can deny that. He might not have acted in more good movies, but he is considered to be the next box office hero after Rajni (if you require link like sify i can get you that). I'm not saying Ajith is below Vijay, but i mean to say Vijay is also another major Hero of Tamil film industry and when you work on Kollywood section, you must try to improve celebrity like him also.</dd>

<dd>The reason why i contacted you was for (1) Flop film Nalaya Theerpu (2) Aadhi's red card issue with sify link. Which looked like you are dumping him rather improving his article. Anyway, "<b>I wish and request you to improve Vijay's article as Ajith's</b>". You decorated Ajith's article very well and i appriciate you for that, i would be happy to see you do the same with Vijay's article.

<dd>I too would like to improve Vijay's article splitting his career decadewise. But there is insufficient data about him. But I will try to gather more info and update soon. Its a myth that Vijay has given more hits than Ajith or anyone else. LOL Otherwise, he should be called King of Opening! I am not dumping Vijay. Infact, I didn't even write about his continuous flops before Thirumalai or about the fake <i>200th day</i> poster celebrations in the past two years or about the multiple lawsuits dfaced by his films since Pudhiya Geedhai. However, Aadhi's red card matter is undeniable now. He has no films in hand effectively now! <a href="../../../a/n/w/User%7EAnwar_saadat_808d.html" title="User:Anwar saadat">Anwar saadat</a> 13:24, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have been informed by several others about the Ajith article you and som other user were the ones to blame. Stop reverting cos it will eventually break the 3 revert rule. I understand Ajith being a guest in Rajavin Parvailey but how is he a guest in Kandukondain Kandukondain. Its like saying Madhavan, Siddharth were guests in Ayutha Ezhuthu.

<dd>Even i don't agree Ajith did guest role in KKKK, there were only two lead male characters. which was played by Mammooty and Ajith, Abbas played a negative role. Also half of movie revolves around him and Tabu, so Ajith must get the credit as lead hero for KKKK. please watch the movie again and consider my point. --<a href="../../../m/2E/a/User%7EM.arunprasad_aa7e.html" title="User:M.arunprasad">M.arunprasad</a> 06:09, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, KKKK is a unique story about sisters. It released almost simultaneously with another Ajith film Unnai Kodu Ennai Tharuven. Plus, Ajith's role was kinda walk-in walk-out lasting 50 minutes even though he had two duets. When it released, the media called it as guest role. But anyway, as you guys feel strongly about this, I am changing it to lead role in the article here. Btw, guess who is Jathu!

<dd>Hello Anwar. Could you please refrain from adding the words "mega-star" and "mega-blockbuster" and "sky-high" instead of high to the Ajith article, because I think that it is POV to use such extreme terms of aggrandizement.<a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen"><span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">ßlηguγΣη</span></a> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> - <a href="../../../e/r/_/WP%7EER_5c78.html" title="WP:ER">review me</a> 01:30, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>KK is infact a mega-blockbuster as it crossed 200 days. These are trade verdicts in Kollywood, not just superlatives. You can verify this with tamilcinema.com database. It is not POV certainly. Similarly, a super star is any actor whose film business is atleast Rs100 million. There are only six superstars in Kollywood. <a href="../../../a/n/w/User%7EAnwar_saadat_808d.html" title="User:Anwar saadat">Anwar saadat</a> 01:32, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Unfortunately, my computer doesn't read the Tamil script, and I can't read Tamil anyway, but a verdict given by an analyst is not necessarily encyclopedic, as they are usually written with a flourishing style - even though <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisden.html" title="Wisden">Wisden</a> is regarded as a "cricket encyclopedia", cutting and pasting profiles from its website <a href="http://aus.cricinfo.com" class="external free" title="http://aus.cricinfo.com" rel="nofollow">http://aus.cricinfo.com</a> would certainly result in POV such as this from <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sachin_Tendulkar_ea66.html" title="Sachin Tendulkar">Sachin Tendulkar</a>'s cricinfo.com profile</dd>

<dd><i>When he became the first batsman to score 50 hundreds in international cricket, Sachin Tendulkar established himself as the greatest of all Indian cricketers. Recognised by Sir Donald Bradman as his modern incarnation, Tendulkar has a skill - a genius - which only a handful have possessed. It was not a skill that he was simply born with, but one which was developed by his intelligence and an infinite capacity for taking pains. If there is a secret, it is that Tendulkar has the keenest of cricket minds. At times in a Test series he looks mortal. But he learns every lesson, picks up every cue, dominates the opposing attack sooner or later, and nearly always makes a hundred. His bravery was proved after he was hit on the head on his Test debut in Pakistan, when he was only 16; and his commitment to the Indian cause has never been in doubt. If captaincy - or rather the off-field management of men less skilled than himself - was beyond him at his first attempt, his reading of the game, and his manifold varieties of bowling, have shown the same acute intelligence. His cricket has been played in the right way too, always attacking, and because he knew that was the right way rather than because he was a child of the one-day age, as he himself modestly said. The awe of opponents was as great as that of crowds. But the finest compliment must be that bookmakers would not fix the odds - or a game - until Tendulkar was out. Surpassed Sunil Gavaskar, his guru, as the leading century-maker in Test cricket with his 35th three-figure score in November 2005.</i></dd>

<dd>If I say <i>Ajith is the only superstar in India</i>, it is POV. The words used in the article are purely in trade context. For instance, if a film's ROI is 150%, it is called a hit, if ROI is 300%, it is called a blockbuster. KK was a low-budget film whose ROI was over 1,000%, that's why it's called a mega-blockbuster. There is nothing POV about this. Its common knowledge as a matter of fact. Behindwoods.com is a well established magazine that regularly publishes ranks every season based on data collected from South India Film Chamber. <a href="../../../a/n/w/User%7EAnwar_saadat_808d.html" title="User:Anwar saadat">Anwar saadat</a> 02:00, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Anwar...I've created taluk level maps for about 80% of all districts in Karnataka (along the lines of the Bagalkot district map). I'm in the process of revitalizing content on Karnataka districts and will no doubt get to all districts eventually. At the end of this process, I hope to have all districts looking in much the same way as Bagalkot does now.

<p>Anwar, you say that it's OK to use words like "super-star" and "mega-hit" because those have accepted meanings in Kollywood fandom. If they have any real meaning (other than "I like this actor" and "I liked this movie") then it must have to do with box office grosses. If you were to give the box office grosses for various movies, that would be fine. We could argue about the reliability of the figures, but at least there would be something there, measurable, discussable. But just saying that Ajith is a superstar and everyone knows what that means, so go away -- that doesn't work for an article meant to be read by millions of people who have never watched an Ajith movie, or who don't know anything about Kollywood, but who might just become fans if the article catches their eye ... and their one-minute attention span. "Super-star" is unverifiable; a box-office gross isn't. I think that we can say "popular" or "well-known" without asking for figures -- those are fairly bland claims. But we just aren't using superstar in the Indian cinema articles. Even for Shah Rukh or Aamir. It's just too subjective.</p>
<p>There are many other problems with your versions of the Ajith and Vijay articles. There are lots of personal judgements; there is lots of hyperbole. That's not OK. We have to write the article so that someone who absolutely HATES Ajith would read it and say, "Well, it's accurate enough." Please try to look at it from that vantage point, and write for the hater, not the fan. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 03:15, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bollywood stars are not as influential as that of Kollywood. That's why they haven't developed a culture of superstardom. All chief ministers of <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil_Nadu_d7a5.html" title="Tamil Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a> since 1967 were erstwhile stars of Kollywood. The nexus between Tamil Nadu State politics and Kollywood is unusually strong and clearly visible in <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil_Nadu_Assembly_Election_2006_801b.html" title="Tamil Nadu Assembly Election 2006">elections</a>.

<dd>In Kollywood, actual box office collections are not given <b>ever</b>. Instead, <i>x number of days run in y number of screens</i> is given. Links to tamilcinema.com db are given already in the article. Most of the Tamil sites use framesets. That's why direct links are not possible.

<dd>Please save your arguments for arbitration, which is definitely coming in a matter of days against Zora once again unless she changes her attitude. Incase you are unaware, she <b>blanked</b> out whole lines, paragraphs, sections and even supporting links (which are several weeks of hardwork of several contributors) without even a pretense of a discussion.

<dd>Personally I think that using the words "failed state" about any country is unacceptable and especially from an organisation that seeks to "explain how the world works". However, the accusations have been made, reported and rejected. The fact that it got a response from the Pakistani government was the main reason I felt it would be better to keep it.

<p>Not all of his images appear to be tagged incorrectly, but some of them definatly are. I've warned him about it, but you probably know more about the images than I would, so the best thing to be done is if you could carefully go through them, correcting the tags where applicable, and adding the 'no licence' tag only where it's not what it's tagged as (and there's no obvious tag to replace it with). If he continues reverting you, let me know. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 15:52, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem began with the repeat offender Zora (who has admitted zero knowledge of Kollywood mechanics) who blanked whole paragraphs, sections, supporting links in the guise of <i>cleanup</i>. Then she proceeds to insert and delete lines conforming to her POV severely damaging the integtrity of the article. Looking at her log, I realised most of her contributions were mere <i>reversion of others' contributions</i>. I tried to reason with her. But she didn't bother to read through the links, which were proofs of the assertions in the article. So I reverted her changes. Then she went on a <i>character assassination spree</i> invoking support from other non-Tamil friends and well-wishers who began collectively pushing... and bulldozing their POVs.</dd>

<dd>She tried to remove the links to songs even after being explained that they were pointing to <i>copyright-free</i> IPRS licensed websites. She has already been cautioned earlier in Aucaman case not to engage in revert warring. But the message is not getting across. What she calls as <i>fancruft and hagiography</i> are matters of fact and tantamounts to common sense of an industry watcher. If you go through history of that article, you can see what/how vandalism was fought and removed by myself. One of her backbenchers even had the nerve to remove the nickname <i>Thala</i> bcoz he thought it is POV!</dd>

<dd>This does happen in a multicultural setting. Don't worry. Such issues can be resolved. Let me come back on this tomorrow after noon. Stay calm and away from contentious articles for a couple of days, you can always go back in history. As for <i>thala</i>, we can properly state that many <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kollywood.html" title="Kollywood">Kollywood</a> actors are called by such <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epithet.html" title="Epithet">epithets</a> and then give this as a matter of fact.

<dd><b>Compromise</b>. I am willing to consider toning down the article if non-Tamil editors (without <i>prima facie</i> concern) are barred from bulldozing blindly their POVs in this article.
