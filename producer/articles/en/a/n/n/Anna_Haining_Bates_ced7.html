<p><b>Anna Haining Bates</b>, <a href="../../../b/o/r/Born.html" title="Born">born</a> <b>Anna Haining Swan</b> (<a href="../../../a/u/g/August_6.html" title="August 6">August 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/4/1846.html" title="1846">1846</a> – <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_5.html" title="August 5">August 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1888.html" title="1888">1888</a>), was a <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canadian</a> from Mill Brook, New Annan, (near present-day <a href="../../../t/a/t/Tatamagouche.html" title="Tatamagouche">Tatamagouche</a>), <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colchester_County%2C_Nova_Scotia_75d5.html" title="Colchester County, Nova Scotia">Colchester County</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/v/Nova_Scotia_7d1d.html" title="Nova Scotia">Nova Scotia</a> famed for her great height, believed to be 7 ft 11 in at the peak of her physical stature. She reportedly weighed 18 pounds (8.1&#160;kg) when she was born and was twenty-seven inches (69&#160;cm) long<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since April 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. Her parents were of average height and were <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_people.html" title="Scottish people">Scottish</a> immigrants.</p>
<p>Anna was the 3rd of 13 children, all also of around average height. From birth she grew very fast. On her 4th birthday she was 4 feet 6 inches (137&#160;cm) tall. On her 6th birthday she was measured again, and she stood 5 foot 2 inches (157&#160;cm) tall, an inch or two (2.5–5cm) shorter than her mother. On her 10th birthday she measured at just under 6 feet 2 inches tall (187&#160;cm) tall. By her 15th birthday Anna Swan was measured at just over seven feet (213&#160;cm) tall. She was discovered in the fall of <a href="../../../1/8/6/1862.html" title="1862">1862</a> by <a href="../../../p/2E/t/P.T._Barnum_c023.html" title="P.T. Barnum">P.T. Barnum</a>, at which time she was 7 feet 2 and a half inches tall.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since January 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> She would reach her full height two years later, which was 7 feet 11 and a half inches tall. At first she refused Barnum's offer but agreed later, as he paid her handsomely.</p>
<p>Anna excelled at <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literature.html" title="Literature">literature</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music.html" title="Music">music</a> and was considered to be very intelligent. She also excelled at her studies of acting, piano and voice. She played <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Macbeth_951c.html" title="Lady Macbeth">Lady Macbeth</a> in one play.</p>
<p>She had to be rescued from a fire at Barnum's museum in July <a href="../../../1/8/6/1865.html" title="1865">1865</a>. The stairs were in flames but she was too large to escape through a window. In her fear she bowled over the men sent to help her. Employees of the museum found a loft derrick nearby, smashed the wall around a window on the third floor, and lowered Anna by block and tackle with 18 men holding the end of the rope. At the time Anna weighed 394 pounds or 28 stone 2 pounds (179&#160;kg). Usually however, her weight was around 25 stones or 350 pounds.</p>
<p>When visiting a circus in <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halifax_%28former_city%29%2C_Nova_Scotia_1550.html" title="Halifax (former city), Nova Scotia">Halifax</a> with which <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Van_Buren_Bates_88a5.html" title="Martin Van Buren Bates">Martin Van Buren Bates</a> — another enormously tall person — was travelling, Anna was spotted by the promoter and hired on the spot. The giant couple became a touring sensation and eventually fell in love and, on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_17.html" title="June 17">17 June</a> <a href="../../../1/8/7/1871.html" title="1871">1871</a> in <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Martin-in-the-fields_0860.html" title="St Martin-in-the-fields">St Martin-in-the-fields</a> in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, they married. Rev. Rupert Cochrane, a 6 foot 3 inch tall native of Halifax, Nova Scotia, was conducting the ceremony. Despite his height, he looked small when standing near Anna Swan. Cochrane was a friend of Anna's family who happened to be preaching in London at the time.</p>
<p>They had two children, the first being a girl who was still-born on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_19.html" title="May 19">19 May</a> <a href="../../../1/8/7/1872.html" title="1872">1872</a>. The girl was the same size as her mother was at her own birth. The Bates family moved to Seville, Ohio, in June <a href="../../../1/8/7/1874.html" title="1874">1874</a> on their return from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. They purchased 120 acres of land and had furniture made to their specifications. Martin supervised the construction of the house. The main part of the house had 14 foot high ceilings, while the doors were extra wide and were 8 and a 1/2 feet tall. The back part of the house was built an average size for servants and guests.</p>
<p>Whilst touring in the summer of <a href="../../../1/8/7/1878.html" title="1878">1878</a>, Anna found that she was pregnant for the second time. Anna went into labour on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_15.html" title="January 15">January 15</a>, 1879. Anna continued in the first stages of labour for 36 hours, at which time hard labour began. Dr. Beach, their physician, realized that the birth wasn't going in a normal direction and tried using forceps, but the baby's head was too large. He called another Doctor who also tried using forceps. They put a strong bandage around the baby's neck to assist with the delivery. The baby was born on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_19.html" title="January 19">19 January</a>, but he survived only 2 hours. He was the largest newborn ever recorded, at 10.6&#160;kg, or 22 pounds and 28 inches (71 centimeters) tall and each of his feet was six inches long.</p>
<p>To help take their minds off their baby's death, the Bates' rejoined touring with W.W. Cole in the <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer.html" title="Summer">summer</a> of <a href="../../../1/8/7/1879.html" title="1879">1879</a>, and again in the <a href="../../../s/p/r/Spring_%28season%29.html" title="Spring (season)">spring</a> of <a href="../../../1/8/8/1880.html" title="1880">1880</a>, but that was to be their final ever tour and they retired after that.</p>
<p>The remaining years of Anna's life were spent quietly on the farm that she and her husband owned, mostly away from the <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limelight.html" title="Limelight">limelight</a>. She had joined the local <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptist_Church_46ee.html" title="Baptist Church">Baptist Church</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1877.html" title="1877">1877</a> and attended services, with her husband on a Sunday, up to her death. The <a href="../../../p/e/w/Pew.html" title="Pew">pew</a> in which they sat had to be enlarged and modified so they could sit comfortably. Anna sometimes taught <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunday_School_35de.html" title="Sunday School">Sunday School</a> there.</p>
<p>Anna Swan died suddenly and unexpectedly at her home on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_5.html" title="August 5">5 August</a> <a href="../../../1/8/8/1888.html" title="1888">1888</a> just one day before her 42nd birthday. She succumbed to <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heart_failure.html" title="Heart failure">heart failure</a> after struggling with a <a href="../../../g/o/i/Goitre.html" title="Goitre">thyroid goitre</a> for some time previously.</p>
<p>After his wife's <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death.html" title="Death">death</a>, Captain Bates wired <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland.html" title="Cleveland">Cleveland</a>, Ohio, for a coffin. A standard size coffin was sent as they believed that the wire was a mistake. Furious about this, Bates contacted them again to say that his first wire was correct. The <a href="../../../f/u/n/Funeral.html" title="Funeral">funeral</a> had to be delayed as it took the coffin three further days to arrive. Anna was finally buried on Monday <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_13.html" title="August 13">13 August</a>. Bates took no chances with his funeral, and kept his coffin in a barn for when he died in January <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a>.</p>
<p>Anna, Martin and their children are buried in Mound Hill Cemetery, <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seville%2C_Ohio_dcac.html" title="Seville, Ohio">Seville, Ohio</a>. Nearby is Anna's sister Maggie, who died from <a href="../../../t/u/b/Tubercolosis.html" title="Tubercolosis">Tubercolosis</a> in the spring of <a href="../../../1/8/7/1875.html" title="1875">1875</a> aged 22.</p>
