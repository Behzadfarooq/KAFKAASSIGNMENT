<h2><span class="mw-headline">Creationist</span></h2>
<p>In her new book she goes on about how Creationism is the correct "science". That would make her a creationist would it not? -- Archeus</p>
<p>All creationists fall into two overlapping classes. They are either fools or liars. Coulter, is, without doubt, a deliberate, public liar on this subject, since it is very hard to believe someone as well-educated as she is supposed to be would get the subject so wrong, unless with malice aforethought. For refutation of any and all of her published opinions on evolution see almost any reputable scientific web-site. 85.210.98.125 17:28, 10 July 2006 (UTC) G. Tingey.</p>
<p>I'm glad you aren't allowing any of your own bias to leak into your remarks. As to if she's a Creationist or not, the answer would be she is. - Temillion</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hey, I'm pretty open-minded on evolution vs. creation, but my faith in the liberal scientific community was shaken by one of her recent chapters: <i>Proof for How the Walkman Evolved into the iPod by Random Mutation.</i> Its main thrust wasn't to promote creationism, but to show how liberals cling with herd-like religious fervor to Darwin's theory, and how they react when it's challenged. Post-publication, they have reacted as she predicted. Doesn't that move her viewpoint a tiny bit closer to "theory?" <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 01:57, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If by "theory" you mean some sort of theory on the behaviors of the thin-skinned and how best to manipulate them, then yes, Coulter may indeed be a theorist of some note. &#160;:P As a firm supporter of the theory of evolution, it always upsets me when people allow themselves to be provoked by challenges to it. They miss the entire <i>point</i> of science, which is to always be challenging <i>yourself</i>. When some people, including those Coulter mocks, hear of a challenge to evolution, they foolishly try to squelch it, to shut the person up. When I hear of a challenge to evolution, I dare them to bring their best shot, because I don't think creationists have a real case to make. Some of my fellow evolution supporters like to constantly make snide comments about the mental cowardice of those who feel the need to believe in a creator, but I have a bigger problem with so-called supporters of science who don't have the mental courage to give an opposing view a fair hearing.</dd>

<p>Why is this woman described as such in the Ann Coulter article? What is the source for granting her that august title? And why do we care who her roomate was?

<dd>Please DO remove it. And at the risk of starting another all-consuming debate, I'm compelled to point out that Ms. Coulter's yester-year litigation work for the Center for Individual Rights, while marginally more important than the identity of her law school roommate, isn't notable enough to be included in the lead paragraph of her Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 14:46, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know of such a policy (but that doesn't mean one doesn't exist!). But I don't see why we would need to specifically note this anymore that we need to specifically note that one must purchase or locate a copy of a referenced book or journal article. Just because something is referenced doesn't mean that it will necessarily be easy or even possible for everyone to verify the citation.

<p>I have read that Coulter is provocative, self-confident and sexy, (and to many outrageous and annoying) like Mrs. M. L. Ciccone-Ritchie. I would add that unlike Ciccone-Ritchie, Coulter is coherent, intellectual and supportive of a truly uplifting culture.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Position of the bibliography within the article</span></h2>
<p>Archived Talk pages have briefly discussed this, and there's some current discussion on user talk pages. Here are the issues (doing my best to get 'em right):</p>
<ul>
<li>Bibliographies are usually at the end of articles</li>
<li>Those bibliographies are usually lists of books used as references or in creating another work. They usually include formal bibliographic information such as publisher, year, ISBN, etc.</li>
<li>This bibliography is a list of Coulter's books, which is a somewhat different thing</li>
<li>Some sort of list or discussion of Coulter's books belongs high up in the article, since her books are arguably her main claim to fame</li>
</ul>
<p>Probably there's a good solution, maybe by a text description of her works high up in the article, plus a bibliography (with ISBNs, etc.) at the end. Based on my understanding of past discussions, the text description, if any, should be brief in its descriptions of the books, an should include links to the separate, more detailed, articles on the books themselves. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 17:02, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you are confusing a <i>reference</i> section with a <i>bibliography</i> section. A <i>reference</i> is for all information used in the article. A <i>bibliography</i> section is a list of books (or articles) written by the subject. By its nature, it should be near the end of the article. The article should start with the person's bio, followed by discussion of the work, with a list of their work at the end. --<a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbl_629a.html" title="User:Asbl">Asbl</a> 17:08, 29 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, a bibliography can also be a section of works cited. They are sort of interchangable. But as there is no other section detailing her books, it should be near the top. The rest of the article would make no sense if the books were not laid out. References to <i>Slander</i>, <i>Godless</i>, etc. would be very confusing to readers. --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort"><font color="purple">LV</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELord_Voldemort_cf5f.html" title="User talk:Lord Voldemort"><font color="#3D9140">(Dark Mark)</font></a></sup> 17:17, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I took a stab at writing a proper section out of the list. I used whatever information was there. We can rename the section to something like "Coulter's books", "Books", or "Writings" (and include stuff from her columns).

<dd>I like LV's result. I'm strongly in favor of calling it something other than a <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bibliography.html" title="Bibliography">Bibliography</a>, since that word is understood by many to refer to a listing of sources. I like the idea of "Coulter's books" or, even better, "Coulter's writings." But if it's "writings," there's the challenge of how to include her columns (plus, somebody has to do it). Maybe a brief discussion of their general nature, followed by a link to some sort of archive of her columns, would work. Since she's a controversial writer, Wikipedians should have an easy way to get to her actual writings (so they can be inspired by them one way or another, so they won't say foolish things about them, etc.) <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 21:51, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Controversies section</span></h2>
<p>A lot of this section is devoted to matters that are not controversies. I think this needs to be fixed, hopefully after discussion. Point-by-point:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Introductory paragraphs.</b> Except for the kente cloth stuff, this is all about controversies. It's been a while since "citation needed" was added to the assertion that the kente stuff is controversial, but so far nobody has provided one.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>4.1 Speeches at college campuses.</b> All well-sourced controversies. The proof of the pudding is in the thousands of rowdy students.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>4.2 Investigation of alleged voting irregularity.</b> This is an important item, but not a controversy. It should stand by itself. BTW, her 30 days is up. What happened?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>4.3 Coulter on domestic separatists.</b> Not a controversy. Modestly notable, perhaps, (or perhaps not) but where to put it?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>4.4 Coulter on Arabs and Muslims.</b> Not a controversy, just a list of not particularly notable quotes. It says they are controversial, but it doesn't provide justification. Danish cartoons are controversial. This stuff isn't.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>4.5 Coulter on women.</b> Another bunch of sub-notable quotes with no evidence of a controversy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>4.6 Coulter on Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens.</b> It's a joke, not a controversy. The author even says so. Get rid of it or move it to the Jokes section.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>4.7 Coulter's role in Paula Jones-Bill Clinton controversy.</b> It's <i>about</i> a controversy, maybe, but it's hardly an Ann Coulter controversy. Like the voting irregularities, it's important and ought to stand by itself.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>4.8 Coulter on the four 9/11 widows known as "the Jersey Girls".</b> Like the college speeches, a well documented and well sourced controversy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>4.9 Coulter and Christianity.</b> Not a controversy, but a series of points about one of her animating beliefs. Important, but belongs elsewhere.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Lou, I hate to disagree with you because I think we agree politically, I like your edits, you discuss things on the talkpage, and most importantly you said something nice to me on my userpage.&#160;;-) However, I'm sure if <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Manson_8fd5.html" title="Charles Manson">Charles Manson</a> wrote a book it would be on the NYT's bestseller list and you wouldn't argue that his opinions are mainstream, would you? Be that as it may, while I disagree with the bus he's taking, I'm on board with Lou's destination. I agree Coulter has some radical opinions that are totally out of the mainstream, but if her wikipedia entry doesn't present a documented argument directed against her for holding that opinion, then it isn't being presented as a controversy, it's simply a mention of her opinion on a topic. And isn't it unbalanced if her only political viewpoints that get mentioned are ones that are radical? Unless critics' responses are added to her mentioned opinions (thereby presenting them as truly controversial), shouldn't her opinions be removed? <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 05:26, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The woman makes outrageous remarks, every one of which is controversial to some, but obvious truth to others. Some of her remarks are so controversial that, for example, student riots ensue. To me, the latter merit being in a "controversies" section, but the former do not. All I'm proposing is to put the notable controversies into the "controversies" section, and to put the other stuff elsewhere. (Please carefully read what I said at the start of this section.)

<dd>I strongly agree with Asbl. Lou, there is such a thing as keeping an article encyclopedic by good and careful trimming. I understand and support that idea. In this case, though, you're proposing that we go too far. Coulter's opinions are wildly beyond the mainstream. You are essentially proposing that we trim all her non-mainstream or outrageous comments. This would result in an article that would misrepresent not just who Coulter is, but also what others think of her. "Evidence of controversy" in several cases was removed by 84.etc's editing spree. "Jokes" are what <i>Coulter</i> calls some of her remarks; are we to implicitly support her characterizations of her remarks by titling a section "Jokes"? Clear structural bias. The article was more NPOV the way it was a day or two ago. Also, Lou, I'm curious why the information on Coulter's political campaign on the Libertarian ticket was removed. I've been watching this article for months, and I've seen the description of her remarks get milder and milder, until today she merely "troubles" some. I hardly know what to say to that. You honestly think that's all she does? <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 15:11, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Both of us, and all of us, should guard against our legitimate points of view coloring our edits in an encyclopedia. Maybe the description of her remarks has gotten "milder" because the editing community believes that's the right direction. And why do the comments of critics of Coulter so easily and numerously get into an article about Coulter? (We don't put polish jokes into the article on Poland. At least *I* don't.)</dd>

Putting Coulter's remark on Justice Stevens under "Jokes" implies that Wikipedia agrees it is a joke. Putting it under a section called "Death Threats" would be equally biased, in the opposite direction. Putting it under a section called "Coulter on Justice Stevens" is NPOV because it does not imply that any of the various characterizations of her remarks is "right"; it lets the reader decide. We can, and in fact <i>already do</i>, note that Coulter calls her own remarks jokes; that is as far as we can go. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 00:17, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

To put the remark about Stevens in a subsection labelled "Joke" is to insert a structural bias in favor of Coulter's characterization of her remark. <i>This is POV.</i> If it weren't a WP:POINT violation, I would retitle the section to "Death Threat against etc." to demonstrate how <i>structural bias</i> works. I have altered it to "Remark", which is NPOV. Please, whoever changed it, do not do so again unless you have a good reason.

<dd>Controversial statements are one thing, controversies are another. The strong reactions by broadcasters and lawmakers to the Jersey Girls statements, and Coulter's in-your-face responses are a notable controversy. So are catfights with auditoriums full of rowdy students, covered by newspapers and involving multiple ejections by ushers. Tasteless jokes about Supreme Court justices, while offensive to some, aren't controversies. Neither are religious beliefs, statements ridiculing women, or hyperbolic epithets about turban-wearers. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 08:34, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Um, I don't know what everyone else is talking about, but I think you're right, <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou</a>. There's a difference between significant controversies and presenting them in an encyclopedic manner - and listing a bunch of quotations that many people consider controversial and many people don't. Also, maybe if <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Manson_8fd5.html" title="Charles Manson">Charles Manson</a> wrote a book it could be on the best-seller list, but 5? All 5? All five of Coulter's books have been on the best-seller list. Oh, and her widely-read column. I would argue that she's on to <b>something mainstream</b> there. So while I'm not against keeping things in the article, many subsections in the Controversies section desperately need clean-up. It's not about listing quotations - if you want to list quotations, it should be in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikiquote.html" title="Wikiquote">wikiquote</a>. BUT actually about writing specific people who have found her statements controversial would constitute a controversy. Also, one could argue that EVERYTHING Coulter says is <i>controversial</i>, so why don't we just write EVERYTHING about her and that anyone can think of and everything she has said under the <i>"controversies"</i> section. Otherwise, we're not being very encyclopedic, since we're not fully expounding the immense <i>controversy</i> of this <i>controversial</i> woman: we're just picking and choosing which <i>controversial</i> subjects to list under her <i>controversies.</i> <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanselmdoc_839f.html" title="User:Stanselmdoc">Stanselmdoc</a> 13:32, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just to throw my two cents in here. The Charles Manson and Coulter comparison does not serve to make the point or, clear anything as regards book sells versus agreement or disagreement with mainstream thought. It is a bad analogy. While Manson's book might reach the bestsellers list out of society's morbid curiousity. Coulter is not a criminal so people could hardly be motivated to buy her books for that same reason. No one is guessing at what Coulter's politics are when they buy her books, either they are buying because, they want to know more or, they're buying because they already knowing they want to read more. Obviously, Coulter could not have sold five bestsellers if the majority of mainstream society could not relate to her politically - I do not think anyone would disagree that Coulter's books are political. I don't know why an encyclopedia entry on Coulter has to catagerize her as mainstream, radical, or controversial. Just state the facts and let the reader make up their mind if she's any of those, if the so, desire. To describe her as popular with the book buying public is accurate, irregardless of going into the reasons why people buy her (since an encyclopedia shouldn't claim to know the impossible to know) It would be fair to say that Ann Coulter would not be able to engage a majority of book buyers to buy her work if she were not popular with them for whatever reason. I hope this helps. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.131.45.44 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.131.45.44_5736.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.131.45.44">contribs</a>) 23:20, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>I'm amenable to that. But that doesn't remove the necessity for better clarifications of the quotes already listed. Some of them just read "Coulter once said this:...." which doesn't qualify it as a controversial statement. Sorry to the editors who want to put it in because they believe it is controversial, but it'd be great to actually find some source saying "and when Coulter called muslims this....blah blah blah...I was so angry and..." &lt;-- THAT qualifies as something to be written. Oh, and can we remove the bullet points of them?

<dd>I just re-read the Media career section, and overall it's pretty fair. The firings <i>are</i> notable, and they appear after several paragraphs of the kind of thing "Lawyer" wants to have in there. The last paragraph is pretty horrible, though. It used to be much fairer and more accurate (after much work and discussion), but a possible POV-pusher reverted it, without discussion, to its pre-discussion form. The editor it quotes was new when he said what he said, and he left a few weeks later, citing personal reasons. His dropping Coulter's column isn't notable at all, and his remarks, IMHO, are notable only because they're a hyperbolic attack on Coulter.

I don't think it's really POV; however, I do think that it would be great if we could mention when she was hired for NRO instead of presenting it like "oh yeah, and she was reprimanded by this group she worked for but we forgot to tell you about" hahaha.

I'm thinkin' that the "satan," "corn-fed" and "hippie" links might be more trouble than they're worth. All the blue in the names of the TV shows is majorly distracting, but some readers might not be familiar with the shows.

This one means, very briefly, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/controversy" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/controversy" rel="nofollow">this</a>. Controversy is also a special subject with Ann Coulter, since she specializes in <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/controversial" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/controversial" rel="nofollow">controversial</a> remarks that might cause it. Some of those remarks, such as the Jersey Girls stuff, spark very notable controversies. Others don't. The voting stuff, IMHO, has nothing to do with controversy (= debate, discussion, strife).

<dd>Off topic: The course I teach was formerly called <b>logic</b>, and used a <b>logic</b> textbook. It was renamed <a href="../../../c/r/i/Critical_thinking.html" title="Critical thinking">critical thinking</a>, and has a sort of pre-logic textbook. I have some theories about CT, as the experts in the field call it. If you look at the people in the CT field, they tend to be from schools of education, community colleges, and other places that are wonderful for what they do, but are not thought of as centers of intellect, high SAT's, etc. My theory is that CT courses are aimed at, and are helpful to, mostly students that aren't in rigorous courses at traditional universities. This is borne out by my current experience with my students, who don't naturally grasp the nature of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/argument" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/argument" rel="nofollow">argument</a> in the sense of using facts to support reasoned conclusions. Some of their eyes light up when they see how that is done. So it's not that they <i>can't</i> do critical thinking on their own, but that life hasn't given them the tools to do it. Their sense of argument is fighting with the bill collector or the baby's daddy or someone who disagrees with them, and that's about it. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 19:40, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It also studies <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fallacies.html" title="Fallacies">fallacies</a>, which helps the students to identify weak/false/misleading arguments.

I'm hoping to show my students the critical thinking behind those assertions. So far what I see is "it's so because I think/feel/say it's so," which I suppose is a kind of <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_authority.html" title="Appeal to authority">appeal to authority</a>. There's also a bit of <i><a href="../../../a/r/g/Argumentum_ad_populum.html" title="Argumentum ad populum">argumentum ad populum</a></i>, when an editor says "it's so because Tom, Dick, and Harry and I say it's so." And I don't remember the name for it right now, but the voting comments have a lot of "Socrates is not a man. He is a human being, and a Greek, and a dead white male, so he definitely isn't a man." I remain hopeful that I'll see some sound arguments for both the things I inquired about (especially that voting isn't political). <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 12:43, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that voting is an inherently political action. But I don't think it's a significant political action in the context of an encyclopedia. The issue is present not because Coulter voted but because she is alleged to have screwed up when registering. If it was accidental, then I don't think it even deserves mention. If it was intentional, then it deserves mention not in a political context but in a criminal or controversial context. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 01:09, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The voting stuff was off by itself, or maybe in the Controversies section, where I thought it definitely didn't belong, at least according to Wikipedia's definition of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversy.html" title="Controversy">controversy</a>. (Far from actively arguing about it, Ms. Coulter is even declining to answer letters.) Since voting is the quintessential political activity, I put it under that heading. I won't be surprised if someone makes up a "Felonious acts" section and puts it there.

Before I added it back, there were 3 long paragraphs describing what she said, another describing how she was responding to the criticism, and only one 2 sentences about what the criticism actually was. The Lauer interview is notable because that's really the begining of the controversy. Emanuel's criticism is notable because of what he said and where he said it, not just because he criticized her. Roemer's criticism is notable because of his status as a member of the 9/11 commission and also because he told people not to buy the book out of respect for the widows. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaximusveritas_5f31.html" title="User:Maximusveritas">Maximusveritas</a> 03:15, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>IMHO you did the right thing (explained it well, too). That whole section does a pretty good job of laying out Coulter's views, presenting the criticism, and presenting Coulter's response. I don't see any reason to delete any of the criticisms, provided that Coulter's response to them is given as well.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think the title of the section is too long and too awkward, however. Most of its words are repeated in the first sentence below it. Maybe somebody can come up with a better one.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, there probably should be a sentence about the Lauer questions or comments that Coulter thought were "testy." It should go between <i>"...interviewed Coulter."</i> and <i>"She defended her statements..."</i> The present version leaves us wondering. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 04:25, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I agree about the title and about the need for an additional sentence about the Lauer interview. I tried to come up with a sentence originally, but I couldn't find a good quote from the interview or a neat way of summarizing it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Messed up citation</span></h2>
<p>The citation for the voting irregularities stuff is somewhat cockeyed. Clicking it leads not to a citation, but to three references identified only by number. One of them leads to an external article that provides support. One leads to a place where you have to be a member to sign in. Another leads to the entrance of somebody's archive. Can somebody please clean it up? <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 09:30, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Two of the three sources are definitely only available to subscribers of the respective publisher/archive.

<dd>The first source is pretty inclusive, and IMHO it would be strong enough to support the stuff that refers to it. The other two could just be dropped. It would also be good if the link to the first one could include more self-description, as most of the others in the area do.

<dd>With respect to references in Wikipedia: Good luck. It's a big mess of inconsistency. IMHO, Wikipedia's "let everyone do it their own way as long it's consistent in the article" way of working doesn't work so well with references. The various citation templates are okay but their display in the article leaves much to be desired. I try not to get worked up over it; I'm usually pleased as punch when editors make a good faith effort to cite their sources at all. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 21:19, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're definitely right about the diversity. In the Coulter article, most of the references contain some plain text describing what they're about. I haven't figured out the different formats, but at least when I look at one of them, I've got some idea of what I'm looking at. Right now, only one reference consists only of a number. Two of them consist only of a URL. The other 50(!) pretty much tell you what they are. I have to say, however, following them doesn't always lead to where they say it will. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 04:47, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Lou tried to change the title of the "Hobbies" subsection to "Deadhead." I reverted the change. I agree that "Hobbies" is not a very good title. But I don't like the title "Deadhead" as a don't think that's a term familiar to everyone, particular to international readers. It could have unintentional negative connotations (or denotations, for that matter) for those people who don't know about the Grateful Dead.

<dd>It would help if you summarized those "very good reasons" in your response to my comment, otherwise I have no idea where you're coming from. As it is, the <a href="../../../a/n/n/Talk%7EAnn_Coulter_Archive_10_6474.html#Trivia" title="Talk:Ann Coulter/Archive 10">discussion</a> regarding the trivia section is pretty lacking an in-depth rationale for removing the section. So why did I move and trim the Grateful Dead information? Because it looks extremely odd to have such a trivial piece of information concerning a subject located at the very beginning of an article, not to mention unwieldy due to it nearly being a paragraph in length. The reader wants to get right into the meat-and-potatoes of a subject; they don't want to be sidetracked from the very get-go with humorous and flimsy anecdotes; those are for later -- much later. <a href="../../../j/2E/r/User%7EJ.R._Hercules_fd8f.html" title="User:J.R.

<dd>I deleted the trivia section and moved the Grateful Dead reference back to biography. Trivia sections as a whole are generally frowned upon as un-encyclopedia, as they merely tend to just be conglomerations of non-notable, unreferenced information. For the sake of this article, since it's fairly controversial, it's also a bad idea to have the trivia section since it would tend to provide a very easy place for vandals and conspiracy theorists to insert crap. The Grateful Dead part is somewhat notable, though, since it does say something interesting about Ann Coulter that is a bit unusual for someone as conservative as she is; Deadheads are generally more associated with the marijuana-smoking, 'hippie' crowd, which tends to be a bit more liberal. I also located a much more suitable reference for this as well. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek.cashman_b6d7.html" title="User:Derek.cashman">Dr. Cash</a> 18:33, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree on killing the Trivia. It has been in and out several times, and IMHO most people think it should be OUT. I also agree that her being a Deadhead is notable enough to be included, and pretty much for the reasons you stated. I didn't check your reference, but there was a very recent interview about her Deadhead stuff, and it was very enlightening. It was formerly one of the references on the Deadhead stuff, and I think it still belongs there--it was unbiased and covered things very well, IMHO. I don't know how to find it and restore it, though. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 18:49, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article keeps getting longer and longer, and it seems to me that some of the sub-sub-sub-headings are unnecessary.</p>
<p>In the very long Controversies section, some paragraphs now have their own sub-sub-headings. Even some single sentences now have their own sub-sub-headings. If we are going to put headings before every single item or thought, we should do it for the whole article, not just for one sub-section under Controversies.

Half of it isn't even controversies - it's just a list of things editors themselves call controversies. If we work to fix the general outlay of things, the sub section headings may actually just disappear on their own. I plan on working on it, but I have to take a pseudo-break for a while.

<p>First, the leftwing blog rudepundit was the source for the History Channel item and rudepundit has retracted that allegation noting that Coulter actually did attribute the info to the actual source (WaPo). Second, both RawStory and Rudepundit are leftwing/liberal/progressive (you pick a name - it all means the same thin in this context) websites. These liberal (and always anti-Coulter) websites are the source of the plagiarism allegations. It is both factual and relevant. As is the dearth of "plagiarism" allegations despite 5 best-selling books and several years' worth of weekly columns. <a href="../../../1/3/6/User%7E136.215.251.179.html" title="User:136.215.251.179">136.215.251.179</a></p>

And you haven't answered my question as to why you removed allegation of plagiarism of the History Channel. Scroll a few paragraphs up to my conversation with Lou, and look at how he behaves. <i>That</i> is how to behave in a collegiate manner here: you listen to what the other guy has to say, you respond in kind, and you <i>wait on declaring victory until he's had a reasonable time in which to respond</i>. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 14:02, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have already responded to your History Channel question above (perhaps you did not check for my response before complaining), and in addition <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ann_Coulter&amp;diff=62163377&amp;oldid=62161911" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ann_Coulter&amp;diff=62163377&amp;oldid=62161911" rel="nofollow">I explained the edit in an edit summary at the time I made the change</a>. When people shit on the article, I tend to clean it up rather than wait for a consensus to remove the excrement. Can you imagine if we flushed toilets by committee consensus? Here is the retraction located on the <a href="http://rudepundit.blogspot.com/" class="external text" title="http://rudepundit.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">home page of rudepundit under the July 3 entry</a>:</p>

<li><i>Correction: One of the pieces of the Coulter plagiarism puzzle must be tossed. It was always the weakest example. For this passage: "A few years after oil drilling began in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, a saboteur set off an explosion blowing a hole in the pipeline and releasing an estimated 550,000 gallons of oil," Coulter does cite an August 24, 1982 Washington Post article by Jay Mathews that reads, "The worst -- and most mysterious -- break occurred on Feb. 15, 1978, when someone, in an apparent act of sabotage, blew a hole in the pipeline near here that spilled about 550,000 gallons of oil."</i></li>

<dd>Ah, I see now. I didn't understand your edit summary or what you meant by WaPo. There still remain the issues of "Liberals allege" and the Tucson paper. If you feel upset that I complain a lot, it might be because I have to do a lot of it just to get you to discuss a single issue at a time on the talk page.

<dd>There's consensus from <i>me</i> on removing the Tucson paper quote. Here's why: 1) It's in the citation. 2) It uses inflammatory words. 3) The guy asserts that conservatives knocked her, but IMHO his assertion is questionable. 4) The guy resigned a few weeks later, under circumstances consistent with being fired. 5) One paper dropping her isn't notable. 6) There's always the suspicion that the quote is in there just because it's particularly hateful (or uses particularly strong words, if you prefer.) <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 14:18, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I admit to lack of patience. But I won't admit to not earnestly seeking a quality article that fairly and accurately portrays the notable facts. Lou is right on the Tucson thing. During the invasion of the left-wing Coulter haters to this article, of course there was lots of sentiment for highlighting everything negative. An honest assessment of ONE PAPER dropping a column carried by over a hundred would be that the fact is NOT material for an encyclopedia article on Coulter. Coulter did not advocate firebombing the editors house and there was nothing else of n ote regarding the actions of this editor. He did not think the column was appropriate for the paper he edited, so he axed it. Fine. So what? There is nothing more to that story. How can it be considered something of note in the life of Ann COulter? What is funny is that the continued wide popularity of her column (which is noteworthy on its own) would not have even been added to the article if it had not been for the overzealous editing of the Coulter-haters who wanted to make it seem as if Coulter had her back against the wall. I laugh at the plagiraism stuff, too, becuase all that is resulting is that people who would never hear of the gross tax-funded art projects or foolish environmentalist fit set off by a weed are now made aware of how right Coulter is on those points! <a href="../../../1/3/6/User%7E136.215.251.179.html" title="User:136.215.251.179">136.215.251.179</a></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Coulter's style</span></h2>
<p>Ann Coulter makes sweeping and provocative statements. She seems to court controversy. It's hard to tell just how serious or "satirical" she means to be.</p>
<p>Did she really <b>literally</b> mean that she advocates the domestic terrorist bombing of the New York Times building in Times Square? According to "E&amp;P Staff", she:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"refuted the notion that she is only joking" <a href="http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002765267" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002765267" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>However, in addition to this interpretation they quote her at length:</p>
<ul>
<li>"No, I think the Timothy McVeigh line was merely prescient after The New York Times has leapt beyond -- beyond nonsense straight into treason, last week," Coulter replied.</li>
<li>"This is great humor," Colmes replied, sarcastically. "This belongs on Saturday Night Live. It belongs on The Daily Show. "</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the <i>Editor &amp; Publisher</i> article characterizes her <b>tone</b> as speaking "sarcastically". <a href="http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002765267" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002765267" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></p>
<p>Note further that they quote hes as saying "This is great humor".</p>
<p>This would seem to contradict E&amp;P's own view, in which they cite her as denying that she is only joking. Perhaps she is being half-serious, or using sarcasm and exaggeration to make a serious point.</p>
<p>Satirist <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Swift_100b.html" title="Jonathan Swift">Jonathan Swift</a> suggested (in apparent seriousness) that the Irish Famine could be solved via what he called <i><a href="../../../a/_/m/A_Modest_Proposal_989b.html" title="A Modest Proposal">A Modest Proposal</a></i>: to wit, that the British should literally eat Irish babies.</p>
<p>I submit that an essential aspect of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satire.html" title="Satire">satire</a> is to blur the distinction between straightforward serious assertions and obvious joking. In fact, the Wikipedia article about Swift's <i>Proposal</i> states:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is widely believed to be the greatest example of sustained irony in the history of the English language. [and]</li>
<li><b>The satirical intent of A Modest Proposal was misunderstood by many of Swift's peers</b> (emphasis added for talk page), and he was harshly criticized for writing prose in such exceptionally "bad taste". He came close to losing his patronage because of this essay. The misunderstanding of the intent of the satirical attack came about largely because of the disparity between the satirical intent of the cannibalistic proposal and the sincere tone of the narrative voice.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think we should hestitate therefore to characterize Coulter as "refuting the notion that she is only joking". That should not be the POV of the article but perhaps of E&amp;P magazine. --<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWing_Nut_3e6c.html" title="User:Wing Nut">Wing Nut</a> 14:48, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>NPOV can easily be reached in this section by adding no extra information, reporting exactly who and what said what.

<dd>Well, I only meant that I think it would be a service to your readers to include as much of the accusations of plagiarism (and evidence about it) as will fit. Then readers can either see (1) how much of a cheater Coulter is or (2) how much her opponents blow things out of proportion. I mean, isn't it up to the reader to draw their own conclusions, based on the reliable facts presented in this encyclopedia? --<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWing_Nut_3e6c.html" title="User:Wing Nut">Wing Nut</a> 21:17, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regarding the <i>amount of plagiarism</i>, please note this quote from John Barrie: "<i>It didn't take long to find evidence of plagiarism, Barrie said. "After we found three in the book, we called it quits. I think we found four of her syndicated columns that had problems." But the task proved draining, he said -- on himself, not his technology. "After combing through Ann Coulter for a while, it doesn't take long before you want to call it quits. I want to prove the technology, but I don't want to make my eyes bleed."<a href="http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/001061.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/001061.php" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 13:27, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<p>Now that we've agreed to write about Barrie's research, what can we do with this blog entry?</p>
<dl>
<dd>One of the pieces of the Coulter plagiarism puzzle must be tossed. It was always the weakest example. For this passage: "A few years after oil drilling began in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, a saboteur set off an explosion blowing a hole in the pipeline and releasing an estimated 550,000 gallons of oil," Coulter does cite an August 24, 1982 Washington Post article by Jay Mathews that reads, "The worst -- and most mysterious -- break occurred on Feb. 15, 1978, when someone, in an apparent act of sabotage, blew a hole in the pipeline near here that spilled about 550,000 gallons of oil." <a href="http://rudepundit.blogspot.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://rudepundit.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Is this one of Barrie's examples? Did the NY Post article even <b>give</b> any examples? (Or just assert "He found a 24-word passage"?)</p>
<p>Anyway, these things usually end with either an apology (and correct citation) by the publisher - or for egregious cases, a withdrawal of the book, possible what Liberal (non-Wikipedian!) opponents hope for. Sometimes it goes to court - which would drive up book sales, hmm...

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Controversies Section Cont'd</span></h2>
<p>Above, there is a lovely beginning discussion on the atrococity of Coulter's controversy section (particularly the Muslim, Women, and Confederate flag sections). I would like to clean it up and fix it. Here are my problems:</p>
<p><b>1. One sentence is not a paragraph.</b> If Coulter created a noteworthy controversy, it has to be able to merit at least three sentences. If you can't think of three sentences to write about a controversy, how can it possibly be THAT notable as to warrant a mention? Everything Coulter says could be argued as controversial, so unless it created a BIG controversy (i.e. the Jersey-girls and the other things listed in her article) it shouldn't be listed as a controversy.</p>
<p><b>2. Half of the things currently listed have no mention of controversy.</b> Basically the entire "Coulter on Muslims" and "Coulter on women" sections are just lists of quotes that some editors thought were controversial. Well, they might be controversial statements, but that doesn't mean they are a controversy. It means Coulter says mean things, oh nooooo...STILL, unless there is some article out there where some guy says "Ann Coulter said this about women and I'm angry blah blah blah", <i>there is no controversy.</i> If no one has responded to a statement she has said, it's POV for an editor to decide to put THAT quote in her article.</p>
<p><b>3. Speaking of all the quotes, we have wikiquote for a reason.</b> Now, I'm SURE someone as controversial as Coulter has an excellent wikiquote article. I'm not opposed to finding sources for the quotes and saying, "when Coulter said this ... she made people angry and they ..." In fact, I would like some help in finding sites like that (since for some reason, I'm having trouble finding people who were angry about every quote listed). However, if someone didn't go "WTF? That stupid Ann Coulter!" when he read what she said, and he THEN wrote his opinion down in a news article or some other source, WHERE IS THE CONTROVERSY?? The quote should be removed from wikipedia and placed in wikiquote.</p>

<p>Her anti-Arab and anti-Muslims statements may not have caused as much commotion as did her comments about the 9/11 widows, which suggests a lot about the feelings towards Arabs and Muslims, but nevertheless, they have angered many people, been condemned by media-watch groups, Muslim groups, and writers, so I can't understand how you did not find anything on this because I found many sources quite easily simply using Google.

<p>IMHO, and I am only one editor among many, the following subsections, taken individually or as a whole, are the major contributors to the section's current atrocity: 1) Criticism of her style; 2) Domestic separatists; 3) Arabs and Muslims; 4) Women; 5) Confederate flag.

<p>I happened to like the "Coulter courts controversy" line and have refactored the heading to include this. She's a self-described polemicist <a href="http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/April06/coulter.pre.dea.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/April06/coulter.pre.dea.html" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> so it's not POV to say that she actively tries to "stir the pot" (her own words).

I hope this helps. -- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_d5cd.html" title="User:Malber">Malber</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalber_7564.html" title="User talk:Malber">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malber_b734.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malber">contribs</a>) 14:18, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Implementing these changes, I think we should determine which things are actual controversies (the point of the changes&#160;:-)). I'd say, off-hand and from my memory banks, the only real "controversies" are pretty sure the bombing of the New York Times quote, definitely the "Jersey Girls" stuff recently, probably the plagiarism, and perhaps the voting stuff. Other than that, it is just polemic speech that <i>some</i> people don't like, but has not caused real "controversy". Did I miss any? Most of the other stuff may have a place in the article, but perhaps not under the heading of controversy. Thoughts? --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort"><font color="purple">LV</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELord_Voldemort_cf5f.html" title="User talk:Lord Voldemort"><font color="#3D9140">(Dark Mark)</font></a></sup> 21:22, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If I remember correctly, LV, a looooooong time ago, there were two separate sections: <i>Controversy</i> and <i>Criticism</i>. I think they were merged into one "Controversy" heading, but I could be wrong. It was over a year ago. I'm not necessarily opposed to creating a "Criticism" section again and placing the other things in that section, but my main problem is the fact that none of it is sourced or even written well. I just didn't want to start making changes on it until I'd commented on it on the talk page to see if people were amenable to the idea. It seems the many people agree things should change a little, so I might get a little <b><a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBold_3536.html" title="WP:Bold">bolder</a></b>. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanselmdoc_839f.html" title="User:Stanselmdoc">Stanselmdoc</a> 16:08, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I've read these parts of the article many times, and I've thought them over a LOT. It helps to look at the Wikipedia entry for <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversy.html" title="Controversy">controversy</a></b>. IMHO, the <b>"Allegations of proper conduct"</b> are exactly that, and should <b>not</b> be in a "controversies" section, because they really aren't <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversy.html" title="Controversy">controversies</a>. I believe the college stuff, the Jersey Girls stuff, and the New York Times stuff are <b>"Notable controversies"</b> (because of the riots etc. at the colleges and the wide discussion in the media of the other two). I don't bother too much with the material in the <b>"Coulter causes controversy"</b> section, because IMHO it isn't well-written, has a lot of material that isn't presented from a neutral point of view, and is strongly but not necessarily reasonably defended by people who like it.</p>
<p>Also, I'm in favor of heading each of the college controversies with the name of the school, and nothing else. That gets rid of the edit skirmishes that the headings have inspired in the past. And I don't like the unwieldy title on the New York Times allegation. I prefer <i>"Bombing" the New York Times</i> or something similar, using the quotation marks to show it wasn't an actual event. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 17:34, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>She's skinny, too, but hopefully we don't have to cite references. I'm not at all bothered when someone characterizes her as a polemecist, as controversial, as shocking, or anything else that she obviously is, but fails to quote a source. But when they line up a jillion Muslim quotes, all properly cited, and leave readers to infer that she's some sort of an anti-Muslim bigot, it kinda starts to bother me.

<dd>Hey, if you can find quotes where Coulter talks about her desire to give every Muslim in the world a hug and a flower while standing under rainbows and petting kittens, be my guest - add them to the article.

<dd>Kase And <b>Raul654</b>, I understand your point of view that Coulter is anti-Arab/Muslim, anti-Woman, and anti-domestic separatist (I infer it from "walks like a duck," etc.). I just wish you wouldn't ask us to infer its <i>validity</i> from a series of sourced but out-of-context minor quotations. I'm somewhat familiar with Coulter's work, and those three subjects are <i>not</i> important themes in it. In fact, she hardly mentions them at all. At best, her words on them are hyperbolic <a href="../../../o/b/i/Obiter_dicta.html" title="Obiter dicta">obiter dicta</a>. Coulter's <i>important</i> themes are the flaws in liberalism and the Democrat party. She advances those themes with articulate tightly-reasoned arguments, whose insight and validity underly her importance as an author. Since there's almost nothing in this article about the <i>major</i> aspects of her work, it's particularly unsuitable that there's so very much material about the <i>trivial</i> ones. It's as though the article on <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Biden_615e.html" title="Joe Biden">Joe Biden</a> consisted mainly of a collection of his controversial quotations, grouped to encourage the (incorrect) inference that he's a fool, long sections about his alleged plagiarisms, and barbs about his baldness and hair replacement. But the Biden article is well-policed by important Wikipedians, and those very sourceable topics aren't even mentioned. That is as it should be, of course, and I wonder why important Wikipedians don't grant the same basic courtesy to Ann Coulter. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 01:25, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Wow. It went from a sentence in the controversies section to the new title. It may be tongue-in-cheek, clever and even a statement I agree with, but it now reads like a <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sensationalist.html" title="Sensationalist">sensationalist</a> headline. As much as I dislike Coulter and her views, controversial articles like this need to be as neutral as possible. Telling the reader what to think of her controversies is wrong, IMHO. They can easily come to that conclusion themselves. Lets stick to the facts and trust the reader to be able to make their own judgements. As for me, I'm not going to edit this article any longer. The opinion war here is too volatile for my taste. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadmonkey0001_1df6.html" title="User:Badmonkey0001">badmonkey</a> 20:57, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Here is the retraction about the History Channel allegation located on the home page of <b>rudepundit</b> under the July 3 entry:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Correction: One of the pieces of the Coulter plagiarism puzzle must be tossed. It was always the weakest example. For this passage: "A few years after oil drilling began in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, a saboteur set off an explosion blowing a hole in the pipeline and releasing an estimated 550,000 gallons of oil," Coulter does cite an August 24, 1982 Washington Post article by Jay Mathews that reads, "The worst -- and most mysterious -- break occurred on Feb. 15, 1978, when someone, in an apparent act of sabotage, blew a hole in the pipeline near here that spilled about 550,000 gallons of oil."</b></li>
</ul>
<p><br />
I have removed POV commentary inserted by Hercules that is not aimed at a better article. Talk page is not a place for posting anti-Coulter POV editorials. What IS relevant is that Rudepundit has RETRACTED an allegation that the wikipedia article still cites. Your dumbass POV pushing is now exposed for all to see. Botttom line: the wikipedia article now contains retracted material as a source - becuase jackasses who hate Coulter, such as Hercules, do not have any interest in an unbiased article. <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.243.10.html" title="User:84.146.243.10">84.146.243.10</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Not so fast. Here's the rest of Rudepundit's retraction, just to make things where they stand more clear:</li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>While no doubt some will look at this and go "A-ha, all the allegations are false," nothing could be further from the truth. The Rude Pundit stands by, and re-emphasizes, motherfuckers, every other instance of plagiarism in Coulter's work, especially now that it's been backed up by the New York Post. Coulter's plagiarism is at least as bad as that of Kaayva Viswanathan, whose book, How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got a Life, was recalled by its publisher.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Oh, by the way, Coulter does not cite any source for her main point of the example: "Six weeks later, the birds were back." Indeed, Prudhoe Bay is more or less fucked up for the birds. <a href="http://rudepundit.blogspot.com/2006/07/late-night-new-york-times-in-smoky.html" class="external free" title="http://rudepundit.blogspot.com/2006/07/late-night-new-york-times-in-smoky.html" rel="nofollow">http://rudepundit.blogspot.com/2006/07/late-night-new-york-times-in-smoky.html</a></i></b></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Yo, anti-Coulter editors</span></h2>
<p>Your plagiarism section, as has been pointed out repeatedly in the talk section, is all dicked up. Its as POV as it gets. In addition to relying on left-wing blogs, it also contains an allegation that has been retracted by the leftwing blog that is cited as the source (the History Channel allegation is just plain false and ridepundit has even admitted that to be the case). If there was even half of an attempt to fix this section the article would have some credibility. As it stands, it sucks as the anti-Coulter POV oozes from the article. <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.146.243.105.html" title="User:84.146.243.105">84.146.243.105</a></p>

<p>No. This article is as biased as can be. Folowing the civility rules has gotten registered level-headed editors like LouSander absolutely nowhere. The NPOV and source rules are being blatantly breached and the leftists here don't give a damn. SO fuck off. I am glad you have to lock down the article.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Indiana University</span></h2>
<p><b>Short version:</b> "Gay boy" stinks in the heading. Get rid of it.</p>
<p><b>Long version:</b> It's pretty clear that the incident at Indiana was mainly notable for the heat that was generated in a large audience. The headline of the cited article is <i>Coulter Splits IU's Crowd.</i> Much of the article is about the disruptions to Coulter's speech, and the accompanying actions of the police. Much of it is about her attacks on public figures and institutions such as Howard Dean, the Democrat Party and the "liberal media." A very small part of the article quotes Coulter's response to three "fans and protestors," one of whom was the "gay boy." A larger part quotes student leaders defending Coulter and deploring the rowdiness of the crowd. The wrapup is six paragraphs discussing people's reaction to the evening's events, <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>.</p>
<p>IMHO, the Indiana sub-sub-sub section of our article is a reasonably fair summary of the controversy at IU. But its title is improper and should be changed to eliminate "gay boy." No <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversy.html" title="Controversy">controversy</a> over Coulter's "gay boy" barb is reported in the source, and as far as I can tell from other research, there <i>was</i> no <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversy.html" title="Controversy">controversy</a> surrounding it. It was just another exchange between Coulter and a boorish heckler. In other words, the word "gay boy" was in no way a notable factor in the activities of the evening, as we all can see in the source. Yet we title it as though it's about "gay boy." Puzzling, eh? Not very professional, IMHO. Also not very indicative that the article is written with a neutral viewpoint.</p>
<p>I think that fairness, truthfulness, honesty, and respect for our readers and our subject all say that the heading of this sub-sub-sub section should be about the "splitting of the crowd" (or like that), which is, of course, what the sub-sub-sub section is about. The same principles say we should abandon the words "gay boy" in the heading. This is not a supermarket tabloid, and those words, though definitely spoken during the evening, were in no way notable to the audience or the IU newspaper.</p>
<p>Others say that the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversy.html" title="Controversy">controversy</a> in this speech is about the use of "gay boy." Nothing I see supports that view. It seems to be pulled out of thin air. We can't have a "This is What *I* Think" (TWIT), and "If *I* Think It, It Must RULE" attitude. TWIT isn't good enough. TWIT needs some factual material behind it.</p>
<p>I believe that using "gay boy" in the sub-sub-sub heading is very, very, very improper. Our common interest says we need to send it packing.</p>
<p>Please comment. After all, I may be missing something. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 03:05, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Proposal:</b> It's notable that Coulter inspires <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversies.html" title="Controversies">controversies</a> at college speeches. I didn't like all the sub-sub-sub headings when they first appeared, but now I'm coming to see their benefit. They're a bit long, though, since the stuff they head consists of short paragraphs that link to some very good sources. They also tend to create unproductive disputes. I propose that the sub-sub-sub headings just state the name of the school. The material below them will summarize the specific controversy, and the references will provide the details. If the proposal is agreeable, the sub-sub-sub headings would be <b>University of Arizona</b>, <b>University of Connecticut</b>, <b>Philander Smith College</b>, and <b>Indiana University</b>. Then we'd have a section on Notable Controversies, a subsection on Speeches on College Campuses, and several succinct examples, complete with useful, non-objectionable sub-sub-sub headings and solid references that provide the details of each <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversy.html" title="Controversy">controversy</a>. IMHO, the result would be a subsection that is notable, informative, and presented from a neutral point of view. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 14:38, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I disagree with Dcflyer; it is an illustrative example of Coulter's public speaking style, in which she hectors and abuses her audience. The speech derives its notability from its ability to describe her speaking style. Otherwise the argument could be made that any particular sample of Coulter's writings, behavior, speaking, <i>anything</i> is not "notable" in and of itself. Their purpose here is to help describe the person herself. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 23:00, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with Kasreyn that the IU speech is a good example and should be kept, provided it can be reported from a neutral viewpoint. I'm sort of surprised that Kasreyn, a notable advocate of "NPOV," seems only to see one side of the Coulter/audience story. At IU, for example, student disruption of the program is in the lead of the news report; Coulter stops speaking "more than ten times" so that unruly students can be removed by the ushers; one student wears a KKK-like costume and a crudely humorous sign; others act rudely and ask rude questions; Coulter responds in kind. This is hardly, IMHO, a story about Coulter "hectoring and abusing her audience." Neither are any of the others. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 23:53, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
