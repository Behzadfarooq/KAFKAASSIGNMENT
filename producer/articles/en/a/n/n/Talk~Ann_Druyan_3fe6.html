<ol>
<li>Why not leave <b>Ann Druyan</b> in bold?</li>
</ol>
<p>Ok.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why not leave the birth date?</li>
</ol>
<p>Ok.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the evidence that Ann Druyan had any serious personal interest in pantheism?</li>
</ol>
<p>Plenty. She and her late husband Carl Sagan both WERE ones, as their own works and own sayings do clearly demonstrate.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Saying it in ALL CAPS does not make it true. What is "clear" is that you use your biased interpretation of Sagan and Druyan in order to put a label on them.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
What makes it true are the actual sayings and writings of Druyan and Sagan, themselves. That is not bias.-PV</p>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Some people feel the need to place labels like "pantheist" on Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan. Sagan and Druyan frequently thought, wrote, and spoke about <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a>, yet they never endorsed <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pantheism.html" title="Pantheism">pantheism</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Not true.-PV</p>
<p><br />
Those who would label Sagan and Druyan as pantheists seem to imagine that Sagan and Druyan simply failed to publicly announce that they were pantheists.</p>
<p>They didn't have to do so, explicitly, their own words and ideals indirectly had actually said it for them.-PV</p>
<p>The alternative and more plausible explanation is that they knew perfectly well what pantheism is and rejected it. This view is supported by their many writings that stress the idea that people can have a sense of awe and wonder about the cosmos without introducing the man-made "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fifth_Wheel_0df6.html" title="The Fifth Wheel">5th wheel</a>" of god.</p>
<p>Again, half-true. Pantheism is not any belief in any man-made Personal God, ie. fifth wheel, but, in the IMPERSONAL GOD of the COSMOS, ie. the Natural and SCIENTIFIC LAWS and FORCES of NATURE.-PV</p>

If you read Druyan's work, you will find that she mentions god in the context of showing how to "explain the wonder of nature without resorting to the God hypothesis". Druyan gives frequent examples of how introducing god is only a source of distraction from the science's goal of finding the truth. <a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 00:42, 9 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Subtract "god" from "God Hypothesis" and think about what is left. Druyan is perfectly comfortable finding her place as part of the cosmos without any god. <a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 00:57, 9 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How can Druyan's article even be compared to a textbook on pantheism when she does not even use the word "pantheism"? Subtract "god" from pantheism and you might get to what Druyan is talking about. <a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 19:12, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>She didn't have to even use the word "pantheism", explicitly, because it was IMPLIED. No. Subtract a "Personal God" from pantheism, and you still will get "pantheism", which is an Impersonal "God" of Cosmos. You just seem just not so very bright, are you?-PV</p>
<p>I haven't followed this particular edit war and it has no relevence on my comment. NPOV articles do not include questions like "maybe someone should actually ask her". Please keep that kind of editorial note in the talk page discussions. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture">Tεx</a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User_talk%7ETexture_2199.html" title="User talk:Texture"><font color="red">τ</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture">urε</a> 17:17, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Indeed, nor vice versa!-PV</p>

<dl>
<dd>Protection from attribution of religious beliefs is in no way a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commutative_operation.html" title="Commutative operation">commutative</a> process. To claim commutivity in this case would be to suggest that you are free to attribute religious beliefs to Sagan since he did not make a comprehensive list of every religion and make clear that he did not believe in each of them. However, Sagan was under no obligation to create such a list in order to be protected from false attributions of religious beliefs to him. His writings make clear that he rejected all religions. <a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 15:43, 9 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not relevant nor true.</p>
<p>It is obvious that Carl Sagan didn't reject <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pantheism.html" title="Pantheism">pantheism</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmotheism.html" title="Cosmotheism">cosmotheism</a>, but, in fact, quite clearly affirmed it.-PV</p>

<p>Because it is obviously false.-PV</p>
<p>Both Carl and Annie only had rejected all traditional religions and their divisive PERSONAL GOD's, but, not the Impersonal <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pantheist.html" title="Pantheist">pantheistic</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmotheist.html" title="Cosmotheist">cosmotheistic</a> "GOD or DIVINITY" of the COSMOS as a WHOLE.-PV</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>She does not say "freedom from traditional religions" and then go on to advocate pantheism. It is not required that she list every religion and say that she rejects it. What <b>IS</b> required is that your claim that she is a pantheist be backed up by evidence. While she has thought about the idea that some people like to imagine that god is the cosmos, you have to provide evidence that she endorsed that idea that equating god with the cosmos is in some way useful OVER and ABOVE just enjoying the intellectual recognition of the unity of the cosmos. Where does she <b>endorse</b> (not just mention) the idea of equating the cosmos with god? Give use the quote. <a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 18:04, 9 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
She didn't have to say "from traditional religions", because it is implied. The evidence supports my contention for Carl Sagan, as I have already quoted him. The evidence about Druyan is more indirect, but, it is still quite clear. "Endorsements" from her are NOT REQUIRED. If I can find a better quote, for her, I will be glad to supply it.-PV</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Please explain how it is "implied" that Druyan endorsed pantheism. I think you are confusing your personal POV with an objective (or <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>) point of view that can be shared by others. You have <b>NOT</b> presented evidence in support of similar claims about Carl Sagan. <a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 22:33, 9 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think you are just confusing your own personal POV with an objective (or NPOV) point of view. I actually have presented very clear and objective evidence of Carl Sagan's <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pantheism.html" title="Pantheism">pantheism</a> by using a direct quote of his that makes it plain as day. Your own biased personal POV is the actual problem, JWSchmidt. -PV</p>
<dl>
<dd>You have never explained how the act of mentioning the idea of pantheism implies that an author is a pantheist. You have repeatedly avoided even acknowledging that there is a distinction between mentioning a religion and adopting a religion. The fact that Sagan <b>discussed</b> the idea of equating god with the cosmos does <b>not</b> IN ANY WAY imply that he adopted pantheism. You have never presented any evidence that Sagan <b>or</b> Druyan endorsed or adopted pantheism. <a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 20:06, 10 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Since you have already just <b>made up your mind</b>, JWSchmidt, I won't bother you with the actual facts and even those you'll just ignore or deny anyway.-PV</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have not read everything written by Druyan. She has also given many public talks. If you have evidence to support the idea that she advocates or ever endorsed pantheism I would be glad to see it. I have been making the point that <i>based on what I have read</i> it is very unlikely that she would ever advocate or endorse pantheism. This does not mean that I would ignore evidence that you can provide. It only means that I am skeptical about the chances that such evidence exists. <a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 23:12, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Go and actually read what she has written and you will find plenty of evidence to support my own contention that she is a <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pantheist.html" title="Pantheist">pantheist</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmotheist.html" title="Cosmotheist">cosmotheist</a>. Be skeptical but also keep an open mind. Otherwise, your bias and bigotry will stop you from ever acknowledging the truth and the facts.-PV</p>
