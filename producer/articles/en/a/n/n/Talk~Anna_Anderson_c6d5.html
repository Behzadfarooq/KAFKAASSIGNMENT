<p>As a person cited on this "Anastasia" page, I object to my article on Franziska Schanzkowska being described as "[an attempt] to reconcile [my] belief that Anna Anderson was Anastasia with the 1994 DNA results." It is, in fact, an effort to demonstrate the impossibility of Anna Anderson and Franziska being the same person, a point on which no one who actually knew AA -- whether they believed she was Anastasia or not -- was in any doubt. It doesn't matter to me whether anyone believes in the Anastasia identity or not -- many do, many don't, and it was always so -- but the Schanzkowska "theory" is and was a pure invention. How they got the DNA to match I have no idea, but it is by no means accepted as final proof by anyone truly familiar with the case. Examples: blood samples of Anna Anderson that were tested at the same time as the hair and intestinal material demonstrated a completely different mtDNA profile than either the hair OR the intestine. It is demonstrated beyond doubt in contemporary records that AA and FS were of different height, different build, different hair color, different eye color, and in no way coincident when it came to bodily marks or, especially, wounds and scars on the body -- AA's body was "covered with scars" and FS's was not -- she was never wounded in the famous factory explosion that was put to forward to account for AA's multiple stab wounds. They can have all the DNA they want -- the Schanzkowska story is pure rubbish. Peter Kurth</p>
<p>Mr. Kurth, do you have any further information about the blood samples? I haven't been able to find anything about it. Chaiyaf 01:10, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with Peter Kurth. He was never 'reconciling' his belief. He was speaking from expirience instead of swallowing what was told to the public. -Caleb G.</p>
<p>One of the most unpleasant aspect of this whole story is the way different people witnessing those events (or maybe allegedly witnessing them) picture AA. To some – mostly the supporters - she knew amazing things that only Anastasia could have known, she behaved like royalty, and she physical resembled her in a number of ways (from ear shape to writing style). Yet according to her detractors, she only knew things that could be picked up from the media, and her memories were often vague, unverifiable, waiting for the convenient witness to step in and confirm the story. Well, both groups cannot be right. True, newspapers need to sell their stories… writers add enough spice and confetti to ensure their books become sensation. That’s why I’m not buying any of those, but I’d be curious enough to see the official transcript of the case in the court, to see what exactly she presented as evidence and what was brought against her. After all, it must have been more than nothing if the court didn’t flatly declare her an impostor, but rather “she had not proven herself to be the Grand Duchess, nor had the identity been disproven”… In the end it doesn’t matter that much… many years have passed and no one who ever saw Anastasia Romanov at least once is still alive. There are only two ways to settle this matter forever: time and/or the discovery of the two famous missing skeletons of Alexei and Anastasia. Given the fact that 28 years have passed since the other members of the royal family have been first located, I don’t see that happening either… -- Allan F, unregistered.</p>

<dd>In terms of the court case, she certainly presented evidence in her favor, I'm sure. But I'm not sure why we should expect that a court would rule that she was an impostor. I suspect, although I do not know, that the supposed "she has not proven herself to be the Grand Duchess, nor has the identity been disproven" verdict is simply a result of the way these things work. It was up to Anderson to prove that she was Anastasia. She failed to do so. It is not the court's job to say that she <i>wasn't</i> Anastasia, merely that she hadn't met the burden of proof to demonstrate that she was. I may be wrong about this, though - I'm sure Mr. Kurth can correct me if I'm wrong, but I really think it's too much to ask a court to declare that a litigant has been demonstrated to be an impostor. I agree with Allan that it <i>is</i> incredibly frustrating how completely divergent the two versions of the case are. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 00:15, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not sure either John, but I thought the case was AA vs Romanovs (rather than AA vs German Government, Russian Government etc). If that was the case, "nor had the identity been disproven" doesn't imply that the Romanovs didn't support their claims either? (inspite of having a historical event on their side - the execution). Maybe somebody with knowledge of law should step in&#160;:) -- Allan F, unregistered.</p>

<dd>It would appear that the case was against the beneficiaries of some relative of Alexandra who died. Since the case was initiated in 1938, I would guess it probably related to the death of the last Grand Duke of Hesse, shortly followed by the death of most of the rest of his family in a plane crash, which happened in 1937, but I'm not sure. Presumably Alexandra's surviving sisters Victoria and Irene, and her nephew Prince Ludwig, would have been the defendants. I think what is really needed is someone with knowledge of the case. But my understanding would be that, it was considered to be already legally established that it was up to Anna Anderson to demonstrate that she was, in fact, Alexandra's daughter, and that she failed to do so. I would imagine, though, that the details of this must be laid out in Peter Kurth's biography of Anderson, which someone could find and use to explicate this. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 07:51, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The ruling that AA's claim had been "neither established nor refuted" far exceeded the original brief of the German courts to determine whether or not the claim was authentic, inasmuch as her opponents in the lawsuit (actually, the defendants, two members of the House of Hesse) had *countersued,* claiming that she was NOT Anastasia and that she in fact was Franziska Schanzkowska. The High Court at Hamburg, in 1967, declared in its verdict, among other things, that "the death of Grand Duchess Anastasia at Ekaterinburg cannot be accepted as a conclusively proven historical fact." The (then) West German Supreme Court at Karlsruhe, three years later, took it further by adding that the case was "non liquet, unsatisfactory to BOTH parties." For what it's worth, the judges at Karlsruhe actually called AA "Anastasia" while reading the verdict. The "transcript" of the case amounts to more than 60 volumes of evidence and testimony. The Hessian defendants, in the end, were Duchess Barbara of Mecklenburg (granddaughter of Alexandra's sister Irene -- whose own father, Prince Sigismund of Prussia, was a staunch AA supporter) and Prince Ludwig, who entered the case as "voluntary co-defendant." Neither of them ever laid eyes on AA. Peter Kurth</p>

<p>Does anyone have information on the child allegedly produced from the marriage of Anderson and Tchaikovsky? The birth is mentioned, but further information on him seems to be missing from the article. Did he survive or die in childhood, as suggested by his lack of presence both in the general knowledge and in the post-death court battles?

<p>More unanswered questions:</p>
<p>If Anna Anderson was Franziska Schanzkowska, then why did friends and family members of Franziska who said that AA was their Franziska always get everything wrong about AA and were caught falsifying evidence.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps that's not actually true? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 00:29, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>And if Anna Anderson were an imposter, then how did she know of that incident where only Lili, Anya, the Empress, and the young Anastasia were present? Are we to believe that Lili Dehn, who was so close to the Empress, was part of a conspiracy to support a fraud? I think it is more likely that there was something wrong with the infected tissue and faded locks of hair.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Or, Lili Dehn <i>unconsciously</i> aided Anderson in "remembering" a story that had happened to Anastasia. This kind of thing happens all the time. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 00:29, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>But it is true. In court, experts determined that Doris Wingender had added on buttons to the pictures.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You said they "always got everything wrong." As to the other, even if people were falsifying things, that completely fails to provide any evidence whatsoever about who Anna Anderson was. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 01:45, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>They did get everything wrong, including height, bodily marks, etc. Please educate yourself on this subject. And the fact that they falsified evidence just supports my view that Anna Anderson wasn't Franziska Schanzkowska.</p>
<p>At least John has the integrity to sign his posts, meaning that he is more confident of the evidence supporting his position than you are of yours. I've also studied the AA/Anatasia claim for many, many years, believing at one time that prehaps she was indeed could ahve been Russian royality, but close investigation even without any DNA to back it up is alone sufficient to prove AA was only a simple old woman with delusions of granduer. Anyone who has had an old world European grandmother recognizes the type immediately...born in dirt, but expecting silver and gold. The DNA is incontravertible. Your reaction against the DNA evidence is the same as those who discounted the DNA evidence against OJ Simpson. The only people with enough interest in AA to falsify evidence are her so-called "supporters" who are living their own fantasies vicariously by perpetuating a lie. Education begins at home, start there sweetie. -- Jango Davis 11:00, 5 Dcember 2006 (UTC) There was never any proof that the samples were from AA ,sweetie. And examine the evidence and then maybe we can have a REAl convo. If you can say Olga and Gilliard were telling the truth then you are ignoring how they changed there opinions only months AFTER they had first acknowledged AA then you are an idiot.</p>
<p>I want to know HOW in the world you can give any credence to the verdict of Olga and Gilliard after they contradicted their earlier statements only much later.</p>

<p>It is diffucult for me to believe Anna Anderson was anyone other than who she claimed to be. She was recognized by those who had been closest the the young Grand Duchess Anastasia (Lili Dehn and Alexandra Tegleva, Anastasia's nanny). No imposter would have known of such private details of the Imperial where only few were present, such as the incident in which only Alexandra, Lili Dehn, Anja, and the young Anastasia were present. The ears and the handwriting were absolutely identical. In 1957, Lili von Dehn who was one of Empress Alexandra's best friend and had been especially close to Anastasia came to meet Anna Anderson in the Black Forest where she was living. What she found was the young girl she had once known, now old and shriveled up. Her statement reads as follows: '...I had a real shock when I first saw her, a poor, pale and wrinkled little face! The first impression was of a terrible sadness, but the moment I heard her voice... it was so familar to me, so real- the voice of the Grand Duchess Anastasia... No one can imitate the voice and the way of talking of a person he has never seen before... We spoke of Anja [Anna Vyrbouva], and she knew many details concerning her and her friendship with the Empress. She spoke of an occasion when the empress was very displeased, even angry with Anja. That was only known to the Empress, Anja, myself, and the little grand duchess who was present, but too young to understand the meaning and only remembered the fact. We spoke of the officers we mutually knew, and she never made a mistake... She did not like or want to speak Russian, but the few words which escaped her were absolutely correct; the family names, real Russian ones, were pronounced in exactly the right way. Her hands reminded me very much of the hands of her mother... What can I say after having known her? I certainly cannot be mistaken in her identity.' This is but one example of many. 'Nearly fifty years ago, Anna Anderson told a story about a sketch she and her sister had put on to amuse their parents during their confinement in Tobolsk. She played a male part, she 'recalled', and and had to borrow a man's dressing-gown. At a pivotal moment in the play, a freak draught made the dressing gown billow up around their thighs, revealing that she was wearing the tsar's long-johns- against the bitter cold of the Siberian winter. The family, said Anna Anderson, had hooted with laughter. The only witnesses from the imperial household who would have been present at that scene, and who are known to have survived, were the two family tutors-both foreigners. One was the English tutor, Sydney Gibbes, and his memoirs were published for the first time in 1975. They include this account of an incident during amatuer theatricals in Tobolsk. "The cast," Gibbes wrote, "had its happiest night with an Edwardian farce by Henry Grattan, called 'Packing Up', ... Anastasia took the male part... at the end of the farce the 'Husband' had to turn his back, open his Dressing-gown as if to take it off- Anastasia used an old one of mine... but a draught got under the gown and whisked its tail up to the middle of her back, showing her sturdy legs and bottom encased Emperor Jaguer's underwear...' So far as exhaustive research can establish, only Anna Anderson had ever before told this vivid ancedote, in private and three decades before the Gibbes memoirs appeared. If Anderson was a phoney, as the seemingly damning DNA evidence now tells us, how did she know the story? That was one of the myriad puzzles that believers in Anna Anderson had to confront when the scientists delivered their verdict. Ian Lilburn, a research historian and the only observer to attend every session of the "Anastasia" appeal process in the German courts, had a calmer response than some. "I think," he said, knowing he sounded like a Luddite and Romanov flat-earther, " there is something we don't know about the DNA." Olga Alexandrovna and Pierre Gilliard are the real reason people doubted the identity of Anna Anderson as Grand Duchess Anastasia. How anyone can trust them after they have been discredited by their own statements I do not know. Olga later said she had always known Anastasia was dead. If that is true why did she write Anna Anderson five loving and passionate letters which promised 'I will never abandon you'. Pierre Gilliard is a proven liar. He constantly touched up photos in his books and even said that Grand Duchess Anastasia had never learned German, despite the fact that it was he who had scheduled her lessons. The Franziska Schanzkowska story is obviously a lie from beginning to end. As if one detective in a matter of weeks would uncover Anna Anderson's identity when the Berlin police had failed to do so for seven years. This myth should have ended when Doris Wingender touched up a photo of Anna Anderson in court, adding to it buttons and belts in order to make her appear to be Schanzkowska. Could there have been a conspiracy to prove Anna Anderson/ Anastasia was a Polish farm girl, Franziska Schanzkowska? I don't know, but evidence prior to DNA suggested that. From what we know of Franziska Schanzkowska, she was not anything like Anna Anderson/ Anastasia. FS- over 5'3 AA- 5'2 FS- size '39 shoe AA- size '36 shoe FS- no pregnancy recorded AA- did have a child FS- not injured in grenade explosion AA- Had many stab wounds and lacerations FS- family spoke mainly German AA- spoke very bad German FS- family could not understand Russian AA- Could understand Russian very well FS- reported missing March 9, 1920 AA- found Feb. 17, 1920- her picture was sent to many hospitals in Berlin but no one recognized her</p>
<p>I don't agree with all of this, but I must admit that I got the impression during my own research that the Royal families had something to cover up. Indeed, they spent so much time trying to defraud Anna Anderson and not a moment with the other numerous claimants.</p>

<p>Hi. Where is this section at?</p>
<p>Oh wait, I found it. "Anderson's DNA sample was also compared with that of Karl Maucher, Franziska Schanzkowska's great nephew, and it was found that there was a match. " I didn't even notice this wasn't mentioned in the DNA section, especially since this is a very crucial point in why people believe/ disbelieve the DNA results. Thanks. I'll try to expand on it later.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It'd be interesting to see the A.A.'s mtDNA sequence, to compare with the published data from Romanovs. The referenced page does not contain any technical info.</p>

<p>Has anyone noticed how out of the numerous claimants, perhaps close to 100, Anna Anderson was the ONLY one they took seriously? Some did believe her, and some who didn't spent thousands of pounds trying to disprove her! Before Olga Alexandrovna went to see her, she told "Shura" to cable her if the young woman in the hospital was Anastasia. And she came. She said, "My heart tells me it is she," and sent her 5 enduring letters and gifts. Pierre Gilliard referred to AA as "the Grand Duchess" when talking to Dr. Rudnev. This was when AA was below 75 lbs. and nearly unrecognizable!</p>
<p>But then months later, both Gilliard AND Olga A. denounced AA as a fraud, saying they had always known the entire family had been killed on the night of July 16, 1918. Ummm... Obviously not or you would not have gone to see the potential survivor. Obviously they found something out in those months which convinced them to say that AA was a fraud. I can think of no other explaination.</p>
<p>Then came the final blow. The "Copenhagen" statement which was actually sent from Darmstadt where Ernst Ludwig, Anastasia's uncle, lived (the same one who denied AA was AN after finding out she said he had been in Russia in 1916. He never even saw her). Not ever 24 hours had passed after the death of the Dowager Empress for them to deliver this statement signed by 12 Romanovs (only 2 who had seen AA) against Anastasia. So even at their beloved Empress's death bed, all they could think about was persecuting Anastasia.</p>
<p>I think people should really consider this before deciding that Anna Anderson was an "absolute fraud" as the family had suggested and continue to today.</p>
<p>To close this I repeat Gleb Botin's words to Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna. "It is easier to understand a crime committed by a bunch of crazed and drunken savages than the calm systematic persecution of one of your own family."</p>

<dd>If you mean the British royal family then you have not mentioned them at all in your piece above, let alone pointed out any lies about them. Your suggestion that there must be substance to Anna Anderson's claim because out of 100 imposters, she was the only one taken seriously by some, is completely worthless - in any group of 100 people there is always going to be one who is better than all the others at any given activity, whether by accident, luck, or design.</dd>

<dd>I wonder if all the fanatical supporters of Anna Anderson have ever given much thought to Anastasia herself, an innocent 17-year-old girl brutally killed with her family in a dank cellar.

<p>Yes, we have. But Anastasia was not killed with her family. Please really examine the evidence. If you can say Olga and Gilliard were telling the truth then you are ignoring how changed there opinions only months AFTER they had first acknowledged AA then you are an idiot.</p>

<dd>I don't care what Olga or Gilliard or indeed anyone else said. The DNA results are conclusive.

<p>The real idiots are those who choose to accept results on a few pieces of hair and a piece of tissue in a hospital since 1979 over the amount of evidence before these tests. This is not good chain of custody. Sorry.</p>

<p>I don't think the article should treat it as an established fact that Anderson and Schanzkowska were the same person. I agree that, most likely, Anderson was Schanzkowska, but DNA tests cannot prove such an identification, and there are many people - including Peter Kurth, who wrote the definitive biography of Anderson - who strongly protest such an identification. The article shouldn't truck with pro-Anderson nonsense, but neither should it state as fact that she was Schanzkowska. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 21:41, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What we need is an article that dosen't claim OR disclaim the Schanzkowska identity as true or false. Let's assume that it was 100% fact that the samples tested were those of AA, it still would not 100% prove her to be Schanzkowska. -C.G.</p>
<dl>
<dd>yes, that's what I was saying. It should note that the current state of the debate appears to be that she was <i>most likely</i> Schanzkowska, but I don't think we should go further than that. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 04:37, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In what way do the DNA tests not constitute <i>proof</i> in the normally accepted definition of the word?

<dd>The DNA tests demonstrate that Anna Anderson's DNA samples were consistent with her being a mitochondrial relation of Karl Maucher. However, Franziska Schanzkowska was not the only mitochondrial relation of Karl Maucher in existence. DNA tests cannot <i>prove</i> someone to be someone, they can only demonstrate likelihood. They can prove that someone is <i>not</i> someone, as they proved that Anna Anderson was not Anastasia. But they can't prove the opposite. As I said, the most likely thing is that she was Schanzkowska, but given that Anderson's most prominent biographer (Kurth) does not believe this, nor do many others who have written about Anderson, it would behoove us to be a bit diplomatic about it, at least. I personally believe that Anderson was probably Schanzkowska, but it's certainly not established nearly as clearly as the fact that she wasn't Anastasia. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 17:12, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Tharkun, I'm not disagreeing that she was very likely Schanzkowska. I'm just saying that we shouldn't aim to offend, and that it's problematic to state as fact things which the most prominent biographer of the subject of this article strongly disagree with. I think Kurth is wrong about who Anderson was, but he is nonetheless the definitive source on Anna Anderson's life, and it seems problematic to state as fact things which a person's principal biographer (only serious biographer?) strongly rejects. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 22:51, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Indeed, how very suspicious, especially after it had been demonstrated during the trials how unlikely it was she was Schanzkowska. But of course, it is not suprising. This is why no one should consider this case solved, especially since the tests were not done on Anna Anderson's body, but on a piece of tissue in a hospital and some hairs allegedly found in a bookstore. This isn't "proof" at all.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Those samples were found by Anna Anderson's supporters, and none of them raised any questions until after the tests came out "wrong". Everything I've read about the hospital sample, in particular, suggests that it should be fairly reliable - that they kept tissue samples from everyone undergoing operations there, and that this was where the Anderson sample came from. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 22:51, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Anderson's supporters weren't the first to ask the hospital for samples to be tested. Before them, investigators were told that there were no samples at the hospital. Only when the Schweitzers asked about the samples were they told that they indeed had some. But before this it could not be found, so god only knows where they had been or if these were indeed the correct samples. And the hairs come from some woman who said she found them in a book at the bottom of a used bookstore. This is not good chain of custody in my opinion.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, it is not your opinion on the chain of custody that is of interest. The people conducting the tests, as well as Anderson's supporters <i>at the time</i>, were confident enough that the stuff was Anderson's. The doubts have only arisen since the results came out. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 04:55, 11 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And if the results had come out the other way, it'd be her detractors pointing out the "chain of custody" issues. That it's the people who feel wronged who are attacking the evidence is certainly opportunistic, but that's the adversarial system in a nutshell. The question is not _who_ raises an idea, but the idea's worth.</dd>

<dd>I don't know that much about the issues here, but assuming for the moment that there is in fact a gap in the documented history of the tissue sample and that the hair was found by a random person in a used bookstore, that strikes me as pretty sketchy. Decent evidence for the court of public opinion, of course, but if I were hearing this case as a judge I would certainly allow serious questioning of the tissue evidence. (Assuming I let it in in the first place. I wouldn't let the hair in, because its <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admissible_evidence.html" title="Admissible evidence">prejudicial effect</a> would outweigh any value it might possess. I mean, seriously, hair in a book? I lived in Charlottesville for awhile, and I bought a used book or two there.

<ul>
<li>Those conducting the tests did not ever state that they were testing the tissue of Mrs. Anderson so you are wrong about that. In fact, Dr. Peter Gill clearly stated "If the tissue being tested belonged to Anna Anderson" and said carefully with each statement "the tissue believed to have come from Anna Anderson" so I think you are wrong here.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was not his job to check the provenance of the tissue - that was done by others. Can you explain how the hair matched as well, even though it came from a different place? And how is it that both samples matched Schanzkowska's family? You find two independent samples, both of which match, that both prove that she was related to the very family that had always been suspected. What do you conclude? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 18:17, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The hair was not 100% determined to be from Schanzkowska. Nor would it be hard to obtain things from someone who was related to Schanzkowska. Rather these were her samples or not, the chain of custody would NOT be acceptable in court. If AA was Schanzkowska as her opponents always said, Doris Wingender would have needed to retouch all her photographs nor would Pierre need to "burn" all of the "documents" which proved AA was FS.</p>
<ul>
<li>Besides, the article is fine as it is. The DNA section leaves it where one could conclude that AA was FS so I don't see what the problem is. -C.G.</li>

<p>DNA is STILL a controversial science. There have been some cases of tests done in the late 80's/ early 90's where "criminals" were thrown in jail over what DNA said, but were only recently released because now DNA says something else! So what makes people so sure they have it 100% perfected even now?!</p>

</dl>
<ul>
<li>Of course I would not. Because it would be supporting what the evidence before this had concluded. But whether I would "say this" or that is beyond the point. The fact is that early DNA tests have been proven to possibly be faulty.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>And the facts are, plain and simple, that the tissue sat on the shelf for a year after being relocated in 1993, during a long and complicated court battle. No special protection was placed on it. That is NOT good chain of custody. I'm not saying that it WAS NOT her tissue once pieces of it were taken by Dr. Gill, but the chain of custody is still not good enough for it to be definitive.</li>

<p>DNA or not, "Anna Anderson" WAS cremated. The Tsar is meant to be a symbol of the church and its protector. The Tsar's family is meant to epitomize Christian Orthodox values, beliefs and faith. Cremation is totally unacceptable in Orthodoxy. Orthodox Christian funerals are denied to those cremated. Panikida are not said for those cremated. Any true Anastasia would not have forgotten this I would venture. What were Anna Anderson's thoughts about Orthodoxy, its relevance to her life, its practice? Why would she, had she been Orthodox, been willing to put her soul in jeopardy by cremation? It makes no sense. Although Evgenia Smetisko (Eugenia Smith) is thought by many to be an imposter, she DID ask to buried in Orthodox fashion in a monastery cemetery. Culturally that seems more appropriate.</p>
<p>ummm, while the orthodox church discourages cremation, they don't believe your "soul is in jeopardy" if you are cremated. there are cases where bodies have to be cremated to prevent the spread of disease in russia, and the priests still perform all the funeral rights. fact is that she may not even have willingly selected to be cremated. sometimes family members do this because of cost or the fact they cant bear to see their loved ones body. i have seen many funerals in the orthodox church were family members have gone against the wishes of the church and had the body cremated, especially cases where the death was someone who was a convert to orthodoxy. and in some places cremation is mandatory because of lack of places to bury bodies, and civil laws that don't permit certain transportation of bodies.</p>
<p>from the oca website:</p>
<p>According to Byzantine Canon Law, cremation is not permitted. Sources state that the original ban arose out of consideration for the fact that within pagan and possibly gnostic circles creation was commonly practiced. There was also the implication that through cremation the value of physical creation, and specifically the human body, was denied. [The Church has always stood squarely against dualism.]</p>
<p>Of course, we read in the accounts of the early martyrs that the faithful treated the martyrs' bodies with the utmost respect as they were taken for burial -- an early indication that the common Roman pagan practice was shunned by Christians.</p>
<p>Today there are those who would propose that the practice of cremation be explored anew, in light of the fact that the practice's association with paganism or gnosticism is no longer a reality. Proponents of this line of thinking may also assert that cremation is a less expensive way to dispose of the body than the increasingly expensive -- and often non-Christian -- burial practices common in many cultures and societies, such as in the United States. However, the vast majority of Orthodox would contend that cremation for whatever reason, and regardless of its detachment from pagan thought or ritual, in every instance denies the value of the human body and of material creation in general. Hence, it is to be avoided as an option.</p>
<p>I have heard of a few cases in recent times where, in extreme cases and for good cause, cremation has taken place with the knowledge of the Church. In each case, however, I have heard that the actual cremation did not occur until after the funeral service at which the body of the deceased has been present. This does not represent standard practice, however, and in each instance there were extenuating circumstances which led the Church to apply the principle of economia.</p>
<p>I think we should point out that the Russian Church in Exile would have been the one that any living Anastasia would have favored, as it was free from Soviet/KGB/Patriarchate compromises to the faith and practice. Here a priest would give a more appropriate answer about cremation than I, but, even as a traditional Lutheran (as was Anastasia's mother originally) I was raised with the teaching that Cremation was wrong and problematic for one's soul. Church in Exile priests I have spoken to are adamant about the unacceptability of cremation on theological grounds. The body should go naturally back to "dust" as it will be Resurrected (curiously the meaning of ANASTASIA, as in CHRISTOS ANESTI!")at Christ's return.</p>
<pre>
Anna Anderson would have had no reason for "economia" and her desire for cremation connotes a lack of sensitivity to Orthodox teaching. That would be very unlikely for the true daughter of the Tsar, who was the protector of the Faith. Whatever her place in this mystery, Evgenia Smetisko, another claimant, desired to be buried in traditional Orthodox fashion in an Orthodox cemetery connected with an Orthodox parish in exile.
