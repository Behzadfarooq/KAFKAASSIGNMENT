<p>Michael [Kazura] was the son of a Pennsylvania mine worker and became an activist in the 1960s, ending up in Ann Arbor MI, home of the SDS and the Weather Underground. He subsequently became involved in union politics, notably in the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Workers_of_the_World_366b.html" title="Industrial Workers of the World">Industrial Workers of the World</a> [IWW or wobblies] and later helped organize the graduate student assistants at the University of Michigan, eventually leading them out on strike. He was killed in a car crash in the early 1990s. During our visit to Chicago for the 100th anniversary of the Haymarket Event Michael took me to the statueless pedestal and informed me that he knew what had happened to it, but that he would never tell. The picture and the enigmatic caption are a sort of tribute to Michael. Does that belong in an encyclopedia? You be the judge. If you think not, then remove it. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarptrash_5c7f.html" title="User:Carptrash">Carptrash</a> 21:46, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've changed the caption beneath the Michael K picture to insert the appellation "Activist". It now reads&#160;: <i>"Activist Michael K at the statueless pedestal of the Policemen Monument, Chicago IL. MK took to his too early grave whatever he knew about the 1969 and 1970 bombings"</i>. I think this adequately describes MK's reason to be in the article. He sounds like an interesting chap. I like your story that he 'would never tell' what he knew about the bombings. <a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnaAniston_846a.html" title="User:AnnaAniston">An An</a> 23:20, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the touch-up on the Michael K angle. He was an interesting fellow for sure, as well as a major pain in the ass. He was born without a compromise or accommodation gear in his personal transmission. He also had no reverse, so he was always pushing forward. Usually a good thing, but . . . . . . ... His most compassionate side was the one he had for his mother, who still lived in Minersville PA [if i remember correctly]. He would fequently drive back to see her and on one of his trip a woman driving the other way on the expressway had an attack of some sort, crossed over the divide and met Michael head on, full speed, just like he had lived his life. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarptrash_5c7f.html" title="User:Carptrash">Carptrash</a> 03:14, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, <a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnaAniston_846a.html" title="User:AnnaAniston">An An</a>. I just realised that I <b>didn't</b> change the <a href="../../../n/i/h/Nihilism.html" title="Nihilism">nihilism</a> page, but the <a href="../../../n/i/h/Nihilist_movement.html" title="Nihilist movement">nihilist movement</a> one. Could you have a look at it and see if everything's fine? I need some feedback. Maybe you'll get interested, as it was a precursor of Nabatism. <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr.Rocks_fc30.html" title="User:Mr.Rocks">Mr.Rocks</a> 02:28, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Have a look at <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narodnaya_Volya_6d45.html" title="Narodnaya Volya">Narodnaya Volya</a>. They seem to have had their major influence on <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukraine.html" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>. Also, I reckon they don't mention this much on Wikipedia pages, but the biggest job of those Nihilist-led movements was to distribute banned literature (the <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circle_of_Tchaikovsky_6ddd.html" title="Circle of Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky circles</a>). There is a missing link to Society of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaikovtsi.html" title="Chaikovtsi">Chaikovtsi</a> in <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophia_Perovskaya_9595.html" title="Sophia Perovskaya">Sophia Perovskaya</a>'s page. I think they've misspelled it, and I think we should create this page. Kropotkin was active on one of those circles, and he describes it very extensively and positively. Much earlier, even Bakunin seems to have been part of the book smuggling effort as well, before leaving Russia. This was a major thing, and we should refer to that, 'cause it's an important part of the picture. A guy from the portuguese Wikipedia is writing lots of stuff about those XIX century russian movements, and he suggested me a book we have at Jura. <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr.Rocks_fc30.html" title="User:Mr.Rocks">Mr.Rocks</a> 05:07, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<a href="../../../c/i/r/Circle_of_Tchaikovsky_6ddd.html" title="Circle of Tchaikovsky">Circle of Tchaikovsky</a> is up!!! Don't forget to check all those types mentioned there, especially <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophia_Perovskaya_9595.html" title="Sophia Perovskaya">Sophia Perovskaya</a>. Except for Nechayev, they were all Kropotkin's buddies. <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr.Rocks_fc30.html" title="User:Mr.Rocks">Mr.Rocks</a> 12:18, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Can't add much to the People's Revenge, as I still have to discover how the <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circle_of_Tchaikovsky_6ddd.html" title="Circle of Tchaikovsky">Circle of Tchaikovsky</a> ended and/or how its former members spread out to form other more radical organisations like <a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_and_Liberty_64ac.html" title="Land and Liberty">Land and Liberty</a>.

I'm curious as to why you nominated so many good articles to be deleted. Your copy and paste description "<i>They are not encyclopedic outside the Symbionese Liberation Army, and can be adequately merged into the Symbionese Liberation Army page</i>" doesn't really make much sense. My dictionary defines <i>encyclopedic</i> as <i>comprehensive in terms of information</i>, which many of these articles certainly are. If what you actually meant by "not encyclopedic" was "not worthy of inclusion in this encyclopedia", I've got to ask, <i>why</i>? We're trying to build an encyclopedic encyclopedia here. There has been clear consensus that Wikipedia should keep articles on far less "notable" people than these. See <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. But unfortunately, even though these people all clearly meet the criteria, because you nominated most of them seperately there is a chance you might succeed in getting one or two of them deleted (though most will certainly be kept). And I wonder, <i>how do you think that will improve wikipedia?</i> <tt><b>~</b><a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeif_7e14.html" title="User:Leif">leif</a></tt> ☺ <sub>(<a href="../../../l/e/i/User_talk%7ELeif_77cb.html" title="User talk:Leif">talk</a>)</sub> 21:17, May 27, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for your well thought out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Leif&amp;oldid=14720271" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Leif&amp;oldid=14720271" rel="nofollow">reply</a>! While I am throughly convinced that you're acting in good faith, I still <i>strongly</i> disagree with your premise that wikipedia is better served by having this type of article consolidated into a larger main article. Aside from the standard arguments of <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" class="extiw" title="m:Wiki_is_not_paper">m:Wiki is not paper</a> etc, it is especially useful to keep separate articles about <i>people</i> for the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metadata.html" title="Metadata">metadata</a> I mentioned earlier (most often, the birth/death categories, but also all of the other person-specific categories that are often applied to articles about people). In the future, better browsers will make much more use of type of information... but if there aren't separate articles about a given person, then that person <i>can't have that metadata applied to them</i>. I think that losing this kind of useful semantic metadata hurts wikipedia significantly, and despite your lengthy reply, I still don't understand <i>why</i> you think wikipedia is "better served" by consolidating. Your comment that "<i>The vfd process puts the value of these pages on the collective agenda, it inspires authors/editors to improve them or to cull that which is less than useful.</i>" is particularly disturbing — there is <a href="../../../c/l/e/Wikipedia%7ECleanup_89e0.html" title="Wikipedia:Cleanup">Wikipedia:Cleanup</a> and other tools for drawing attention to pages, and most of the subjects in wikipedia could be called "less than useful" by some peoples' standards of usefulness. I'd say that these articles are <b>all useful</b> to the person who types one of the subjects' name into the wikipedia search field and finds the article, I don't think any of them met <i>any</i> of the VfD criteria described at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>. It does look like all of the articles are going to be kept, and only one of them due to lack of consensus... I do hope that this will encourage you not to nominate more high-quality articles for deletion in the future. <tt><b>~</b><a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeif_7e14.html" title="User:Leif">leif</a></tt> ☺ <sub>(<a href="../../../l/e/i/User_talk%7ELeif_77cb.html" title="User talk:Leif">talk</a>)</sub> 02:16, Jun 5, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have been closing out a number of the VfD nominations you made about members of the SLA. I agree with your original statement that these people are not significant except for their involvement in the SLA and think that we do our readers the best service by discussing the subjects in their proper context. When you run into this situation next time, may I suggest that you <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">be bold</a> and redirect the articles. Redirects do not have to be decided through VfD and are often far less controversial.

<dd>And now I see that you've had this same conversation with others above. As leif's comments make clear, merging can be controversial too. But those are discussions that get held on the article talk pages and not VfD. For that reason alone, they tend to be more civil.

<p>Not that I want to nitpick over terms, but you changed "mother" to "woman" in one place, and left it unchanged in other places. I personally hold to the opinion that a pregnant woman is a "mother", and that this status is not at all inconsistent with her having the right to terminate the pregnancy. Either way, I'd like the article to use consistent terminology. Cheers. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_a828.html" title="User:BD2412"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_4cc0.html" title="User talk:BD2412"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 00:11, 2005 Jun 23 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, this could make for an interesting discussion... people have roles that they assume, either volitionally or by their actions. You, for example, are a woman, but also a law student - a role you went to some lengths to acquire (taking the <a href="../../../l/s/a/LSAT_b063.html" title="LSAT">LSAT</a>, applying to <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_school.html" title="Law school">law school</a>, etc.). A woman who becomes pregnant <i>usually</i> does so through some intentional, volitional act (though the consequence may be unintended). Since most women who become pregnant do not terminate their pregnancies, they necessarily assume certain duties (e.g., don't drink or smoke or play contact sports) for the benefit of the child which they anticipate having. I opine that the assumption of these duties (or at any rate the decision to go ahead with the pregnancy) are enough to justify the label of motherhood, and that those duties should attach during any period of indecision with respect to the pregnancy. Of course, this somewhat contradicts what I've just said about you being a law student, as you were not one during your preparations for assuming that role, but at least I would not have been amiss to label you as an intended future law student. Also, there was no guarantee that you would be a law student until you received an offer of admission, while there is a fairly high probability that a pregnant woman who chooses to bear a child will, in fact, bear a child. Just my thoughts on it, but thank you for contributing to the article - it's an important topic.

<p>I'd like your advice, since you're a regular contributor to <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">rape</a>, and I trust your judgment. I was just writing an article where I used the term <b>rape culture</b>. I wanted to wikilink it, so that readers could get a good explanation of the term and the concept behind it. Thing is, there's no article for it, and on <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">rape</a>, I couldn't find it mentioned, either. I went ahead and made a red link to <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape_culture.html" title="Rape culture">rape culture</a>, figuring I can put an article together for it tonight or tomorrow or some other time very soon. But then I got to thinking, maybe it would be better to put rape culture in as a section in the rape article. What do you think? Should rape culture go as a section in rape, or should it get its own article? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 06:51, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm sorry you're finding me hard to deal with. You're probably used to scaring people with your aggression and tone and don't like being challenged on what you consider to be <i>your</i> territory. Still, I've done nothing but ask you to consider the policies of Wikipedia in your editing and to source your edits rather than fill the article with your own personal opinions. You might find that objectionable in itself but I've been polite enough in doing so.</p>
<p>I haven't said you're not important. I've said that Wikipedia ought not to include the opinions of <i>any</i> of its editors. You are reading that as a personal attack for whatever reason. I am not "trying to shoot you down". I've taken account of what you said -- I even removed a sentence you felt was objectionable -- and I'm perfectly happy with what we have now. Clearly, you're not, but if you want to claim that the manifesto is "satirical", I don't think it's unreasonable that you cite someone saying so, rather than insist the article should say so because <i>you</i> think it's plain that it is. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Arthur_6320.html" title="User:Philip Arthur">Philip Arthur</a> 05:18, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK, I understand, that is a possibility. I am just trying to find a section where I acn place it. I suppose I can just copy and paste ?.</p>
