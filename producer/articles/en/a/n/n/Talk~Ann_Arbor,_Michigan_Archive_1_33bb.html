<h2><span class="mw-headline">Too much on U-M???</span></h2>
<p>I am in the process of expanding this article. However, is there a way of doing so without always having to mention the Univesity of Michigan? Thanks. <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPentawing_8905.html" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a> 02:40, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The only place I think there is gratuitous mention is in the culture section. There are plenty of cultural events not tied to the Uni, so that could be redone to discuss that the city has many cultural events, art fairs, etc, and that the University has many or a good portion of them too. Where else were you thinking it was too much? The places where the university has a significant impact, such as the economy, that should be noted as it is, in order to be comprehenisve and correct. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 13:59, August 17, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I tried rewording a bit, but from my own perspective the University does dominate the cultural scene in Ann Arbor. Hence, I am going to need some help in this area. The other sections aren't too much of a problem though. <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPentawing_8905.html" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a> 01:39, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, the city <i>is</i> influenced a lot by UoM, so it's just natural that the feeling of UoM all over the article I guess - and i don't see anything wrong with that. But I do agree with Pentawing, if there's a better way to put things it would be great. For a change, what about the picture of the house with big M? That could have been replaced with a more 'neutral' one, because that's a special case than what you normally find, and gives the already-UoM-smelling article an additional bias imho&#160;:-) <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenleaf_48a6.html" title="User:Greenleaf">Greenleaf</a> 02:44, 23 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>That's a good point. It would make a good UM picture, but it contributes to the overdoing it in this article. Aren't there some other prominent houses? Maybe a picture from Huron River drive at the neighborhood to the North? - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 22:36, August 24, 2005 (UTC)

    a- held by the State Street Merchants Association, don't know official name
    b- held by the Michigan Guild, don't know official name
    c- held by the South University Street Merchants Association, name unkown
    d- the original fair that started it all, no names, but its held on Thayer and North University area, by the clock tower
    e- official name 'Kings Chosen'

<p>I also added the text "many other artists and retail booths anywhere they can rent some space."</p>
<p>Well, writing this art fair starts in 3 days, so I may get my facts straight during that time.</p>
<p>2- added the Ann Arbor Shopping Cart Race, will work on getting more details.</p>

<p>Hey, so about the shopping cart race, if you want to do that right you need to put that down as Punk Week. (I'm going to get killed for doing this.) That whole week consists of Punk shows, and the whole punk community from the surrounding USA comes out (we're talking drifters from as far as Cali).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Additions and "History" subheadings</span></h2>
<p>Hey everyone. This article is looking pretty nice. The "History" section is getting long enough that it would be a good idea to have sub-headings. Anyone want to take a stab at that? Maybe some of the stuff briefly listed under "History" also deserves separate, longer articles; for example: 1.) the Ann Arbor greenbelt could be a good article of its own, including past (failed) attempts to enact one, the intense debate leading up to the referendum, related debates on downtown density, etc. 2.) the "Free John Sinclair" 1971 concert/rally could perhaps get its own article, too. <a href="../../../r/o/p/User%7ERopcat_d539.html" title="User:Ropcat">Ropcat</a> 05:31, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Lake effect snow?</span></h2>
<p>I think the last edit mentioning heavy snow and lake effect is wrong. <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_effect.html" title="Lake effect">Lake effect</a> is mostly on land masses that are to the east of bodies of water so the prevailing easterly winds bring the snow to them. This happens all along the west side of Michigan and Cleveland, Buffalo for ex, but not Ann Arbor, Detroit, etc. Ann Arbor gets much less snow than the west side of the state or even Lansing typically. I don't have a source for that at hand, but I wonder where the info in the article came from. I didn't want to revert though. Sorry to be a spectator, but you're doing a great job overall. I also think the history section is too long for an overview article of a city, especially if your goal is to be a FA. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 03:47, August 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I found that information at the following: <a href="http://www.michiganvacations.com/regions/Ann-Arbor-Michigan.html" class="external text" title="http://www.michiganvacations.com/regions/Ann-Arbor-Michigan.html" rel="nofollow">www.michiganvacations.com/regions/Ann-Arbor-Michigan.html</a>. Now that you mention it, I'm not sure about it, but you could check on the website and note your opinion on it. Otherwise, I will remove the lake effect notation. <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPentawing_8905.html" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a> 04:27, 18 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ok, reading that fits more into what I was thinking and the impression I got from the lake effect article. AA gets some of the lake effect to increase the cloudiness and gets more lake effect snow than say Minneapolis MN, but saying it gets a lot of snow because of it is overdoing it. Better than saying a lot anyway is finding a number for average snowfall, and some comparison of that to other areas. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 04:37, August 18, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Should I then include the information or leave the climate information as is at the moment? Thanks. <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPentawing_8905.html" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a> 04:44, 18 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I tweaked it a bit just so it didn't say heavy snowfall. For areas that get snow, 1-10 inches a month is certainly not heavy. It sounds reasonable that AA does have some climate effect from lake effect, so mentioning it in the way that source did, that it increases cloudiness should be done. I presume that increases the precipitation to more than what would occur without the lake effect, but the source didn't appear to say that from what I recall. If you have another available that would help. So something should go in about lake effect, maybe that it exists, but is less than the west side of the state, but I couldn't think of how to say it. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 14:45, August 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I added some information about topography by looking at a map from topozone.com. However, I need someone to look over my numbers to ensure that they are indeed correct.

<p>What does this mean? "<i>The painting of Ann Arbor fire hydrants is decentralized.</i>" Is it meaning to say that there's no one, central authority in charge of painting them? <a href="../../../r/o/p/User%7ERopcat_d539.html" title="User:Ropcat">Ropcat</a> 21:44, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I am under that impression, though you may want to ask <a href="../../../t/l/o/User%7ETlogmer_ea3e.html" title="User:Tlogmer">Tlogmer</a> about it, since he had unloaded that image. <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPentawing_8905.html" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a> 21:51, September 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I was attempting to be tongue-in-cheeck; more usefully, the downtown fire hydrants were all painted in art-style (whatever you want to call it) during the past couple years by U-M and public school students as part of a project called <a href="http://www.arts.umich.edu/programs/special/firehydrant/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.arts.umich.edu/programs/special/firehydrant/index.html" rel="nofollow">Fire Up Downtown</a> (I wonder if they'll let us use their pictures).

<p>For the restaurant notation, it could probably be best to place it into the culture section, though I am also seeing some legitimate reasons to place it in the economy section. <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPentawing_8905.html" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a> 22:41, September 8, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Either way, it relates to the other, so I agree with the culture I think. That's part of what people think of when they think of Ann Arbor's culture is the Main street and other restaurants. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 22:44, September 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">State capital</span></h2>
<p>Should we be using "state <i>capital</i>" or "state <i>capitol</i>" in the history section? On the one hand, Ann Arbor was vying to become the capital (city), but on the other hand, the sentence in question is referring specifically to land set aside for the construction of a capitol (building). <a href="../../../r/o/p/User%7ERopcat_d539.html" title="User:Ropcat">Ropcat</a> 01:46, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I changed the notation to "capitol" since the wording implies a building rather than the entire city. <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPentawing_8905.html" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a> 20:58, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
