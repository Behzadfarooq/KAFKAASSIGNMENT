<p>In 1954, the Wades, an African American family who knew the Bradens through association, approached them with a proposal that would drastically alter all lives involved. Like so many other Americans after <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Andrew Wade wanted to buy a house in a suburban neighborhood. Because of <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Crow_7557.html" title="Jim Crow">Jim Crow</a> housing practices, the Wades had been unsuccessful for months in their quest to purchase a home on their own. The Bradens, who never wavered in their support for African American civil rights<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, agreed to purchase the home for the Wades, and, on May 15, 1954, Andrew Wade and his wife Charlotte spent their first night in their new home. Upon discovering that blacks had moved in, white neighbors burned a cross in front of the house, shot out windows, and condemned the Bradens for buying it on the Wades’ behalf. Their fears may have been stoked, in part, by the timing of the move, which came only two days before the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark condemnation of school segregation in <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brown_v._Board_of_Education_9aee.html" title="Brown v. Board of Education">Brown v. Board of Education</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/p/Topeka%2C_KS_6bd6.html" title="Topeka, KS">Topeka, KS</a>. Six weeks later, amid constant community tensions, the Wades’ new house was dynamited one evening while they were out.</p>
<p>What began as an act of housing desegregation turned into a local variation of the anticommunist hysteria known nationwide as <a href="../../../m/c/c/McCarthyism_56ee.html" title="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a><sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. The investigation turned from segregationist violence to the alleged <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_76ce.html" title="Communist Party">Communist Party</a> affiliations of those who had supported the Wades in their housing quest. In October 1954, Anne and Carl Braden and five other whites were charged with <a href="../../../s/e/d/Sedition.html" title="Sedition">sedition</a>. After a sensationalized<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> trial, Carl Braden—the perceived ringleader<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>—was convicted of sedition and sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment. As Anne and the other defendants awaited a similar fate, Carl served eight months, but out on $40,000 bond when a U.S. Supreme Court decision invalidated state sedition laws because of their capricious<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> use.

In the years before southern civil rights violations made national news, the Bradens developed their own media, both through SCEF’s monthly newspaper, The Southern Patriot, and through numerous pamphlets and press releases publicizing major civil rights campaigns. In 1958 Anne wrote The Wall Between, a memoir of their sedition case. One of the few books of its time to unpack the psychology of white southern racism from within, it was praised by human rights leaders such as <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_King%2C_Junior_da4e.html" title="Martin Luther King, Junior">Martin Luther King, Junior</a>, and became a runner-up for the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Book_Award_03c8.html" title="National Book Award">National Book Award</a>. Although their radical politics marginalized them among many of their own generation, the Bradens were reclaimed by young student activists of the 1960s. They were among the civil rights movement’s most dedicated white allies<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Bradens also had three children: James, born in 1951, a 1972 <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhodes_Scholar_b495.html" title="Rhodes Scholar">Rhodes Scholar</a>, and a 1980 graduate of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_Law_School_e417.html" title="Harvard Law School">Harvard Law School</a>, has lived and practiced law for over 25 years in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco%2C_California_b6e2.html" title="San Francisco, California">San Francisco, California</a>.

<p>After Carl’s death in 1975, Anne Braden remained among the nation’s most outspoken white anti-racist activists<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. She instigated the formation of a new regional multi-racial organization, the Southern Organizing Committee for Economic and Social Justice (SOC), which initiated battles against <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environmental_racism.html" title="Environmental racism">environmental racism</a>.

Over her nearly six decades of activism, her life touched almost every modern U.S. social movement<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, and her message to them all was the centrality of racism and the responsibility of whites to combat it.</p>
