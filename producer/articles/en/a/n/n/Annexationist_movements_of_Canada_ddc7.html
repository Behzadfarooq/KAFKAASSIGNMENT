No serious force has appeared on the American political scene that aimed to persuade or coerce Canadians into joining the United States.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Annexationist_movements_of_Canada_ddc7.html" title="Edit section: 1837">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1837</span></h3>
<p>Historical annexationist movements inside Canada were usually inspired by dissatisfaction with Britain's colonial governance of Canada. Groups of Irish immigrants took the route of armed struggle, attempting to annex the peninsula between the <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_River_d34e.html" title="Detroit River">Detroit</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/a/Niagara_River_e7e9.html" title="Niagara River">Niagara Rivers</a> to the U.S. by force in the minor and short-lived <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriot_War_946e.html" title="Patriot War">Patriot War</a> in 1837-1838.</p>
<p>It is significant, however, that although the <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebellions_of_1837.html" title="Rebellions of 1837">Rebellions of 1837</a> were motivated in part by this type of dissatisfaction, Canadian resentment of British rule never reached the degree that led to the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Revolution_bd44.html" title="American Revolution">American Revolution</a> in 1775. In the period from 1790 to 1837, imperial officials repeatedly denounced American-style republicanism and tried to suppress it. The <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebellions_of_1837.html" title="Rebellions of 1837">Rebellions of 1837</a> themselves however were not fought with the goal of annexation, they were small scale attempts launched by militant reformers in present day <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario.html" title="Ontario">Ontario</a> and <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec.html" title="Quebec">Quebec</a> at political independence from Britain and <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal.html" title="Liberal">liberal</a> social reforms as opposed to the repressive British colonial system.</p>
<p>Between 1848 and 1854, a significant and articulate minority of conservatives in <a href="../../../u/p/p/Upper_Canada_49b4.html" title="Upper Canada">Upper Canada</a> advocated constitutional changes modeled on the American federal-state system and the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_the_United_States_01a7.html" title="Constitution of the United States">US Constitution</a>. They critiqued Canada's imitation of <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_System_853e.html" title="Westminster System">British parliamentary government</a> as both too democratic and too tyrannical. It destroyed the independence of the appointed governor and Legislative Council and further concentrated power in the Cabinet. This critique led many conservatives to argue that the American model of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Checks_and_balances.html" title="Checks and balances">checks and balances</a> offered Canada a more balanced and conservative form of democracy than did British parliamentary government. These "republican conservatives" debated a series of constitutional changes, including annexation to the United States, an elected governor, an elected Legislative Council, a federal union of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_North_America_0dc2.html" title="British North America">British North America</a>, and imperial <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federation.html" title="Federation">federation</a>, within this framework. These conservatives had accepted "government by discussion" as the appropriate basis for political order. A historiographical tradition that stresses the existence of a conservative, pro-British, and anti-American political culture in Upper Canada cannot do justice to the extent, thoughtfulness, and discerning nature of political debate in this period.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/n/n/Annexationist_movements_of_Canada_ddc7.html" title="Edit section: 1850s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1850s</span></h3>
<p>Around 1850 there was a serious annexationist movement on the border region of Quebec's <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Townships_7b6d.html" title="Eastern Townships">Eastern Townships</a>, where the American-descended majority felt that union with the United States would end their economic isolation and stagnation as well as remove them from the growing threat of <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Canadian_decb.html" title="French Canadian">French Canadian</a> political domination. Leading proponents of this genuinely bipartisan movement were careful not to appear disloyal to Britain, however, and they actively discouraged popular protest at the local level. Fearful of American-style democracy, the local elite also expressed revulsion toward American <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slavery</a> and militaristic expansionism. Consequently, the movement died as quickly in the Eastern Townships as it did in Montreal after Britain expressed its official disapproval and trade with the United States began to increase. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In Montreal at midcentury, with little immigration and complaints that the repeal of the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corn_Laws_d726.html" title="Corn Laws">Corn Laws</a> had cut the region off from its British trade links, a small but organized group supported integrating the colonies into the United States. The leading organization advocating merger was the Annexation Association, founded in 1849 by an alliance of <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Canadian_decb.html" title="French Canadian">French Canadian</a> nationalists and Anglophone businessmen in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal.html" title="Montreal">Montreal</a> who had a common interest in the republic. Many of its members, including <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis-Joseph_Papineau_ff79.html" title="Louis-Joseph Papineau">Louis-Joseph Papineau</a>, were participants in the 1837-38 rebellions.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal_Annexation_Manifesto_cb92.html" title="Montreal Annexation Manifesto">Montreal Annexation Manifesto</a> was published in 1849. It was hoped a merger with the United States would give Canada markets for its goods, ensure national security, and provide the finances to develop the west. A half measure was the in 1854 <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian-American_Reciprocity_Treaty_1237.html" title="Canadian-American Reciprocity Treaty">Canadian-American Reciprocity Treaty</a> that linked the two areas economically.</p>
<p>However, the movement died out in 1854. Annexation was never a very popular choice. Many Canadians were loyal to the Crown and Great Britain, especially the descendants of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Empire_Loyalists_b44c.html" title="United Empire Loyalists">United Empire Loyalists</a>. French Canadians worried about being an even smaller minority in a larger union, and were concerned about American anti-Catholicism. The <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, further, convinced many Canadians that the American experiment was a failure.</p>

<p>In the late 1860s, residents of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_90ec.html" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a> (which was not yet a Canadian province) responded to American purchase of <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska.html" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> with a sense of being hemmed in. Many residents wanted this frontier region to be the next American purchase. Local opinion was greatly divided as the three <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver_Island_06d5.html" title="Vancouver Island">Vancouver Island</a> newspapers supported annexation to the United States, while the three mainland newspapers rejected the idea. Even opponents of the annexation scheme admitted that Great Britain had neglected the region and that grievances were justified. Nonetheless, annexation sentiment disappeared within a few months and prominent leaders moved toward confederation with Canada. [Neunherz] Petitions circulated in favour of American annexation. The first, in 1867, was addressed to <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom_5e8e.html" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a>, demanding that the British government assume the colony's debts and establish a steamer link, or allow the colony to join the U.S. In 1869, a second petition was addressed to <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President</a> <a href="../../../u/l/y/Ulysses_S._Grant_1b52.html" title="Ulysses S. Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>, asking him to negotiate American annexation of the territory from Britain. It was delivered to Grant by Vincent Collyer, Indian Commissioner for <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska.html" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>, on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_29.html" title="December 29">December 29</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1869.html" title="1869">1869</a>. Both petitions were signed by only a small fraction of the colony's population, and British Columbia was ultimately admitted as a Canadian province in 1871.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, most Canadians were strongly opposed to the prospect of American annexation. Reports of the <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annexation_Bill_of_1866_be94.html" title="Annexation Bill of 1866">Annexation Bill of 1866</a> (a bill that contrary to myth never came to a vote) might have been one of the many factors behind <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Confederation_dbec.html" title="Canadian Confederation">Canadian Confederation</a> in 1867. Much more serious were the <a href="../../../f/e/n/Fenian_raids.html" title="Fenian raids">Fenian raids</a> made by <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Americans_3518.html" title="Irish Americans">Irish Americans</a> across the border in 1866. This caused fear in Canadian hearts and when they were repulsed caused a wave of patriotic feeling that helped the confederate cause. <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>Modern groups, which generally have a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoconservative.html" title="Neoconservative">neoconservative</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism.html" title="Libertarianism">libertarian</a> political stance, are usually organizations that do not enjoy much public support or awareness.

<p>The <b><a href="../../../u/n/i/Unionest_Party_3fbf.html" title="Unionest Party">Unionest Party</a></b> (<i>sic</i>) was a provincial political party in <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan.html" title="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a> in 1980 that promoted the union of the western provinces with the United States. It was the most politically successful annexationist group, but its success was both short-lived and extremely limited in scope.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../p/a/r/Parti_51.html" title="Parti 51">Parti 51</a></b> was a short-lived political party in <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec.html" title="Quebec">Quebec</a> in the 1980s that advocated Quebec's admission to the United States as the <a href="../../../5/1/s/51st_state.html" title="51st state">51st state</a>.</p>
<p>The <b><a href="../../../a/n/n/Annexation_Party_of_British_Columbia_fa5d.html" title="Annexation Party of British Columbia">Annexation Party of British Columbia</a></b> was founded by R.

<p>In modern Canadian political discourse, the idea of Canada becoming the "<a href="../../../5/1/s/51st_state.html" title="51st state">51st state</a>" of the United States is much more often used as a scare tactic <i>against</i> political courses of action that may be seen as too "Americanizing". The use of this type of rhetoric may occur even if the proponents of such a course of action have <i>not</i> endorsed or proposed annexation.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1911.html" title="Canadian federal election, 1911">1911 federal election</a>, the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_of_Canada_%28historic%29_e5a6.html" title="Conservative Party of Canada (historic)">Conservative</a> response to the proposed reciprocity treaty negotiated by the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Canada_1b0c.html" title="Liberal Party of Canada">Liberals</a> was to denounce it as equivalent to an American economic takeover, with annexation likely to follow. The rhetoric carried the Conservatives to victory. (Ironically, in the later <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1988.html" title="Canadian federal election, 1988">1988 federal election</a>, the Liberals used the same type of rhetoric to denounce the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Canada_d0d3.html" title="Progressive Conservative Party of Canada">Progressive Conservatives</a>' proposed <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada-United_States_Free_Trade_Agreement_a7a3.html" title="Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement">Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement</a>, although the Progressive Conservatives won that election and the agreement was implemented.)</p>

<li>Annexation fears can be found throughout <i>Canadian History for Dummies</i> (2nd ed 2005) when humorist <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_Ferguson_2bbb.html" title="Will Ferguson">Will Ferguson</a> tried to be serious.
