	    <p><b>Anne-Marie Slaughter</b> (born September 27, 1958) is the current Dean of the <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodrow_Wilson_School_of_Public_and_International_Affairs_8149.html" title="Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs">Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs</a> at <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton_University_960f.html" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a>.

Slaughter was a member of the class of '80 at Princeton. She is married to Andrew Moravscik, who teaches in Princeton's Politics department. Her father also attended Princeton and served in the U.S. Attorney General's office.</p>
<p>Since becoming dean of the Woodrow Wilson School in 2002, she has been credited with vigorously rebuilding Princeton's international relations faculty, including hiring a bevy of well-respected, left of center academics including <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Keohane_b83f.html" title="Robert Keohane">Robert Keohane</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Milner_254e.html" title="Helen Milner">Helen Milner</a>, and <a href="../../../g/2E/_/G._John_Ikenberry_341b.html" title="G.

<p>She is currently writing a book on America's founding principles for Basic Books. Her most recent book, A New World Order, looks at the role of transnational networks in contemporary international relations. Slaughter has led efforts to bring together the fields of international relations and international law. Slaughter was a recent contributor on foreign policy matters to the "America Abroad" blog on TPMCafe.com.</p>
<p>In November 2006 the U.S. State Department announced Slaughter was picked to chair Secretary's of State's Advisory Committee on Democracy Promotion, which was established by Secretary Condoleezza Rice to "convene external experts to provide her and the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) with advice on issues related to democracy promotion in the formulation and implementation of foreign policy and foreign assistance."</p>
<p>On September 27, 2006 Slaughter helped to launch on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC the Final Report of the Princeton Project on National Security, a bi-partisan, multi-year initiative created to devise a long-term national security strategy for the United States. The Princeton Project's honorary co-chairs are George Shultz and Anthony Lake; Slaugher and G. John Ikenberry serve as academic co-directors of the Project.</p>

<p>In 2003, she was involved in a controversy when she defended an art exhibit titled "Ricanstructions" at the Wilson School that opponents of the exhibit claimed was "anti-Catholic" and desecrated Christian symbols, and who included some Princeton undergraduates and two Princeton faculty members. The School hosted a public forum in which she and supporters and opponents of the exhibit participated, and at which the exhibit's opponents asked Slaughter whether she would host an exhibit that featured Islamic symbols in a potentially controversial fashion. Slaughter at first conceded she would not, but at the end of the forum said she had reconsidered this point and would be willing to exhibit "paintings that are are bound to cause offense to some," as long as they had educational value.</p>

<p>She also served on the board of the proposed International Freedom Center, which would have been placed at the site of the World Trade Center. Those opposed to the Center, mostly conservatives, argued that it was being developed not as a memorial to those who died in the September 11, 2001 attacks, but as a place to criticize U.S. policy and history as oppressive.</p>
<p>In early 2006, she was involved in a controversy over her decisions to invite prominent figures such as <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colin_Powell_f293.html" title="Colin Powell">Colin Powell</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condoleezza_Rice_57ca.html" title="Condoleezza Rice">Condoleezza Rice</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Shultz_369a.html" title="George Shultz">George Shultz</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Chertoff_c663.html" title="Michael Chertoff">Michael Chertoff</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Petraeus_510b.html" title="David Petraeus">David Petraeus</a> (leader of the 101st Airborne Division in North Iraq), Giora Eiland (former IDF commander), <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Zinni_d007.html" title="Anthony Zinni">Anthony Zinni</a> and other government and military officials to Princeton University. Critics argued that the Woodrow Wilson School is excluding independent, critical and anti-war academics, journalists and commentators from its prestigious conferences and events (primarily the Wilson School's 75 Anniversary Celebration and the "Rethinking the War on Terror" Conference). Slaughter refuted these claims by pointing to the dozens of public lectures by independent academics, journalists, and other analysts that the Wilson School hosts each academic year.</p>

In a Public Forum entitled "Intellectuals and the Institution: What's in the Service of the Nation?", Dean Slaughter was accused by one panelist of using the Woodrow Wilson School as a "stepping stone" to a future position in Washington, a claim she rejected.</p>

<p>At the end of the forum, she stated that "at some point, I hope that I can be in government and I hope that I can be in a position where I'm contributing to foreign policy... there is no shame in saying you want to serve the nation, in foreign policy or domestic policy in any way. Indeed, we [at the Wilson School] seek to encourage that in all of you."</p>
