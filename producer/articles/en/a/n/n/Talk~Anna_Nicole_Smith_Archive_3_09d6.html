<dd>You mean the photo in front of the MTV stand? It's one in a series of various celebrity arrivals at whatever awards show it was. It seems real enough. I don't know but what it might be a copyright violation, though. If not, maybe the cute closeup of Carmen Electra could be added to her own article, instead of the witchy-looking photo they had there the last time I checked. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 19:42, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's an original photo by Toby Foraggio. Note that she's holding the hand of some keeper, who's blurred walking past the side boards. Her hand's firmly around the keeper's hand, so it seems real to me. The blur of that person's leg is the same as the blur of the hand of the guy with the umbrella. Also, if you look really closely at the motion drag of her pointer finger, it's darker over the area where the umbrella is, lighter blur over the window area.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Actually that's not the "discussion point." The original poster merely expressed a personal opinion, while calling O'Donnell a "loudmouth lesbian." He or she said nothing at all about the article. And no, obviously O'Donnell's comments aren't relevant enough for the article. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 03:42, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, if you take away the slanderous stuff from the original poster's comments, there's an opinion expressed on whether Rosie's comments (which merely echo those of everyone in the media in this case) are worthy of inclusion. I think the consensus so far is <b>NO</b>. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 04:09, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Please read the original poster's comments again. There was NO opinion expressed about whether or not O'Donnell's comments should be included in the article. Certain people, for whatever reason, use Wikipedia as a soundingboard for their own opinions and beliefs, as if it were an AOL chat room. I attempted to delete the comments due to their utter irrelevancy, but was unsuccessful. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 05:53, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>While I agree that the *way* in which the original post was phrased could have been a bit less... um frank, that by itself is not a reasonable reason to remove it. Also, talk pages are not only for discussing how to improve the article. They are for discussing the article in all it's permutations. Many talk page comments only ask a question like "what does x mean"? They aren't removed simply because they "don't tend to improve the article." In general there are only a very slim number of talk page comments that can be removed. For example, personal attacks. That's why I reverted it, because the remark that Rosie talked about her that day, is novel to me and interesting. Whatever Rosie said may or may not be useful for the article, I don't know exactly what she said. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 06:50, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I admit that attributing noble intentions on the part of the original poster was a serious stretch. And if it had stayed in that vein, it was certainly worthy of deletion. However, it quickly evolved into a legitimate discussion. That's why I'm not so eager, as some are, to delete stuff from talk pages just because they <i>appear</i> not to be useful. However, I'm not opposed to it either, and I have also deleted blatant vandalism on talk pages from time to time. However, I don't think it's appropriate to put too much "prior restraint" on the talk page contents, as seemingly off-topic or irrelevant discussions <i>can</i> lead to useful and appropriate points. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 09:52, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

TrimSpa Lawsuit</p>

The previous month TrimSpa paid $1.5 million to settle a dispute with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over the effectiveness of the pills. <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/breaking_news/16634094.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/breaking_news/16634094.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>This is newsworthy - perhaps somebody can wind it in? Claim by a Native American indian that Anna Nicole determinedly seduced him while she was at the Sanctuary Resort and Spa on Camelback Mountain in Arizona and got pregnant. Against abortion for religious reasons, she deliberately fattened up to hide the pregnancy, had a son, and signed custody over to the father, who has kept the boy on the reservation ever since. The boy is now 5 years old, and the father has come forward because Anna's monthly $10,000 bank deposits to care for the boy ceased when she died. YIKES!!!

<p>Just watched Larry King live and I wouldn't be surprised if Howard K. Stern is arrested in the coming days. He flew out of Florida the day Anna died, hes making millions of dollars off of her death, and hes hidding someone else's baby! Where are the police in all of this? Anyways, can someone please add this information about Howard K. Stern into the article. The information can be found on the court tv website and on the Insider website as well. Thanks.</p>

<p>I believe what the police actually stated was something more like "There is no evidence of foul play."

<h2><span class="mw-headline">new information about probate</span></h2>
<p>Some new information. There supposedly is a will. The probate proceedings will now be conducted in the Bahamas rather than the U.S. And given the rather bad reputation of the courts (and the government - see yesterday) in the Bahamas, the outcome isn't difficult to guess. It will also be possible there to get around conflict of interest problems involved with the same person having written the will, being its executor, being a major beneficrary and being the guardian of the other major beneficrary. That arrangement would have been unlikely to stand in the US courts. You put together all the events of the last six months it really starts to look bad. The combination of her son (and main heir) dying, her obtaining perminent resident status in the Bahamas, a sham marriage that wasn't really a marriage and someone getting a name put on the birth certificate and the quick piling up of a legal/political war chest of several million dollars in very available cash from the sale of photographs/interviews. I really wonder what they told her to convince her to become a permanent resident in the Bahamas. She didn't need it to stay in the country indefinately and she didn't need it for custody purposes because her child was born there. Ironically, the only useful thing about that status would have been in the event of her death. 12.96.162.45 17:59, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

The original source is Smith attorney Wayne Munroe speaking to someone from the associated press. If you go looking on Google News, you can easily find sources for Stern being the executor (her main lawyer announced it). The corrupt nature of the government in the Bahamas is opinion, but somewhat validated by Smith's bedroom photos with the government official who fast-tracked her residency. Aside from everything else thats been mentioned, there might not be as much money in the estate as people might suppose. I suspect (but obviously can't prove) that she has been financing her lifestyle and lawyers by borrowing against the potential value of the Marshall judgement. You look at all the lawyers and hangers-on that were living off her and it adds up to more money being spent than can have come from trimspa and E!. <a href="../../../6/3/2E/User%7E63.3.5.2.html" title="User:63.3.5.2">63.3.5.2</a> 03:35, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I read something like that as well. Something like somebody... the bodyguard? thinking that *maybe* she choked on her own vomit. Not sure where I read it though. Of course that raises the question of why she was so comatose that she couldn't vomit in a normal way. The vast majority of us vomit and don't choke on it, and taking flu medications doesn't typically make people into vomit-choking vegetables.&#160;;) <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 20:11, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>A person does not need to be "comatose" to choke on vomit. The most common cause is that the person has passed out while intoxicated, but any medication that induces a deep sleep can be a cause, especially if the taker has a delayed adverse reaction to the medicine that causes the vomting. — <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalloon_5060.html" title="User:Walloon">Walloon</a> 20:49, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The vomit stories all seem to go back to "access hollywood" as a source. That story has a medical non-professional suggesting it based on the presence of vomit around her. The medical examiner did not ever suggest that choking or loss of air was the cause of death so I would not tend to put much credibility on the story. The person supposedly worked for her, but is not identified. Also, the kind of "vomiting" thats being talked about here isn't what you would think of as the normal vomiting that most people experience. When you start mixing bunches of drugs, things in the body can start going wrong. It can lead to heart failure or airways getting clogged with stuff. There are lots of automatic things going on in the body all the time that keep hearts beating and lungs breathing. People take things like coughing for granted. The right combination of drugs can mess up those automatic systems. And it can happen easier than most people think. And if your an alcoholic on methadone, even simple things can be bad. 12.96.162.45 21:04, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The text concerning the dispute over the house in the Bahamas needs improvement. I'm locked out of the article, so I'm leaving this as a suggested improvement.</p>
<p><br />
Thompson located and purchased the house with his own money in order to help Smith relocate to the Bahamas quickly. There was an agreement with Smith that the deed to the house would be recorded in her name once she obtained a mortgage/note to finance the purchase of the house. This never happened. The official recorded deed still lists Thompson as the owner. An unrecorded deed was created with Smith's name as a convinenance to get the utilities of the property turned on and to create a basis for her claim of residency in the Bahamas. Thompson has stated that he did not press the issue of the mortgage because of her pregnancy and the death of her son but had no intention of ever turning the house over to her as a gift or allowing her to record a deed in her name until he received payment. <a href="http://www.jonesbahamas.com/?c=45&amp;a=10462" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jonesbahamas.com/?c=45&amp;a=10462" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>Thompson has been attempting to re-claim the property since November of 2006. He had the power to the house briefly turned off and seved Smith with an eviction notice. Smith's response to the serving of the notice was "You get off this property. This is a gift and I ain't ever leaving. And I'll show you, Ben, you ain't never gonna see the baby again!. Smith had claimed that Thompson was the father of her child until being informed that he was incapable.<a href="http://www.tmz.com/2006/11/13/the-lights-arent-on-and-anna-is-home" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tmz.com/2006/11/13/the-lights-arent-on-and-anna-is-home" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>

<p>Why do you assume the doctor and pharmacy committed multiple crimes? It is *not* illegal to take pain medication during pregnancy. There is the possibility of dependence for the newborn but it's not a crime if the medication is prescribed for a legitimate reason.

<dd>Are you sure your not confusing Howard Stern and Howard K. Stern (as the article and this talk page mentions, they're different people). The radio show is obviously Howard Stern. Are you sure she wasn't saying she would fuck anyone except Howard Stern (not Howard K. Stern). Sounds like something she might say when talking to Howard Stern... I was channel surfing and happened upon E and notice she was on Howard Stern in 1995 or something. This was long before Howard K. Stern was publicly part of her life AFAIK so if this was from then, it seems very unlikely she was referring to Howard K.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Billy Wayne Smith</span></h2>
<p>Does anyone know if he's still alive? I know little about inheritance law and especially not Floridan but unless I'm mistaken normally parents inherit from children if the child has not spouse or children. So if her 2001 will is upheld and there is no newer will and her dead son has no will, then I presume Billy could inherit everything <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 12:58, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Billy would inherit his son's right to whatever he would eventually receive. If Anna's estate wins the million they would be split equally between her two children. Her son's part would go to his father as you say. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 07:44, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Billy Wayne Smith is alive. He testified (very briefly) on the telephone during last week's hearing for Virgie Arthur's side. He indidcated that "if he had the money" he'd have Daniel's body moved back to Texas.</dd>

<dd>As for inheritance, he will receive nothing. Because Daniel pre-deceased Anna Nicole, her will must legally be considered null &amp; void because there is no living heir. She has essentially died intestate - with no will. (so the $ goes to Dannielynn) In other words, Daniel (who is dead) is not in a position to inherit anything. Therefore, Billy Wayne has no claim. Had Anna Nicole died first, Daniel would legally inherit everythng. If Daniel had died AFTER Anna Nicole, Billy Wayne would probably get something - but as is - he'll get nothing. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleo123_d48f.html" title="User:Cleo123">Cleo123</a> 08:24, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're right about most of that. Since Daniel died before Anna, then Billy would only have a claim to whatever Daniel had at the time he died. Since Daniel was Anna's heir, then the will naming him is worthless, unless it specifies what to do *if he were to die*. The only thing above that you missed is if Daniel had died after Anna. Billy wouldn't get *something*, he'd get *everything*. I'm under the impression that half-siblings don't inherit in intestate cases. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 08:30, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So far I have heard that the deed is in fact actually in Anna's name. Now I do understand that G. Ben Thompson had "gifted/lent" Anna $900,000 US towards the purchase of that home. Here is my question; why would the ownership of the home be in question at all? When you lend someone money, whatever they decide to buy with that money is not something you can claim as yours unless a lien is placed on that property (sort of how you buy a car and do not get the deed until you pay it off). G. Ben Thompson should file a repayment request from the estate of Anna Nicole Smith. He has NO RIGHT to the property that is titled under her name, legally. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMariza21_b5ed.html" title="User:Mariza21">Mariza21</a> 10:10, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>According to <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaither_Ben_Thompson_89dd.html" title="Gaither Ben Thompson">Gaither Ben Thompson</a>, the property was not a gift, but a loan -- and she never had title to the property, nor was a legal deed recorded for her. Says his attorney, the deed is in Thompson's name. After he bought the property and paid for its maintenance, she did not repay him, so he sued her in Bahamas court to evict. He won a summary judgment when she failed to respond to the filing or appear at trial. --<font size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 09:13, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
