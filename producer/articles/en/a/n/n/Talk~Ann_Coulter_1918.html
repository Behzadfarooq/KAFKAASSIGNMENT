Why is this article longer and better researched than Einstein or Lincoln? Why the incessant desire to flaunt opinions about current events? This is an encylopedia, not a blog.</p>

<dd>That is a really good point. I have followed this discussion for months and made a couple contributions. It's clear there are die hard fans and detractors who will continuously fight. Anyone sayng the page looks good is nuts. The attempt to create a section titled 'faggots' stands out. Also the CBC issue was especially noteable. Case in point, all the irrelevant material on the CBC Vietnam comment. At the time every other q&amp;a she was in had a fan stand up (like this was actually helping her) and offer the points about Canadian peacekeepers and such. At the one I was at at Florida she made jokes and then said basically that's not what I meant, I was wrong, I've said as much, let's move on. Separate but similar comments were referenced in the UofT paper. But here the issue is misrepresented. Her detractors and her supporters both have little reasonable perspective.</dd>

<dd><b>P</b>erhaps because Einstein and Lincoln are not alive and still generating new news that is documented before the entire public in their daily news consumption, thereby providing plenty of sourced information to be included? Further, Coulter is a contemporary advocate for a political party as well as a source cited and provided air-time on a number of national outlets and has an ongoing impact on politics and American life. Why should such a person not be thoroughly covered? And why should any attempts be made to not include all aspects of their contributions? Why should her comments about calling multiple political candidates "f****ts" and calling Iraqi people "towelheads" be kept out? There are facts and non-facts. If something is a fact, then why cry "bias"? Should we only allow contributions to articles about people and topics that certain editors feel are acceptable? In ten years time, this person may barely be remembered. If every event and person was eternally memorable, what would the point of an encyclopedia be? And while you and I may not think she is very memorable, the fact that she was chosen (repeatedly) by one of the most prominent political gatherings of the year says that she is of some significance.</dd>

<dd>Well, given that Wikipedia did not exist in the days of Einstein and Lincoln, I think it's safe to say that if it did, we'd likely have more-detailed articles. That aside, given how "sensitive" people have become in the past few decades, it's easier to offend people, especially demonstrated by how PC our society has become, and what happens to people who "speak out of turn" like Coulter did; I doubt the same furor would have been incurred a few decades ago. I don't think Coulter will be "barely remembered" in ten years time, but that's because even though there are plenty of people like her out there, she's one of the few the mainstream media pays attention to. --PeanutCheeseBar 19:00, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The original poster does have a point that recent articles get way too much attention here. It seems that editors (myself included) have a tendency to want to add things they've heard or read to articles, without first analyzing whether it is relevant. That's why George W. Bush's article is almost three times as long as say Thomas Jefferson or George Washington, even though Jefferson and Washington are clearly more important and historically significant than Bush. But such is the nature of the beast. Persons and subjects who make the news in the present is emphasized more than persons and subjects in the past. Over time it is easier to comprehend whether an event or controversy should garner a mere sentence or a full section. But in the present there is no way to objectively figure that out. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamsquire_182a.html" title="User talk:Ramsquire">(throw me a line)</a></sup> 19:12, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Quite honestly, just have the article conform to events that actually was a defining moment in the person's life. Look at the celebrity article for Stacy Ferguson of the Black Eyed Peas to see what I'm talking about. She peed herself on stage, while funny has nothing to do with her career and no one can reference anything to the contrary. i'm sure that Lincoln must have done something embarassing. Maybe he sneezed all over the Gettysburg address. You wouldn't know from the article on Wiki but I sure know that George W. Bush recieved a drunk driving ticket when he was 30 and inexplicably the locked door incident? The hell? Its a real shame because when I come to Wiki I just scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the references to get the story on a subject. --<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt8641_eb49.html" title="User:Art8641">Art8641</a> 22:03, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The John Edwards comments are part of a pattern in her speech where she makes accusations about an individual's supposed homosexuality. It is a significant distinction within her style and since she is a unique political and social commentator the pattern deserves recognition. Since it has been used repeatedly, it has become a important and meaningful part of her message. Txjeffrey 07:52, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Kizzle, I agree. My opinion is she isn't a satirist and her remarks are meant to belittle, not humor. But that isn't the main point of my argument which is this is another occurrence of a rhetorical pattern--part of a theme which I feel is now noteworthy because it has appeared repeatedly. Since yesterday two speakers at the conference have condemned her remarks which arguably gives her remarks more weight. Because she is unique among her peers with a unique style and with a wide following, I feel it is appropriate to present a thorough citation of her work.Txjeffrey 19:47, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I also agree that there shouldn't be any personal analysis calling it "hate speech" or anything else similar.

<dd>Kyaa, your edit summary was a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPAvio</a>. I'll let it go this time, but you need to rein it in. I made the edit based on the comments by editors here and on the AN/I, where people expressed surprise that with as much coverage as it has, it's NOT on wikipedia, and given the list above by Kizzle, INcluding FOXNEWS, and teh NYT, if both sides of the fourth estate are covering it, if her fellow speakers are responding to it, and if readers are looking for it, we should include it. it is well sourced, and if we chose to, we could use all of Kizzle's list to make it one of the single most extensively sourced paragraphs ever on wikipedia. that's not a POINT violation, it's being bold in the face of obstructionism citing 'recentism' as a reason to not include an event on the national news. I'll ignore that PA this time, but I suggest you let it stand. Numerous additions, citations and so on extensively support it's inclusion. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 00:08, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Wikipedia is not an directory of quotations. We've simply asked that we wait for some evidence that this is a notable controversy. Newsworthiness does not equal notability. If we listed every time that Coulter shot off her mouth, this article would challenge the library of congress in size. Is this a notable spouting of nonsense by Coulter? Probably not. Is it the most recent, yes. Gaming the system to try to overcome consensus is not cool. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 00:20, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Coulter's spouting is always notable. She's got a major national following and deliberately seeks media attention to garner more sales and attention. This time, she's managed to insult a major political figure at a level which skirts slander with the thinnest of veneers. AGAIN, I reassert, the massive coverage, response from within her own party and the expectations of readers to see such information substantiates that it is NOT transitory, and DOES belong in the article. Should she do nothing more along this line, then in six months or a year, it can be collapsed into a general 'Other controversies' section, perhaps. but for now, it's relevant and noteworthy. The NYT, and FOXNEWS, and WashingtonPost are all carrying it, in addition to wire services, major blogs, and on, and on, and on. Stop making your baseless personal attacks aabout me gaming the system, and making POINT violations. One more out of you and I'll take this right back to AN/I. You argued it's content, I came back and argued the content. Your reply, Personal Attacks.

<dd>I think you are entirely mischaracterizing what amounts to a satirical comment about a) our culture of redemption through rehab and b) the shock value of language a la George Carlin. She essentially said "if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all" but with the "Grey's Anatomy" twist. She didn't call anyone a name. It's a biting style considering the word she used, but it's satirical humour nonetheless. Also characterizing her comment as "spouting" is not very encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 00:37, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, she referred to the Grey's anatomy "rehab" nonsense. However, in doing so, she called Edwards a "faggot". It's not like it was the first time she used the word, she also called Al Gore a "total fag". --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 01:30, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, she said she couldn't talk about Edwards. That's the humour part. And the Al Gore quote was a total deadpan humour line. This is very similiar to Al Franken. I find them both very funny with very biting satire. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 01:49, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But the logical implication is that she would use "faggot" as a descriptor, no? The presence of sarcasm in a statement is not a license to freely interpret meaning, as sarcasm indicates that the meaning is opposite of its intention. Thus, the sarcasm directed towards Isiah Washington (which I fully agree is a bullshit remedy a la Mel Gibson/Ted Haggard/Mark Foley) still does not negate the logical implication that she was referring to Edwards as a "faggot". That's my take, at least. It's also the take of Captain's Quarters, Michelle Malkin, John McCain, Rudy Giuliani, and Mitt Romney, all of whom condemned her statement. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 03:00, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't think it was serious so I am not sure how to interpret it. I think the word choice is condemnable and is why they condemned it. But I think the humour that was both meant and understood by the audience is lost in simply a literal/logical interpretation. For example, if she was making a joke about how stiff Al Gore is and said something like 'I'd talk about Al Gore but I was taught never to speak ill of the dead.' There would be no claims that she was threatening his life (or if there, they would be silly). There would be no literal intrepretation that she was saying he was actually dead. It would simply be picked up for the word play that it is. The issue here isn't that she called Edwards "a faggot", but rather her word choice may be seen as offensive even in the context of joke. There is no reason though to try to turn the quote into something other than a joke. Highlight it's offensiveness of the word but the context is still an attempt at humour. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 04:08, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>The article is looking pretty good. I have not viewed it for some time. Kudos to everyone who has contributed. I agree that she was attempting to be satirical in this instance tho she is in general not a satirist but also that that should not factor into whether or not this comment should be included. The comment does not carry the weight of controversy that it would if spoken by some other pundits. By her extravagances Coulter crosses the line into being an entertainer and so I think a lot of poeple take what she says with a grain of salt. As others have noted the reaction is more important and needs to be gauged. (Trajancavalous 03:06, 4 March 2007 (UTC))</p>

<dd>The disagreement above by kizzle and Tbeatty can easily be resolved by including the quote, without analysis as to whether it was a joke or not. I also think relevant, agreed upon context can/should be provided. If we're going to include the reference to the cast members of Grey's anatomy, we need to find a reliable source for this (I'm sure it's not lacking), as otherwise it would appear to be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. The title <b>Use of the word "fag" or "faggot"</b> albeit a neutral one, seems a bit odd to me. Maybe it's just me. However, it's better than a title like <b>Accusations of homosexuality</b>, which seems to imply that her comments weren't jokes. I don't think we can know if she was joking or not, and therefore it's not in our place to be deciding such things as editors.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The event is already notable. That it's recent has little to do with anything pertaining to notability. We need to be careful in assessing the quote and presenting it as a joke or not. I'm sure some sources will say "it was just a joke" and some will say "she called Edwards a faggot", and unless we're quoting these sources, we need to assert nothing of the sort. --<a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a> 07:23, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Very good point in the preceding two comments. I too think this needs a new subtitle. For consistency, similarity to the other subtitles seems more appropriate. <b>Comments about individuals</b> is the most generic. Perhaps a more specific title to consider is <b>Comments about politicians and public officials</b>. The allegations of homosexuality are just part of her rhetorical style. Another consistency in her style is her advocating justifiable death of public officials which has similarly created notable controversy and could be included in this section at some point if deemed appropriate.Txjeffrey 13:53, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Coulter's known for making attention-grabbing comments, and this isn't the first time that she's used or seemed to infer use of the words "fag" or "faggot". That having been said, the media hasn't and the Democratic party have not flipped out every other time she's used the word, so I fail to see what's different other than the fact that they cared to look NOW. If nothing else, it should be noted in her article that she's prone to using derogatory language about gay people (or accusing people of being gay); if we covered every instance where she used the word, this article would be a LOT longer. --PeanutCheeseBar 14:05, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>So</b>, if I understand this correctly - we should avoid recentism unless something is picked up and carried throughout the press? It's not enough for something to be a fact or a documented or cited fact. It has to be a fact that is popularly covered wide and far? Does this mean that since very little to no coverage has been afforded to, say, Darfur - it should be ignored and not covered as a historical article or issue of current event? A comment of significance should most certainly appear in your article on wikipedia. Especially if it has caused a significant stir as this has. I fail to see how there should be any discussion as to whether it should be included or not to begin with. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Cordell (<a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECordell_6057.html" title="User talk:Cordell">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cordell_a6c1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cordell">contribs</a>) 02:07, 6 March 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>I think the answer to your question is that quotations within Coulter's bio requires a higher standard of notability than other articles, simply because she makes <i>so many</i> controversial statements. Of <i>course</i> a detailed article on Darfur is justified, and should contain as much information as possible based upon verifiable and reliable sources. The Darfur case also contains a high amount of non-controversial concrete descriptive facts, whereas here we're discussing whether one controversial statement out of a million that have already been spoken deserves inclusion. In the case of Coulter, if we don't hold ourselves to a higher standard of notability, this article is going to be a repository for every dumb thing Coulter has ever said in the past. Kyaa's initial concern of recentism was entirely justified, as she says shit that pisses off liberals every week, and even gets some media coverage for those statements almost as often. We had to wait until it was absolutely clear that this incident rose above the rest of the dumb shit she says, and in mine and others' opinions, when all top-tier Republican presidential candidates weighed in, as well as Michelle Malkin, Howard Dean, Ted Kennedy, John Amaechi, in addition to being covered on almost every major news outlet, it showed a clear demonstration of the incident's notability. We ended up only waiting a few days, and I believe such caution especially on this page is justified in order to prevent this article from becoming "What dumb shit did Coulter say this week?". --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 03:27, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Reproduce coverage from more mainstream coverage like NY Times, WaPo, etc., and you may change my mind, but the Guardian quoting a Bill Maher interview.... ehhh. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 23:18, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's documented in the Time article. I never knew Ms. Coulter's <i>personal</i> religious practices were of such import. Is it encyclopedic and NPOV to expound on Ms. Coulter's religiosity at such length?

<dd>Um, what? How are her religious views not notable? She's been very loud about what they are and has made clear that they influence her decisions deeply.

<dd>I don't mean to pile on <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> but how can you ignore a prominant American saying that islam ought to be replaced by Christianity? Especially when there are fundamentalist Muslims out there who point to remarks like that and say we are trying to eliminate Islam. Muslims in poor countries without access to independant sources may actually see her as the embodiment of everything we as Americans stand for if that's what the propaganda says. I'm not saying what I just said should be included in the article, but given the state of the world today how can her religious views don't matter? <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 08:59, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>"I was going to have a few comments on the other Democratic presidential candidate, John Edwards, but it turns out that you have to go into rehab if you use the word 'faggot,' so I'm - so, kind of at an impasse, can't really talk about Edwards, so I think I'll just conclude here and take your questions," said Coulter, whose comment was followed by applause. <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/04/coulter.edwards/" class="external autonumber" title="http://edition.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/04/coulter.edwards/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></li>
<li>Audience members appeared startled, then many clapped, and she opened the floor to questions. The event was carried on C-SPAN. Many newspapers, including The New York Times, covered the event but failed to mention the Coulter slur at first. <a href="http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003553226" class="external text" title="http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003553226" rel="nofollow">(Editor and Publisher)</a></li>
<li>Mr. Edwards’s aides responded with an e-mail message that attacked Ms. Coulter and urged supporters to donate to Mr. Edwards’s campaign. “John was singled out for a personal attack because the Republican establishment knows he poses the greatest threat to their power,” said his campaign manager, David E. Bonior. “Since they have nothing real to use against him, Coulter’s resorting to the classic right-wing strategy of riling up hate to smear a progressive champion.” <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/us/politics/04coulter.html?em&amp;ex=1173157200&amp;en=01c86fe9521cf152&amp;ei=5087%0A" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/us/politics/04coulter.html?em&amp;ex=1173157200&amp;en=01c86fe9521cf152&amp;ei=5087%0A" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></li>
<li>"Ann Coulter's use of an anti-gay slur yesterday was un-American and indefensible," Edwards said in a posting on his Web site, www.johnedwards.com. "In America, we strive for equality and embrace diversity. The kind of hateful language she used has no place in political debate or our society at large." <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/04/coulter.edwards/" class="external autonumber" title="http://edition.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/04/coulter.edwards/" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></li>
<li>Edwards' campaign posted the video on their Web site, and asked readers to help them "raise $100,000 in 'Coulter Cash' this week to keep this campaign charging ahead and fight back against the politics of bigotry." <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/04/coulter.edwards/" class="external autonumber" title="http://edition.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/04/coulter.edwards/" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> "I believe it is our moral responsibility to speak out against that kind of bigotry and prejudice every time we encounter it."</li>
<li>Ms. Coulter, asked for a reaction to the Republican criticism, said in an e-mail message: “C’mon, it was a joke. I would never insult gays by suggesting that they are like John Edwards. That would be mean.” <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/us/politics/04coulter.html?em&amp;ex=1173157200&amp;en=01c86fe9521cf152&amp;ei=5087%0A" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/us/politics/04coulter.html?em&amp;ex=1173157200&amp;en=01c86fe9521cf152&amp;ei=5087%0A" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></li>
<li>“The comments were wildly inappropriate,” said [John McCain's] spokesman, Brian Jones. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/us/politics/04coulter.html?em&amp;ex=1173157200&amp;en=01c86fe9521cf152&amp;ei=5087%0A" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/us/politics/04coulter.html?em&amp;ex=1173157200&amp;en=01c86fe9521cf152&amp;ei=5087%0A" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></li>
<li>Mr. Giuliani said, “The comments were completely inappropriate and there should be no place for such name-calling in political debate.” <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/us/politics/04coulter.html?em&amp;ex=1173157200&amp;en=01c86fe9521cf152&amp;ei=5087%0A" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/us/politics/04coulter.html?em&amp;ex=1173157200&amp;en=01c86fe9521cf152&amp;ei=5087%0A" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></li>
<li>Kevin Madden, a spokesman for Mr. Romney, said: “It was an offensive remark. Governor Romney believes all people should be treated with dignity and respect.” Mr. Romney preceded Ms. Coulter at the event and mentioned that she was speaking later — he jokingly referred to her as a “moderate.” But he was not in the room when she spoke, Mr. Madden said. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/us/politics/04coulter.html?em&amp;ex=1173157200&amp;en=01c86fe9521cf152&amp;ei=5087%0A" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/us/politics/04coulter.html?em&amp;ex=1173157200&amp;en=01c86fe9521cf152&amp;ei=5087%0A" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></li>
<li>The remarks also drew disapproval from some popular conservative commentators. Ed Morrissey on his Captain's Quarters blog wrote: "Yeah, that's just what CPAC needs -- an association with homophobia. Nice work, Ann." <a href="http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003553226" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003553226" rel="nofollow">[16]</a></li>
<li>In a written statement, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, said, "Ann Coulter's words of hate have no place in the public sphere much less our political discourse. Not only should she apologize but those who participated in the conference with her should denounce her shameful and divisive actions." <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/04/coulter.edwards/" class="external autonumber" title="http://edition.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/04/coulter.edwards/" rel="nofollow">[17]</a></li>
<li>"Ann Coulter's use of this anti-gay slur is vile and unacceptable," said Neil G. Giuliano, president of the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, "and the applause from her audience is an important reminder that Coulter's ugly brand of bigotry is at the root of the discriminatory policies being promoted at this gathering." <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/04/coulter.edwards/" class="external autonumber" title="http://edition.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/04/coulter.edwards/" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></li>
<li>Michelle Malkin expressed disapproval, and at her Hot Air site regular contributor "Bryan" wrote: "I’m no fan of John Edwards, but that’s just a stupid joke. It’s over the line. The laughter it generated across the room was more than a little annoying. Last year it was 'raghead.' This year it’s calling John Edwards a 'faggot.' Two years in a row, Coulter has finished up an otherwise sharp CPAC routine with an obnoxious slur that liberals will fling at conservatives for years to come. Thanks, Ann." <a href="http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003553226" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003553226" rel="nofollow">[19]</a></li>
<li>Democratic Party chief Howard Dean weighed in later: "There is no place in political discourse for this kind of hate-filled and bigoted comments. While Democrats and Republicans may disagree on the issues, we should all be able to agree that this kind of vile rhetoric is out of bounds. The American people want a serious, thoughtful debate of the issues. Republicans -- including the Republican presidential candidates who shared the podium with Ann Coulter today -- should denounce her hateful remarks." <a href="http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003553226" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003553226" rel="nofollow">[20]</a></li>

<dd>Probably the entire quote plus selected reaction. Probably something like this (not fully developed):</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>In an allusion to the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey%27s_anatomy.html" title="Grey's anatomy">Grey's anatomy</a> stars' (I forget who it was) use of the slur 'Faggot' and his subsequent rehab stint, Ann Coulter made the following statement &lt;full quote&gt; at a speech to <a href="../../../c/p/a/CPAC_9d15.html" title="CPAC">CPAC</a> in &lt;wherever it was&gt;. The audience appeared startled but responded with laughter and applause. The slur was roundly condemned by politicians, gay rights organizations and pundits from around the political spectrum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure if there is room for each individual condemnation and it would probably be hard to decide which is more worthy.

<dd>But that's what I said before. Fox News said "she <i>called</i> Edwards a "faggot"".

<dd>Adding "jokingly referred to" presents the problems Ramsquire brought up when we were discussing the CBC: with Coulter especially, and given her frequent but not uniform usage of sarcasm, it's tough to say what is a joke in the official tone. My proposed passage does, however, quote Coulter saying "It was a joke", so hopefully that will be good enough. You said we should treat this like the Kerry botched joke, it's the same thing: we don't say whether it was a botched joke or not, we just report what she said and that <i>she claimed</i> "It was a joke". --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 01:23, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>The sentence "(This was after Edwards had come under fire for hiring, firing, re-hiring and re-firing two pronounced anti-Christian bloggers)." seems designed to imply hypocrisy in Edwards's criticism of Coulter. Nor is it NPOV to refer to the bloggers as "pronounced anti-Christian," which is certainly not how they self-identify or are commonly referred to.</p>

I know that people are complaining about the number of sources for her remark against John Edwards, so here are a number of sources that show how notable it is and also helps to verify the infomation. <a href="../../../d/p/o/User%7EDposse_bcc1.html" title="User:Dposse">dposse</a> 04:14, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think notablility will fade. It's a current event. Last year at the same conference, one of the sources pointed out she used the slur "raghead". It's essentially a sentence today as part of a larger paragraph. I suspect this will fade into a sentence or part of a sentence as time fades. Unfortunately a real time encyclopedia seems to emphasize the immediate. I think this is just the nature of the beast and simply needs to be as concise and neutral as possible given the amount of detail that people want for current events. The hard part is not to do an injustice to the subject. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 04:38, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As an aside, it would be interesting to have a moratorium on all but the most basic current events for 6 months on BLPs just to see what would happen.

<dd>Possible, but irrelevant at the moment. This is getting a lot of coverage. Also, keep in mind that Wikipedia is not paper. If someone gets to be sufficiently controversial we can always split the controversy off to another article and only have the major ones on the main article.

<dd>Agree with JoshuaZ. The notability of these comments may or may not fade, but it certainly deserves a place in the article now because <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is niether paper nor a crystal ball</a>. We often must trim articles to avoid undue weight. At any rate, it's rare she provokes such a response from prominent Republicans. For this reason, if I were in the prognostication business, I think her Edwards remark might become one of the classicly-repeated Coulterisms.

<dd>WP:N, WP:V, and WP:NOR come to mind. But I do get your point. And people are right that she will probably not be terribly notable in the distant future. But we're not editors of a paper encyclopedia in the year 2100. We're editors of a non-paper encyclopedia in 2007, and this article is being fed traffic from people searching google in conjunction with her latest attack. Trying to omit tabloidish <i>New York Times</i> stories before they're X days old underserves our readers and is quixotic at best. Incoming readers view it as an omission and add it in whether we take the hundred-year view or not. It's better then to make such coverage accord with N, V, and NOR. We'll trim for undue wieght later when we have better perspective, but lacking the future wisdom of August or 2100 is no reason to leave cited stories out. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 17:14, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There were several other law reviews at Michigan at the time, and she might have been on one of them. I don't know. I vividly remember her starting the Federalist Society at Michigan during her first year and that was her claim to fame around the school.</p>

<p>The name of the section regarding Coulter's most recent controversy has been changed to "2007 CPAC Controversy". I think the homosexual slur title is more accurate and appropriate as the controversy concerns Coulter's use of the slur and not her attendance at the CPAC. In addition there is no controversy with the CPAC about Coulter's appearance there. The controversy is about Coulter and her use of the slur, therefore the title should be changed back. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamsquire_182a.html" title="User talk:Ramsquire">(throw me a line)</a></sup> 20:26, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unfortunately, we don't live in a society where "faggot" is unanimously considered a slur like "nigger" is, and thus is a controversial label.

<p><i>No way</i>! There is no way wikipedia is only able to refer to the biggest papers. If it is public &amp; distributed publicly it can be refered to! There is <i>no way</i> that only the biggest networks or papers in whatever country we are talking about are of note. If i wish to refer to a small independent paper, in Russia lets say, i have a right to, just because the large ones currently dominate or are under a common rubric doesnt mean they are the only notable ones, and this applies to every country on the globe including the US, people can refer to whatever paper they wish, hopefully they choose articles that are well reported and accurate, but if someone has issues with that referal then they can post counter references with a different side to the issue, or if they can show it was patently false or inaccurate or misleading in a discussion they can remove it, but take this tyranny of the majority argument back where it came from. Anyways a small US paper has a right to be represented if an editor so wishes to refer to it, and as i said before this particular issue of her latest controversial remarks should be reasonable in length to other sections, yet I am against deleting a bunch of information just as a couple of editors really want to spend some time with something compiling stuff, even though my opinion is <i>this is one of the least of the controversial things she has said</i> and she is being unfairly attacked over it, there are other things far more controversial and potentially highly inflamatory.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>for instance this controversy over the word "faggot" is not going to produce a bunch of violence, yet her remarks using the word "raghead" for instance, while i do support her free speech, and her ability to make jokes or slurs about something she feels she needs to, just as I should be able to make sarcastic remarks about a really stuffy arrogant thick-skulled christian for instance, or the way they dress, if I wish... none the less, in the circumstances of her making that remark, considering the extremely tense violent situation at hand globally, she was within her rights, yet was just not wise, as she has further polarized her own country with it, is encouraging her country to make broad general swipes or accusations at all muslims or arabs when only a minority is responsible for the actions she is <i>especially</i> upset about, and on the other side, inflamatory remarks such as this by a well known highly publicized individual undoubtedly encourage further extremism if they are picked up in that part of the world, and undoubtedly would then increase the size of the minority she takes issue with for its violent means, and would thereby further increase the violence they would perpetrate to her own nation and people, so she had a right to this, yet in the particular climate it was an unwise remark, I would tell her <i>she should be able to say what she wishes</i>, yet unfortunately <i>the current state of the world is not such that people in high profile positions such as hers should utilize their natural rights to full freedom of speech in highly public mass media forums</i> thereby possibly inflaming or enraging people and creating potentially violent reactions...so she should be able to express her extreme anger, even call publicly for invasion of all muslim countries and to "christianize" them, yet to resort to ethnic-religious slurs in calling for this is the unwise part which is uncalled for and is actually perhaps more inflamatory than simply calling for retributive invasions...85.1.223.203 22:47, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The statement has so far gotten more coverage than her statements at the CPAC last year. I don't see any undue weight issue with it currently. If in 3 months this seems like a much smaller issue then we might consider an undue weight response. But in any event, it isn't like this page is so long (only 63 kb). I would furthermore suggest that if the various controversies are getting too long to just have the major ones in her article with mentions and have a fork of "Ann Coulter Controversies" And I still favor "Faggot Controversy" as NPOV and easy to locate. The other option would be "Edwards Controversy" maybe? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 08:36, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not so sure...To everyone on wikipedias suprise <i>I am "coming out of the closet" as a "friend of Ann Coulter"</i>...it may indeed shock people familiar with my editing and writings...I have never met Ann, yet I am indeed perhaps even starting an advocacy group in support of Ann Coulter named "Friends of Ann Coulter"...My call is for the section to be renamed "<i><b>controversial use of first ammendment rights to free speech</b></i>"...and I think she has been unfairly targeted, she has a certain style, her style is often provocative or over the top, many times this is an attempt at humor, in any case she has a right to use the full extent of the english vocabulary to express her opinions without being demonized for it, and as long as she isnt advocating violence she is well within her rights, attack her for the content of her arguments, not for her sometimes flashy provocative style, some arent happy with her latest attempt at humor, yet whether you appreciate the joke or not, she has a right to full use of the english vocabularly, she did not tell people to head out to "hang all the gays" or something, she made use of a term, not even considered a profanity, such as others might use the term "red-neck", or a hip-hop singer might use the term "nigger", (these even ethnic based slang!)...people use terms like "commie scum", or "pinko", to talk about those on the left, or "nazi" or "fascist scum" to those on the right, for instance, based on ideological differences, and to advance their own position using a rhetorical flair, while some may think these slurs deflect from the substance of the discussion, and that they actually may end up hurting the users position in some cases, the user has full right to the full extent of the english language to express whatever opinion they may have. If anyone has a case against her for something she has said it would be the New York Times bombing remark, and I would tell her to be careful with such talk considering the laws in place in the US right now, and for this remark i would rebuke her to be more thoughtful about her highly public statements, as with her wide popularity it could indeed stir some in her fan base that lean towards the violent extreme to actually carry out such attacks, yet I still would argue she was within her 1st ammendment rights and was using the remark in a rhetorical sense to advance her position and argument and didnt actually plan such attacks to be actualized in reality. Anyways i certainly do not agree with many of the things Ann Coulter has spouted out, yet I believe in this instance <i>she has been unfairly attacked</i> while trying to use light humor to poke fun at something she doesnt believe in: homosexuality. And i have another confession to make actually...I'm coming out of the closet yet again.......indeed i admit here on wikipedia...that once...and its the only time it has ever occurred...once several years ago i indeed vandalized an ann coulter book...(it was a library book, and it wasnt exactly extreme vandalism, i think i took issue with something she said about Harry Truman)...anyways...yet indeed i wrote in a couple sentences explaining a few facts to dispute the argument Ann was purporting in her book...(in fact its the only thing i have written in an officially publicized form, the only thing I've ever written in a published book was in a copy of an Ann Coulter book)...anyways, you cant exactly call me a huge Ann Coulter fan, at least not until now...but after the attack on her for her use of freedom of speech and using light humor i have come to her defense, even to the point of incriminating myself if I were to come before a US court...anyways I'm not saying i agree it was wise or appropriate to use the joke or whether i thought it was funny, yet i believe it unfair to deprive her of free use of her most effective weapon to advance her positions and views on the subject of homosexuality or any other subject: her tongue...and i feel it highly hypocritical for people to attack her on this recent escapade when she has used the term "raghead" in the past which is quite plainly a much further and greater controversial remark as it is somewhat of an ethnic or religious slur, yet i do believe once again she was within her rights to express her opinion, if she is in a state of mind to be so put off by those she slurs, she has a right to this vocal catharsis...indeed in some countries she might be killed or beaten for such a remark, yet in many countries we have established a tradition of allowing people to express their minds even if it is controversial or "politically incorrect" language, plus they would not experience violent retribution or stir riots using this freedom in these countries, and the targets of these slurs would most often just laugh it off being sure enough of themselves to weather the verbal blow and perhaps even have a quick comeback to denigrate the user of the slur in like terms, so it is allowable...85.0.218.125 04:50, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Plus I'm boycotting Verizon, Sallie Mae, and Netbank, as well as The Oakland Press in Michigan, The Mountain Press of Sevierville, Tennessee, and the New Era in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, as the simple fact is she has made other statements of far more concern than this latest attempt at humor, if they had any backbone they would have discontinued her column or dropped sponsorship over more serious offences <i>or the substance</i> of some of her ramblings, yet of all the things Ann has said <i>it is this</i> that gets people to drop her column?, she didnt even actually use the word directly on anyone, only indirectly &amp; on someone married with children in an attempt at a joke towards someone clearly even immune to the joke...85.0.218.125 05:18, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

I restored the material within a few hours, both times -- not that it should matter <i>who</i> restored it.<br />
I restored the material because long-standing content has achieved consensus, and so it ought not be unilaterally deleted, without discussion or at least a note on the talk-page giving a rationale. Also, the likelihood of the deletion being overlooked, because of the vandalism-storm, seemed overly great. So foremostly I meant to ensure the deletion did not pass un-noticed, and was at least mooted somewhat.<br />
As for content, the part that was commented-out seems to be more-or-less covered elsewhere, so I think it is no loss. The bit about quoting scripture at the beginning of "Godless" seems insignificant. The part about church attendance seems worth mentioning. -- Lonewolf BC 21:05, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Jones suit was not "summarily dismissed," as the Coulter article falsely claims. It was dismissed on April 1, 1998, almost four years after it was filed on May 6, 1994, and after extensive discovery, including the deposition of President Clinton, which later touched off the expansion of Independent Council Starr's jurisdiction, and eventually led to a referral to Congress and the first impeachment of an elected President in American history on counts of perjury and obstruction of justice. Before the case got to stage of the Clinton deposition, it had already been to the Supreme Court, where the court issued a historic ruling that the District Court may take discovery in a civil case against the President based upon alleged acts before the President took office. All of this important context is not conveyed by the outright false statement that the Jones case was "summarily dismissed."</p>
<p>The article contains the additional demonstrably false statement that the Jones case was settled for $850,000 "in exchange for Jones' not appealing the decision." In fact, the settlement was reached on November 13th, 1998, several months after Jones' lawyers filed an appeal of the District Court's dismissal on July 31st, 1998. In the interim, oral argument on the appeal was heard by a panel of Eighth Circuit judges on October 20, 1998. The settlement occurred while the appeal was pending a decision by the Eighth Circuit.</p>
<p>All the facts above are back up by the Washington Post time-line of the Jones civil suit, found here:</p>

<dd>There's two tests that we'd need to pass. The first--providing evidence that she IS a chain smoker, which hasn't been done so far. The second--showing some reason why it's important to mention it, assuming that it's true. If she were a passionate anti-smoking crusader, I could see a point to it--the old hypocrisy issue. If she did a lot of pro-smoking advocacy, it might be relevant. If neither of those is the case, why is it any more notable than the model of car she drives, and her favorite dress shop?Marieblasdell 00:52, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>speak for yourself user "69"</i>...for instance it has been stated that the right leaning conservative leader in the UK, David Cameron, smoked ganga while in college, now i might still vote for the conservative leader knowing this and that the left leaning labour party leaders did not (and even have a policy of not allowing past ganga smokers to work in their government), <i>frankly I am more concerned with his &amp; their policies on the issues at hand!</i>...yet I am happy with the information on Mr Cameron's drug habits during college and also currently, on the other hand if I knew that Mr Cameron was currently a chain tobacco smoker, (which i dont think he is) I simply would be very unlikely to vote for him as he is clearly making choices by chain smoking that are extremely detrimental to the health of his own body, the solvency of the health care system, and also he would be creating a bad public example, (for instance 440,000 people die each year in the US from tobacco, and more &amp; more public figures smoking constitutes a bad example to others clearly!) so how could i trust him to make healthful choices for the UK?...while it might not be a deciding factor by any means, it would be points against him and if he couldnt demonstrate a great advantage over the other leaders, his chain smoking could lose him my vote!...while there would of course be many many other factors in my voting for him or not, it would be nice to know whether he is a chain tobacco smoker, whether he smoked ganga during college a few times is totally irrelevant as regards whether i would vote for him and only interesting to note...If Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or John McCain or anybody else in such positions is currently a chain tobacco smoker i would like to know, just like I would like to know if they are currently a chain ganga smoker, it doesnt necessarily mean I wouldnt vote for them, but I want some public info about their habits and preferences and how they treat their own bodies before i come to conclusions to their ability to hold sway over the body public!...and its nothing to do with a smear job, its wishing to acquire information about public figures, including entertainers that are highly politically involved like say ann coulter (I'm actually a fan of hers after her latest troubles, yet wasnt before especially)(I still will be a fan even if I know shes a chain smoker, she can be highly entertaining, it just will cement my view that shes maybe upset about not having kids or something and that its just another thing like her aggressive sensational tone)...83.79.148.111 01:01, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't have time to read all that. I had to skim over. Just keep these things in mind:</dd>
<dd>1. No articles or sources have been provided that she's a chain smoker or that she smokes at all.</dd>
<dd>2. That a person smokes is hardly notable enough to make it into their wiki article, so even if she did smoke, the only reason I can think of that that would warrant inclusion is if say, she was harshly critical of smokers/smoking and it was discovered that she smoked too. Then we'd have to see how much note the fact that she smokes generated.</dd>

<p>I disagree, if its a fact she (or anyone else notable enough to have a wiki-bio page) is a chain smoker, an editor can legitmately add that to the article, if its true and documented somewhere. Simple as that. In fact its just as notable as mentioning some random town they happen to be born in, its information, its notable,...period...(they shouldnt write a paragraph on it unless its somewhat <i>highly</i> notable and controversial such as you suggest, as if they were vehement anti-smokers, but a single sentence mention is allowable, if its true)...83.79.183.169 03:04, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This entry is excessively editorialized.</p>
<p>While Coulter is famous for her purposeful jabs at secular progressives, her quotes are no more incendiary or controversial than the likes of, say, Garrison Keillor, whose anemic entry makes no mention of controversy. In fact, it reads as though Keillor is the incarnation of the wise and kindly Will Rogers. Worse yet, the hypercontroversial Al Franken’s entry presents none of the editorializing comments that Coulter’s does.</p>
<p>Compare some of Coulter’s quotes to the following examples from Keillor’s HOMEGROWN DEMOCRAT (which are NOT cited in Wikipedia's entry, though Coulter's controversial statements are): Keillor calls Republicans as "hairy-backed swamp developers, corporate shills, Christians of convenience, freelance racists, hobby cops, misanthropic frat boys, lizardskin cigar monkeys, jerktown romeos, ninja dittoheads. .. .tax cheats, cheese merchants, cat stranglers, grab-ass executives, gun fetishists, genteel pornographers, nihilists in golf pants."</p>
<p>While claiming that his book describes "the politics of kindness, Keillor also says that Republicans are "criminal" and worse, "evil, deeply evil."</p>
<p>In 1999 Keillor told THE GUARDIAN (London) "Republicans might be heathens out to destroy all we [sic] hold dear; but that doesn’t mean we take them seriously. Or be bitter because they are swine.”</p>
<p>Worse yet, Al Franken's entry--perhaps sanitized for his recent run for the Senate--might link to sites that would reveal some of Franken's highly provocative, inflammatory remarks; however, none of these are quoted in his entry, nor does the text contain any narrative descriptions of events such as the following:</p>
<p>As a promotion for one of his books, Franken recorded a creepy spot that shows him engaging an actor who is playing a conservative reader. In this "ad," Franken kicks the conservative in the groin and smashes him over the head with a chair. The "skit" closes with Franken grinning broadly, holding up his book, and saying, "That felt good." To see this ad, go to www.michellemalkin.com/archives/003777.html</p>
<p>I fail to see why Coulter's many controversial statements (most of which contain liberal "rebuttals," as if the article is trying to prove a particular point) are cited in quantity and at length, while secular progressives such as Franken and Keillor enjoy entry that omit their equally incendiary statements and behaviors (all of which are accessible and documented).</p>
<p>I have often used Wikipedia entries (and have directed my four children toward them) when doing research. I have found them to be accurate and very helpful. This entry, however, has caused me to question the integrity of this service and to wonder about, or perhaps simply to recognize, a political bias that distorts the accuracy of information presented.</p>
<p>To maintain credibility, Wikipedia needs to amend its approach to use a more even hand when representing highly outspoken and controversial figures on both sides of the aisle.</p>

<p>-What??? How does she compare to kind Mr. Keillor? 66.177.204.252 3:58 11 march 2007</p>
<p>if someone feels they need to add Garrison Keillors quips about american republicans I'd say head to his page and go ahead if thats what you want to do. You will then deal with the editors that keep an eye on that page. Maybe they will be glad to have some of his sarcastic remarks included, I dont know. I know for sure that on this article there are several loyal Ann Coulter fans that keep an eye out to have the rightwing position presented. Go ahead Sixbrocks, start trying to put in some derogatory dirt on Ann Coulter to her article page! See what happens! Your going to need a bunch of references and maybe even then you'll just be blocked. In fact head to any republican personality or politician and start trying to fill the page with comments from the hard left...see what happens!...you'll never get away with it, there are hundreds of editors from the right watching over all those pages! Look at the edit histories for either right or left politicians, your going to find massive editing wars on each one between left leaning and right leaning editors!...maybe one side or the other has a slight advantage on any particular page you check, it just depends...on top of that your going to get editors from other countries come to english wikipedia and say the entire thing has a right-wing bias, the slightly left in america could be distinctly right of center to them, and of course you may find some editors from certain countries that would say wikipedia english does seem to have a left bias from their country perspective...its really a hard call to designate objectively where wikiepdia english stands right or left, <i>all depends on the relative position of the observer</i>...yet I'd say there are enough american editors, from both the american left &amp; right, to keep it teetering rather near the center, looking at it from an american perspective as the observation point...and if the teetering on ann coulters page seems to be off center, well perhaps its as near 2/3 of americans are ticked off about the Iraq War and she was a big proponent, so maybe her page isnt looked on quite as fondly as a couple years ago, and of course as time passes her opponents will have more and more stuff she has said to add from their perspective...if anything <i>wikiepdia english</i> has an american bias, it certainly doesnt have a chinese or russian bias for instance! A Bahamian bias?...no...it likely does tend toward the most internationalist of the various wikipedia language sites, with at least some contribs from a wide variety of lands and perspectives, yet the slight american bias would be the biggest tilt currently i would think...83.78.128.62 05:26, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>If your going to tell me that there arent any Ann Coulter fans that edit on this site its others that will do the laughing, she likely has about half of america counted as fans of a lesser or greater sort, so you'd basically have to say that this right of center half never edits on the Ann Coulter page...no way...<i>of course</i> there are ann coulter fans that edit on this site, and the whole paragraph was just responding to accusations of bias, so tell it to the first person! If they want to try and say wikipedia is biased, then someone can respond and say, ya sure it is, but its not quite like how you think, and if there is a bias its surely a partial american bias!-get real Ubiq!-did it say everyone editing on this page was an ann coulter fan? NO! It was even made clear that wikipedia has lots of people from both the right and left that edit and so that tends to keep pages relatively in the center somewhere...maybe next time you could <i>actually read</i> the paragraphs you are responding to Ubiq!-<a href="../../../8/3/2E/User%7E83.78.136.13.html" title="User:83.78.136.13">83.78.136.13</a> 22:12, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>in the last ten edits youve got Ubiq trying to argue people can't even call her provocative, which isn't really even a negative adjective, and you've got an editor removing "although she is known for preaching what many consider unprecedented hate" (clearly put there by someone on the left, and promptly removed by someone on the right surely!)...don't try and pretend to me Ubiq that editing wars don't occur on all politician and political personality bios on wikipedia!...That is patently false, all these types of pages are subject to constant edit wars, its why I rarely even go near them, its just a waste of my time, maybe in 50 years once they are long gone, but even then i doubt it will change! <i>This entire section was started by an editor saying the there is a bias in that leftie personalities arent given the same treatment as righties</i>, do any of you even read things??? plus it was pretty darn long!

<p>First of all she also needs a section on <i>positive reactions from publishers</i>!...quite frankly this woman is worth some serious gold, and I'm sure many a publisher would like to have her, and in that vein I think we need some statistics on how much money this little lady is making! With all those bestsellers!, <i>someone got some stats on number of books sold and how much they go for!</i>...I might not vote for a chain smoker, but I just might hire her to write a book for me as its gonna be worth some serious bucks!...I think the smoking thing does belong in here, I have heard on some blogs maybe she has stopped? we need mention of the current status of her smoking yet just a sentence or two...I also think we need a section summarizing her views, with quotes from her on all the main policy issues...&amp; sections of background and personal life should be expanded...currently there is a lot of coverage on this page about some of the controversial things she has said, I think thats OK, people on all sides want to know about these things, (plus some may actually like what she has said, and others may not) I just think for a little more balance it needs to be more clear that the bottom line is this little lady is worth a fortune and is a brilliant entertainer/writer, she has made a good living with this character she has created of "ann coulter" and as I'm not one to remove things that are valid and true that other editors to wikipedia have contributed, my proposition is not to shrink this article down to bring more balance, but instead to beef up some of the other sections like background &amp; personal life, and create a couple new ones such as 1-"positive reactions from publishers" 2-"number of books sold and earnings/book price" (plus other salary type figures if possible to find), 3-"stances on the issues" 4-"positive comments about Ann from other notable people" -<a href="../../../8/3/2E/User%7E83.78.136.13.html" title="User:83.78.136.13">83.78.136.13</a> 04:31, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>as one of my propostions on pages with edit wars, <i>at least for some of them</i>, is for the editors on both sides to back off each other <i>a little</i>, and allow the pages to expand from both viewpoints, instead of constant bickering and battling over every little entry addition, I think a lot of valid info <i>from both sides</i> may get left out when there is so much battling...<a href="../../../8/3/2E/User%7E83.78.136.13.html" title="User:83.78.136.13">83.78.136.13</a> 04:36, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>phew!...just looked it up on wikipedia, at least according to this encyclopedia it does appear that some women do have adams apples, (<i>this fan was just about to be crushed!</i>) anyways i would be willing to include a single sentence in the article about her prominent adams apple, that includes a wiki-link to the word adams apple and the fact that many critics refer to her adams apple, and the fact that women sometimes have them, and we dont really need a reference and you can just look at a picture, yet actually we can't really make a statement that she is in fact a woman, only that it appears she is a woman despite the adams apple, as we need a valid reference to state this for sure that she is a woman- I suppose something like... "Many critics refer to Ann's prominent <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam%27s_apple.html" title="Adam's apple">Adam's apple</a>, (which women sometimes do have), and sometimes insinuate that she is really a man." I would be willing to allow a statement like that-(PS: <i>this fan is still kind of paranoid</i>...I'm making a personal plea!

<p>I agree its not the most important fact, but there are indeed <i>337,000</i> entries on yahoo for that, and many many critics do bring it up, yet its not so important &amp; I don't especially care, i was just saying I wouldnt be the one to block another editor from adding it if in a reasonably worded sentence. As to recent edits by Ubiq in battle with a couple others, I'd say the both "criticism <i>and</i> praise" thing he wants in should stay, as surely she has had both from her many appearances, as to the word "provocative" I take the other side, as its not really a negative or positive word, just saying she provokes attention really, and come on, I mean its obviously true, you can be provocative and be good, or can be bad, its a rather neutral adjective describing a state of provoking thought or debate/controversy etc etc, anyone with with so many sections on controversies can surely be described as <i>provocative</i>-<a href="../../../8/5/2E/User%7E85.1.212.140.html" title="User:85.1.212.140">85.1.212.140</a> 03:21, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have nothing to do with the "criticism and praise" thing. Please get your facts straight. Her <i>viewpoints</i> are best described as "conservative". Her <i>style</i> may be described as "provocative" but again, that's a fairly descriptive word. Not Dilbert wanted to change it from "conservative viewpoints" to "provocative viewpoints" and has done so many times without bringing it up on the talk page. He/she would need to get a source to attribute that word to Coulter's <i>style</i>.

<li><i>"I think this should be in the article for the dichotomy provided. All agreed?"</i>. No, not all agreed. You would need to state a good case as to why it would be relevant, and why it would not be POV pushing or original research, before I might agree. It might be relevant and add to sourcing for the Sanchez article, however. My take on the faggot remark is that she meant it in the more generic "girlyman" way, rather than implying that Edwards is actually gay. - <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 21:45, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I actually dont live in the United States, so I'm not familiar with all their gay stars, i just know that american republicans have a bunch of gay stars on their side these days, and that they are now the hardcore pro-gay party or something, I mean, they give hardcore gay porn stars big awards at their ceremonies, the republican party has changed to <i>hardcore</i> pro-gay, they even try to keep child molestor gays in Congress, I mean, just listen to the candidates denounce Ann for even trying to make a light joke about the excessiveness of people going to psychiatric clinics for not being pro-gay, they denounce that little lady for a joke, but try and keep the child molestor people in the parliament, i mean, thats hardcore-<a href="../../../8/5/2E/User%7E85.1.212.140.html" title="User:85.1.212.140">85.1.212.140</a> 04:54, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure how my statement got turned into an adams apple debate and is she a woman debate...but here it is again...sorry for my hypocrisy kizzle for just posting the same exact thing but calling you out for it</p>
<p>First of all she also needs a section on <i>positive reactions from publishers</i>!...quite frankly this woman is worth some serious gold, and I'm sure many a publisher would like to have her, and in that vein I think we need some statistics on how much money this little lady is making! With all those bestsellers!, <i>someone got some stats on number of books sold and how much they go for!</i>...I might not vote for a chain smoker, but I just might hire her to write a book for me as its gonna be worth some serious bucks!...I think the smoking thing does belong in here, I have heard on some blogs maybe she has stopped? we need mention of the current status of her smoking yet just a sentence or two...I also think we need a section summarizing her views, with quotes from her on all the main policy issues...&amp; sections of background and personal life should be expanded...currently there is a lot of coverage on this page about some of the controversial things she has said, I think thats OK, people on all sides want to know about these things, (plus some may actually like what she has said, and others may not) I just think for a little more balance it needs to be more clear that the bottom line is this little lady is worth a fortune and is a brilliant entertainer/writer, she has made a good living with this character she has created of "ann coulter" and as I'm not one to remove things that are valid and true that other editors to wikipedia have contributed, my proposition is not to shrink this article down to bring more balance, but instead to beef up some of the other sections like background &amp; personal life, and create a couple new ones such as 1-"positive reactions from publishers" 2-"number of books sold and earnings/book price" (plus other salary type figures if possible to find), 3-"stances on the issues" 4-"positive comments about Ann from other notable people" -<a href="../../../8/3/2E/User%7E83.78.136.13.html" title="User:83.78.136.13">83.78.136.13</a> 04:31, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>as one of my propostions on pages with edit wars, <i>at least for some of them</i>, is for the editors on both sides to back off each other <i>a little</i>, and allow the pages to expand from both viewpoints, instead of constant bickering and battling over every little entry addition, I think a lot of valid info <i>from both sides</i> may get left out when there is so much battling...<a href="../../../8/3/2E/User%7E83.78.136.13.html" title="User:83.78.136.13">83.78.136.13</a> 04:36, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK, here is a start for one to be expanded upon by others...section title: "Words of praise for Ann Coulter"</p>
<p>Bill O'reilly has praised her good books sales saying "You did very well with that "Treason"...good for you!"<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,121262,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,121262,00.html" rel="nofollow">[71]</a> He has also given her mild criticism while supporting her in some of her controversies such as this one over the 9-11 widow statements "Ann Coulter should listen to me. But she doesn't listen to anyone" &amp; "In the past, I've told Ms. Coulter that using personal attacks to make ideological points is short-term gain but not long-term pain." but tempered this with "There is hypocrisy running wild in the Coulter controversy. The same media voices that embrace the smear tactics routinely used by the far-left Air America radio network and displayed daily on the nutty political blogs, are all huffy about Ms. Coulter attacking a group of 9/11 widows"<a href="http://www.billoreilly.com/site/product;jsessionid=633C326FBABEB8A983E3F63146DEA018?printerFriendly=true&amp;pid=20119&amp;said=null&amp;satype=null" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.billoreilly.com/site/product;jsessionid=633C326FBABEB8A983E3F63146DEA018?printerFriendly=true&amp;pid=20119&amp;said=null&amp;satype=null" rel="nofollow">[72]</a></p>
<p><br />
Other words of praise for Ann include<a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl/display.pperl?isbn=9781400049189&amp;view=quotes" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl/display.pperl?isbn=9781400049189&amp;view=quotes" rel="nofollow">[73]</a>:</p>
<p>“Ann Coulter is one of the fiery new breed of conservative commentators who don’t worry what the Establishment thinks of them.” —Robert D. Novak</p>
<p>“The conservative movement has found its diva.” —Bill Maher</p>
<p>“There’s nothing artificial about Ann. She has a vision of the Constitution and the government’s rightful role in our lives that is much different from the mainstream, and much different from mine, but she represents a significant constituency.” —Geraldo Rivera</p>
<p>“Ann Coulter is a pundit extraordinaire.” —Rush Limbaugh</p>
<p>“One of the twenty most <i>fascinating</i> women in politics.” —George magazine</p>
<p>In publishing, Augusta Chronicle editor Michael Ryan stated on a past controversy after dropping her column that none the less he felt "I continue to be an Ann Coulter fan" &amp; "I think her logic is devastating and her viewpoint is right most of the time." and that "Pulling Ann Coulter's column hurts but she's one of the clearest thinkers around."<a href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/7/24/195552.shtml?s=ic" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/7/24/195552.shtml?s=ic" rel="nofollow">[74]</a></p>
<p>On the other side, sometimes democratic supporters have praised Ann for her good work. Jerry Zeifman, a former chief counsel of the House Judiciary Committee has said: "As a life-long Democrat my view of myself and our party has benefited from the writings of Ann Coulter. I see her as a satirist worthy of literary praise. Coulter has a style reminiscent of the great Irish satirist Jonathan Swift who in his day was denounced by his critics for his strident ridicule of his political opponents."<a href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2006/6/12/145925.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2006/6/12/145925.shtml" rel="nofollow">[75]</a></p>
<p>Ann sometimes speaks of herself too: "I don't think I am strident. I think I speak the truth and people are attracted to that, and judging by my book sales versus those who are less strident, I think I'm doing pretty well."<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,121262,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,121262,00.html" rel="nofollow">[76]</a></p>

<dd>The proposed section reads rather thin to me. For starters, a pat on the back for book sales isn't really noteworthy praise, even from a felow news personality. I like the quite from Zeifman. The Ryan quote is good, but needs more context. Why is he saying it "hurts *but* she's one of the clearest thinkers..."? Is that a typo? Her own statements are given enough time in this article already, I think, so we probably don't need more. The idea of a positive comments section is good, but we have to be careful not to "over-balance". That is, we don't want to make it seem like half of the public comments about Coulter are positive if it's a much smaller percentage (is it? I'm honestly not sure.) -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 06:09, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd have to say its pretty relevant that she hugged a gay porn star at the confernece she is getting lambasted over, and that a gay porn star received an award from the conservative's conference, and it fits into a section detailing this latest controversy over her remark --yet I reiterate my call for some positive sections on Ann, perhaps someone wishes to paste in my above suggestion for a new section titled "<i>Words of Praise for ANN</i>", and someone should start a "Positions on the Issues" section plus mention the figures of number of books successfully sold and the total value for those books (monetary value, not literary value)-<a href="../../../8/3/2E/User%7E83.79.178.42.html" title="User:83.79.178.42">83.79.178.42</a> 05:59, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As for your ideas, a "Words of Praise" section would be a bit POV, considering there really are very few (if any) BLPs with such a section. Oftentimes words of praise are interspersed throughout the article, if they're there at all (or there may be one or two in the beginning). Making a section like that under the guise of "balancing" an article is not a legitimate reason to do it, especially if most of the praise isn't notable (lots of criticism isn't notable either). You also might want to check out the articles of other authors and see if they have financial figures for their book sales, because I'm sure the vast majority of them don't. I could definitely see a section that covers the criticism and praise of her individual books, but I think exact figures for sales of her books would be unnecessary. --<a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a> 01:25, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The following sentence has been a low-key point of dissension for a while.</p>
<p><i>Known for her controversial[3] style and unabashedly conservative/provocative views, she has been described by The Observer as "the Republican Michael Moore", and "Rush Limbaugh in a miniskirt".[4]</i></p>
<p>I'm in favor of dropping the disputed part of the sentence entirely. I think it's redundant in either version. We've said 'conservative' in the lead paragraph, so it's pointless to repeat it, and the comparisons to 'Republican Michael Moore' and 'Rush Limbaugh' reinforce it. I don't think there's enough difference between 'controversial style' and 'provocative views' to justify including them both, expecially considering the nature of the rest of the paragraph. After all, what does provocativeness provoke? It provokes controversies.</p>
<p>In my suggested version, the second paragraph reads:</p>
<p><i>Known for her controversial[3] style, she has been described by The Observer as "the Republican Michael Moore", and "Rush Limbaugh in a miniskirt".[4] Coulter has described herself as a "polemicist" who likes to "stir up the pot" and makes no pretense to be "impartial or balanced".[5]</i></p>
<p>I think that gets all the points across well, with a citation for everything, but since this has been a low-key edit-war, I thought I'd post here before changing. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Marieblasdell (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarieblasdell_7ef7.html" title="User talk:Marieblasdell">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marieblasdell_4511.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marieblasdell">contribs</a>) 17:25, 15 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd><b>Support</b>. I made a minor grammatical change, but otherwise your version looks fine. I reverted because (quite apart from the fact that the change was made either with a misleading edit summary or none), as you point out, "provocative" doesn't mean "conservative", and was redundant given the presence of "controversial".

<p>If you have a section on negative reactions you have to have a section on positive reactions, simple as that, this page is hiding the fact that she is very well thought of by many people. Most public personalities of course are afraid to make strong words of praise for her, and just privately approve, but any public comments of even light praise are entitled to be in here. To leave it to just one publisher comment and a single democratic comment is ridiculous and misleads as to her actual fan base which is in sinc with the several right leaning personalities refered to, with light words of praise for her, (as best they can manage without endangering themselves in the public eye if she gets too wacky)(if you think they are not praise then why in the heck are they included as words of praise for her book sales!!!???)(in fact many people leave their words of praise as rather ambiguous or mixed of course as they are afraid to tie themselves too strongly to her, whereas those of opposite political persuasion have less to fear about close association and can say whatever they truly feel)<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrystalizedAngels_4af9.html" title="User:CrystalizedAngels">CrystalizedAngels</a> 09:23, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS: controversial and provocative are two entirely different words. It is not at all a redundancy. They refer to two entirely different concepts. ie: One can be provocative without sparking controversy. One can be controversial with resorting to provocations. Ann in fact can be described, and is <i>accurately</i> described, as both controversial <i>and sometimes</i> provocative. Also keep in mind neither of these words implies a negative connotation, one could be controversial and provocative, and still very well liked universally for instance-<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrystalizedAngels_4af9.html" title="User:CrystalizedAngels">CrystalizedAngels</a> 09:28, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The positive comments are fully referenced, yet I will go ahead and place a reference number by each one. <i>You</i> have ignored what I have said, like it is ridiculous to have just two positive comments, one from a democrat, and one from an editor that discontinued her column. It is also <i>totally ridiculous</i> to have someones self description of themself in their intro! <i>In fact its laughable</i>. On top of this I dont see it a good thing to use an idiom in the intro as opposed to a straight forward adjective like provocative. "likes to stir up the pot"&#160;???...There are a dozen ways to interpret that, it may be worthy to include this self description of herself somewhere in the article, <i>but not in the intro</i>. There are many people who might use english wikipedia, including many non-native speakers, and english idioms, some of which even may only be known in the native english speaking community in certain areas or countries, are a bad practice to start bringing to the encyclopedia intros, even though "likes to stir up the pot" is somewhat straight forward.-<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrystalizedAngels_4af9.html" title="User:CrystalizedAngels">CrystalizedAngels</a> 22:43, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm sorry, but I am going to remove the entire section on positive comments that I added, because it is utterly ridiculous to just include the two in there now without showing the several words of minor to moderate praise she has received from fellow commentator-type people. These comments are factual, whatever comments I add are "going to be out of context" unless I add a paragraph or whole page from each person offering praise. Again I stress that the editors of this page clearly have a poor sense of how to write an NPOV biography, with contradictory things going on: like the main bulk of the article devoted to criticism without establishing that this is a very wealthy, popular figure, who has sold an enormous amount of books for a political personality, grown fabulously wealthy from that, and who is very well liked in many circles &amp; booked solid on the lecture tour. On the other hand you have the intro leading with the persons own description of herself! It is down right tacky to have a persons intro with their own description of themself, I will look around wikipedia to try and find another example of such a case. Anyways my main concern is that this page is off balanced, I am not saying to remove the copious quantity of material already devoted to her exploits and controversies and provocations, I'm not saying the editors haven't contributed a bunch of good material, what I am saying is there needs to be included some stuff from a slightly different perspective as well, I initiated one of my suggested sections, (words of praise), and it has been whittled down to being ridiculous, and a misleading poor example of where the praise for her stems from. I don't see this problem as especially coming from a liberal block or something, it seems more the case that people are just stubborn and insistent on haggling over the slightest changes, with absolutely no room for deviation from an opinion they might have about an edit, no matter how minor the edit even. To disallow the <i>clearly factual</i>, (and highly established by just reading the article), statement that she is sometimes provocative, to instead have her own description of herself in the intro, with a vague idiom none the less, I just cant fathom!-<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrystalizedAngels_4af9.html" title="User:CrystalizedAngels">CrystalizedAngels</a> 18:46, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We've gone round and round about this before and like I and others have already stated, oftentimes such praise doesn't satisfy notability and the vast majority of BLPs don't have a "praise section". I don't see anything wrong with a self-description that she likes to "stir up the pot". We're using her words, that's what encyclopedias do. We can't use "provocative" unless we have a source to attribute that word to her. I've told you this already.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And while I strongly disagree that she's as popular and loved as you think she is, how popular she really is wouldn't matter much if she makes her career out of shock and controversy. Actions/events are what get reported, and fittingly, they're in her encyclopedia article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, just because you call something "clearly factual" doesn't make it so. I'm sure there are people who would disagree that she's provocative.

I actually agreed with you (and Ramsquire) a few months ago, when it came down to it, and that's why I agreed to cut some of the sections.

<dd>It sure seemed like a personal attack. It's not so much that I had a "change of heart". I don't think I was all that stubborn or steadfast in my argumentation back then. Prior to this article, I'd not engaged in any sort of edit conflict/decision-making so I was fairly new to some of the policies.</dd>

<dd>But to remind you: When you and I argued over notability, I said notability is relative to how noted other events are and you said notability is relative to how <i>her</i> already noted events are. I remember certain arguments where you stated some of her comments can dismissed as being "Coulter" comments. I disagreed at the time, but after spending more time on wikipedia it does seem to be important to consider how much note someone generates on average in determining how notable any of their events is. I argued with Ramsquire about what sources can be considered reliable. It wasn't that I didn't "champion" notability back then, I just had different ideas of what events are notable.</dd>

<dd>In respect to the praise section proposed by Benjiwolf, many of the remarks are less notable (in that they generated less note) than the college campus speeches we cut out of this article. I think a few positive comments and praise would not hurt the article (even if they aren't incredibly notable), but it seems that if we included some, we'd have to find a way to fit them perfectly into the article, and that can be very hard to do. I'm wary of praise sections in any BLP, unless that person has genuinely gotten lots of notable praise for works/actions/etc and that they are <i>known</i> for such praise from others. I don't see Ann Coulter as one of those people though. EDIT: It seems Benjiwolf/CrystalizedAngels has gotten blocked so some of this discussion may not need to continue. --<a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a> 01:28, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see. That makes sense; you just had a different emphasis on notability back then.

<p>It is impossible to have a fair and balanced article about Ann Coulter. She is simply to polarized. If your not a fan, you probably regard her as crazy. There really isn't any middle ground with her. Most conservatives love her, liberals hate her, and even most moderates consider her way to far to the right for their tastes. Since Wikipedia attempts to give facts without opinions, the fact that almost all of her statements are deemed false by some makes keeping the article nuetral impossible. She allegedly lies, so Frankenh points it out. She claims Franken lied about her 'lies,' he claims she lying about his lying about her lying. See how impossible it is to stay nuetral? Both sides seem to work by a different set of facts, not just opinions. Which set of facts i think is reality is irrelevent to this, but I find it hard to keep my bias out of my evaluation of the article. Two sets of facts can't both be true, but by taking a side Wikipedia apparently is no longer nuetral. See the conflict? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Wikifan999 (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikifan999_63a2.html" title="User talk:Wikifan999">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wikifan999_5a2b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wikifan999">contribs</a>) 19:42, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</small></p>

<li>I'd never heard of her, and this article is still my only source of information. The same will be true of the majority of editors on Wikipedia. I confess that what I read here doesn't impress me (I don't mean the descriptions of her; I mean the rather juvenile comments that she's quoted as making), but I have no deep-seated feelings, and no preconceptions.</li>
<li>What count are verifiable sources; with those, none of the rest matters. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 20:19, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think it's very possible to have an impartial article on Ann Coulter. Just pretend she is a foreign pundit talking about a country you have no attachments to and persons you have no attachments to. Detatchment is easy to attain in temporary fashion, which is all that is required while editing/contributing to an article like this one. Pretend she's talking about different species of ants if you have to. It isn't difficult to be impartial. Darin Wagner 17:43, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
