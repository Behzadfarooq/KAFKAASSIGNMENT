<p>hmmm, i clicked on the 'what links here' box and no user pages showed. sorry.</p>
<p>i do realize it's a parody, as you can see from my comments on the 'user trusts jimbo' category. i actually posted that template to jimbo's user page (using a sock) just to see if he'd remove it, which he did. at any rate, sorry you weren't informed ... for whatever reason no one was listed as using it at the time of posting. i still think both templates &amp; categories should go; though i am considerably more offended by the brown-nosing ones. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 02:29, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sydney, hmmm. I'm thinking about taking a job at ANU, but I keep reading unhappy things about Canberra ... "soulless", "boring", "lifeless", etc. Is it really as dull as all that? I'm quite enjoying being single in San Francisco, so that kind of talk makes me nervous. Can you reasonably escape to Sydney on the weekends, or is the traffic hell?

<p>Hello Anna: I write articles about sculptors and am about to do a couple on some women sculptors - and - do you think [or feel] that it is necessary for me to include the fact that they were <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbian.html" title="Lesbian">lesbians</a>? In some ways it seems gratuitus but in other ways it seems that "outing" them is appropriate, [most of them were pretty Out as it was], that it is nothing to hide or avoid. Or, is it nobody's business? I am emailing my daughter too and am pretty comfortable letting you two decide for me [the coward's way out] Of course if you two don't agree . . . . . . . .................. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarptrash_5c7f.html" title="User:Carptrash">Carptrash</a> 15:11, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm fabrixio form south-america, i put that about individualist feminism because here in latin america and also in in Europe, there are very anarcha-feminists that are also individualists feminists. She not only put the enfassis in gender issues but in the individualists perpective of anarchism. There are many groups and anarcha-feminists with this kind of thinking and also disscussions about it.</p>
<p>But something is clear they are anti-capitalists.</p>
<p>I think wikipedia not should speaks only about U.S issues but all world. It colukd be something cultural but U.S is not the entyre world.</p>

It is in Spanish, a lot of articles about anarcha-feminism <a href="http://www.nodo50.org/mujerescreativas/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nodo50.org/mujerescreativas/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Mujeres Creativas</p>

If this is enough for you, please try to explain in that article that individualist feminism in the rest of the world is nearest from Voltairine De Cleyre than to Wendy McElroy. In other words they are anarchists and not capitalists in any way.</p>

<p>I said several times that she is indentified as a anarchist communist. It even says it on her page. She was deported under the palmer raids for being a communist. This is not a pov term. Also the section is reserved for American communists I should have noted that. Anyways thanks for your concern.</p>

<p>"Its not like lesbian anarchists regularly go onto the white pride page and demand that neo-fascism be described with their sensibilities in mind." A normal human male visiting wikipedia and asking that an article such as <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radical_Feminism_4b54.html" title="Radical Feminism">Radical Feminism</a> be modified is hardly in the same realm as you visiting a white pride page. By using such a ludicrous anallogy, you only make yourself seem completely unreasonable and unwilling to engage in free thought. Hiding behind a veil of "libertarianism" while spouting anti-male slogans makes you as much, if not more, of a "proto-fascist" than those you attempt to expose as such. You can tell me to fuck off if you like but it doesn't change the fact that I'm right. <a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEaster_rising_2031.html" title="User:Easter rising">Easter rising</a> 16:59, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see you are interested in the page, but do you agree with the actual manifesto? I read about half of it before giving up. It had some good ideas, but was far too extreme on some issues. Just wondering. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 08:48, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Golly, judging by the recent contributions to your talk page, parachute pants must be at the far back of your mind. However, you encouraged a negative-sounding contributor to make it right in Feb 06 (without contributing content on your own, I might add: pbbbt!!!;). That bastard didn't do anything positive, nor did anyone else much. I did some editing to this on my own recently, it's somewhat silly, but the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parachute_pants.html" title="Parachute pants">parachute pants</a> article has had a "casually significant" revision. Glance at it, and send me feedback if you care to. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurtyWilly_0548.html" title="User:DurtyWilly">Durty Willy</a> 06:01, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>An anonymous user has edited <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Gender_Studies_332d.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Gender Studies">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Gender_Studies</a> and has edited its aims so that it reads (the following quote is taken from the talk page):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>* Correct articles where the term 'gender' is overused, used incorrectly, or used pejoratively to pander to (what Christina Hoff-Sommers, Wendy McElroy and other more moderate feminists call) a "gender-feminist" POV.</p>
<ul>
<li>Correct articles where the term "gender" is used (without reference to NPOV dictionaries and other NPOV sources) to replace the term 'sex' as a ploy to pander to "gender"-feminist POV. <b>Correct the usages so that the proper definition is used without regard to</b> UNTESTED and often invalid 'gender theories', so distinctions can be made between 'gender' and 'sex', and so that the usage reflects some sort of NPOV take on a highly loaded term. Just because some widely criticized academic fields have used totalitarian tactics to force 'gender' and censor the usage of 'sex', in US humanities programs is no indication of the validity of this politically-loaded term. Consult NPOV sources such as dictionaries, opponents of "gender"-feminists and NPOV mass media sources to balance 'gender' POV with 'sex' POV.</li>
<li>Correct articles where the term 'gender' is being used gynocentrically as a front for 'oppression'-feminist political, legal or cultural power plays. For example, in <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">feminism</a> (Status) there is no mention that for the male 'gender', military mortality is 98% compared to 2% for the female 'gender' (in Iraq)...but other forms of far less serious female "gender" oppression are implicated (covertly and most disengenously) as having something to do with the gender "oppression" of women. This kind of blatant, gynocentric "gender" bias is no less POV than the other forms listed here.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Said user has further edited the talk page suggesting that (the following quote is taken from the talk page):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I suspect this project was created to pander to the points of view of <b>misandric, gender-ginning, 'patriarchal oppression' feminists (please see <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women%27s_studies.html" title="Women's studies">Women's studies</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misandry.html" title="Misandry">misandry</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">feminism</a> ) who use the term 'gender' as a cunning, covert, and blatantly gynocentric weapon of war.</b> Many other more moderate feminists and non-feminists have challenged these blatantly gynocentric, and often misandric "gender feminist" ideologies. I insist on a non-sexist, non-'genderist', non-reverse sexist project...otherwise this project is just the usual type of cunning totalitarian tactic we see so much in other politically correct channels. To revert the above content just because none of the orginal authors of this project page like it is a POV stunt to have ones cake and eat it too. I am going to reinsert the content. I insist that before it is reverted again good NPOV reasons be provided. My aim here is some kind of GENUINE non-sexist, non-reverse sexist, and non-'genderist' NPOV...as may be shown well in <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexism.html" title="Sexism">Sexism</a> (drop in editor) 00:37, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea that the term <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender.html" title="Gender">gender</a> (that is, the idea that at least some of the differences between the roles of men and women in society) is socially constructed, yet 'sex' (i.e. that any differences between men and women are essentially biological), at the very least, looks like misogyny|misoginist]] POV bias of the worst kind. Any assistance arguing against the point would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi AnAn, I'm asking a few <a href="../../../g/s/_/WP%7EGS_dea7.html" title="WP:GS">Project gender studies</a> members for opinions on a few changes to the project templates. The discussion is <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Gender_Studies_d57d.html#new_userboxes_for_project" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Gender Studies">here</a>. If you're interested have a look. I'd also like to have the project page unprotected so it could be editted to give due balance to the Gender Theory activities of the project as well as the removal of systemic bias activities - what are your opinions (<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Gender_Studies_d57d.html#I.27m_confused" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Gender Studies">discussed here</a>)?--<a href="../../../c/a/i/User%7ECailil_97aa.html" title="User:Cailil">Cailil</a> 18:54, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
