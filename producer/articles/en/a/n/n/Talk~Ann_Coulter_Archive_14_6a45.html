<p>She is far from self-described as a public intellectual. She was heavily covered in a book about public intellectuals a few years back. she was definitely in the top 100.

<dd>I remember that too. By the way El Kevbo, I think you are the one who asked for a citation? The "public intellectual" comment comes from the <i>Time</i> magazine cover story piece by Cloud. Except it's not a direct quotation. Cloud says something like "Coulter sees herself as a public intellectual". 216.165.199.50 05:49, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Registration and Voting / Innuendo and Libel</span></h2>
<p>Somebody needs to rewrite the "Registration and Voting" stuff, since it's outdated and based on innuendo. Somebody could/should get in big trouble over it. Wikipedia says Coulter "is under investigation." The source of this is a gossip column (see its URL) that says officials are "reportedly investigating." I wouldn't want to explain the difference to a judge in a libel case. The next part says the officials gave her 30 days to explain. That was seven months ago (&gt;210 days). Yet this "encyclopedia" still says "is". The judge would have a fit. Not to mention that the cited source is no longer available unless you pay for it. I'm not paying, and I don't trust that it says what Wikipedia says it does (see above for the reason). Also, what does the minor age dispute in the third paragraph have to do with alleged improper conduct in registration and voting? <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_Cop_4c9d.html" title="User:Good Cop">Good Cop</a> 01:07, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>What did you think of my fix, Good Cop? Any suggestions would be welcome. Let me say this, though, the articles (the free ones) form a coherent story. I also read somewhere that Coulter got legal assistance from somewhere. But there was no "allegation" in this episode yet, just an investigation, and I changed the article to reflect that. 216.165.199.50 05:43, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Removed reference to the political party of the election official who is investigating Coulter, it's not relevant to the article.</p>
<dl>
<dd><s>I can't be bothered checking through the history but from memory, there was a dispute as to whether the was born in 1961 or 1963. Given when she first voted, if she was born in 1963, she would have been breaking the law in the US. I believe this was the relevance between the age dispute and voting <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 17:05, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</s></dd>
<dd>Actually it's still in the article. Basically, she registered to vote in 1980 supposedly. But it's unclear if she were born in 1963 or 1961. In the US state where she registered to vote, the voting age is 18. Therefore, if she were born in 1963, she would be 17 at most in 1980 and would have broken the law if she voted (and I guess if she registered to vote) <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 17:09, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Canada and Vietnam/Indochina (again)</span></h2>
<p>Once again people want to include this in the article. As usual, they are newbies, semi-anons, and other types who aren't very familiar with the article. The Canada matter has been discussed at great length, and consensus reached to eliminate it. Look <a href="../../../a/n/n/Talk%7EAnn_Coulter_Archive_13_083e.html#Crooksandliars.com" title="Talk:Ann Coulter/Archive 13">HERE</a> to see a lot of the most recent discussion. At one time, all the links and explanations of these matters were in the article, but then the whole silly business was removed, the links and explanations along with it.</p>
<p>If you doubt that Canada sent troops to Vietnam/Indochina during a time when the borders in that area were in a state of flux, please read the article on <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Control_Commission_3100.html" title="International Control Commission">International Control Commission</a> (it will help if you follow the links). If you still doubt that Canada sent troops, it may help you to look <a href="http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=collections/cmdp/mainmenu/group06/icmic" class="external text" title="http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=collections/cmdp/mainmenu/group06/icmic" rel="nofollow">HERE</a> to see the medal that Canada awarded to them for their service.</p>

<dd>Those are non-combat troops deployed via the UN. Saying that Canada sent fighting troops to Vietnam is like saying that whenever an American volunteer for the WHO goes to a country, the US has sent troops there. Coulter was incorrect in her statement, the only non-neutral, fighting Canadian troops in Vietnam were sent as part of the US army. 71.166.50.200 20:22, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I see there is you attempting to whitewash her comment. She clearly did not know what she was talking about, and no one has yet provided a cintilla of evidence that Canada sent one fighting soldier to vietnam. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 21:13, 4 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think her comments are white washed enough. Canada did send non-fighting soldiers, and Canadians joined the American army to fight. Also, it should be noted that Canada officialy was totaly against the war and allowed American draft dodgers to get refugee status, showing that the Canadian legal system comsidered the Vietnam War to be unjust. --67.70.2.252 16:07, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Additionally, Coulter's statement (that Canada sent troops to Vietnam) might be true in its most literal, least meaningful sense (in that more than one - and not very many more - troops in the Canadian army were physically present in Vietnam during the time period); however, her comment was clearly intended to convey that she believes they sent sizeable numbers of troops to fight there. Claiming that she meant otherwise is (at best) intellectually dishonest. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 21:17, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It would really be helpful if someone could show the rest of us how "fighting soldier" applies to this incident, and if someone could point out specifically what would make anyone think that she "clearly intended to convey that she believes they sent sizeable numbers of troops to fight there." The facts of Canada's troops in Vietnam/Indochina stand on their own. Confident assertions about Ann Coulter's thought processes do not. And I do not appreciate assertions about "whitewashing;" please try hard to assume the good faith that underlies bringing out the facts about Canada's troops in Vietnam. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 15:21, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The issue is NOT whether Canada sent troops to Vietnam. The issue IS whether the facts of the paragraph are accurate, which they are. If Coulter was shown to be correct, then by all means add sourced information to the paragraph to that effect. But don't effectively deny that the exchange between Coulter and McKeown occurred by deleting the paragraph, which contains accurate quotes. I wrote the paragraph, not to prove Coulter right or wrong. I wrote it because the events occurred, and the section title is "<b>Allegations</b> of plagiarism and factual inaccuracy." <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWard3001_c2d6.html" title="User:Ward3001">Ward3001</a> 21:27, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

The point is the entire section is utterly non-notable. Wikipedia biographies should not be lists of factual errors. Especially in biographies of living persons. Even if you look at a highly odious person like <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam_Hussein_75a3.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> you don't see his article detailing every factual error he has ever said or written. That seems solely resident in articles about controversial political pundits. Litanies of errors are simply not what encyclopedic articles are for.

<li>There is a memorial in southwest Quebec honoring the approximately 5,000 Canadians who fought in Vietnam, it's on Hwy 132 between Beauharnois and Valleyfield, north side of the road. If it would be helpful, I can snap a photo the next time I am by it, and upload it. There is also mention in Wilbur Morrison's book <i>The Elephant and the Tiger</i>, of about fifty Mohawks from the Khanawake reservation (just across the Mercier bridge from Montreal) who served in Vietnam. I am acquainted with one of them who lost most of a hand in combat. I also know a retired Kirkland (Montreal) policeman who served in Vietnam during the early advisory period. I don't think that any of them were there technically under the Canadian flag though, but were volunteers who served with American forces. www.thevirtualwall.org allows searches of The Wall database by different parameters, such as home town, etc., and quite a few Canadians can be found listed on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. - <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 15:43, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm just pointing out that it is a fact that Canadians fought and died alongside of Americans in Vietnam, which I can verify with some effort. They were not sent by the Canadian government, but were volunteers who I believe were fighting under the American flag. I'll let you all hash out whether or not it is notable enough for inclusion, I just wanted to make sure that the Canadians who sacrificed on the behalf of the US for the freedom of the Vietnamese people were not dismissed or swept under the rug in this discussion. - <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 17:13, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Crockspot - Oops! I seem to have misdirected my above comment. Sorry. It was meant for Ward and whoever else keeps reinserting the Canadian TV interview. There is no doubt that many Canadians served in the U.S. armed forces during the Vietnam War, and no intention by me to diminish their role there. (Neither is there any doubt that the government of Canada had troops in Vietnam/Indochina from August 1954 through January 1973.) <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 19:52, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ward, you keep reverting (three times now), and you haven't responded to the charges of non-notability established a long time ago, and rehearsed again here. As for Coulter's response, <a href="http://www.cbcwatch.ca/?q=node/view/936" class="external text" title="http://www.cbcwatch.ca/?q=node/view/936" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is the interview. And is it really fair to make us presume your non-reasoned claim to notability is correct, and insist that we do the leg-work of making a capsule summary of the reasoning about notability and Coulter's point of view from the arguments, when the arguments have been archived exactly for the purpose of educating new-comers about the work of their predecessors? I think it would be more fair if you would read the archives, make an argument and <i>then</i> revert. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.154.26.251.html" title="User:64.154.26.251">64.154.26.251</a> 19:10, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This event is not notable for a biography.</li>
<li>Canadians participated in the Vietnam War.</li>
<li>The Canadian government <i>did not</i> send troops to Vietnam, as the phrase "Canada sent troops to Vietnam" uttered by Coulter means.</li>
<li>Raul is spot-on: simply stating that Coulter was right because technically speaking, there were Canadian citizens who were participating in the war is intellectually dishonest at best. I agree with you Lou, assertations about Coulter's thought processes are inappropriate for Wikipedia. Consequently, she might have meant to say "Canadians participated in Vietnam" rather than "Canada sent troops to Vietnam" (which is clearly a different meaning), but it is inappropriate for us to defend Coulter as what she "really meant to say". --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 09:11, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Additionally, for some reason, a few editors insist on believing that Canada "did not send troops to Vietnam" (perhaps they believe the erroneous assertion of the broadcaster, instead of the well-documented historical facts). <b>Canadian troops were sent to Vietnam in August 1954 as peacekeepers during the partition of Vietnam. They stayed through January 1973. They were Canadian troops, sent by the Canadian government. They incurred casualties and at least one death.</b> For further information, please read the articles on <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Control_Commission_3100.html" title="International Control Commission">International Control Commission</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Commission_of_Control_and_Supervision_1d72.html" title="International Commission of Control and Supervision">International Commission of Control and Supervision</a> (it will help if you follow the links).

<dd>Wow, 1,550 people got medals for "90 days consecutive or non-consecutive service as a member of the commission"? That's <i>almost</i> as hard to get as a purple heart (translation: these medals have nothing to do with combat). The part where you equate <i>non-combat</i> "peacekeepers" with combat troops is what Raul and I are talking about when we say intellectually dishonest (and trying to pass off non-combat participatory medals as more than they are). Canadians were there to "supervise the cease-fire, the withdrawal of troops, the dismantlement of military bases, the activity at ports of entry and the return of captured military personnel and foreign civilian", <b>not engage in combat</b>. Like I said, she might have made a verbal gaffe and meant to say "Canadian peacekeepers were technically present during the Vietnam War, albeit in a non-combat manner" (which is a far cry from "Canada sent troops to Vietnam"), but, as you say, "confident assertions about Ann Coulter's thought processes do not" belong here.

<dd>Coulter is notable for, <i>inter alia</i>, having "[a]llegations of ... factual inaccuracy" made against her -- thus the existence of this section of her article. The CBC bit is an instance of this -- and rather a better example of it than some of the others. Beyond that, it is given from a neutral point of view; it is not <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html#Biased_or_malicious_content" title="WP:BLP">"biased or malicious content"</a> at all.

Even Coulter herself does not, that I have seen, attempt to claim she was right on such a basis.) -- Lonewolf BC 18:53, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lonewolf BC: IMHO you have not provided clear evidence that this incident is relevant to Coulter's notability. Many besides me have studied the incident at length and in depth, and have concluded that it not notable. I hope you don't think that Wikipedia should include every instance of someone alleging factual inaccuracy. This incident was a short interview on an obscure program; the disagreement about troops was a minor one, and subject to many interpretations that have been discussed at length on this page. The incident did not receive any sort of important media coverage. Past consensus was that the incident is not notable. It hasn't gotten any more notable in recent months. If you have something to say to counter these points, you will get a fair hearing here.</dd>

<dd>In the context of discussion, especially with Coulter's followup before she was <i>corrected</i> by McKeown: "Was Vietnam less containable and more of a threat...", troops meant "a group of soldiers" or "military units" as the definition of "troop" means. If she meant to say "non-combat peacekeepers", she sure messed up the phrase. I don't need to ask my teachers about it, I'm a big grown boy now and out of school! For Lonewolf's <strike>assertion</strike> perception of Coulter's view that "Canada sent troops to fight in support of the United States," I'm surprised you're not grasping onto that justification with both hands gripped tightly, as that's the best though (highly) charitable interpretation where Coulter is not wrong, as there technically were Canadians (that were <i>not <b>sent</b> by the Canadian government</i>) who signed up in the United States Army to fight in Vietnam. Finally, your silence on your error in ICSC's "token" (according to their own website) participation (and no participation after 1969) is noted. My teacher didn't even need to show me that one. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 20:54, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Before I make additional changes to the article, I propose that we try to come to a consensus about selecting one of these two possibilities:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. Include information about the Canada-Vietnam issue as it was most recently presented, with the understanding that information about Coulter's response might need to be edited. OR,</dd>
<dd>2. Delete ALL information about "factual inaccuracies" (no changes to information about plagiarism) and re-title the section "Allegations of plagiarism."</dd>
</dl>
<p>My rationale is that, if the Canada-Vietnam issue does not rise to the level of notability, then none of the "factual inaccuracy" issues rise to that level. Note, however, (and this is not a veiled threat, just an observation; I have no intention of making other deletions), deletion of non-notable material opens up the possibility that other sections of the Coulter article might be challenged on the basis of non-notability. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWard3001_c2d6.html" title="User:Ward3001">Ward3001</a> 00:12, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I definitely agree with your line of reasoning. Reading this article it is pretty clear there are some striking POV and notability issues. I have never seen a bio of a writer with a list of "factual inaccuracies." I realize she is a total lightning rod for controversy but its a bit much the way it is now. I would say that no factual inaccuracies should be included unless they somehow caused a situation more notable than being a mistake or play into some larger event. The WP is not a clearinghouse for pointing out inaccuracies in writing no matter how disliked the author may be. I just don't see "Misspelling the name 'Feldt" as "Febit'" as a notable item.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have gone ahead and added a POV tag to the article. From reading through the talk page it is pretty clear I am not the only editor that thinks this is warranted. --<a href="../../../r/t/r/User%7ERtrev_b641.html" title="User:Rtrev">Rtrev</a> 00:35, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Canada interview is not notable. Coulter is a writer, and if some of her writing is legitimately challenged for accuracy, it might possibly be notable. A factual challenge of what a writer said during a television interview is very, very, very far from being notable in itself. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_Cop_4c9d.html" title="User:Good Cop">Good Cop</a> 01:46, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looking at the other "factual inaccuracy" stuff, the Franken challenge and the Dale Earnhardt matter seem to be notable, since they were widely discussed over time. The Reagan percentage business doesn't seem to be notable -- it is a mildly disputed minor fact. The iThenticate stuff isn't notable at all (some nobody alleged plagiarism, the allegations were investigated and dismissed by a responsible non-nobody publisher, and the story ended there). The Media Matters stuff was about same -- a minor muckraker made allegations and nothing came of it anywhere else. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_Cop_4c9d.html" title="User:Good Cop">Good Cop</a> 01:46, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For this specific issue, I don't see it as that notable, but I see nothing wrong with a one sentence blurb about it, but I'm not really partial either way. As for Media Matters, it may be partisan but it's a legitimate source, especially considering the ease of meeting the verification criteria; most articles are based upon transcripts or video clippings from actual news sources, thus any reader can go lookup the transcript themselves to see whether or not the claim is true. If it were up to me, I'd much rather see a paragraph or so saying something that "occasionally," Coulter has been accused of factual inaccuracy, go <i>briefly</i> through iThenticate, Coulter and CBC, the other examples, but making sure to consolidate and keep to one paragraph or so with nice prose while making sure to represent that in most cases, nothing came from it. I'd rather have a limit otherwise we get into discussions like the title of this section with people bending over backwards to justify or discredit Coulter's claims. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 08:31, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It seems we now have several choices regarding "factual inaccuracies":
<dl>
<dd>1. Select which items are notable enough to be included.</dd>
<dd>2. Revert the section back to its status on Nov. 3 WITHOUT the paragraph about the Canada-Vietnam issue.</dd>
<dd>3. Revert the section back to its status on Nov. 3 WITH the addition of the paragraph about the Canada-Vietnam issue as it was last written.</dd>
<dd>4. Eliminate all items related to factual inaccuracies and retitle the section "Allegations of plagiarism."</dd>
<dd>5. Write a briefer summary of the factual inaccuracy issues.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I think option 1 is difficult because there are many different opinions about notability. I think option 5 will likely appear biased because of space limitations and, consequently, omission of important information regarding either the allegations, or Coulter's responses, or both. But if someone wants to try writing a briefer version of the section I certainly would consider its merits. I continue to believe, however, that we should select either option 3 or option 4 because I don't consider any of the alleged inaccuracies to be any more notable than the others.</dd>
<dd>Regarding plagiarism, I consider the plagiarsm issue important enough that it should be restored to the article. If the factual inaccuracy issues are retained, I think plagiarism should be placed in a separate section because the two issues are quite different. Think back to your undergrad days in English classes. If you put a few factual inaccuracies in your paper, you could be graded down. Plagiarize and you could be kicked out of school. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWard3001_c2d6.html" title="User:Ward3001">Ward3001</a> 19:39, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think the cleaned-up article is fine the way it is. Thanks to whatever hero did it. The remaining factual inaccuracy stuff is sufficient, IMHO, to illustrate that she has been accused of inaccuracies and that she has answered the accusations. In the case of Franken, she defended her facts. In the case of Earnhardt, she admitted her error and her publisher corrected it. Both instances were notable, in that they received widespread coverage in a variety of media.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The other "inaccuracy" stuff that was cleaned out was non-notable finger-pointing, not at all suitable to a biographical article in an encyclopedia. The plagiarism assertions were investigated by her large and reputable publisher and found to be groundless (and therefore not notable, IMHO).</dd>

<dd>I think an important point about this that is being missed here is that this comment and the ensuing controversy is, so far, essentially the only significant publicity Coulter has gotten in Canada at all. Those of us who follow American news know of her, and that's a substantial fraction. But for many people she was merely some American who came on Canadian television and made absurdly false claims.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I should say that, to one relatively familiar with the Canadian perspective on the Vietnam War (as much as someone born after it can be), these comments bringing up Canadian citizens enlisting in the U.S. army or the non-aligned Canadian peacekeeping force in Vietnam seem very much like apologetics for Coulter. Frankly, she was wrong, and I simply don't understand how this can be disputed. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 09:32, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Allan Colmes asked her nothing of the sort; instead he attacked her, accusing her of making the statements on the basis of being a closet liberal!</p>
<p>If you can't watch it, here is my summary of the exchange:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Alan Colmes mentioned Salem's claim, and said to her that remarks like saying "<a href="../../../t/i/m/Timothy_McVeigh_0621.html" title="Timothy McVeigh">Timothy McVeigh</a> should have bombed <i>The New York Times</i> building" were "laughable happy satires, right?" then said he now realized that Coulter was "actually a liberal who is doing this to mock and parody the way conservatives think." She responded, "Well, it's not working very well if that were my goal. I think the Timothy McVeigh line was merely prescient after The New York Times has leapt beyond -- beyond nonsense straight into treason, last week," Coulter replied (referring to a Times report that revealed classified information about an anti-terrorism program of the U.S. Government involving surveillance of international financial transactions of persons suspected of having Al-qaida links). Alan Colmes continued in this sarcastic vein when he responded, calling her remarks "great humor", and that it "belongs on Saturday Night Live. It belongs on The Daily Show."</dd>
</dl>
<p>The "account", if you can call it that, even contains the made-up detail that Colmes said "especially if reporters were inside."</p>
<p>And whoever included the "account" apparently plagiarized large sections of the <i>E&amp;P</i> article, then went on to make "improvements" like having Salem "saying" Coulter was a brilliant satirist, rather than "suggested".

<p>I don't have time, right now, but does Coulter actually "periodically wish death and violence on liberals and other traitors", as the plagiarized version now reads? I don't recall Coulter calling all liberals traitors in the first place, and she said she refused to name any traitors, except one, Pinch Sulzberg. If anyone would like to help, jump right in. It should be easy if we can dismiss <i>Editor &amp; Publisher</i> as an unreliable source as the two internet copies of the article would suggest that we can. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.154.26.251.html" title="User:64.154.26.251">64.154.26.251</a> 02:27, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It definitely wasn't Newsmax.

<p>Unless there are some strong objections, I propose to make the following changes to the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ann Coulter was born to John Vincent Coulter <s>(born 1926)</s> and Nell Husbands Martin Coulter<s>, (born February 28, 1928, Paducah, Kentucky)</s>.</dd>

</dl>
<p>The purpose of the change is to bring it in line with other biographies by removing non-notable material. I looked at a bunch of biographies of people with notability similar to or greater than Coulter's, and didn't find any that went beyond parents' names and occasionally their place of residence.

<dd>I mostly agree. Leave "...and her two older brothers...", though, as it says something about the family circle in which she was raised.

<p>I think that her age discrepancy might merit brief mention in the article, but I'm not sure where it should be or how it should be stated. The facts are that there is some question whether she was born in 1961 or 1963, with 1961 being probable due to an early driver's license and voter registration. The discrepancy has had minor media coverage, so is therefore minorly notable, IMHO. On the other hand, it isn't uncommon for entertainers, sports figures, women, etc. to tell their publics that they are younger than they really are (<i>e.g.</i> <a href="../../../z/s/a/Zsa_Zsa_Gabor_6ede.html" title="Zsa Zsa Gabor">Zsa Zsa Gabor</a>).

<dd>Encyclopedias do not put about proven falsehoods as if they ought be taken seriously any longer. Her year of birth is a matter of fact, and it was 1961. There <i>was</i> some question about it.

<p>Lou Sander got rid of <strike>all</strike> one of the reports of Ann's dating partners. He says they're not sourced well (which I disagree with) and says the article is not a gossip tabloid. Ann's dating doesn't interest me personally, but I'm sure it interests some people. In general, I'm reluctant to remove what I see to be good faith contributions to the article, but I agree with Lou somewhat about limiting the scope of the article to significant information. Coulter herself doesn't seem to mind people discussing it (in the "Coultergeist" article she says "I've dated [Dinesh D'Souza], I've dated every right-winger").</p>
<p>I'd like to know what Lou and the rest of the editors think about this. 216.165.199.50 18:38, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry Lou, I assumed you removed both persons from the article because of your edit description.

<dd>No problem. I followed the references and didn't see D'Souza or even a mention of pay-to-see. For Guccione, I didn't think an "arm candy" discussion in a gossipy place was suitable backup for the claim that she "dated" somebody.</dd>

<dd>As a basic proposition, I'm not very much in favor of "personal" sections in encyclopedias.

It came back, and wasn't worth going through a lot of stuff to get rid of, at least for me.

<dd>Thanks for finding a few entertainment personalities whose articles mention dating. Now give us a bit of explanation about how Coulter's "dating" relates to her notability. (Try something like this: Jennifer Lopez is a popular singer. The "relationships" of popular singers are important parts of their public images. Their handlers and publicists try hard to keep those things in the public eye.

<p>If you read the quote in that section, she is anti-evolution, but she is not a supporter of either Creationism or Intelligent Design.

<dd>IMHO, she doesn't belong in either category. She's not any sort of main supporter or promoter of either belief. Like hundreds of other authors, she has written on the topics, but in her case they were only used to illustrate a not-very-closely-related point: that liberal beliefs are religious in nature. Look at the other articles in those categories. With a few mostly hard-to-justify exceptions, they are about people who had major writings or major interests in the field.</dd>

<dd>It would be interesting to see some reasoned justification for her inclusion in the categories.

<li>Ann Coulter defends <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irreducible_Complexity_663b.html" title="Irreducible Complexity">Irreducible Complexity</a>, a cornerstone of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_Design_39cd.html" title="Intelligent Design">Intelligent Design</a>: <i>At least we finally had a clear admission that the irreducible complexity argument had not been answered before this. But look at the allegedly "complex" mechanism that scientists asserted -- not proved, asserted -- might have arisen by natural selection: a two-part molecular mechanism, the hormone and its receptor. Two parts! Even a mousetrap -- Behe's simplest example of a complex mechanism -- has three parts. And, of course, they still hadn't shown that the hormone-receptor pair could be produced by natural selection, only that this simple two-part mechanism might be produced by natural selection. That's front page news for the state religion.</i> Pgs 209-210.</li>
<li>Coulter cites Intelligent Design Advocates: <i>I couldn't have written about evolution without the generous tutoring of Michael Behe, David Berlinski, and William Dembski, all of whom are fabulous at translating complex ideas, unlike liberal arts types, who constantly force me to the dictionary to relearn the meaning of quotidian.</i></li>
<li>Coulter also endorses Behe's viewpoint: "[l]ife at the molecular level, he [Behe] concluded, is a loud, clear, piercing cry of design."</li>

<p>Does anyone still doubt that Coulter advocates Intelligent Design? Now whether Wikipedia protocol requires her to be notable <i>for advocating intelligent design</i> to be included as a member of the category I'm not sure, I'm just refuting earlier comments such as "She's not any sort of main supporter or promoter of either belief" and "she is not a supporter of either Creationism or Intelligent Design. She is agnostic on the issues, calling the questioned raised 'unanswerable'." Of course no one claims to know the answer to life, but given the evolution/creationism(intelligent design) dicothomy, it is crystal clear on what side she places her faith in. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 04:02, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, in other words she has written a book in which her support for ID -- which is nought but a guise of Creationism -- features prominently.

<dd>It is really, really, really difficult to see how writing a single book that prominently features Creationism/ID, but is not ABOUT Creationism/ID, puts one in the same category as those whose work is all, or mainly, about that subject. She wrote about it once in a book. The entire discussion took four chapters. The book was about liberal "religious" beliefs. The four chapters were about liberal "religious" beliefs in Darwinism, and used Creationism/ID for purposes of comparison and contrast. They did not involve new theories about Creationism/ID, but only described the work and theories of others.</dd>

<li>Coulter doesn't <i>defend</i> Irreducible Complexity in the paragraph you have just cited, she <i>attacks</i> certain scientists who are defenders of a natural selection theory simply for not answering the arguments contained in Irreducible Complexity, and then again for only offering only a weak reproof. Her observations in your example have much more to with the manner in which certain scientists engage the issues, rather than the issues themselves. If that accidentally causes someone to lean towards the theory of advocates who are less discredited, that doesn't make Coulter herself an advocate of a particular explanation.</li>
<li>Coulter "cites Intelligent Design advocates". I never said Coulter didn't consider the merits of opposing arguments in the question of how life began. In the first paragraph you list, she also "cites" advocates of evolution.</li>
<li>Coulter doesn't <i>endorse</i> Behe in the paragraph you have cited, she merely quotes him.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>You seem to missing the point. Coulter is taking the role of an intelligent juror on the issue of how life came to be on Earth, not an advocate. She shares with her audience the arguments she has diminished in her own esteem as a result of her own reasoning as contradictory, weak or unproven. And she is like an alternate juror rather than one called on to judge, because she has declined to render a final decision. Just like "agnostic" in its more common sense is understood as undecided between various forms of theism as well as atheism, Coulter regards herself as agnostic, being undecided among the various explanations for life on earth, all the while not regarding them all equally persuasive. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.154.26.251.html" title="User:64.154.26.251">64.154.26.251</a> 20:01, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ol>
<li>By <strike>including the passage in her book</strike>including the passage with a sympathetic tone while treating evolution arguments with a critical tone, she's expressly supporting the viewpoint; you really can't tell me that she's just regurgitating two viewpoints without prejudice for either side. If you actually disagree with that, then we'll just be talking past each other.</li>
<li>Right, but there is clearly a sympathetic tone to the ID people she "cites" whereas the evolutionists she "cites" is met with a critical to the point of dismissive line of querying.</li>
<li>Umm, that's what supporting means. She's citing an expert to <i>support</i> her own argument. You don't think she's just writing a historical narrative on the evolution/creationism debate, she's advancing her own argument and using what she considers "expert" advice to bolster her case. Once again, if you really think she's not taking sides, then we're just going to be talking past each other.</li>

<p>"Taking the role of an intelligent juror on the issue of how life came to be on Earth," I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about, as well as "she has diminished in her own esteem", or what exactly an "alternate juror" does in your legal analogy. I don't know what to say except we're reading the same passages, but somehow where I see an apple, you see an orange. My personal belief is that it is absolutely incontravertible that she is advocating an anti-evolution pro-ID argument (especially considering she thanks all ID "scientists" and no evolution scientists in her book), but while you're not entitled to your own facts, you're entitled to your own opinion. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 21:45, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So she sympathizes in certain respects. If a juror has sympathy for a defendant, does that make her the defendant's advocate in his case that he's not guilty? Since you have difficulty with analogies, this is analogous to Coulter having sympathy for certain points of an argument, expressing that fact, but not going so far as to advocate the viewpoint.</dd>

<dd>None of it, I'm on the same page, Lou. I think this is more off-topic. 64, your first assumption taken within a vacumn is true, but not after reading Coulter's words on the matter, especially the lengths through which she criticizes evolution arguments and sympathasizes/regurgitates ID arguments while citing ID "scientists" to help her case. We know several things, that evolution and creationism/ID are mutually exclusive, that Coulter doesn't believe in evolution, that Coulter thanked only ID scientists for their viewpoints, and that the passages in question are critical of evolution and supportive of ID. If you look at all these premises and conclude that she is not supporting ID in her book and arguing against evolution, then there's nothing I can say further to convince you otherwise. Your second assumption is simply false: if you agree with, endorse, and use an ID argument by an ID "scientist" to support your argument, you are, in fact, espousing that belief as well. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 01:46, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Coulter may have contradicted her expressed view that she doesn't take an interest on the details how life on earth came about, but you have presented no such evidence that she did. And we don't "know" that evolution and ID are mutually exclusive; there are many who embrace both. And as I said, the support or "endorsement" she herself (not through quoting <i>others</i>) gave to Intelligent Design in your example would only have been accidently bestowed: through someone negatively assessing, along with her, her report of the means by which the evolutionary scientist presented his case! I don't think I need to add, except perhaps to you, that one merely agreeing with particular details of a position or presenting the position at some length means that one has a prior or posterior intention of championing that position. I agree with Lou that Coulter is not an important person in the fields of creationism or intelligent design, and Coulter's expressed lack of interest in the matter indicates she is not even a non-important advocate. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.154.26.251.html" title="User:64.154.26.251">64.154.26.251</a> 03:43, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Evolution and ID are mutually exclusive... irreducible complexity, a cornerstone of ID, is simply not congruent with the basic concepts of natural selection through mutations: evolution fundamentally asserts that the complexity of organisms originates from a process of natural selection through periodic advantageous mutations in offspring whereas ID fundamentally asserts that this complexity <i>does not originate from natural selection or advantageous mutations</i> but from an intelligent designer, therefore they are, in fact, mutually exclusive, as their fundamental assertions cannot both be true. Once again, Coulter specifically expressed that she belives that "evolution doesn't exist." She uses ID arguments and only thanks ID "scientists", while at the same time being critical of the basic concepts of evolution. I have no idea what "one has a prior or posterior intention of championing that position" means, as once they have agreed with (and <i>not</i> merely cited) a position (i.e. "evolution doesn't exist") and used it to support their own arguments, then they have expressed that position themselves. Like I said, you may be free to your opinion, but not your own facts. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 04:03, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>(copied from above to remain germane to the topic)</i> Whether a category <i>ought be</i> on Wikipedia is a matter quite apart from who belongs in a category that <i>is</i> on Wikipedia. <i>If</i> Wikipedia had those categories then Coulter would belong in them (assuming that the said allegation has been made), but that's really neither here nor there. Coulter's support for creationism has become fairly notorious, and the facts that she is not known <i>foremostly</i> as a creationist, and that she is not one of the <i>foremost</i> creationists, take nought away from the substantial notice she <i>has</i> gained as such. But this "notability" business is being mis-used, anyhow: In Wikipedia, it is really just a criterion for whether articles should exist, unless I am much mistaken. -- Lonewolf BC 01:19, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's what I mean... yes, Coulter believes in ID, yes there is a category that goes along with this, but taking a cursory look at <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_tutorial_6edc.html#Categorisation" title="Wikipedia:NPOV tutorial">Wikipedia:NPOV_tutorial#Categorisation</a>, which states:

<dd>I doubt that I would stick IDer or Creationist as one of the top 5 descriptors for Ann Coulter, especially considering much more appropriate ones as American author, Conservative, NYT Best-selling Author, Media Personality, etc. (along with a few choice inappropriate categories I'd love to stick on as well). --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 03:48, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It looks to me like there is very little of her mainstream work in the article, and a super amount of criticism. Not balanced at all. Where what she actually says and writes is included, it seems to be chosen because somebody else has criticized it.

<dd>The discussion of her work is supposed to be in the daughter articles about her books. I myself have only looked at two of them recently. <i>High Crimes and Misdemeanors</i> contained some old false reports that Coulter was accused of plagiarism. Not by any recognized responsible journal she wasn't. I removed the reference. What's left is a half-baked summary of the book. <i>Godless</i> had a sort of report added by Ed Poor, I believe, which was added to a long (blog-sourced) attack on Coulter and Intelligent Design with which Felonious Monk had filled the page beforehand. At this point, I don't think it would take too much time for someone to go to the library and open up <i>Book Review Digest</i>. As to whether there would be any intelligent reviews found there is anybody's guess. 216.165.199.50 01:45, 16 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"Intelligent" being here defined as positive? Please explain to me why you consider the article on <i>Godless'</i>s section on Science and Intelligent Design to be an "attack", or for that matter, "blog-sourced". Also, please explain on the talk page why you consider yourself justified in removing the note of the allegations of plagiarism. I have reverted your removal and await your reason (blanking half of an article with no explanation is not how we do things here). Cheers, <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 00:25, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Kasreyn, as I stated in my edit summaries, Felonious not only cites but actually <i>quotes</i> two different non-notable blogs to support his case. As I said on the talk page, Felonious also will not cite evidence <i>from the book</i> that the book <i>Godless</i> "attacks science"; that in the book Coulter uses "Darwinism" as a synonym for "Evolution and science" or that by such alleged usage she acts, in his words, "in keeping with the religious right".</dd>
<dd>Also, I explained the removal of the plagiarism section in the edit summary and so doing, I removed the section with more explanation than it was added and with much sounder reasoning. Why should there be long quotations of duplicate content (longer than the description of the book itself) between two authors presented in a manner that imports to the reader it is the primary criterion for judging whether the supposed (and blogger-accused) plagiarism has occurred? Especially when alternate explanations are available? If you would look at the archive box, item #4 contains the title "Ext. Links, Transsexual, Birthdate, Plagiarism". Which means it was already discussed a long time ago. Why not read the archive so I don't have to repeat the full discussion all over again on another talk page? <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.154.26.251.html" title="User:64.154.26.251">64.154.26.251</a> 04:02, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Couldn't someone with the book simply post what Coulter means by "Darwinism", as if she wasn't referring to evolution in particular, she hopefully defined what exactly "Darwinism" is before arguing against it. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 00:09, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am in agreement with the anons and with Coulter's publishers that the accusations of plagiarism are ill-founded. Many attack her for "false" statements and "copied" material, which upon analysis are found to be very much less than what is asserted. The article, to Wikipedia's great discredit, is full of this cruft, with the attacks getting great and ponderous weight.</dd>

<dd>I also agree that the criticisms <s>of</s> by <i>Felonious</i> are often ill-founded or misleading, or both. My favorite example is that in <i>Godless,</i> Coulter cited Piltdown man, Galapagos finches, and several other famous examples of longstanding and now-discredited arguments in favor of evolution. Poor Felonious twisted the wording to make them seem as though they were longstanding arguments of anti-evolutionists. He/she apparently has a flock of like-thinkers (if it can be called "thinking") who support this sort of thing, also to Wikipedia's great discredit.</dd>

<p>As long as due weight is considered (one para at most I'd say), the answer is not to wipe the entire section from the article entirely, but rather to state the allegations and the response.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Religious views - change the section name to reflect intended meaning</span></h2>
<p>Consensus sought: Is this subsection meant to reflect Coulter's personal spirituality or is it to reflect on her wider views on religion? This subsection is not in the area where the article is discussing her political statements, rather it is in her "biography" portion. Can we get a consensus on what was the intention of this so we can stop the edit war that Raphael1 has decided to wage?

<dd>The section is intended to discuss Coulter's personal spirituality, and that is what it does. <a href="../../../r/a/p/User_talk%7ERaphael1_fe34.html" title="User talk:Raphael1">Raphael1</a> has no way of knowing "intended meaning," and seems to have a history of disruptive edits.

<dd>Whatever the best section-heading would be, I strongly suggest keeping personal remarks out of the discussion. Accusations and insinuations of the kind are rarely helpful, and contrary to the assumption of good faith.</dd>
<dd>As for the heading, I wouldn't get too hung up on its "intended meaning". Only whoever first made the heading might know the answer to that (might not, either), but in the end it does not matter because we are not constrained by that intent. The proper question is whether it makes sense, in terms of the organization of an encyclopedic article, to consider Coulter's personal religious beliefs under a common heading with her opinions on those of other folk. I think that it does, and that "Religious views" makes a reasonable heading for such a section. Sub-headings for "Personal beliefs" and "Opinions of other religions" might be in order, given enough material. Further, if the section <i>is</i> to be limited to Coulter's (ostensibly) Christian beliefs, then it would be better to have a heading that reflects that. -- Lonewolf BC 01:09, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I propose to delete the "smell bad" quotation. It wasn't made in connection with Coulter's personal religious beliefs, and it is taken out of context in the column it comes from (which is about a movie and liberal interpretations thereof). It really belongs in Wikiquote. Maybe it's already there, in fact.

Among those is that, given the volume of the archive of this article, it is <i>not</i> reasonable to expect anyone to search the haystack for something you say is "in there somewhere". If you wish to introduce such matter into later discussion, the onus is on <i>you</i> to give a better indication of where to find it. If you disagree with me on that, then so be it. I do hope you give the matter some thought, at least. If you feel that I was too blunt in saying this .... well, then I am sorry you feel that way, but respectfully disagree. -- Lonewolf BC 05:29, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What is the justification for keeping it in? The justification for getting rid of it appears above (it's not part of her religious belief, it's taken out of context, and it belongs in Wikiquote, if anywhere). There is possibly other justification in <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html#Biased_or_malicious_content" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 23:55, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>

<dl>

<dd>The justification is that your reasoning for removing the passage is entirely fallacious. You are arguing three reasons for removing it:
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>"It wasn't made in connection with Coulter's personal religious beliefs"</li>
<li>"[It] was taken out of context in the column it comes from (which is about a movie and liberal interpretations thereof)"</li>
<li>"It belongs in Wikiquote"</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Moving the quote to opinions post-9/11 would place the passage in a more germane section and thus satisfy #1. #2 is patently false: The answer is to supply the missing context rather than delete because the context is lacking. Please illuminate us all by either enlargening the quotation or providing the necessary lacking context in order to achieve proper context and thus satisfy your second objection. As for moving to Wikiquote, we don't vacumn every single quotation from this article into Wikiquote. As long as context is applied and it is not a simple naked quotation, it belongs in the article. After #1 and #2 are dealt with (#3 is just wrong), I see no further standing objections besides a "possible" and as-yet uncited, imaginary BLP violation. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 03:57, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Try showing us some of her racist and bigoted views, then. All I see are some tiny quotes that are not what their advocates want us to think. The silly one that will not be in the article much longer is a parenthetical comment from an article about American liberals misunderstanding a Christian movie. It is already in Wikiquote. If you can find it as part of someone's discussion of her anti-smelly-people outlook, for example, it would help us all to understand what you are talking about. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 01:21, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fundamental misunderstanding. Some of Coulter's writing *might* be removed from the BLP of another individual, if she is viewed as a "partisan" source for text used in someone else's article and if the text is deemed less than reliable, but her own writing is most certainly a valid source for her own article: your argument that it would be removed because she is "partisan" is incorrect.

<dd>She was being Coulter. She uses far out blurbs in the same way that Michael Moore does, to draw attention to herself. It is her "style". It is despicable, but... amazingly... people still fall for it which in her publishers eyes makes it valid. Does she mean it? Probably not, but it gets you to pay attention to her and possibly read her columns. Discussing what the column states is off-topic for this talk page, if you'd like to write about that, you could quote her in the article and discuss her viewpoint on Christianity there.

<dd>We are not analyzing the validity of the allegation as to whether or not Coulter, in fact, made bigoted remarks. Instead, we are <i>reporting</i> on the incontravertible <i>fact</i> that she has been accused of bigotry by notable and prominent Islamic advocacy groups such as:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Council on American-Islamic Relations ("a major non-profit, non-governmental, Muslim organization in North America, funded by American Muslims and also in significant part by Middle Eastern sources such as the Al Maktoum Foundation, which is headed by the crown prince of Dubai and which owns the deed to CAIR's headquarters in Washington, D.C.")</li>
<li>American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee ("With headquarters in Washington, DC, ADC operates offices in Boston, Dearborn, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York City, and San Diego. ADC welcomes members of all faiths, backgrounds, and ethnicities. Former US Congresswoman Mary Rose Oakar is currently ADC's president.")</li>
<li>Muslim Civil Rights Center (taking a cursory look at their website, they might qualify as fringe, I'll let you decide)</li>
</ul>
</dd>

</dd>
<dd>BLP itself mandates inclusion by critics if the views are "relevant to the subject's notability and are based on reliable sources, and so long as the material is written in a manner that does not overwhelm the article or appear to side with the critics' material." Coulter's comments on the Islamic world since 9/11 has been an integral part of her television coverage and public visibility along with her book releases, and this is just another example. Including criticism from fringe groups is one thing, but as demonstrated above, at least the first two groups can hardly be called fringe. As for reliable sources, here's one from LexisNexis so that we can use in addition to the primary source:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>Jim Ritter, "Muslims see a growing media bias", Chicago Sun Times, September 4, 2006</i> - Anti-Islamic prejudice "is increasingly bleeding into mainstream media," [Ibrahim Hooper of the Council on American-Islamic Relations] said. After Sept. 11, columnist Ann Coulter wrote, "We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity." Before Sept. 11, Coulter "would have faced swift repudiation from her colleagues," Hooper said. "Now it's accepted as legitimate commentary."</li>

<dd>From what you quoted: "If the view represented is that of a tiny minority, it has no place in the article." The view that Coulter is a bigot IS that of a tiny minority. Very few Muslims globally know who Coulter is and of them, a very small minority have ever read her writings. Sounds tiny to me. Ritter's quote has no bearing on the portion of the article we are discussing, the portion I was having problems with was the one that called her straight out a bigot. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 01:18, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>On top of these being partisan websites, as I pointed out above, libelous material needs to be removed immediately and the person adding that material is required to give proper sourcing for it.

<dd>I'm sorry, but a prominent Islamic lobbying group that is spending over $50 million on a media campaign run by a former Congresswoman and Saudi Prince Alwaleed ibn Talal does not count as a "tiny minority".

<p>Outstanding issues: The claim that Coulter is a bigot by CAIR still needs support. Kizzle found 1 additional article to help source it but the article was written by someone who's neutrality is in question. The claim that Coulter is a bigot by CAIR may be giving undue weight to a tiny minority opinion. This view seems to be only found on partisan websites, and as above, the single source that Kizzle has uncovered. The claim that Coulter is a bigot may be better expressed already by the article and adding this potentionally libelous one-liner should be weighed against the rest of the article for inclusion.

<dd>You've called Oden legitimate concern "wikilawyering" and warned him that changing the images was done at his "own risk". You told him "Thanks for visitting." which I interpreted (maybe in error!) as telling him to piss off. Who's being rude? Nevermind that, all we want is a free image.

<dd>The risk was that changing pics on this article leads to this sort of crap. Pages of pages of drivel over the changed bloody picture. We'd FINALLY gotten settled on the one we were using and Oden decided unilaterally to toss that aside and change it. Legitimate concern? What bloody concern? After having the revolving door of pics, we'd finally gotten one that noone was arguing about for a change. You want a free image, fine, post a free image on your own website. On wikipedia, go with consensus and consensus was happy with the gray dress shot. Then again, maybe we'll just start changing the image willy-nilly again!

<dd>Nevertheless, WP policy is WP policy. If there is a free image and a fair use image, WP policy does <b>not</b> give us a choice. We either use the free image, or no image at all. The only thing that made a fair use image acceptable at all was the <i>non-existence</i> of a free one. That is the only justification available under WP policy.</dd>
<dd>Additionally, your comments on this talk page have been uncivil, to the point of hectoring. I strongly recommend you reread <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> once more. Oden provided you with the link to the policy, which if you had read it, would have shown you that Oden's concern over the image was a matter of policy and not personal.

<li>In light of this debate (which has become quite heated) I thought I would make an edit I think can be considered a compromise... if only a temporary one. It is true that free and open images are preferred. It is also true that free alternatives to fair use images should be of similar or greater quality. The current free image is simply of poor quality. It is out of focus, poorly lit, and not what I would consider fit for an encyclopedia no matter who the photographer may be.</li>

<dd>I'd like to get Oden's opinion on this one, as he found a perfectly legitimate and arguably superior image (it being free rather than fair use). Such a good idea shouldn't get the cold shoulder, but I'll defer to his opinion in the matter. As for quality, I agree with Rtrev, it's a matter of balancing the value of free vs. fair-use over a slight but discernable difference in quality. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 06:22, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is the most ridiculous thing I have seen in a while. I'm surprised someone who didnt like Coulter didnt just upload a photo of a dog turd, name it Ann Coulter.jpg and insist that because it was a free image it had to be used to replace the legitimate fair use image that was there. The concept of using free images vs fair use images is good in theory, but the way it is being implemented here appears to be nothing short of a demonstration of zealotry or fanaticism. The image offered as a replacement is crap (excuse my francais). The quality of the image has to play a role, and no one can honestly say that is a good photo of Coulter. Better no photo.

<dd>Wikipedia is built by consensus. When a minority of editors make an unwanted change to an article, this breaks consensus and other editors are encouraged to rescind those changes. What Oden did broke the truce over the images on this article, and has become a disruptive edit, regardless of him being supported by policy or not, his change is disruptive and should be treated similarly to any other disruptive edit. To quote Oden himself, if you do not like the fact that wikipedia articles are based on the consensus of editors, you're welcome to leave. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 07:38, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, uh, guys? I know I'm late here, but some things actually can't be overridden by consensus. Even if every regular editor of this page agreed to throw out NPOV and turn this page into a fan site (or attack screed), it would be overturned. NPOV is a policy handed down by the Wikipedia Foundation, and you can't overrule it, no matter how many people you get to agree. It's their site, and they make the rules. Fair use policy is in the same category; it's a core Wikipedia policy that fair use images can not be used when free ones are available, and you can't just throw that out. —<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowbok_9a99.html" title="User:Chowbok"><span style="background:black; color:white; font-weight: bold;">Chowbok</span></a> <a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChowbok_a1df.html" title="User talk:Chowbok"><span style="color:black;">☠</span></a> 21:50, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>BTW, I was the original uploader of the "Grey dress" photo taken from Coulter's site.

<dd>I'm actually rather surprised there is so much opposition to this image. Yes it isn't the best but it isn't terrible. And IMHO, it's far better then the image we had previously that made her look anorexic (yes I'm aware that she has it on her site, it doesn't change the fact it was a particularly bad image). The simple fact is, we only really have 2 options here. Either we use this image or we leave the page blank until we find a suitable free replacement. IMHO, it's better to have this even if it isn't the best. If she personally requests it's removal, then sure we probably should remove it and leave the page blank (unless she provides a suitable free alternative). But given the image she has on her site, I don't think she'll care. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 17:13, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>BTW, IMHO it's best to keep the origina image, especially when it's been cropped and had extensive changes and both source and output is JPG. There might be a reason for an uncropped image and another use may be able to do a better job. Also, too much recompressing is bad. Of course, it could be reobtained from Flicker but it's easier to just keep the thing. In this case, given Jimbo's image is currently unused, there's no reason IMHO to replace. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a></dd>

An example I could think of would be a covertly taken nude photo of the subject. But Coulter clearly consented to have her photo taken here. And even if she didn't stop and smile, a photo of her walking by would be equally appropriate and not violate the BLP policy. Could a better photo be taken? Surely, and once a free one is found it would be suitable for inclusion. As any featured article about a public feature should have an image of the subject included, and a free one of this subject is available.

<dd>Yes, photos contributed by professionals could be considered <i>professional quality</i>, but they would be contributing them for free and hence as an amateur. This is however a semantic argument and not relevant to the issue.
<dl>
<dd>You're making a distinction between six and a half-dozen. I think you're wrong on the semantics; a photo created by a professional photographer is a professional image. A "professional" is one who takes a majority of his/her income from photography - this doesn't mean that every image they create must be sold. Many professionals do <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro_bono.html" title="Pro bono">pro bono</a> work. Others donate images here ( and elsewhere ) for publicity, especially when using the attribution license. Yours is simply too rigid a definition.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html#Policy" title="WP:FU">fair use policy</a> is very clear on this issue: when a free equivalent is available or could be created that would adequately give the same information, it should be used over the non-free version. Wales's picture does this. The policy does not take "quality" of the image into account. So far there is no criteria for deletion of images based on quality (there really isn't one for articles either). Face it: Coulter doesn't always take a good picture. —<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_d5cd.html" title="User:Malber">Malber</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalber_7564.html" title="User talk:Malber">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malber_b734.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malber">contribs</a>) 21:46, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed. It's not the best photo but it's free and that takes precedence. Legal and ethical concerns must (and do) take precedence over aesthetic concerns. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 21:52, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I made a number of, what I consider, compromise edits and LonewolfBC has repeatedly reverted them away. I've made requests to him on his talk page to be careful when reverting and to discuss major changes on this discussion page before making them. He has blatantly refused to discuss anything (see his talk). Honestly, if LonewolfBC has a personal problem with me, fine, but bullying my edits away is dirty pool. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 17:21, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's helpful when you avoid antagonising editors. For example, calling LonewolfBC's edits vandalism when they clearly weren't was not likely to be helpful. Also, as far as I can tell, you're the one who made the major changes which LonewolfBC felt were illadvised and therefore reverted. Generally speaking, when you make major changes to an article, which are disputed, it is up to you to explain why you made the changes and why you felt they were necessary rather then the person disputing them to explain. I'm not saying LonewolfBC has handled this well, simply pointing out the best way to handle tricky situations <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 18:00, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Let's discuss those changes:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>1 In the section about Coulter's religious beliefs, I added an OR tag to the unsourced statement that a particular writing stirred controversy. 2 In that same section, I increased the size of the quote to give context. 3 I moved the section about CAIR throwing a hissy fit over her columns from the "terrorism" section to the columns section. 4 I removed the duplicate material related to the 911 Jersey Girls, which has its own section and was terribly out of place. 5 I hid the image since there is a content dispute regarding it and it had been totally removed previously.</p>
<p>Why Lonewolf's reverts are bad form:</p>

<li>Do not simply revert changes that are made as part of a dispute. Be respectful to other editors, their contributions and their points of view.</li>
<li>Do not revert good faith edits. In other words, try to consider the editor "on the other end." If what one is attempting is a positive contribution to Wikipedia, a revert of those contributions is inappropriate unless, and only unless, you as an editor possess firm, substantive, and objective proof to the contrary. Mere disagreement is not such proof. See also Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith.</li>
<li>Generally there are misconceptions that problematic sections of an article or recent changes are the reasons for reverting or deletion. If they contain valid information, these texts should simply be edited and improved accordingly. Reverting is not a decision which should be taken lightly.</li>
<li>Do not revert changes simply because someone makes an edit you consider problematic, biased, or inaccurate. Improve the edit, rather than reverting it.</li>

<dd>I looked at the edits. I decided that they were bad. Yes, you've been <i>talking</i> about making assorted edits, but I don't see that you had consensus for the ones you made. Indeed, you had every reason to believe that they would be contentious. One factor that figured in my decision to revert was that your behavior has become indistinguishable from that of a troll, both in editing the article and in talking about edits, here. The big hullaballoo you are now making, with its emphasis on trying to cast Lonewolf as the villain of the piece, rather than calmly discuss the edits, is typical of this troll-like behavior. If you are sincere, you need to take a good long wikipedia-break, to try to regain some perspective. If you are a troll, you need a permanent one. Anyhow, my interest is in useful editing of articles, not in wrestling with trolls or folk who act like trolls, so I'll not step into the ring with you, though I am ever ready to sit across the table. -- Lonewolf BC 19:25, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I agree with Lonewolf's reversion. I don't personally see any reason to move the the CAIR thing. And the stuff that was added, well was unnecessary. In terms of your dispute with Lonewolf, I won't go any further except to repeat what I said before. Try to avoid antagonising other edits. Perhaps lonewolf has not handled this well, I won't comment on that. But Lonewolf's edits were obviously not vandalism. BTW, I'd in fact visited Lonewolf's page and viewed your attempt to sort this out beforehand. I note in your oldid you failed to include the edit you made where you gave Lonewolf a vandalism warning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lonewolf_BC&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=90866659" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lonewolf_BC&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=90866659" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<dd>You may agree with Lonewolf's reversion, but per the help file for reversion, his choice to revert was a bad choice. His choice to revert again after being asked politely to discuss his proposed changes on the talk page was starting a classic revert war which is seriously frowned upon by wikipedia and most neutral wikipedians. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 21:09, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Passion thing</span></h2>
<p>I commented out the Passion thing for now <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ann_Coulter&amp;diff=90967310&amp;oldid=90945900" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ann_Coulter&amp;diff=90967310&amp;oldid=90945900" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Reason is quite simple. Although Ann's comments are likely to be offensive to many, it's important we establish they were controversial or at least noteable which we haven't. As another editor remarked (somewhere in the archives now I guess), Ann has said a lot of stupid things. You only have to read a bit of what she says to know this. However it's not up to ask to compile all the stupid things she's said. When a specific thing she said has attracted controversy, then we can mention this. The fact that you and I find this comment offensive is irrelevant (this will probably apply to most of her comments) in the absense of evidence it was controversial or noteable. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 19:51, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Coulter says many things that tend to be inflammatory to some readers. There is no room to repeat them all. IMHO, we should specifically mention only those that have caused fairly notable and widespread <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversy.html" title="Controversy">controversy</a>. When we mention them, fairness requires us to do a lot more than just repeat what she said; for example, we need to provide a fair description of the context in which she said them.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Islamofascism"</span></h2>
<p>The term "<a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>" is (in my opinion, intentionally) inflammatory, in addition to being generally inaccurate (as fundamentalist Islam shares very few traits with World-War-II-era <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascism</a>). While to some it may be a "legitimate term to describe a subset", as <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaper13_315c.html" title="User:Caper13">User:Caper13</a> claims, it's too emotionally loaded to ensure rational discourse. It is not used at all within the section, and including it in the header implies that Ms. Coulter limited her statements to the jihadists, undercutting the controversy surrounding the statements within the section; the controversy is precisely because her statements do not differentiate between violent, fundamentalist Islamic groups such as al Qaeda and peaceful Muslims. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Geiger_d671.html" title="User:Benjamin Geiger">Benjamin Geiger</a> 17:05, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>IMHO the article might be improved by addition of an encyclopedic, neutral point of view section on Coulter and Arabs/Muslims. This should NOT just be a childish recitation of things she has said that some A/M's might take issue with. It might include the points that 1) she writes a lot of stuff; 2) none of it mainly deals with A/M (or if you think some of it does, point it out in a neutral way; her airport security stuff is about airport security, not about A&amp;M); 3) she has said some minor things that some find disagreeable ("raghead," "smell bad," etc.) Personally, I don't think her A/M stuff is notable enough to write up. Those who DO might want to try to write it up in an encyclopedic NPOV way. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 20:33, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Vpoko is probably right about some of her A&amp;M comments being notable, if indeed they were heavily reported in the mainstream press. They're just not notable enough for ME to spend time on. If an A&amp;M comment goes in, it should go in in an encyclopedic and neutral way (which takes skill, time and effort to do, of course). If somebody who cares about the A&amp;M material could discuss it in an encyclopedic and neutral way, it probably would stay in. "COULTER HATES MUSLIMS!" won't make it. Neither will "WALID FOO SAYS COULTER HATES MUSLIMS!" Maybe something like "While A&amp;M have not figured prominently in Coulter's work, some of her comments about them have raised eyebrows" -- then provide some citations.

<dd>Her comments would have to have been highly reported though. Not just some critic commenting "Eeek, look at what she's said now". Otherwise, when it comes to articles about professional commentators, their article will become a collection of quotes surrounded by complaints about how so and so was pissed off by them. Coulter's style is to cut through the noise and to make comments which shock certain readers. I think rather than entering a collection of quotes that are intended to have shock value, it is enough to just note this propensity and style of hers. As for whether she doesnt like Muslims, that is laughable. I would imagine she would answer that she has no problem with Muslims as long as they arent trying to kill people, destroy our buildings, impose islamic law, destroy western civilization, hijack planes, or forcibly convert others. &lt;--the preceeding was an example of the type of comment that is phrased to have shock value, and yet carry what some would consider a <i>normal</i> message at its core. (She is opposed to the fanatics who are waging war). If it is part of her style to do this, it can be noted that those who like her enjoy the over the top comments, and those who dislike her are outraged by them, without creating a laundry list. Particular subjects are then easier to deal with in an NPOV manner. Eg. that because we are at war with an enemy that is predominantly muslim, she favors a wider program of profiling those groups and is less concerned that nonmilitant muslims may be inconvenienced by it, given the potential dangers involved (even though she may have phrased it in a more inflammatory way). Our job is to be NPOV even if the subject isnt. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaper13_315c.html" title="User:Caper13">Caper13</a> 23:02, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Strongly agree with Benjamin. If the term "Islamofascism" is to be included, it needs to have quotation marks around it. WP is not here to lob verbal grenades like that.

<p>I've re-addded the photo. It doesn't matter if some people feel the free image is esthetically inferior.

<dd>Malber, I believe that your position is a good faith one, however I disagree with your rationale that the goal of FA Status requires the immediate insertion of ANY image into the article. Essentially extending the position that says ANY free image automatically prohibits the use of all fair use images, to any image is always preferable to no image. User Rtrev made a reasonable compromise suggestion when the free image first came along that we go blank for a while rather than revert back and forth between the free image and the fair use image. It seems a large number of editors dislike this image and want time to find another. Extending the inital truce (no image) for a week or two to allow people time to find an alternate free image that people can all agree on, would seem to make sense. It avoids potential edit wars, calms tempers, and allows time for a solution everyone might find acceptable. Unless you are expecting this article to be a FA in the next week or two, I dont see what the downside is. Perhaps if people have a reasonable amount of time, and are unable to locate an alternate image, they might warm up to the free image currently available and we can achieve consensus that way as well. I really don't see what the time pressure is, and a pause might allow everything to work out naturally. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaper13_315c.html" title="User:Caper13">Caper13</a> 22:30, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't mind the new section. This is the story to date regarding inclusion of an image from my perspective. When I first encountered this article, a scan of the cover of Coulter's book <i>Slander</i> was used for an image of the subject. When objections were raised about the appropriateness per policy of using a fair use book cover image for the image of the subject, I found the grey dress image on her site and used it as a replacement. At that time, there were objections to that image for esthetic reasons. But those arguing against inclusion of the book cover image on the basis of policy won out and the fair use promo image from her site was used. Now we have a free copy that meets all of the criteria for inclusion of an image depicting the subject of a biographical article: it acurately depicts the subject, it is not derogatory or inflamatory. It even has the added bonus of appearing that the subject consented to have her picture taken. If those objecting to this image can provide a valid reason for exclusion of this image that has its basis in policy, please present it. As it stands, the grey dress image will be deleted as it is an orphaned fair use image. So when that happens, we won't have an alternative other than the free image (unless someone uploads a better quality free image). This is why I believe the image should stay. There is no policy based reason why a good faith edit to include this image should be reverted. —<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_d5cd.html" title="User:Malber">Malber</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalber_7564.html" title="User talk:Malber">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malber_b734.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malber">contribs</a>) 22:46, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not suggesting that we should use the Silver Dress image. I'm just saying that an easy way to avoid an edit war would be to go without an image for a short time and allow those who say they don't like the free image to find an alternative image that is also free use. I'm not suggesting that we go without an image forever. If in the end, no other free image is discovered, I'd probably vote to go with the currently disputed free image. Staying blank (image wise) for a couple of weeks is a small price to pay if it helps build consensus, and I really don't see the downside. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaper13_315c.html" title="User:Caper13">Caper13</a> 23:08, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't see a rational objection to the inclusion of the image and any reason why the article should go imageless for any period of time. Is the image not sexy enough for everyone? Do we have to wait for a free image that would be considered for inclusion in an issue of <i>Playboy</i>?

<dd>Um, the article has had an image since its earliest days. There has never been any non-trivial objection to any of the images that were there, either the professional images supplied by those who supply such things for widespread use, or the low-quality amateur ones supplied by those who don't understand the accepted methods of handling photos of public figures. There isn't any non-trivial reason not to have a photo. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 01:35, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>No, the insistence that the article should go image-less until a "suitable" image is found ("suitable" here defined as suitable to a vocal contingent of Coulterites) is not rational. No consensus is required to determine whether the article should have an image: <i>it is encyclopedic best practise for each of our bio pages to have a photo, preferably free, of the subject.</i> We have such a free image. Unless a better <b>free</b> one can be found, it is obviously best practise to include it. We can "work our way up" to "better" pictures later. In fact, if this one bothers you so much, go out and find a better free one yourself or quit complaining. It's not our damn job to worry about whether a photo of Coulter might be unflattering. The photo in question was taken by the creator of this website, who is apparently a friend of Coulter. <b>Somehow, I doubt she's going to complain</b>.</dd>

<dd>I must be crazy in thinking that Jimbo's image isn't bad enough to warrant complete exclusion from the page. I'm not sure we should just go without an image "for a while" as just finding a free non-fair-use image of a celebrity is pretty difficult. It would be one thing if policy were ambiguous about the matter, but it says "Always use a free image in place of a fair-use", even with "Always" bolded to emphasize the point. Malber makes a great point: this is an <i>open source</i> encyclopedia and subject to slightly different standards than print encyclopedias. Britannica can probably get permission to use a slightly better image (assuming Britannica would even make a page on Coulter or Al Franken or any other of the like), but Wikipedia is governed by rules to ensure that it stays or aims to be free. I'd prefer to act according to policy rather than the threat of an edit war, so let's keep the free image until another more suitable replacement can be found. That's my two cents. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 03:20, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did Google but didn't find anything. Didn't look that hard tho. I personally don't object to not having any image. I do hope however that who oppose the free image need to realise we are unlikely to change our policy and no matter how many pleas so it will always be free image or no image. Of course, a better free image could come along. Alternatively, since some editors seem to find her agreeable, they could try contacting her for a free photo.

I'm saying that his comment isn't sufficiently relevant to Coulter's notability to appear in her article. The reasons I don't see it as relevant to her notablity are 1) that it is but one of hundreds of comments from people who don't like something that Coulter says, and 2) though it was made in reaction to Coulter's words, it seems to be mostly about the decline of American journalistic standards, according to Hooper's point of view, and 3) it comes from an advocacy organization, and not from the mainstream.

<dd>When I first read Lou's comments I agreed. But on further consideration I think Ibrahim's comments definitely merit inclusion. You need to consider the comments carefully. Although on first consideration, it may sound like it's just a comment on what America is like, it's actually quite a strong comment on Ann Coulter as well. Basically it's saying Ann Coulter's comments are so disgusting that they would be completely unacceptable in any resonable society and would have been unacceptable in the US before September 11th. So yes, it's commenting on America but it's also commenting, very strongly, on Ann Coulter's comments so it merits inclusion in the article <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 11:01, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good thinking, Nil. Even before your comment, I did some further consideration and started thinking that maybe his comments ARE notable enough to be kept. I disagree with your "so disgusting" and "reasonable society" stuff, though. Look at his words: "... now it's accepted as legitimate commentary." Maybe he doesn't like what Coulter said, and he's definitely advancing his lobbyist POV by objecting to it, but even HE acknowledges that words like Coulter's are legitimate commentary. It's important for us to let our readers know that, and for us as editors to realize it. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 15:05, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This would apply to any spokesman representing any organizations, be it governmental or non, as they are all paid. You think Tony Snow is any less biased than Hooper? Even all this is forgetting paid corporate spokesman, which we still quote pretty frequently. I guess it doesn't matter, as I think we've come to a concensus to include the passage as it satisfies <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 04:30, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My point was that a paid spokesman, is not the same as an independant reviewer. What one says could very well be true, but one is hardly impartial. Tony Snow is not an impartial observer of the Bush Adm just as this guy is not an impartial observer of the subjects he is paid to comment on. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaper13_315c.html" title="User:Caper13">Caper13</a> 06:27, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Clear, accurate thinking, Caper. Everyone is paid for <i>something</i>. Some are paid to promote a point of view.

<p>I dislike the current photo, it may represent Coulter in her capacity as some sort of newsperson, but that isn't really what she does, and it isn't a very flattering picture either. Were I a betting man, I would put $10 on it that some people like it because she looks rather tawdry in it. I don't know what all the flap about fair use vs free is, my understanding is any picture on the web is fair game unless it is specifically labeled as not. Once it hits the web, it's as good as saying, <i><b>"I am fine with that, I can't control it's publication but if it is used in a way that defames or presents me in a bad light, I understand I have a right to redress the way it is used though not the use per sae."</b></i></p>
<p>With that in mind, here is, IMHO, <a href="http://jakking.typepad.com/daily/images/coulter.jpg" class="external text" title="http://jakking.typepad.com/daily/images/coulter.jpg" rel="nofollow">a more benign picture of the debbil woman herself</a> which would look OK at a slightly smaller resolution. LOL</p>
<p>Another encyclopedia has posted <a href="http://www.dkosopedia.com/wiki/Ann_Coulter" class="external text" title="http://www.dkosopedia.com/wiki/Ann_Coulter" rel="nofollow">this photo of Ms. Coulter</a>, so it's not like there aren't plenty of pix to use hanging around. <a href="../../../i/d/i/User%7EIdioT.SavanT.i4_eb6b.html" title="User:IdioT.SavanT.i4">i4</a> 05:50, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sigh, we've been in to this lots of times. There may be a million photos of Ann Coulter, it's kind of irrelevant. We don't use photos under fair use when there is a 'free' one which does the job. Until and unless you can find a better 'free' image, then this one will have to be it. Frankly, I've never understood why people make such a big fuss about these photos. While I agree Jimbo's one was a bit crap, this one is fine and isn't unflattering.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Jackass Incident</span></h2>
<p>I propose to delete this stuff, which was recently added to the <i>Speeches at college campuses</i> section:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>On May 3rd, 2005, while Coulter was having a Q&amp;A session at the University of Texas' LBJ Library, a UT student-heckler named Ajai Raj spoke his mind and asked a very crude question to Coulter which concerned sodomy in a heterosexual marriage. Coulter stood shocked on stage and the crowd was likewise stupefied. From an article Raj wrote about the incident, it seems that his plan was simple: to be a jackass. Evidently, Raj and friends had been yelling obscenities at Coulter from the start while holding protest signs at the back of the crowd. His reasoning behind these actions was that anyone could be abrasive, rude and crude, which is what he believed Coulter was doing. Raj also attempted to convey his thoughts that not everyone was intimidated by her and not everyone agreed with her political points. Feeling triumphant, Raj turned to leave the event, making masturbatory hand gestures as he left, and was approached by the police. Raj told them he was leaving and they replied that they were there to arrest him. After questioning why he was being arrested, they handcuffed him and put him in the back of a police car. While in the car, Raj asked them again why he was being arrested and the officers allegedly told him that they didn't even see what had happened (meaning Raj's question and hand gestures) and were just doing what they were told to do.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Reasons: 1) poorly sourced; 2) no clear demonstration of its relevance to Coulter's notability; 3) original research ("it seems," "what he believed," "feeling triumphant," etc.; 4) unencyclopedic; 5) pretty old. Basically, it's a story of some kid mouthing off and getting arrested for it. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 14:55, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It would <i>at best</i> be mildly interesting if we could source that the kid's motivation was to mimic what he saw as Coulter's crudeness (ie., a kind of parody), but even with such a source, I'd definitely say we don't need a huge paragraph on it. If it stays, it should definitely be trimmed to the essentials. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 23:18, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>I agree this is unnecessary. The amount of space devoted to this incident and the tone of the paragraph sounds more like a blog or student paper than an ency. article (even though there is a source describing his motivation--the guy's own story about the incident).

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Public Controvery and Partisanship</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>I wanted to add something about an emerging phenomenon, the growth of websites featuring anagrams of Ms. Coulter's name. A Google on her name and anagram returns more than 27,000 citations.</li>
<li>Additionally, I don't think Wikipedia presents a clear view of the intense partisan dislike Coulter has generated. It is as strong if not stronger than liberal emotions toward the top members of the Bush 43 administration, which is, in itself, quite extraodinary for a talking head.</li>
</ul>
<p>I attempted to place this section directly under the Private Life heading and it reverted - whether by accident or by some unseen hand keeping tabs on the article - I don't know. Given the apparent vandalism I read about here, I am including the entire text of the entry for discussion and if somehow it can be worked in properly, I think it merits at least some mention, but I abide by the will of the majority contributors. The text was as follows:</p>
<p><i><b>Liberals, whom Coulter often expresses strong disdain for, have returned the favor and branded her with labels like "bitch" and "Nazi NeoCon". So strong has liberal dislike for Coulter become, she has merited an entry in the satirical <a href="http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Ann_Coulter" class="external text" title="http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Ann_Coulter" rel="nofollow">Uncyclopedia</a> nearly as lengthy as Wikipedia's own.</b></i></p>
<p><b><i>Coulter's frequent commentary on homsexuality has been a source for rumors and innuendo that she is either a man or transgendered &amp; on her own sexual preferences, (mostly in regards to an overly large laryngeal prominence). Appellations like "Stan the man" Coulter, "(M)"ann Coulter, &amp; "him/her" are often used by her detractors. Making anagrams from various permutations of her name</i></b></p>

<p><i><b>have become popular enough to spawn numerous websites with little purpose other than to publish these anagrams.

I really don't see how a bunch of hate filled people making a game out of calling her a C*nt or whatever is encyclopedic.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bias</span></h2>
<p>I believe that this article represents a biased point of view. I would like to propose the following changes, including a brief rationale for each change:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. "Ann Hart Coulter (born 8 December 1961)[1] is <s>an</s> a controversial American author, columnist, and <s>pundit</s> <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_speaker.html" title="Public speaker">public speaker</a>."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The word "pundit" is primarily used to describe a properly qualified expert whose views are sought, usually in the popular media, to explain or clarify specialist material for a general audience. Increasingly, however, the word is used in derogatory or misleading ways (see Wikipedia's article on the term "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit_(expert)" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit_(expert)" rel="nofollow">pundit</a>"), either by implying that the expert's claim to expertise is partly or wholly vacuous, or by implying that the expert's apparent neutral point of view belies a veiled bias or prejudice. Ann Coulter would be better described as as a "controversial and provocative commentator".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. "Known for her <s>controversial[3]</s> <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polemical.html" title="Polemical">polemical</a> style and <s>unabashedly</s> <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provocative.html" title="Provocative">provocative</a>, politically conservative views ..."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Coulter's <i>style</i> is argumentative (in the polemical sense). Her <i>views</i> are provocative (in the controversial sense).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3. "<s>Ann Coulter was born to ... . She has described her family as "upper middle class" and has termed her attorney father a "union buster".</s> Ann Coulter was born in New York City to upper middle-class parents John Vincent and Nell Husbands Martin Coulter. After her birth, the family moved to New Canaan, Connecticut, where Coulter and her two older brothers were raised."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>While Coulter's description of her parents as "upper middle-class" implies a degree of self-consciousness around class differences that would tend to be consistent with her broader political views, the article's use of quotation marks implies that this fact is either interesting in and of itself, or possibly disputed; no rationale is provided, in the case of the former, and no reference is provided, in the case of the latter. Moreover, while Coulter's description of her father as a "union buster" possibly provides insight into the general political milieu in which she was raised, it has no bearing on the present article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>4. "<s>Coulter proclaims Christian religious beliefs.</s> Coulter is a Christian."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Here, again, the use of the word "proclaims" suggests that Coulter's claim to be a Christian is or could be disputed, for which no evidence is provided.<br />

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm in favor of polishing this stuff up, but maybe a little differently.
<dl>
<dd>1. Is fine, but maybe link to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversy.html" title="Controversy">controversial</a>. I agree that public speaking is one of her main activities.</dd>
<dd>2. It's her <i>style</i> that is provocative and polemical. Her <i>views</i> are conservative. Suggest "known for her provocative, polemical style and politically conservative views."</dd>
<dd>3. IMHO there's a bit too much family detail here. It's probably OK to mention that her father was an attorney, since she followed in his footsteps. "Upper middle class" and "union buster" should be dropped, as should her parents' names and the fact that she has two brothers—we're not dealing with some sort of hereditary peer here, and her family members are not notable on their own.</dd>
<dd>4. I don't agree that "proclaims" invites dispute. I think "espouses" would be a better word, though. She openly and often says she's a Christian, and mentions specific beliefs. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 14:01, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Just remember to make sure things are cited. We need to have a source where she states that she is a Christian, a source saying she is a controversial pundit/commentator/whatever (also in this case it would probably be good to use what the source calls her as long as it is NPOV). --<a href="../../../r/t/r/User%7ERtrev_b641.html" title="User:Rtrev">Rtrev</a> 16:24, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think "political commentator" would do better than "pundit". Oddly, "pundit" has both positive connotations, of genuine expertise, and and negative connotations of being a phoney who lacks genuine knowledge and insight but likes to yap on. So although "pundit" might be said to be balanced, it is not really neutral.<br />

<dd>It is "standard" in the sense that such material is not generally considered out of place in a biography. On the contrary, it is a part of any thorough biography. I don't doubt that examples of biographies that don't include such material are easy to find within WP, or elsewhere, but that does not show that the material is unfit for inclusion.<br />

<dd>Your assertions are noted, but disagreed with. Try to show some justification, other than your personal opinion, for including 1) her mother's maiden name and 2) mention of her siblings. IMHO, those things are unnecessary here, are not notable in themselves, and are not pertinent to Ann Coulter's notability. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 01:16, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lou, I'm not altogether sure what you mean by my "assertions". Please be more specific, if I have not guessed rightly. Also, your reply supposes that I've justified keeping the material in question with mere "personal opinion", which is not so.<br />
My guess is that by both "assertion" and "opinion" you mean my, "It is 'standard' in the sense that...", and my, "On the contrary...". These are not what you've called them. Rather, they are easy <i>observations</i> for anyone with a passing familiarity with biographies. Are you <i>actually</i> claiming that they are untrue?<br />
You've also raised three counter-points (at least in relation to, specifically, the giving of her mother's maiden name and the mention of her her siblings): that they are "unnecessary", that they "are not notable in themselves", and that they "are not pertinent to Coulter's notability". Assuming for argument's sake that those three things are true, it still would not follow that the material oughtn't be in the article. Particular bits of information in an article do not <i>need</i> to be absolutely "necessary" for the article. Indeed, we'd have precious little left in Wikipedia if we took such a bare-bones approach. But, much to the contrary, the whole WP outlook is to be <i>generous</i>, not niggardly, with information. Again, particular bits of information within an article do not <i>need</i> to be "notable", in themselves. "Notability" is a WP criterion (and not even a universally agreed criterion) for whether a topic may have its <i>own</i> WP article. The pieces of information making up an article don't <i>need</i> to be worthy of articles in their own right! (This ongoing abuse of "notability" as a pretext to strip information from this article has gotten quite out of hand.) Your third point fares no better, as the requirement that material be "pertinent to [the subject-person's] notability" only applies to dubious material. There's nothing particularly good, bad, or otherwise remarkable about, for instance, having two brothers.<br />

<dd>Lou, I'm not going to bother "supporting" the obvious unless you're actually attempting to deny it. A clear yea or nay from you, on that, would be helpful. Also, if you're claiming that it is somehow inapplicable to WP, you must explain how and why you reckon that is so. I can't respond to such a vague claim, beyond asking, "How do you figure?"<br />

<dd>I disagree with that proposed edit, because I think there is worth in making plain that this is what Coulter has <i>said</i> about her own background, not what has been determined by some other person. The same would go for anyone, for the same sort of reason that we use self-published works only with caution on WP. In Coulter's case it is more important than usual, though, whereas she has not been altogether truthful about such matters (e.g. the now-resolved matter of her age), and is known for saying things for effect. I don't see a need for quotes around "upper middle class", though, because it already says, "She has described...", and upper middle class is a commonly understood, uncontroversial term -- so it doesn't matter whether or not those were her exact words. The quotes around "union buster" ought stay, though, for the converse reason that it <i>is</i> a somewhat "colourful" term, and so it is important to indicate that Coulter, herself, used those very words.<br />
Incidentally, I gather that there is some question about whether she was born in NYC or in New Canaan.<br />

<dd>What is notable about her "upper middle class" birth? If it is being included simply because she said it, that is not notable in itself, its sort of a dog bites man bit and adds nothing to the article. Additionally, I dont see the point of mentioning too much detail on her parents. They are not what makes Coulter notable.

<dd>The material about her parents' names, the class of her family, the number and existence of her siblings, and the "union buster" status of her father is not notable in itself, and is not germane to Ann Coulter's notability. While such stuff is sometimes found in biographical encyclopedia articles, it usually isn't. (I've provided some illustrations of this, which were very easy to find.) Removing this material from the Ann Coulter article would improve the article by making it more encyclopedic, for the reasons stated in this paragraph. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 14:08, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lou: See my post of 07:10, 22 December 2006, to Sander. Wait a minute, that's <i>you</i>, isn't it!&#160;;-)<br />
Examples of bio articles that <i>don't</i> include such material do <i>not</i> show that it should be deleted from articles that <i>do</i> included it. That would only follow if we were to assume that the <i>reason</i> it is absent in those former cases must be that it is considered unfit for inclusion in WP biographies. Other possible reasons for such absence are rather obvious, and counter-examples to such a claim about WP biographies are easy to find. Consider the detailed family background given for <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._R._R._Tolkien_236d.html" title="J. R. R. Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>, lately a front page article. Or that given for <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Trudeau_6783.html" title="Pierre Trudeau">Pierre Trudeau</a>. Do you insist on a living example, too? Okay, try <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Chr%C3%A9tien_401f.html" title="Jean Chrétien">Jean Chrétien</a>. I hope that makes an end of this issue, here.<br />
In broader principle, though, we ought not be seeking pretexts to make WP <i>less</i> informative. -- Lonewolf BC 02:37, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Part of skillful editing is knowing what to leave out. Typical Wikipedia biographies of non-superstar contemporary writers and commentators do not name the subjects' non-notable parents or siblings, or even mention them, except in some notable context (do you know why?).

Lou: Once again, examples of biographies where information about family background is slight or lacking do <i>not</i> show that it is unfit material for a biography, nor even for the biography of a relatively minor person. The same goes for your (correct, I assume) statement that among biographies of relatively minor figures such information is slight or lacking more often than not. <i><a href="../../../n/o/n/Non_sequitur_%28logic%29.html" title="Non sequitur (logic)">It&#160;does&#160;not&#160;follow</a></i>. It does not follow unless we suppose that the <i>reason</i> such information is lacking is that it is considered unfit for inclusion. But to assume that is to <a href="../../../b/e/g/Begging_the_question.html" title="Begging the question">beg the question</a>, so this line of argument gets you nowhere. There are some rather obvious reasons why else such material should be lacking in such biographies: No one may have bothered to research it, or no one may have bothered to print it, if it has been researched or is otherwise known. There are heaps of WP-notable people out there, and finding out such stuff about a person <i>costs</i> something, as does printing it. Given that, is it really surprising that in many cases no reliable source has printed the information? No, it is not surprising. The contrary would be surprising -- nay, downright astounding.<br />
So, what ought we do when we <i>have</i> such information on someone? If we were paper-copy editors of some sort (newspaper, magazine, book, whatever), faced with limited space, we might well choose to leave it out, as not important enough to be worth the cost of printing and the loss of space that might be better used. But Wikipedia <i>is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#PAPER" title="WP:NOT">not paper</a></i>, and so we needn't worry about that. The only thing we need to worry about, for garden-variety family background stuff, is the verifiability of the information. (For living people, we <i>do</i> need to be a bit more careful about verifiability, in accord with <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, but this does not become a major issue unless there is some uncommon claim. If ever a reputable major newspaper publishes a story saying that Coulter was born as a boy, or was raised by the KGB, or killed and ate her pet horse at age 12, <i>then</i> we might have a dilemma.)<br />
-- Lonewolf BC 06:45, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Kizzle, no offence meant, guy, but I think that you, too, are falling into the "notability" trap that's be laid hereabout. For commonplaces such as having two brothers, we don't need to worry about "relevant to notability", much less about the "notability" of the item by itself. If the info is reliable, it's just fine to include it.<br />
"Relevance to notability", under the <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">biographies of living persons guidelines</a>, is a consideration (a) when using the <i>subject</i> as a source, (b) in cases of possibly biased or malicious content, (c) in the use of <i>primary</i> sources for biographies of public figures, and (d) for content in general about non-public figures. Coulter is a public figure, so (d) doesn't apply at all. Basic family stuff doesn't fall under (b), so that consideration can be laid aside too, in this case. That leaves (a) and (c), for which the upshot is that if the family stuff is from some reliable non-primary source then it can be included, even if it's what Coulter told that source herself, or if they got it from a primary source.<br />
As for "notability" itself, somehow the idea has worked its way into the editing of this article that the individual pieces of information in it need to be "notable", in themselves. Not so. "Notablility" is a WP criterion for whether a topic may have its <i>own</i> WP article. But the issue here is not whether we can have an article on "Ann Coulter's family background". It's only whether to include family background matter in the article on Anne Coulter. In essence, for unremarkable family background, provided it meets verifiability requirements, there is no reason to leave it out. But I'm repeating myself, aren't I.<br />
I'll say this again, though (not so much to you as in general): We ought not be seeking reasons to make this article, nor WP generally, <i>less</i> informative.<br />
Best regards, Lonewolf BC 06:45, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Notability" is not a trap, it's an established <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">guideline</a> as you say so yourself. Reliability is an important factor for inclusion, but it is not the only factor. I'm sure that a detailed report of Coulter's genealogy can be dug up along with her family tree, but what her grandparents did for work or other such hypothetical edits are not notable enough for a bio page on Coulter. If we followed your rule, then it opens the door for all sorts of minutiae. A brief mention of where she grew up as well as maybe what her parents did is ok. Think of what are the most important facts about Coulter's upbringing and limit them to a few paragraphs. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 22:12, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By "notability trap", I don't mean to suggest that the <i>actual</i> guidelines concerned are a "trap". The "trap" is the misconceptions about, and the misapplications (or abuse) of those guidelines, which I explained in my last comment. I'm sorry I was not clearer about that; I've edited my last comment to you slightly, to try to bring out that point a little better. I'm not denying the existence of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> -- obviously not, given that I referred to it (albeit not by name and without linking to it) in my last comment, just as you note in your last comment. I'm pointing out that in the editing of this article WP:N has somehow become twisted into a tool for improperly stripping pieces of information out of an article, when it is actually a guideline for whether a topic may have an article of its own -- an article of which it is the subject.</dd>
<dd>Your hypothetical about a genealogy is interesting. I agree that there comes a point at which ancestors and kinsfolk have so slight a bearing on the subject of a biography that including material on them is silly. Exactly where this limit ought fall is moot and, I think, variable from case to case. Myself, I think that information on people who affected a biography-subject's early life is reasonable to include in that subject's biography, and that this might, in some cases, include ancestors more remote than grandparents, although I've seen no indication that this is so in Coulter's case. An other might easily have a different view from mine. However, such differences of opinion are not so problematic, because for the purposes of Wikipedia the issue is self-regulating, based on sourcing requirements: In Coulter's case, if a reliable, non-primary source were to publish "the genealogy of Ann Coulter", then her genealogy would be fit content for her biographical article. Moreover, if multiple, independent, reliable non-primary sources were each to publish a "genealogy of Ann Coulter", there could be a WP article devoted to that very topic. WP guidelines disallow using primary sources to build such a genealogy and then adding it to the article, though, partly on grounds of privacy, even for a public figure such as Coulter, and partly because, genealogical work being what it is, creating a genealogy from primary sources would be original research. This all is an interesting hypothetical, but I doubt it shall become realised.</dd>
<dd>I agree that the ideal coverage of Coulter's upbringing would be "a few [short] paragraphs" on "the most important facts" about it. Whereas the present material falls well short of that, there's no good cause for taking such material out. -- Lonewolf BC 10:51, 26 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think you're missing what I'm trying to say&#160;:). Family trees and genealogy reports are not exactly the hardest facts to come by, thus reliability can be satisfied quite easy as to Coulter's genealogy. I guess you <i>could</i> create a genealogy of Ann Coulter page, but coming just from my prediction, the article would be boring as shite. However, I think we're on the same page about due weight given to Coulter's upbringing, and if you think that a fact satisfying <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> is something we should really know about Coulter given the few paragraph limit and is phrased in a neutral way, then I'll be happy. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 23:55, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The new image should be removed immediately since, legally, it does not meet Wikipedia's copyright guidelines (it appears to be a hack job from the web site anncoulter.org) and, aesthetically, it represents a heavily cropped and caricatured likeness of the subject. <a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELooksharp_9463.html" title="User:Looksharp">Looksharp</a> 05:57, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just wanted to say Merry Christmas to all Coulter-lovers, Coulter-neutral, and Coulter-hater people out there!&#160;:) --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 04:34, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Archive Time?</span></h2>
<p>It seems like it's time to archive this page. Recent archives have included about two months' worth of discussion, and our two months are up. November and December would make a nice archive. Whoever knows how to do it should spell out the dates, as there is confusion about Month First or Day First in some of the recent archives. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 17:39, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
