<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mass delete of criticism section</span></h2>
<p>(Text temp-moved to <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Coulter_criticism_2efd.html" title="Ann Coulter/criticism">Ann Coulter/criticism</a>)</p>
<p>The criticism section consisted of several passages of text of the form:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coulter says this, but the reality is this.</li>
</ul>
<p>This essentially makes Wikipedia endorse the POV that Coulter is wrong. Which obviously violates our policy.</p>
<p>It would be fine if <b>any number of named critics</b> each were quoted as saying they disagreed with Coulter. Or if we merely summarized the views of these critics.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Al Franken says Coulter misinterprets stuff, takes quotes out of context, etc. (Here are a few examples he gives from <i>Lies and Liars</i>.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Somebody</b> (but say who, please) gave a rejoinder to her "liberal idle rich" remark, asserting that Republicans are just as rich (richer?).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Rush Limbaugh says she goes too far (need source for this)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not sure what to do with Franken's crack, "...hysterical right". Is this a criticism? Or just name-calling? Should it go first, as a kind of intro to his arguments? If Franken is asserting that the right is "hysterical", what does he mean by this? Is he dismissing ALL right-wing criticism of liberals? (Right wingers are crazy, they just can't see the truth.)</p>
<p>Where to go from here:</p>
<p>Any part that can be salvaged can go back in, properly sourced and cast in neutral language. Nothing of the form <i>Coulter claims this but is clearly wrong</i> can go back, unless attributed to a source: e.g., <i><b>Some people contest Coulter's claim that liberals constitute an "idle rich". These people argue that....</b></i> 19:27, Mar 2, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hard to argue that Canada's not participating in the vietnam war, or the voting habits versus income structure of the us are merely matters of point of view. Therefore I returned ann's disagreement with the common reality on these topics to the article. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 04:11, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>That's not the point. Nobody here is disputing whether Canada participated in the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>. The point is whether Wikipedia may support the POV of the anti-Coulter crowed that <b>Coulter distorts facts and refuses to concede error</b>. It's better to couch it in terms like the following, which I propose to add to the article:</p>
<ul>
<li>On several occasions, other commentators and writers have taken issue with Coulter's handling of historical facts. For example, on a talk show she made reference to "Canada not sending troops to Vietnam" and refused to agree with the interviewer's rejoinder that "Canada had indeed sent troops to Vietnam" (see <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada_and_the_Vietnam_War_b5d5.html" title="Canada and the Vietnam War">Canada and the Vietnam War</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If we put it like this, the <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Coulter_3c97.html" title="Ann Coulter">Ann Coulter</a> article neither supports nor condemns the view that Coulter made a mistake and refused to accept correction. But it also supplies an easily-checked reference so that the reader can make up their own mind.</p>
<p>The important issue is that Wikipedia articles should remain neutral and avoid taking sides in disputes. There is, as I believe you will agree, a dispute between Coulter herself and the "anti-Coulter" crowd about how accurate her remarks are. It is this point on which I urge you to help me make the article neutral.</p>
<p>I have no objection to making it <b>easy</b> for readers to check the facts about any specific example of Coulter's alleged sloppiness with facts. Add dozens of these, if you like. I'll even help you! But please just avoid having the article say outright (or even imply) that <i>Coulter makes many mistakes and refuses correction</i>. That <b>conclusion</b> should only come from the mouth of a critic. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">-- Uncle Ed</a> <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_Poor_6f26.html" title="User talk:Ed Poor">(talk)</a> 16:50, Mar 3, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This text has been "temporarily" moved to <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Coulter_criticism_2efd.html" title="Ann Coulter/criticism">Ann Coulter/criticism</a> for a month now, are there any further plans to work on it? If not, I'm going to merge it back into the main article. Articles shouldn't be split along lines of POV like this. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 07:06, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Another month passed without comment. It's now been merged back into the main article. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 08:31, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Main_point_that_her_critics_make" id="Main_point_that_her_critics_make"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Main point that her critics make</span></h2>
<p>We should try to figure out the main point (or points) that Coulter's critics make. Near as I can tell from superficial link-following, is that they make the following case:</p>
<ol>
<li>Coulter plays fast and loose with the facts.</li>
<li>Coulter's sloppiness with the facts is egregious.</li>
<li>Coulter makes up stuff which is <b>clearly, obviously</b> false.</li>
<li>Her claim about Canada having "sent troops" to Vietnam is a typical example of her pattern of distorting history.</li>
<li>Therefore, she should be dismissed as a shrill, nonesense spouting mean-spirited bitch.</li>
</ol>
<p>(This is only a first draft, maybe I could leave out the b-word, eh? But I think I've captured the gist of the argument.)</p>
<p>Now how shall we characterize this?</p>
<ul>
<li>Coulter's critics <b>rightly</b> charge her with being sloppy with details or outright lies; the Canada thing <b>proves that these critics are right</b></li>
<li>Coulter's critics <b>claim</b> that she is sloppy with details and even indulges in outright lies. They <b>cite</b> the Canada thing in support of their claim.</li>
<li>Coulter's critics are trying to discredit her with claims that she falsifies history and refuses to accept correction; she'll lie right to your face. The Canada thing shows that <b>these critics are wrong</b>, and are engaging in exactly the sort of tactics she <b>rightly</b> accuses <b>them</b> of.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd call the first, siding with Coulter's critics; the second, taking a NPOV; the third, siding with Coulter. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">-- Uncle Ed</a> <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_Poor_6f26.html" title="User talk:Ed Poor">(talk)</a> 20:38, Mar 3, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hooray for Uncle Ed! You surely put it right there, din't you? She's a mean-spirited bitch allright, KEEP THE CURSE WORD'S FOR FUCK'S SAKE, they spice up the argument! Screw that driveling wench Ann Coulter! Oh, and please LET ME ADD: Don't you fuckin' think of wanting to add more "unbiased" gleeness about her, being positive is impossible! There's like, TOTALLY nothing good about her. Being utterly negative is the only option, permanently, for a neutral stancepoint is out of the question! Perhaps she should not be WRITTEN to as this and that, but trying to dig up positive facts is second to zero. THERE IS NOTHING BUT ILL THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THIS CUNT. And I will -NOT- pardon my language!--<a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleMaster_fbc4.html" title="User:OleMaster">OleMurder</a> 10:10, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm hoping OleMaster is aware of the irony of using Coulter's own methods of verbally abusing the people/supporters of insert-topic-here in question in his arguments in favour of Wikipedia supporting a bias against Anne Coulter. The fact that, at least in Canada, she's usually viewed as something of a crackpot doesn't mean that she should be called such in a theoretically unbiased work. If she really IS that crazy, then the information will make that quite clear, and I think for the most part it does. People who AREN'T aware of the irony should note that usually the validity of a person's is argument is never so questioned as when it relies entirely on the defamation of the character of a person making an opposing argument.</p>
<p><a name="Points_of_view" id="Points_of_view"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Points of view</span></h2>
<p>Coulter's critics have one point of view, and her defenders have another. Wikipedia should not censor these points of view (POV). If you disagree, please say why; don't just censor. Thank you. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">-- Uncle Ed</a> <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_Poor_6f26.html" title="User talk:Ed Poor">(talk)</a> 17:39, Mar 8, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Victor Levant, author of <i>Quiet Complicity</i>, wrote: "Ten thousand young Canadian men fought in the US armed forces in the war." <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Rhodes/1588/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Rhodes/1588/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Coulter complains that the CBC took 30 seconds out of a lengthy interview and magnified a small quibble to discredit her. Did "Canada" meaning the Canadian Government officially send troops in Canadian uniform under command of Canadian active-duty officers? I'm not sure; maybe not. But did "Canada" (the nation, the land, the body of people) send anyone to fight? Certainly.</p>
<p>Was Coulter 100% wrong? That's for each reader to decide for themselves. Wikipedia should not say the interviewer "corrected" her because that endorses the view that <b>she was wrong</b>. Moreover, nearly all the quotes in the Quotations section are being used by Coulter opponents (some of them Wikipedians) to imply that Coulter blatantly makes up falsehoods and therefore can be utterly disregarded.</p>
<p>We should not <b>cooperate with</b> or <b>endorse</b> this anti-Coulter campaign but describe it fairly. THere is a dispute between anti-Coulter forces and her defenders over what her "wild" remarks mean. Anti-Coulter says it proves she's mostly wrong. Pro-Coulter says her <b>phrasing</b> might not be spot on, but she was close enough.</p>
<p>Coulter was arguing that (a) Canada helped a lot during Vietnam but (b) is not helping as much now. The interviewer pounced on her "sent troops" remark. Bloggers all over are publicizing that <i>did not, did too</i> exchange as <b>proof that Coulter makes mistakes and refuses correction</b>. Wikipedia should not endorse or oppose this campaign, but merely report on it.</p>
<p>There <b>*is*</b> a campaign to discredit Coulter. Wikipedia should report on this campaign. It should not say her critics are wrong for trying to discredit her (and that she is right). Nor should it say that they are right (and that she is wrong). It should just do what Larry Sanger, Wikipedia co-founder said: describe the dispute fairly. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">-- Uncle Ed</a> <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_Poor_6f26.html" title="User talk:Ed Poor">(talk)</a> 20:32, Mar 8, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Uncle Ed, I'm trying to see both sides of this. But this your recent addition just strikes me as "apologist" (emphasis mine below):</p>
<dl>
<dd>The following quotes are <b>mostly</b> in a style <b>apparently</b> calculated to irritate opponents deliberately, and nearly all of them have given offense to one opponent or another.</dd>
<dd>* <b>Some</b> of these quotes are <b>flamboyant or tongue-in-cheek</b>, others are in a polemical style. Many <b>appear to be meant</b> as <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satire.html" title="Satire">satire</a> or <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperbole.html" title="Hyperbole">hyperbole</a> (Coulter has stated, "Liberals love to pretend they don't understand hyperbole.")</dd>
<dd>* <b>Some commentators</b> make no distinction between her tongue-in-cheek remarks and her straightforward ones. <b>They take them</b> all equally seriously, citing Coulter's remark, "I believe everything I say."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Lots of ascribing motive with no evidence, and lots of hedges with "some" and "mostly."

<p>You said (further above) that my text:</p>
<ul>
<li>presents the anti-Coulter case as resting on a shaky foundation of "sound bites" and implies that there's nothing substantial to the arguments, as they are merely based on a couple scare quotes.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can't argue with <i>how it looks to you</i>. I assume good faith on your part, so if the way I wrote it amounts to a condemnation of the anti-Coulter case, then I've written it badly! Please help me to re-write that text:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to avoid making Wikipedia endorse the view that the anti-Coulter case "rests on a shaky foundation", because that's just as bad (in the opposite direction) as saying that the anti-Coulter case is well founded.</li>
<li>Likewise, I want to avoid implying that there's "nothing substantial" to the anti-Coulter argument.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the risk of going on a tangent, though, may I say that I had no intention of arguing that the anti-Coulter case was based on a <b>small number</b> of scare quotes. The article has <b>dozens</b> of them. It's not the number to which I object. It's the insinuation that these quotes are <b>representative</b> of Coulter. It seems plain to me that NONE of these quotes were selected to portray her in a good light. Rather, the quotations section violates the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Wikipedia%7EOriginal_research_757d.html" title="Wikipedia:Original research">Wikipedia:original research</a> policy. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">-- Uncle Ed</a> <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_Poor_6f26.html" title="User talk:Ed Poor">(talk)</a> 16:11, Mar 9, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>What has happened is that the focus has been shifted from the original, which was 'Ann Coulter just makes crap up' as universally viewed by folks on the leftish side, 'And here are some examples' to instead make it appear that there were precisely two occasions on which she is suspected of this and one of them is still being debated. This is not an accurate depiction of the Ann Coulter Controversy. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 18:26, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>At least two of these Franken quotes need to go, as I said before this section is too heavily weighted with Franken quotes. So let's vote (1,2,3, or 4).</li>
</ul>
<p>1.Al Franken in his Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them argues that Coulter misrepresents the articles she cites, and devotes two chapters to what he believes are false and misleading statements in her Slander.</p>
<p>2.Franken also asserts that, although a newspaper's editorials represent its chosen position, Coulter treats any sentence found anywhere in The New York Times as reflecting the newspaper's official opinion. He claims that if a New York Times book review asks people on both sides of an issue to give their opinions, Coulter will represent any quotation she finds offensive as the official position of the newspaper.</p>
<p>Ann Coulter counters by arguing that Franken's chapters contain false accusations, and suggesting that liberal newspapers are prone to make errors of omission that can be much more serious. (Coulter, 2003)</p>
<p>3.As an example of Franken's criticism, he mentions a comment in Slander which states "Bush had won any count" of the 2000 Florida recount, and cites a Washington Post article with the contrary headline, "Study Finds Gore Might Have Won Statewide Tally of All Uncounted Ballots". It could be argued that this is a misrepresentation, but it could also be argued that by "any count", Coulter meant any count that had been actually legally pursued by the Democrats rather than hypothetical cases (See U.S. Presidential Election, 2000: The Florida Ballot Project recounts).</p>
<p>4.Franken also asserts, based on a September 6, 2002, Washington Post article [3] (<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A43120-2002Sep5?language=printer" class="external free" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A43120-2002Sep5?language=printer" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A43120-2002Sep5?language=printer</a>), that there is a discrepency between the birthdate on Coulter's Connecticut driver's license and her District of Columbia driver's license. According to the Post article and Franken, the Connecticut license states that Coulter was born in 1961 whereas the District of Columbia license states she was born in 1963. Furthermore, Franken and the Post article claim that Coulter's voter registration in Connecticut states she was born in 1961. Franken claims this is evidence that Coulter deliberately provided an incorrect birth year on at least one government form and thus committed perjury.</p>
<p>I'm voting 4 should stay since it is actually cited.</p>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>So a Washington Post headline says there's a study that states that Coulter <b>might</b> have been wrong. This criticism is too nitpicky to include in my opinion. I suggest that it be taken out. Surely someone will come up with some real critcism at some point.--<a href="../../../1/9/8/User%7E198.93.113.49.html" title="User:198.93.113.49">198.93.113.49</a> 15:22, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, the content of the article itself <i>is contrary</i> to Coulter's view that "Bush had won any count"... given a full recount of the state of Florida, Gore would have won, only under the partial recounts (suggested by Gore) did Gore lose. So maybe we can rephrase and quote directly from the article itself, I'll do this when I have time. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 17:01, Jun 2, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If there is documentation that shows that what you say is true it should be in the article. If there is not the criticism should be taken out.

<dd>A lot of the Franken stuff is rather nitpicky. I took out a paragraph about her allegedly lying about her age which seemed the least important to me. There are some more general criticisms of her that aren't included here, but I'm hesitant to include them considering the reaction to the racism paragraph. One I'd like to add is criticism by feminists/pro-feminists of her attitudes toward women. --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades.tk</a> 17:33, Jun 2, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think criticisms of her attitude toward women would be very appropriate.

I'd propose replacing the entire Quotations section with something along these lines:</dd>
<dd>Ann Coulter is noted for many memorable statements that some regard as outlandish, including a statement after 9-11 that (regarding Muslims) "We should kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity.", "Canada is lucky we [the United States] allow them to exist on the same continent", that Liberals hate America and questioning the benefits of women voting. Many view her statements as examples of a tongue-in-cheek use of hyperbole or satire, while others take them more seriously. Coulter herself once stated, "Liberals love to pretend they don't understand hyperbole." However, she has also stated, "I believe everything I say." <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/low_res/story.jsp?story=551959&amp;host=3&amp;dir=81" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.independent.co.uk/low_res/story.jsp?story=551959&amp;host=3&amp;dir=81" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></dd>

Please explain why this article warrants a full list of quotations fully cited and dated and say, the Gandhi article or the Dan Quayle article does not.

<dd>If the Dan Quayle and Gandhi articles don't have quotes sections, then I personally feel those articles are incomplete. I can think of two or three things that each man said that should be included in an encyclopedia article just off the top of my head. Coulter's section will be large by comparison, not because she is more important than Quayle or Gandhi, but while someone like Gandhi made himself notable by his actions, Coulter's profession is shooting her mouth off. Entire controversies have revolved around just one of these quotes, and to not include them is ommitting important information. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 04:50, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

We are in agreement about the nature Coulter's 'profession' raises the importance of her statements relative to her particular importance, which is why I proposed the wording above that mentions some of her quotes in passing. I attempted to summarize her most infamous and contraversial quotes, at least the ones that struck me as particularly infamous. If you feel that this incomplete and omits other critical 'goodies', please propose expansion and/or alternative wording.

<dd>I agree, but a small list of quotes does not make this article a "repository". Controversies should be described, and the first step in that is providing the full quotation and source of the quote that caused the controversy in the first place. A paragraph that summarizes some of them in passing is not adequate, nor is such a summary necessary since we can simply list them since <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_paper_aa2d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a> and we have plenty of room.

<dd>Four or five quotations should be enough to give the flavor of Coulter. The information is not being removed, it is in another part of the project, a link away. The purpose of an encyclopedia is to summarize, not to provide source material. These quotes are not lasting epigrams of wisdom and wit -they're glib, slightly outrageous, political barbs.

<dd>The big problem with putting the quotes in the form of a quotations section is that it effectively invites would-be editors to treat it as a complete list. When I first saw the list, it was about as large -- if not larger -- than the corresponding article in Wikiquote. Secondly; placing the quotes directly in the article is simply redundant in quite a few cases. Pretty much the entire article other than quotations and her background is about the contraversies she's created and some also state the quotes right in the text. --<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBletch_389c.html" title="User:Bletch">Bletch</a> 00:18, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not nearly everyone who comes to Wikipedia goes to Wikiquote as well, thus I think it would be relevant to include a quotes section here, the actual number of which can be debated. I personally was fascinated with most of them when I first saw this page, and would have hungered for more if I had seen only 4 quotes initially. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 02:57, Mar 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>True, but it does indicate that an article should not function a repository of quotes. It is clear that the current section qualifies as such. I made a proposal that improves the article by eliminating that role. If you do not like it, it would be constructive if you could propose an alternative wording or subsitute. --<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBletch_389c.html" title="User:Bletch">Bletch</a> 16:10, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I still think you need a lot of quotes to depict Coulter. Without the quotes, what is she? A skinny blond with a short skirt? <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 17:25, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I think that it is pretty obvious that removing the quotes section and placing 4-5 quotes under her rhetorical style does not reduce the article to "Ann Coulter is a skinny blonde with a short skirt." Keep in mind that many of her other quotes and their related contraversies are detailed elsewhere in the article, so it isn't like my changes eliminated all but four quotes. The real question is why does there need to be a <i>complete</i> list of quotes in this article. When I selected those four quotes, I've attempted to be representative and illustrate that the seems willing to make pretty outlandish statements on a wide variety of subjects. Can I ask a question: In your mind, how much is 'a lot of quotes', and why does that apply to Coulter and not to other notable quoteables? --<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBletch_389c.html" title="User:Bletch">Bletch</a> 17:56, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why is the onus to eliminate quotes as guilty unless proved innocent? What is the motivation to eliminate the quotes? That the article is too long? Not by Wikipedia standards. That there are too many quotes? Why? That they are redundant? They are organized into subject matter. I'll go the other way, look them over and see if some are redundant in each topic. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 17:11, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>OK, I took out a few quotes and reorganized things a bit, so that the general communications style section encompasses these specific instances as subsections rather than main points, also tried to reword some of it to make it less POV. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a>

<dd>The 'onus' is that as presented in this article, the quotes section is redundant - it duplicates Wikiquote's function. Previously, pure raw quotes encompassed 50% of the article, though that share has gone down over the last week. In case that I wasn't already clear, I have zero problem with (in fact I favor) having large sections that analyze and dissect specific contraversies generated by her statements, like the section on Canada and the Vietnam war (though I personally am neutral on the current contraversy of the exact wording.) Of course, such sections are ripe for POV issues but they can be handled in the usual way. --<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBletch_389c.html" title="User:Bletch">Bletch</a> 18:54, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I hate to re-spark an old controversy, but I just stumbled across it and I must say I agree with Bletch - this quote section is very large and not really appropriate IMO considering the redundancy and project goals of Wikiquote. How about removing all the raw quotes (or moving them to Wikiquote where they aren't already duplicates), and then in the paragraph describing the quotes explicitly refer the reader to Wikiquote to go and read them? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 07:19, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I stongly disagree. Ann Coulter is known for her strong opinions. Without them no one would knwo her from Adam. Therefore, understanding what she thinks and what she says is key to understanding, her, her fame, and her following. There's no clearer or more accurate way to do this than by quoting her. Otherwise, were left with other peoples opinions about what her views are. Why not just simply quote her. The counter to this seems to be that that can be accomplished with less quotes. I don't beleive that it can. Any politcal figure will make 5 or 6 controversial statement in his or her career. What's special about Coulter is that she will make 5 or 6 controversial statements in a month. The clearest and fairest way to demonstate this is to simple quote her. (unsigned statement)</dd>

<dd>Coulter is known <i>precisely</i> because of such quotes, they are illustrative of the very reason the article exists. In contrast, Dan Quayle is notable for other reasons, and thus an extended quote section is not necessary for appreciating his notability. In short, Coulter is different in that her words go directly to her notability, and so form an integral part of a well-developed article. -- bill (unregistered)</dd>

<dd>Gzukier, if the quote you deleted that she made about the left-wing media bias "didn't add as much to the picture as much as the other quotes", then the only "picture" YOU are trying to present is that of her <i>expressions</i> of hostility towards the media without allowing Coulter to give any kind of <i>reason</i>--from which the material she draws is ample--behind it whatsoever! There were <i>three</i> quotes expressing disdain of the media, all expressing the identical sentiment, and you delete the one quote that begins to explain why she feels that way. 216.119.136.151
<dl>
<dd>That's actually a relevant point (the one you just made). Didn't think of it when deleting the quote.<a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 05:31, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Its an especially damning indication of bias since you are the one who set up the topic outline for the quotes in the first place to include a section on journalism. And the icing on the cake is that this isn't the first time--you had previously said that <i>all</i> she makes jokes about is the injury to her enemies <a href="../../../a/n/n/Talk%7EAnn_Coulter_1918.html#Ann_Coulter_is_racist_and_sexist" title="Talk:Ann Coulter">Talk:Ann Coulter#Ann Coulter is racist and sexist</a>, when its actually the case that it's just <i>all</i> you find important about her opinion on journalism when she's a #1 best-selling author of a book on media bias! 216.119.136.151</dd>
<dd>Gzukier, you can't shed light on something you haven't established to begin with. And the quote wouldn't show hypocrisy about promiscuity unless you jumped to conclusions about the meaning of the quote which is what the source of the out-of-context quote was hoping he would dupe you into doing. What <i>is</i> the source for that quote? Is it the same source that <a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">User:Kizzle</a> used to conclude that Coulter "sleeps around"? (See <a href="../../../a/n/n/Talk%7EAnn_Coulter_1918.html#Ann_Coulter_is_racist_and_sexist" title="Talk:Ann Coulter">Talk:Ann Coulter#Ann Coulter is racist and sexist</a>) And if we discover what that source is, wouldn't you agree that we should remove ALL the quotes that that unreliable source has provided to the article, since it has already misled two editors and who knows how many readers about an important aspect of Coulter's character and reputation? 216.119.136.151
<dl>
<dd>I don't think quotes in general should be taken out of context. Thus the removal of this one. Is that the case for other quotes? Or is it one of those 'oh she was clearly just joking when she said would that the military were targeting journalists' things?<a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 05:31, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The point, Gzukier, is that <b>Wikipedia shouldn't use unreliable sources</b> including, I might add, editors that jump to conclusions because of that source and won't check the facts.

<dd>Gzukier, are you projecting your own failures to comprehend on to everyone else, to make yourself feel better? That kind of capacity for spite would be a good explanation of why someone who doesn't understand Coulter's humor would take steps to make sure that no one else would feel comfortable understanding it either--by means of trying to tarnish her good name 216.119.136.151 20:46, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>By deleting a printers' mark that 90% of the population wouldn't recognize? So that's what's giving Coulter so much bad press. Maybe you'd better take it up with the guy who replaced it thinking it was 'line noise'. (I thought it was just sloppy fingers, myself).

<dd>I disagree. Coulter isn't a public official, who has a history of good or bad decisions that need to be reported. She's prominent solely as a commentator. It's therefore appropriate to give more coverage to quotations from her writing than would be the case in an article about a President or a Senator. We should include quotations, fairly selected to convey her views, her reasoning, and her style. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 04:43, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Apparently, it's impossible for Coulter fans to find any set of quotes from her which would not portray her negatively. Yet, she is a 'bestselling author'. Go figure. Maybe we should just remove everything down to her birthdate. Of course, she has given two different birthdates publicly, so I suppose that's got to go too. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 05:31, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Gzukier, what do you mean "It's impossible for Coulter <b>fans</b> to find any set of quotes which would not portray her negatively"? We are supposed to be editors of what is factual, not public relations agents manipulating an image of Coulter for the purpose of making people like or dislike her. This mandate is what the NPOV policy is all about. Are you calling the editors here who haven't revealed a preference for Coulter one way or another <b>fans</b> in order make your own obvious biases less conspicuous? You've even admitted it; you called your first major edit here a "rant" leaving it to others to do the work to clean up the mess you made of that section of the article. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.154.26.251.html" title="User:64.154.26.251">64.154.26.251</a></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removal of Quotations, Again</span></h2>
<p>The long list of quotes, almost an entire reproduction from Wikiquote is unprecedented in any other article found in Wikipedia.

<dd>The only reason Coulter is notable at all is her writing style. Quotations play a much greater role in conveying important information about her than about other article subjects. How is it biased to quote her own words? If the quotation is inaccurate, fix it. If it's unfairly taken out of context, expand it or include additional material to present it properly. If there are other quotations that round out the picture of her commentary, add them. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 19:21, 2 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I have never seen another example where defenders of someone want to remove as much information about them as possible. Are you saying that the quotes are taken out of context, or are POV in themselves? So what if other articles do different things, this is wikipedia not the justice system. Each article requires its own intracies, for Ann Coulter, it is helpful for the reader to see her polemic style. I seriously don't get why this amount of quotes is bad. So what, go get other quotes that you feel would balance her out, like take some from the time article or something, but why remove information that directly came out of her mouth? Sheesh! And I don't follow your accusation of original research in the slightest. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 21:57, May 2, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Are you suggesting we can only quote her by proxy of other people quoting her? Why do you suggest content between Wikiquote and Wikipedia cannot be duplicated in some respects? And also, what <i>is</i> notable in Wikipedia is not any single one of these quotes, but the collection as a whole which educates the reader on her polemic style.

<dd>To my knowledge, there is no guideline for selcting quotes, but those selected quotes do not belong here, they belong in Wikiquote. No other article in Wikipedia is so full of quotes drom a particular individual who also has an enty in Wikiquote, and no one has shown me otherwise. Unless someone can provide me with a reason that all these quotes belong in the article and not in Wikiquote, and no one has yet to provide me with a sufficiently good reason based on precident in an other article, I really am at a loss to see how the ammount of quotes here does not bias the article in a certain negative POV. What is notable in Wikipedia has to be based on an outside reference, notability is not solely up to the determination of editors. Any particular quote from Coulter which has drawn fire from her critics may be fair game, but the assertion that this particular collection of quotes <i>educates the reader on her polemic style</i> is subjective and not supported by any outside reference. So either provide some indication from an outside source that this particular collection <i>educates the reader on her polemic style</i> or this will fall under the category of original research. <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">TDC</a> 04:03, May 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm seeing more and more of this resort to the "no original research" policy in wholly inappropriate ways. Thousands of Wikipedia articles involve the selection of facts on the basis of notability. In every case I know of, notability is indeed "solely up to the determination of editors". We require outside sources for the facts. We don't require citation of some outside source saying, "This statement is not only true but it's particularly important as well." Instead, we discuss the different factors that affect notability. That a fact has been highlighted by critics would be one such but not the only one.</dd>

<dd>Asked and answered. Coulter is unlike 99.99% of our article subjects in that her notability derives almost entirely from her propensity to toss off quotations like these. If articles about other similarly situated people have had all the quotes excised, I'd favor including a few there, too, even if there's a full set in Wikiquote. (I just took a quick look at <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorothy_Parker_f8a9.html" title="Dorothy Parker">Dorothy Parker</a>. I think that article should quote a few of her aphorisms, to give the reader an idea of her style, though the analogy isn't exact because the specific quotations are less important to a biography of Parker.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, since you're so keen on challenging other editors to find similar examples, I'll give you a challenge. Find some other fairly detailed Wikipedia biographical articles where the selection of facts to be mentioned -- not just the confirmation of the information, but the determination that those facts are notable and merit inclusion -- is based solely on objective criteria; where a critic for the <i>New York Times</i> or some similar outside source has pronounced each specific fact to be an important one. (By the way, what are the objective criterion for deciding which critics or experts are sage enough to give opinions that constitute objective criteria?) Of course it's not a matter of "the sole discretion of the user", but it's also not a straightforward process like determining whether she spells her name "Ann" or "Anne", which is what you seem to be implying. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 06:37, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Doesn't the basic assumption that quotes from Coulter are biased against her and the more quotes the more bias strike anyone as a bit bizarre? Would anyone use the same argument if the Shakespeare article seemed to have too many quotes? If the Abraham Lincoln article did?

<dd>TDC, thanks for your input. I should tell you up front that I provided four of the quotes used in the article. As the article says, Coulter relishes the role of a controversialist. <i>Some</i> controversial quotes are definitely relevant as indicative of the controversies she involves herself in. In fact two of the quotes I provided were from a promotional advertisement for her book, and one was from a talking Ann Coulter doll she promoted on her website.</dd>

<dd>Coulter is also known to respond in interviews with buffoonish satire of those who use verbal attacks to engage, stun or misdirect their audience by conjuring up a dramatic departure from the ordinary. Unfortunately a certain individual has compiled a list of these satirical remarks and presented them, along with others, stripped of their original context, having the effect of misleading those who read them, and delighting those who oppose Coulter. From this collection of 31 mainly out-of-context quotes, editors have attempted to introduce 20 of them, and 13 (one half of the total quotes in the article) that remain in the article are found in this unreliable source, and 11 of these are unconfirmed by any other source. I have been meaning to remove them, but have not had the time.</dd>

<dd>TDC, I'm sorry I didn't read your argument carefully enough. As for your argument that we shouldn't define Coulter's work, I think what we are really doing is defining her style. The section divisions (On Safety Nets, On Women, etc.) may be misleading in that they seem to imply a definitive opinion is to follow. I have always regarded them in a semi-humorous light. It reads as if someone were choosing various general topics and then letting Coulter expound improvisationally on them. The problem comes when an unreliable source is used to produce content that's all the same (for example, by only selecting her "slash-and-burn" humor out of context) in one of the topics.</dd>

<dd>Other valid criteria would include: quotations that exemplify aspects of her style; quotations that have attracted a lot of media attention; and, based on your comment above, quotations that are verbatim accurate but that have been taken out of context by Coulter critics and used to paint a misleading picture. In that last category, we should of course, as kizzle says, provide the context. We would be doing a service to the reader by explaining a quotation that the reader might encounter, without the explanation, on some other site. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 07:27, 8 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the suggestions, James. I should warn everyone however, that all 11 of the unconfirmed quotes are from television shows and are thus very difficult to provide context for. What I did was research the story behind one of the quotations mentioned, that someone by sheer coincidence had provided on Wikiquote. For other quotes it's easy to build a circumstantial case that they are out of context and even what the context was from the facts known about Coulter's opinions and her known style of argument. For others it's more difficult.</dd>

<dd>People say that Jon Stewart has blurred the line between news and humor, but his Daily Show airs on a comedy channel. Coulter goes on actual news programs and deploys so much sarcasm and hyperbole that she sounds more like comedian Dennis Miller on one of his rants than Limbaugh. Consider an exchange on Fox News in June 2001 with Peter Fenn, a Democratic strategist. At the time, Barbra Streisand had suggested that Californians practice more conservation, to which Coulter responded:
<dl>
<dd>COULTER: God gave us the earth.</dd>
<dd>FENN: Oh, O.K.</dd>
<dd>COULTER: We have dominion over the plants, the animals, the seas.</dd>
<dd>FENN: Oh, this is a great idea.</dd>
<dd>COULTER: God said, ‘Earth is yours. Take it. Rape it. It’s yours.’</dd>
<dd>FENN: Oh, terrific. We’re Americans, so we should consume as much of the earth’s resources—</dd>
<dd>COULTER: Yes. Yes!</dd>
<dd>FENN: —as fast as we possibly can.</dd>
<dd>COULTER: As opposed to living like the Indians.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Coulter and Fenn were both laughing. But her rape-the-planet bit would later be wrenched from context and repeatedly quoted as Coulter nuttiness. “What p_____ me off,” Coulter says, “is when they don’t get the punch line.”</dd>

<dd>How else do we discern between those who quote Coulter fairly and those who quote her out of context simply because they want us to dislike her? Coulter likes to do a parody of the style of a strident Hollywood liberal insulated from reality and given to flights of drama. She also realized that that aspect of her persona was ironically being used against her by liberals who didn't get the parody or by liberals who did who were resentful of it and/or wanted to curb her influence.</dd>

<dd>At least once Coulter even baited people to quote her out of context by making a remark in a hostile, strident, recklessly self-dramatizing style with no context whatsoever so that her more careful readers could laugh at the picture of the reactionary gloating by liberals who felt lucky to have "discovered" the quote that was sure to follow. Don't Wikipedia editors likewise have an obligation to use their intelligence to generally avoid either being played for dupes and/or to allow their article to have its truth subverted in order to retaliate against its subject through personal or political vendettas?</dd>

<dd>For the record, I agree with the statement posted further up that 'no original research' is being badly abused here and elsewhere; I would be in favor of both the editor who tracks down the context of quotes (although probably it would be more productive to provide the context as a rebuttal rather than to delete the second hand quote)</dd>

<dd>I don't think it's so much a matter of balance - at least it isn't to me. I just find the vast number of quotes superfluous, to say the least. I haven't seen any other Wiki article so filled with quotes (not to mention any article in any 'real' encyclopedia). Really, all it takes is a link to the Wikiquote page, and this article would then be trimmed by quite a bit. --<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatton1138_c8fd.html" title="User:Patton1138">patton1138</a> 22:52, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Structure of Writing / Removal of POV</span></h2>
<p>It seems that the only people editing this article have a POV. The entire article after the first paragraph is POV. If the whole article is not to be removed, then some way must be found to provide balance to the paragraphs. Normally, news articles handle this by placing a quote or portion of evidence supporting one POV followed by a critique. I think this would be most effective. For example, on a particular book, it is appopriate to include a review summarizing the impact from one POV and followed by a critique from another POV. Finding obscure facts to support some position may be the risk, but it is a lot better than blatant POV.</p>

<dd>You said it yourself: She is foul. The reason the quotes are unflattering is because she can't make an appearance on television or write a column without saying something offensive.

The most frequently objected to section of the article is the quotes section.

<dd>How is including Coulters own words, verbatim, POV? The only way this could be POV is if the quote was out of context. Or if the quotes only demonstated one side of her position. The proposed solution in these instances is to add the context thereby removing the POV and adding more quotes thereby giving a fuller picture of what she actually says thereby removing the POV.

<p>I didn't forget to include it because it isn't relevant to the case. We've got the makings of an encyclopedia article here. Let's not be lazy, if Coulter's opinion on a matter is of importance it can be illustrated by using quotes, but using quotes alone is not encyclopedic.</p>

<p>We basically agree that Ann Coulter is famous for her writings, many of which involve some very contentious, largely insupportable opinions expressed in a pithy and amusing manner. What you appear to me to be saying is actually that, no, what she's actually "famous for" is a bunch of unconnected sayings that just came out of nowhere. I'm sure that isn't your opinion, but that seems to me to be the germ of your difference with me. I think we should write an encyclopedia article in which her expressed opinions are discussed, using quotes where necessary. You on the other hand defend the practise of just listing a whole slew of categorized quotes that don't really discuss her opinions at all, but present them in the style of a dictionary of quotations. I suggest that an encyclopedia article about Ann Coulter should do more than just duplicate Wikiquote. --4 July 2005 23:31 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, nobody is stopping you or the myriads of folks before who have said the same thing from writing this long awaited article discussing the wisdom and humor of Ann Coulter in context, with which we could replace the list of quotes.

<dd>Ann Coulter is famous for her propensity to create controversial statements... of course she isn't famous for a "bunch of unconnected sayings that just came out of nowhere." That is the biggest straw man argument I have ever seen, and I am confused when you both say that you're sure that this isn't my opinion, yet it is the difference between our viewpoints. If your argument is that the amount of quotes is not interesting to the reader, than that's a different subject. However, in the face of quotes that are taken out of context or require more info for the reader to fully comprehend the opinion that lies beneath, we have two choices: either add any missing context/info that would help us understand the true nature of why Coulter said what she said, or we can remove the information out of the article altogether. I don't see how the latter accomplishes anything but unnecessary censorship. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> July 4, 2005 23:51 (UTC)</dd>

<li>yes.

<li>I also agree with Derex, and add this: Wikipedia has to guard against some lazy ways of "writing" an encyclopedia article, among them dumping in every quotation you can find and dumping in every link you can find. Hence we have general policies about quotations and links. Without the general rule, somebody with a misplaced desire to help would just go to Bartlett's and add every Lincoln quotation to the <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> article. But this rule shouldn't be a straitjacket. Ann Coulter is (to put it mildly) no Abe Lincoln; her notability derives entirely from her writing and speaking, so more extensive quotation is appropriate here, although it wouldn't be in most articles. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 20:52, 9 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>No</i> Wikiquote was established to hold quotes. I do not object to around 5 quotes, in order to give a taste of her style. This is regardless of content.

<li><i>No</i>. I agree with Tony. I would say that, in this case, quotes used in the context of describing her views are acceptable. A blind list of quotes is not.

<p>I think yes, because she's probably best known for some of these quotes. I think the section should be trimmed, however - some of the quotes are more well known and have been more widely spread than others.

I have absolutely no problem with the use of quotes on Wikipedia. However blind lists of quotes are not acceptable. As we're now at 8 opposing the quotes against 5 in favor, it would not be a good idea to restore the quote section.

<dd>That could be said for any writer. The proposal here is whether to include "notable quotes". "Notable" usually means "noted", in other words, commented on or controversial.

<p>First, a brief summary of the <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Original research</a> policy</p>
<dl>
<dd>Original research is research that produces primary sources or secondary sources. Primary sources present information or data, such as archeological artifacts; photographs; historical documents such as a diary, census, transcript of a public hearing, trial, or interview; tabulated results of surveys or questionnaires, records of laboratory assays or observations; records of field observations. <b>Secondary sources present a generalization, analysis, synthesis, interpretation, or evaluation of information or data</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Original research that produces primary sources is not allowed</b>. However, research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and secondary sources is strongly encouraged. In fact, all articles on Wikipedia should be based on information collected from primary and secondary sources. This is called source-based research, and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia.</dd>
</dl>
<p>All of the sources for the quotes are primary, not secondary. Some have secondary source, for example the Timothy McVeigh reference, because a secondary source commented on it, but the vast majority fall under the exclusively primary realm.</p>
<p>These all come directly from speech transcripts, television appearances, article or books Coulter has written, with no secondary source either commenting or evaluating them. <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">TDC</a> 16:17, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is a significant difference between <b>referencing</b> and <b>producing</b> primary sources. <b>Referencing</b> Ann Coulter's quotes as a primary source is fine. <b>Producing</b> a statistical report on Coulter's beliefs yourself and citing it in the article is not fine. I don't think you understand the concept of original research. Of course quoting Ann is <b>referencing</b> a primary source, are we not supposed to try to take information directly from primary sources rather than solely rely on generalized summaries by other newspapers? Why not remove the middleman? --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 16:42, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>so then you are arguing that no quote should ever be allowed in wikipedia? no statistic should be allowed? no map? no photograph? you are grossly misinterpreting the original research policy. i could rip the guts out of just about <i>any</i> wikipedia article by going around misapplying this policy under your interpretation. "Research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing <b>primary sources</b> &amp; secondary is <b>strongly encouraged</b>. that is <i>precisely</i> what the article does at present. you may feel that the information could be <i>better</i> organized (so then do it), but it clearly is organized and presented in a context of illustrating her style. at any rate, the quotes do not fall under any category in your cited passage.

<dd>No secondary sources, no dice. If you can priovde secondary sources on any of the quotes currently in the article, then perhaps they can stay.

<dd>I honestly don't even know where to begin. Once again, primary sources are allowed to be referenced: "<b>However, research that consists of collecting and organizing information from <font>existing primary</font> and secondary sources is strongly encouraged.</b>" Like Derex said, are you seriously suggesting that no map, original transcript, or quotations are allowed on Wikipedia? --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 18:51, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I have stated earlier. A map provides no analysis, as such. An original transcript used to present a generalization, analysis, synthesis, interpretation, or evaluation of information or data in and of itself would also be a violation of the OR policy. Notable quotation are another thing. Things like quotations become notable because people talk about them. Many people have criticized coulter over her comments that we should "invade Arab nations and convert their populations to Christianity" (I am paraphrasing here), but the bulk of the other quotes have no secondary sources what so ever. And with that said, relevant quotes should be worked into the article, when possible, or sent to Wikiquote, where they belong.</dd>

<dd>Look TDC, I can see tony's point about not encyclopedic (at present i disagree). There is some <i>very</i> small chance that I can be persuaded of POV. But this original research claim is simply bizarre. Gzukier points out your error in a crystal clear fashion. And yes, by your interpretation I could rip out the guts of any article -- because I could remove any facts not explicitly attributed to a secondary source as 'original research'. As to maps, do you have <i>any</i> idea how many maps are in Wikipedia? Tens of thousands. The issue is whether one is <i>producing</i> original research; quoting someone is not. Providing a map is not. Providing a quote illustrating her style is not. Obviously an article consisting <i>only</i> of quotes or maps would be silly. I will revert to the death before I let quotes be removed on the basis of your original research argument. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerex_a544.html" title="User:Derex">Derex</a> 19:13, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By the way, how on earth do you think editors came to know of these quotes? I think it unlikely people personally went and scoured her works for inflammatory statements. Most of the quotes are rather widely known, and I have personally seen many of them discussed with considerable outrage/amusement on well-known blogs. Here's at least one secondary source, 2nd hit in my google search <a href="http://politics.abovetopsecret.com/thread100306/pg1" class="external autonumber" title="http://politics.abovetopsecret.com/thread100306/pg1" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. Do we really want to go around linking web forums to prove that someone <i>else</i> noticed this stuff? It's just silly. The qualifer "and" in the policy does not mean that <i>every</i> element of an article has to be based on both primary &amp; secondary sources. Flip it around, where is the <i>primary</i> source for a bunch of the content on Wikipedia? An article as a whole should be a <i>blend</i> of material from primary and secondary sources. That's why we can have maps &amp; photos &amp; quotes without a detailed discussion of what other people think about the map. They are of use to the <i>reader</i> in and of themselves to better understand the <i>overall</i> article. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerex_a544.html" title="User:Derex">Derex</a> 19:24, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The quotes, as presented, are being used to make an opinion or judgment about Ann Coulter's style. There is no secondary source to back up any of these claims. The <i>primary</i> source for most of the information in Wikipedia is embedded in the secondary. That is to say, when we quote John Doe's biography on Jane Doe's, it is reasonable to assume that John Doe has given a reasonable and accurate representation of it, unless there is evidence to suggest otherwise. "Secondary sources often are subjected to peer review, are well documented, and are often produced through institutions where methodological accuracy is important to the future of the author's career and reputation."</dd>

<dd>You are completely missing the point. "In order for us to then attribute them to how she feels about a certain subject, we would need a secondary source to corroborate this." This is absurd. We don't need secondary sources to verify primary sources. We see Coulter on TV talk about Arabs being smelly. We don't need to wait to see it in a newspaper to corroborate her quote. Your assertion that secondary sources are needed to use primary sources is absurd, misquotes Wikipedia policy, and plain wrong. To answer the question which I have "ignored" to date, "Where are the secondary sources for Coulter?", there are many secondary sources that quote Coulter, just no policy requiring us to utilize secondary sources above or in the place of primary sources. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 20:10, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, you are completely missing the point. You dont need a secondary source to <i>verify</i> a primary source, but you do need one if you are going to <i>"present a generalization, analysis, synthesis, interpretation, or evaluation"</i>, which is what you have done. You say that these quotes are indiciative of Coulter's views on women or Bill Clinton, or the environment, I think they are humorous illustrations of more general points, others beleive they are just mean spirited cheap shot. Point bieng, since there is a "debate" over how to interperate them, we need a secondary source to do this. <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">TDC</a> 20:19, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Are you just arguing for argument's sake now? You haven't responded as to your incorrect interpretation that Wikipedia policy discourages using previously existing primary sources without also using secondary sources... it says nowhere in Original Research that secondary sources are required or favored above primary sources. Primary sources do not need to be qualified by secondary sources. If you think I'm wrong, cite Wikipedia policy that says otherwise. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 20:53, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>"Yes, Coulter is savage, overstates, ridicules, and sometimes oversimplifies." -- Ann Coulter vs. Al Franken by Harry Binswanger; Capitalism Magazine (November 29, 2003)</li>
<li>'Arguably more appealing, unquestionably the sharpest shooter, she is, of course, the darling of conservatives and a hate figure for the left - but there are others, among her detested liberals, who are gripped in fascinated awe by her scorching invective. ... Her grievance against the war on Iraq: that it missed out all the other Muslim countries that should be on America's target list.

<li>Most won't admit it, but there was something sexy about an Aryan she-villain calling on her country to conquer and Christianize the Islamic heathen.

<li>"In this recurring nightmare of a presidency, we have a national debate about [George W. Bush's stolen presidency].... Otherwise there would be debates only about whether to impeach or assassinate."</li>
<li>"We need to execute people like Ann Coulter in order to physically intimidate conservatives, by making them realize that they can be killed too. Otherwise they will turn out to be outright traitors."</li>
<li>First things first: Mr. Ashcroft, if you're there, I do not mean any of the statements above to be taken literally. I do not mean them at all. None of them. OK? What I do mean is to point out the incredible hypocrisy of those on the right, the center and the "liberal media" who defend the lunatic ravings of Ann Coulter, whether because she is "kidding" or because "the left does the same thing." (For those who have been lucky enough to have missed the Coultergeist of the past few months, the author of the summer's number-one bestselling nonfiction book in America has--in language identical to that above--expressed her regret that Timothy McVeigh did not blow up the New York Times building, mused aloud whether Bill Clinton should have been impeached or murdered, and called for the execution of John Walker Lindh in order to intimidate liberals.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Her incitements to murder and terrorism have been cheered and defended in the Wall Street Journal and National Review Online. (The latter did so, moreover, despite her having termed its editors "girly boys" and behaving, in the words of the website's editor, Jonah Goldberg, "with a total lack of professionalism, friendship, and loyalty.") And her publisher, Crown, says it has no plans to correct her lies in future editions. Why should they care? Is anyone holding them accountable?Devil in a Blue Dress; The nation Sep 23, 2002</li>

<dd>I'm fairly comfortable with this policy, and it seems clear to me that TDC has misunderstood it. Offering novel interpretations of the quotes and synthesizing them in unexpected ways that are not covered elsewhere would be original research; here we are merely listing them. While there is a certain element of OR in the selection of the quotes, a small amount of original research necessarily occurs in writing any article; the only real issue here is whether the quotes are selected in a way that meets the NPOV policy. <a href="../../../d/c/o/User%7EDcoetzee_a2a7.html" title="User:Dcoetzee">Deco</a> 21:28, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>See, if I were to write a paragraph like "The third letter in every fifth word of Coulter's sentences is a vowel" based on my own observations, that would be original research. If I were to say "Coulter is right, Liberals are all rich" that would be original research. If I were to say "Coulter says blah blah blah rich liberals blah blah (insert a real Coulter quote), that's not original research, that's called READING.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ann Coulter is racist and sexist</span></h2>
<p>Just to experiment with the wikipedia policy, I want to know what people think of stating in the article (along with "republican") that Coulter is:</p>
<p><b>Racist</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>"When we were fighting communism, OK, they had mass murderers and gulags, but they were white men and they were sane. Now we're up against absolutely insane savages." -- she is implying that white men (sexist <i>and</i> racist), are more sane then non-white men.
<ul>
<li>Logical fallacy. All she is saying is the known fact that at the time she said it, in countries where there is a majority of white people, the countries are ruled by laws. The fallacy is confusing: "nearly all white men live in a nation of laws and are therefore sane", with "nearly all white men live in a nation of laws <i>because</i> they are sane". Rather, it's the law that enforces the sanity. <a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.119.143.114.html" title="User:216.119.143.114">216.119.143.114</a>
<ul>
<li>You mean the rule of law existed in "communist" countries and the Vietnamese, the Chinese, the North Koreans and the Cubans...etc were white? Come on, why would you even try to defend people like her? She is obviously trying to get attention by saying outrageous things.
<ul>
<li>She was refering to communism in USSR 209.148.140.195 01:42, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>How can you tell? She doesn't explicitly state so. And I suppose then that Korean war wasn't about fighting "communists"?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I am not making a fallicious statement. If it is her belief that race has nothing to do with rule of law, why does she bring it up. Clearly she thinks race is important in this issue, which makes her racist. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_779c.html" title="User:Mir">Mir</a> 04:08, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As a class the white race is nearly universally an educated one. That's simply a fact, not racism. <a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.119.143.114.html" title="User:216.119.143.114">216.119.143.114</a>

<ul>
<li>I don't understand what that means. <a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.119.143.114.html" title="User:216.119.143.114">216.119.143.114</a> 23:32, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It means that he's dismissing your statement that all other races are not as "nearly universally educated" as the white "class" as Nazi-esque rhetoric. Just because more people who are white in the world are educated, statistically, doesn't mean that you can hold that against the people who aren't white. There are plenty of uneducated white people you can run into on the street.
<ul>
<li>She's not holding it against anyone, she's holding up the white race as a model for this specific attribute: controlling itself by offering everyone a place in society that is worth living to keep. This fact doesn't exclude other means by which other races may be held up as models of controlling themselves: for example, by having a great heart or by experience with nature and other social bonds of their culture.</li>
<li>And when I said "as a class" I meant "as a class". A class by definition contains individual differences.</li>
<li>And thirdly you're making it sound like I said all other races aren't nearly as educated as whites when what I really said was that whites were nearly all educated. 216.119.136.173 07:56, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>She realized her audience would recognize this and form in their minds a vivid contrast to those zealots, like those who crashed airplanes into the U.S. landmarks, who seem to not even possess reason.</li>

<dd>Of course! That's the point; her audience is as racist as she is. And, apparently, just as capable of denying it.<a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 19:59, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What do you mean, her audience is just as racist as she is? That's what this discussion was intended to prove, that she is racist. You are begging the question and saying it doesn't even need to be established in the first place. If it were so obvious we wouldn't be having the discussion at all. And <i>a fortiori</i> you can't be adjudged "capable of denying" something that hasn't been proven you've done to begin with. <a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.119.143.114.html" title="User:216.119.143.114">216.119.143.114</a> 23:32, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>You are missing the point people! In response to the anon (white race is nearly universally an educated one. That's simply a fact, not racism.): They (we;), are more educated than "the savages", because white people are generally richer and have better access to education. Again, not because of the skin color. while its a fact, its a circumstantial fact with no meaning, so its racist to bring it up. So Coulter is racist, so can we please start arguing about it and agree with what i say?? heh -Mir</p>
<dl>
<dd>Again, Coulter is commending the white race for its dedication to the use of inducing its members to live by offering them something worth living to keep, to be able to control itself. Period. She does not agonize over the reason why this might be so. Other races excel whites in dedication to beauty or dedication to family life. These are also important things to consider in trying to live well and even to just survive. There are some people who believe the life presented by communities without this rule of property combined with insanity, like in al Qaida camps, and the life presented with civilization have equal merit. Coulter is apparently not one of those people. 216.119.136.173 07:56, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Sexist</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I think [women] should be armed but should not vote...women have no capacity to understand how money is earned. They have a lot of ideas on how to spend it...it's always more money on education, more money on child care, more money on day care." -- From wikipedias definition, sexism is discrimination (double standard) between people based on their gender.
<ul>
<li>Possible use of humor. We don't know if Ann is being facetious or not. It's likely that she is--would she take away her own right to vote? Doesn't her opinion against a fundamental right seem ridiculously contrary to her own political activism, and her extreme conclusion appear in the disguise of having been reached as a result of a free flight of a femininely light imagination that accidently carried the argument too far? So that if someone objects that the conclusion doesn't follow from the argument, or that she's oversimplifying, she can say, "Well we know that's exactly how women argue, so you're proving my point that they DO have trouble understanding any number of things"? And having "proved" her argument, she at the same time <i>disproves</i> it by the fact that she has just outsmarted you. When you realize all those things nearly all at the same moment, (as long as you don't hold a grudge) it makes you laugh.
<ul>
<li>No, she is being serious and refering to women in general, herself being the exception. If you disagree, please state what possible non-sexist point could she be making here. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_779c.html" title="User:Mir">Mir</a> 15:21, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I just got through explaining, to parade her own cleverness, mainly. I might add the point that it's a comic cliché that women as class like to go shopping. Comedy depends on these kinds of generalizations, and no one calls it sexist. Coulter seems to be merely extending the comic image of women not being able to control their enthusiasm for spending into the realm of whom they choose in government to spend money for them.
<ul>
<li>Ever hear of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chewbacca_Defense_7721.html" title="Chewbacca Defense">Chewbacca Defense</a>?
<ul>
<li>Let me explain it to you another way if you didn't understand. Coulter likes to imitate New York and Hollywood narcissists you see on movies and TV who use their personal dynamism to charm you and then use that charm as a cover to persuade you to let them rewrite the legitimate rules of society so that they can indulge their own private shortcomings that are contrary to those rules. So when she uses a dynamically dramatic argument to demand to turn the whole world upside-down by not allowing women to vote just so she can get her way, she is lampooning this type of egotism.</li>

<dd>Was she on a humor program? did she laugh? Did anyone else laugh? Anyway, all Ann's humor in the past has involved death and injury to people she didn't agree with (I didn't mean they should blow up the new york times building, only kidding!) so this doesn't fit the pattern. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 17:50, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Are we to assume that Franken's comedy writing team didn't <i>really</i> want us to believe that Nixon wanted to have himself assassinated? Or should we instead harbor suspicions about them that they really wished "death and injury to people [they] didn't agree with"? What I see conspicuous in the so-called examples that are put forward under this header is not racism or sexism, but rather prejudice against conservatives.
<dl>
<dd>Yes, exactly like that; Franken and Ackroyd <b>were</b> on a comedy program, they <b>were</b> obviously grinning, and the audience at home and in the studio <b>did</b> laugh; these are generally good indicators that they were <b>not</b> being serious.

<dd>I thought your point was that Coulter hides hostility under the guise of humor. Now that you discover that it's actually her critics who do it in a more obvious fashion, you seem to want to change the subject. I'll bite. Let me ask you, Gzukier, do you have the kind of memory where everyone else remembers a pleasant dinner party, but you "remember" there being Sigmund Freud, a bathtub and a walrus there? Because that is depths to which your memory has failed you in this case. Franken was a <i>writer</i> not an <i>actor</i> at that point and not even in the sketch. Nobody was grinning, that's what made it funny: "Nixon" didn't know how ridiculous he was being. I think it would be spoonfeeding to tell you the simple facts that Coulter was a regular on a comedy program where the studio audience laughs <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politically_Incorrect_0b03.html" title="Politically Incorrect">Politically Incorrect</a> and that news entertainment programs frequently book guests that use humor in their political commentary (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_Buchwald_e974.html" title="Art Buchwald">Art Buchwald</a> comes to mind), yet they aren't spoken-word comedians--but they have unusual opinions or an unusual perspective that is sometimes expressed in an off-beat manner. It's obvious to me that you don't read or don't understand Coulter's columns. There she is more broadly comic. I think you may not be the best editor for this article since you don't seem to know even the rudimentary facts that someone interested in this woman would have. <a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.119.143.114.html" title="User:216.119.143.114">216.119.143.114</a> 23:32, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>How exactly did you deduce that Gzuckier was changing the subject? In fact, your question was answered directly. The fact is, Saturday Night Live is expressly a comedy show. Ann Coulter is not expressly a comedian, so your comparison really has no basis. Additionally, Gzuckier may not have even seen this skit involving Dan Akroyd, but may merely have been going on the information provided by you, and agreeing with you to answer your question. Furthermore, it seems to me that you were the one changing the subject with all the sudden talk of Freud, bathtubs, and, walrus. On top of it all, the fact remains that Ann Coulter has consistently, and increasingly, come under fire for her distasteful rhetoric, not only by Liberals, but by many Conservatives as well. She has even lost jobs because of it. So, in effect, you would think that she would choose her words more carefully. Finally, it was mentioned that her seemingly hostile statements may actually be intended to be humorous. For example, the statement "I think [women] should be armed but should not vote...women have no capacity to understand how money is earned. They have a lot of ideas on how to spend it...it's always more money on education, more money on child care, more money on day care." The notion that this was intended to be funny is probably crap, and if that was indeed her intent, she should probably reconsider things, because she cannot expect the public as a whole to understand her intent. If she's smart enough to outsmart someone else with this statement, she should be smart enough to realize that not everyone is as smart as she is.User:LikeSoStoked</dd>

<dd>I don't think anyone will ever know whether or not Ann believes anything that comes out of her mouth or if she, like Howard Stern, realizes that the only reason why people know her name is because she'll say what other people won't say. So I don't think we'll know if she really is sexist or racist, she promotes obviously conservative traditional values and yet she sleeps around all the time, clearly there is a divide between what she says and who she is. Personally, I don't care whether or not she is. Anyways, see below. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 21:04, Feb 14, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Kizzle, what is the source of your claim that Ann Coulter "sleeps around all the time"? It's contrary to her depreciation of women who are licentious and the media that promotes that lifestyle. Furthermore, she has stated that she keeps her private life private, and it stands to reason that the campaign to discredit her would latch onto reports of such behavior as a weapon in their arsenal. Please do tell us, so we can discount that source as a source for the Ann Coulter article.

<p>Yeah, that seems to be the pattern on wikipedia. This makes it biased because there have to be critics in the first place (Coulter says something discriminatory, nobody publishes criticism of it, and so it cant go on wikipedia). -mir</p>

<dd>Maybe Coulter isn't as discriminitory as she seems. She said once said she thought an all black Supreme Court would be cool. Lots of people resent strenuous political correctness, so maybe her lack of critics in this department is proof of her innocuousness. 216.119.136.173 07:56, 17 May 2005 (UTC)

<p>I don't mean to be confrontational, but I object to the attempt to change "Coulter has also drawn criticism for frequently making racist remarks, particularly against people of Middle Eastern descent" to "Coulter has also drawn criticism for frequently making <b>what some perceive to be</b> racist remarks...". When something is this clear I don't think it's right to blur things like that. If someone said "Black people are stupid" would it be wrong to state clearly that this person made a racist remark? How could these comments be perceived as non-racist? Anyone who does not object to her racist remarks doesn't do so because they're somehow not racist on another level, but simply because they agree with her racist conclusions. I realize that the strength of my argument is weakened by my dislike of Coulter, but for the sake of analogy using individuals whose work I value, I would not oppose a statement that <a href="../../../b/a/k/Bakunin.html" title="Bakunin">Bakunin</a> made several anti-Semitic remarks or that <a href="../../../n/i/e/Nietzsche.html" title="Nietzsche">Nietzsche</a> made sexist remarks.

<dd>If you agree with Kizzle's argument about POV and spoon-feeding, then you shouldn't claim that her arguments are racist - instead, let people decide. I'm trying to imagine any other encyclopedia describing a contemporary writer as racist (short of someone who advocates lynchings). A charge of racism is an inflammatory remark (to an admittedly inflammatory wirter). However, what it fails to do is illuminate, in any way, the character of the subject. Ann Coulter's public pronouncements may well be racist (I see little inherently racist with most of what is listed in the article), but labelling her a racist seems to be more an attempt to degrade her character than anything else. Finally, why "avoid the appearance that the opinions of her detractors are minority views"? You haven't demonstrated that there is any sort of agreement by even some that she is a racist. I made the initial edit to change from your originial, and clearly POV formulation, to some perceive. I tried to find a compromise. After reading what has thus far been provided, I no longer believe that a compromise is in order.<a href="../../../r/k/e/User%7ERkevins82_9ffc.html" title="User:Rkevins82">Rkevins82</a> 21:58, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>I would like to discuss this new addition as well:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Coulter has also drawn criticism for frequently making what many perceive to be racist remarks, particularly against people of Middle Eastern descent. For instance, following the 9/11 attacks she argued that "we should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity." A minor controversy ensued after Coulter denounced <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Thomas_18d6.html" title="Helen Thomas">Helen Thomas</a>, calling her an "old Arab." In other instances she has referred to the Middle East as a "swamp" and advocated racial profiling.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This section was written by someone who not only isn't aware of the discussion dealing with allegations of Coulter being racist, but he doesn't seem to have even finished reading the article. Later in the article is a quote that places the quotation he cites in context, a pretty important context too, since it defines the meaning of the word "them", the direct object of who she's referring to. Coulter is a supporter of racial equality, and that support extends to her personal life. She once dated a Muslim and an Indian as well (<a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinesh_D%27Souza_5192.html" title="Dinesh D'Souza">Dinesh D'Souza</a>. Politically incorrect statements are not the same as racist ones, sometimes they are meant humorously as the television show <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politically_Incorrect_0b03.html" title="Politically Incorrect">Politically Incorrect</a> demonstrates, on which Coulter frequently appeared.</p>
<p>Perhaps this person can also tell us why he thinks every comparison of someone to an arab is denunciation and meant to indicate an arab is something that no one would want to be compared to. Isn't this really a case of someone interjecting his own POV expectations about Coulter into what may be a neutral statement? And isn't the generalizing phrase "advocating racial profiling" remarkable in sweeping her concern that 3,000 more Americans not be slaughtered through hijacking the nation's aircraft into the irrelevant (and racially charged) area of municipal police harassment of minorities?</p>
<p>These are the grounds I am employing for removing it. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.154.26.251.html" title="User:64.154.26.251">64.154.26.251</a> 22:41, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>She has been called a racist in response to all examples I put in that paragraph and thus it stays, because it is part of a summary of criticism she has received.

<p>I see that Tothebarricades.tk seems to have accepted the "what some perceive to be" part as a compromise between removing the racism paragraph and saying directly that she is a racist. I support this NPOV compromise, and will revert any future removal of the paragraph. I also suggest we quote notable sources that say she is racist, to avoid the vague "some". — <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChameleon_a79b.html" title="User:Chameleon"><i>Chameleon</i></a> 00:44, 29 May 2005 (UTC).</p>

<dd>Racist is here being employed here as a blanket term for anything remotely politically incorrect. The author is not willing to defend his case as a fair presentation of any facts that we are supposed to believe would indicate Coulter makes racist remarks, a case which I have so far refuted. He has also not responded to observations about his paragraph that indicate he had neither read the article, nor the pertinent discussions about the kind of disputed facts he is introducing. These are necessary and appropriate measures any editor should take before contributing to a Wikipedia article, especially one who is trying to add such explosive allegations. The first measure is also a prior requirement for any "notable source" whose judgment is introduced in order to evaluate the evidence he or she used to make that judgment. This is not to suggest that I believe that any such source exists in this case.</dd>

<dd>Wait a minute! Somehow, Kos, CounterPunch, and a software company (which I've never heard of) say that Ann Coulter is racist, I am to believe it is so! This is indulgence of the highest order. You said that her critics have described her as racist, falling back to Google page counts. Let's take a look at who is calling her a racist on Google: Move Left Media, Media Transparency (a liberal group that seeks to debunk conservatives in the media), Counter Punch (not exactly the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">Grey Lady</a>), crooksandliars.com, a Mac homepage, Democratic Underground, Change for America, and Reclaim the Media make up the first two pages. The rest are articles defending her or her charging racism (however improvidently). I'm not sure this is the kind of support I would rest on to show even a sembleance of most people thinking someone was racist. Looking at this more - and the arguments being made - I am further resolved that we shouldn't be calling a commentator racist for advocating positions that are disagreeable but not definitely racist.<a href="../../../r/k/e/User%7ERkevins82_9ffc.html" title="User:Rkevins82">Rkevins82</a> 05:15, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h1><span class="mw-headline">Coulter on Liberals as Idle Rich Discussion</span></h1>
<p><a name="small_incorrectness" id="small_incorrectness"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">small incorrectness</span></h2>
<p>From the paragraph: Coulter is quoted in an article in Newsday as saying that the media are biased to the left because Republicans don't have the wealth to start media outlets, while Democrats do. That Republicans are rich, she says, "is one of the stunning lies that Democrats have been able to palm off.... Liberals really are the idle rich." In Slander, she writes that "liberals have absolutely no contact with the society they decry from their Park Avenue redoubts." Critics such as Joe Conason, author of Big Lies, point out that Coulter herself is a rich woman from an affluent background, and that she does not similarly dismiss Republican politicians because of their wealth. Coulter's position is further undermined by the Gallup poll, which found that "regular voters in the two higher-income categories prefer Republicans by an average of about 15 percentage points, while the two lower-income groups support Democrats by an average of about 23 percentage points. The crossover point appears to be at an annual income of about $50,000 a year".</p>
<p>I dont think the Gallup poll is relevant. She is saying that democrats, because they are rich (richer than republicans), are <i>not in a position</i> to represent the lower or middle class, while the poll shows that they are statistically supported by that group. More relevant would be some stats showing that republicans are richer than democrats, and that they recieve a lot more funding. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_779c.html" title="User:Mir">Mir</a> 02:37, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Gallup Poll is not relevant, but not for the reasons given. The Gallup Poll is irrelevant because Coulter refers to the "idle rich". I doubt anyone can make a convincing case that "regular voters in the two higher-income categories" are all "idle rich". I believe Coulter is referring to people somewhat north of the .01 percentile in income.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Liberals as the "idle rich"</span></h2>
<p>This entire section should be removed. The proposition that the "idle rich" are predominately liberal is not arguable without defining what "idle rich" means. The current section citing the Gallup survey is irrelevant. Pointing out that the top two tax brackets vote Republican could only be relevant if the top two brackets are all considered to be "idle rich". If no one objects I will delete the section.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I'll object. It is after all, Coulter's proposition that the idle reich are liberal. If you feel the proposition is not arguable because it's vague and undefined, then it is a good illustration of Coulter's rhetoric being vague and undefined and somewhat shotgun-like. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 17:06, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Then the most the article can say is that this position is vague and undefined, rather than demonstrably false. If you care to edit it to reflect that then I have no objection.
<dl>
<dd>How's this, made it 'her opponents' point of view? <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 18:02, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There are two problems. First, 'her opponents' aren't being cited as making that point. Rather, her point is challenged by original research in the article. Second, evidence cannot be presented to counter the claim that the "idle rich" are liberal without defining the term "idle rich". Since Coulter has not done this, no counterargument to the proposition is possible. It is a vague rather than false proposition.
<dl>
<dd>OK, how about now? <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 21:08, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>The "idle rich" section is still a mess. The Gallup data does not belong at all primarily because it is nonresponsive. Information about the voting patterns of the top two tax brackets is completely irrelevant to the discussion unless the author is claiming that everyone in the top two brackets is independently wealthy and chooses not to work. The only meaningful response to this proposition would be data showing the voting habits of the idle rich along with a clear definition of who falls into that category. I am deleting the section.
<dl>
<dd>OK, now you are just being wilfully doofusistic. The income distribution of the two parties has no relevance to a quote regarding which party is 'the idle rich'? So you delete the quote? Particularly when the idle rich reference is the minor part of the quote, the point of which is, explicitly, that democrats control the media because republicans can't afford media outlets? I don't think so. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 05:23, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It would be relevant if she said "Democrats are richer than Republicans". She said the "idle rich" are Democrats. People in the top two income brackets cannot necessarily afford to buy media outlets. Or are you suggesting that income in excess of $50,000 per year is all it takes to start a cable channel?</dd>

<p>Please try to stay on-topic with this section. The alleged innacuracy of Ann Coulter is the issue and the proposition that the idle rich are predominantly politically liberal is the specific proposition being questioned. Comments regarding progressive taxation and Republican fundraising are utterly irrelevant unless they can be meaningfully tied to the idle rich. I think the whole accuracy section should be deleted and perhaps replaced with a list of links to sites that question Coulter's accuracy. The whole thing seems irreparably POV.</p>

<p>Looking at the article freshly, what jumps out at me is not an overemphasis on quotes, but that the Paula Jones section is overweight and might do with being moved to Paula's own page.</p>
<dl>
<dd>LOL. You suddenly losing the ability to see the value of a section to the article as a whole that "happened" to be recently changed from presenting Coulter in a negative light to portraying her in a positive light has become a known tactic of your bias. Present some goofy charge about Coulter, then when someone checks the facts and presents the surrounding context that proves she's innocent of wrongdoing, erase the section it applies to. You did it with the Quotes section [see article History 21:29 17 Mar 2005], you did it with a part of the Paula Jones section before <a href="../../../a/n/n/Talk%7EAnn_Coulter_Archive_1_882d.html#Paula_Jones" title="Talk:Ann Coulter/Archive 1">Talk:Ann Coulter/Archive 1#Paula Jones</a> and you did it with the "Liberals as the 'idle rich'" that you renamed "Democrats richer than Republicans" section. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ann_Coulter&amp;diff=11239434&amp;oldid=11225035" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ann_Coulter&amp;diff=11239434&amp;oldid=11225035" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> (between lines 29 and 72 with the old version and lines 39 and 82 in the new version) 216.119.136.151</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's not as major a hunk of Coulter's life as it used to be.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why? Because she's four months older now than since you wrote it (or should I say, plagiarized it? [Gzukier rewrote three paragraphs worth of a CoulterWatch article with four sub-quotes they used, and never cited his source]) Speaking of four months, even if we do find it to be irrelevent at some point, I think we should keep this section at least four and a half months in the interests of fairness and accuracy to correct the erroneous record that has been maintained on this Wiki for that amount of time as well as the Wikipedia clones. 216.119.136.151</dd>
</dl>
<p>Anyway, if anyone can give the particular flavor of Coulter and the controversy re and the emotions pro and con she engenders without quotes, that would be great but otherwise... At least we're at a point where the pro and con forces are each adding and subtracting quotes, so maybe we're nearing balance. Actually, this might do with a bit more regarding her books (response to the comment regarding the earnhardt section being bigger than the writeup for slander. That might be a good place to get some NPOVness? <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 06:33, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're begging the question regarding the Earnhardt section, that being another one of your avoidance tactics that I'm beginning to recognize. It hasn't been established that the Earnhardt piece ought to be in an article of this size in the first place, much less that we ought to apply NPOV to "rebalance" it. It seems to me you have some issues with Coulter. According to Jimmy Wales, the Wikipedia now has 500,000 articles. Don't you think that perhaps your editing skills might best be applied elsewhere? 216.119.136.151 20:37, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>????????????? That's an odd thing to say from an anonymous source who has never edited anything other than one article. Sudden suspicion: you aren't Ann Coulter herself, are you? That would explain your style of cooperative editing. It's entrapment if you don't admit it. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 21:30, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Is that sheer recrimination or do you have evidence to support that?

<dd>I failed to mention you are also equivocating again between yourself and other users. There is no evidence of there being "pro and con" forces. There is just one acknowledged con force-Gzukier himself. You seem to picture writing Wikipedia articles as some kind of tug-of-war with equal parties on both side trying to manipulate the image of the subject of the article into being liked or disliked, and the sides can be chosen just as wisely based solely on the feelings she engenders (either for the right reasons or through a complete misunderstanding of her motives). The sides aren't equal and it's not even a tug-of-war. Instead it's just people trying to maintain an informative and accurate article through cleaning up certain other people's messes. 216.119.136.151 21:09, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gzuckier continues to engage in POV and <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_word.html" title="Weasel word">weasel word</a> writing. Someone needs to explain to me how the Gallup poll citation in the "Democrats richer than Republicans" section is NPOV. --Bziobnic 22:10, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">POV notice on rich democrats section</span></h2>
<p>Bziobnic is reverting my edits, so lets discuss it here. I added the following (what parts do you have a problem with):</p>
<ul>
<li>It should be noted that, at least in theory, left-wing policies which are generally associated with Democrats, benefit the lower income class economically more than right-wing and Republican policies. Some examples of this are progressive taxation laws, public institutions and safety net programs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Republican party on average recieves more funding and has a bigger budget than the Democratican party.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Here's the problem: The impact of policies traditionally associated with Democrats is not relevant to a section which is addressing Coulter's alleged inaccuracy in asserting that the "idle rich" are predominantly liberal. The impact of progressive taxation has nothing whatsoever to do with, for example, Ted Turner's political biases. Also, Republican financing is irrelevant unless it can be clearly established that the majority of the "idle rich" are Republican Party contributors.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Coulter does not assert that liberal policies benefit the rich nor does she assert that the Democratic party raises more money than the Republican party. These additions are completely irrelevant.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Something can be totally factual and yet irrelevant. Coulter's accuracy is the issue here. The only relevant content for this section is material that directly addresses Coulter's statement. I still believe that this whole section should be deleted. It is not Wikipedia's role to directly challenge anyone. Links to sites that challenge Coulter's accuracy are the only appropriate method for a Wikipedia article. --Bziobnic 04:39, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Sez who? There is a proscription on 'easter egg' links where the content is not apparent until the link is opened. This is for the benefit of those who are reading a printed copy of the page, rather than viewing it online. A summary of what can be found at the end of the link, with the link being just for reference, is very much in tune with the Wikipedia way. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 20:16, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but Wikipedia is also not a place for <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, which is what we have in the rich Democrats section. I believe that this topic is too complicated to be dealt with in the body of the article and therefore external links are appropriate.--Bziobnic 04:35, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry, I misread the paragraph. Seems the quote has changed, used to say something like "Democrats out of touch with the working class they claim to represent"? (in which case she is refering to the Democratic Party). Does anyone have a source for the quote (its not on wikiquote).</p>
