<p>Listing researchers on each continent is probably unnecessary, it makes more sense to just list the most notable ones (which will probably be mentioned in the article already anyway). --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 14:58, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you read the content suggestions, you'll see that I am not suggesting that people 'list researchers'(there are too many to name). Rather, they will be discussing the major <b>university labs</b> and <b>peer-reviewed journals</b>. The general picture of parapsychology varies from continent to continent (and even country to country, but there is no need to go into that level of detail in a summary). Researchers receive varying levels of support from their local governments, and this has an effect on the field. For example, there is more institutional support for parapsychologists in Europe than there is for North America. The kinds of parapsychology research done is South America is much different from the research being done in North America, etc. The <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthropology.html" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a> article found it notable to distinguish types of anthropological research according to locale. I see no reason why the parapsychology article shouldn't do the same.--<a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnalisa_Ventola_fe49.html" title="User:Annalisa Ventola"><span style="color:#000000">Annalisa Ventola</span></a> <sub>(<a href="../../../a/n/n/User_talk%7EAnnalisa_Ventola_78fa.html" title="User talk:Annalisa Ventola">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Annalisa_Ventola_a758.html" title="Special:Contributions/Annalisa Ventola">Contribs</a>)</sub> 16:28, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the field varies in different parts of the world, that difference can probably be summarized in a paragraph. Articles should be encyclopedic and explain the subject - breaking it down by continent doesn't seem that useful to the reader, particularly if it gets into lists (which I don't see in articles like <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a>). I don't know if you want to necessarily want to use Anthropology as a reference article since it may not be the best comparison (since the field itself has a geographical component) and because it just might not be a good enough article to use as a role model. Wikipedia has many <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">featured articles</a>, I'd recommending looking at some of those for models to emulate. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 16:45, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, I am not advocating the use of lists in these sections. The geographical breakdown in this outline exists so that the article can maintain a narrative flow. Many anthropologists study parapsychological topics, so I don't think that the comparison is unwarranted. I've looked at several featured articles here at Wikipedia, but I do plan to look at more. In the meantime, perhaps it would be best to reserve a discussion of whether or not this section is useful to readers for <i>after</i> some content has been provided?--<a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnalisa_Ventola_fe49.html" title="User:Annalisa Ventola"><span style="color:#000000">Annalisa Ventola</span></a> <sub>(<a href="../../../a/n/n/User_talk%7EAnnalisa_Ventola_78fa.html" title="User talk:Annalisa Ventola">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Annalisa_Ventola_a758.html" title="Special:Contributions/Annalisa Ventola">Contribs</a>)</sub> 17:29, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've had a stab at this, and put in specific refs, temporarily, in same section. I like the proposed article layout; the existing one is a bit of a nightmare...<a href="../../../r/i/k/User%7ERikstar_7ffb.html" title="User:Rikstar">Rikstar</a> 00:13, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for your contribution, Rikstar. You are certainly taking this in the direction that I imagined, but I would like to suggest a few edits. I'd spoken with one of the parapsychologists involved with Project Alpha, and his side of the story was that his colleagues were starting to suspect that those young men were deceiving them just before Randi broke the story. In other words, the young magicians knew that they were about to be outed, so they acted first. Hindsight, is of course, 20/20, but I have no reason to suspect that this particular gentlemen was lying to me. That being said, I think that it would be more neutral to state that Randi's trainees were "reported to have deceived" the experimenters rather than "managed to have fooled."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When it comes to the Soal case, it should be mentioned that evidence of deception came from within the field.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would also like to bring David Hume into the discussion. Are you familiar? --<a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnalisa_Ventola_fe49.html" title="User:Annalisa Ventola"><span style="color:#000000">Annalisa Ventola</span></a> <sub>(<a href="../../../a/n/n/User_talk%7EAnnalisa_Ventola_78fa.html" title="User talk:Annalisa Ventola">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Annalisa_Ventola_a758.html" title="Special:Contributions/Annalisa Ventola">Contribs</a>)</sub> 04:31, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Thank you for you feedback. I appreciate the circumstances of Project Alpha, but I feel your edits give the uninitiated reader the option to believe that there is a possibility that the McDonnell team were not fooled by the subjects they eventually chose to test (out of 300?). Given that researchers "were starting to suspect that those young men were deceiving them just before Randi broke the story", this implies that, for a very long time, nothing was suspected. This in turn implies that there was nothing 'alleged', 'supposed', etc. about the success of Project Alpha in "exposing poor experimental methods and credulity". I totally agree that, as in the main article, not every skeptical claim either, especially in these criticism sections, needs to be preceded with 'alleged', 'supposed', 'reportedly', etc. Nor should all such claims have to be qualified within these sections, unless there is strong evidence to cite. In which case the skeptical claim is not worthy of inclusion in the first place (we also run the risk of repeating those tiresome point-counterpoint debates). I would like to think (as someone yearning to believe in the paranormal) that well-referenced skeptical claims can stand unqualified and without reservations in these sections, but are openly or tacitly demolished, or rendered irrelevant, by the sheer weight of evidence embodied in the rest of this article. I'll have a think about Mr. Hume and keep you posted.<a href="../../../r/i/k/User%7ERikstar_7ffb.html" title="User:Rikstar">Rikstar</a> 08:19, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with you that it reads rather poorly at the moment (I did not make those edits) and we do need to find a way to state the facts without sounding apologetic no matter which section we're drafting. However, since this is an article about parapsychology, we do need to consider the other side of the story. First, the methods of testing psychic claiments are such that parapsychologists start informally with loose controls, and then gradually tighten the controls over time. And how often where these guys visiting the labs? Every day? Once a month? Four years of what? The testing of psychic claiments is, by its very nature, an involved and time consuming process. Second, the ethical guidelines of the PA state that researchers must be absolutely sure that participants are cheating (i.e. be able to demonstrate it) before making a public statement because of the effect that it might have on participants lives. And lastly, I think it is worth noting that no public statment or report was ever made by these researchers in support of the magicians, which makes it difficult to prove that anybody in fact was being 'fooled'. You ought to wonder why the story would be broken before such a report could be made, my guess is that Randi and his magician friends knew that there would never be one.</dd>

<dd>Still, the event is worth noting, simply because of the amount of press that it got and the effect that it had on the field. I'm not asking that we go into some point-counterpoint argument about the whole thing, because that is more than any causual reader at Wikipedia is asking for. However, if an interested reader were inspired to look into Project Alpha after reading about here, I should hope that they would be able to approach the literature with an open mind. So we should consider how it is being discussed here. --<a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnalisa_Ventola_fe49.html" title="User:Annalisa Ventola"><span style="color:#000000">Annalisa Ventola</span></a> <sub>(<a href="../../../a/n/n/User_talk%7EAnnalisa_Ventola_78fa.html" title="User talk:Annalisa Ventola">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Annalisa_Ventola_a758.html" title="Special:Contributions/Annalisa Ventola">Contribs</a>)</sub> 16:52, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regarding Hume, I remember reading a quote by him somewhere saying something to the effect of it being more likely that a man would lie or cheat, than that the laws of physics had been violated. The text is called <i>On Miracles</i>, I think. It's an interesting argument, because otherwise, calling a scientist a liar or a cheat would be considered an ad hominom attack. I thought it might be useful to note in this section, but you can take it or leave it. --<a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnalisa_Ventola_fe49.html" title="User:Annalisa Ventola"><span style="color:#000000">Annalisa Ventola</span></a> <sub>(<a href="../../../a/n/n/User_talk%7EAnnalisa_Ventola_78fa.html" title="User talk:Annalisa Ventola">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Annalisa_Ventola_a758.html" title="Special:Contributions/Annalisa Ventola">Contribs</a>)</sub> 05:15, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I tried to start a disscussion about this at the Parapsychology Talk page and got very little response. But now I see people mixing up citation styles in my sandbox and this needs to be addressed. I'll be happy to discuss the pros and cons of changing systems, but for now all you need to know is this: parapsychologists (and psychologists) use APA style in their writing. If you look at other psychology articles at Wikipedia, the many of them use APA style. Therefore, we should too.</p>
<p>This is not a difficult system to use or learn. If you want to see examples of how it is used, look at psychology articles like <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stress_management.html" title="Stress management">Stress management</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanistic_psychology.html" title="Humanistic psychology">Humanistic psychology</a>, or <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apparitional_experience.html" title="Apparitional experience">Apparitional experience</a>. There is a brief guide at <a href="../../../a/p/a/APA_style_e6ef.html" title="APA style">APA style</a>, and the links they provide at the bottom of the page are also very good. Also, the APA system is virtually identical to the Harvard system, which is fully supported here at Wikipedia, so there are templates that we could make use of if need be.</p>
<p>I'm going to wait a few days for people to learn the ropes of APA/Harvard style references and I'll be willing to help, but by next weekend, I'm going to start deleting material that is not properly referenced. I hope that editors will look into this, because some of this material is very good, and I would like for it to stay. --<a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnalisa_Ventola_fe49.html" title="User:Annalisa Ventola"><span style="color:#000000">Annalisa Ventola</span></a> <sub>(<a href="../../../a/n/n/User_talk%7EAnnalisa_Ventola_78fa.html" title="User talk:Annalisa Ventola">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Annalisa_Ventola_a758.html" title="Special:Contributions/Annalisa Ventola">Contribs</a>)</sub> 17:36, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I like the APA style and if it can be used here, I say go for it. The only thing I wanted to point out is that it doesn't appear to be the most commonly used format in Wikipedia articles, so it may be difficult to maintain. Not everyone reads the talk pages. So what you'll probably get is a lot of people editing and not using the right format, and someone having to come in and change their sources to make them right.</dd>

<dd>I'll second the notion that other WP editors may want to use a reference format that has links. Reference format is determined by consensus, so if the consensus is to use one of the more commonly used ref formats, that's what will happen. Particularly when there's already an existing article that has already established a citation format. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 12:31, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What do you mean by a reference format that has links? There are templates for Harvard referencing that allow links if it's really that important. Our current reference list has 'links'.</dd>
<dd>I think that most people are willing to give the system a chance, at least while it's in the sandbox. If we find (after the article is done) that it really doesn't work out in the real world of Wikipedia, I'm not going to stand in the way of changing it back. I think the parenthetical system is useful for immediately seeing who is saying what while reading the article, especially given the level of controversy surrounding this field. And the fact that the system is standard in the physical and social sciences should be considered. Keep in mind that the existing article is not very stable, and there is a tag saying that the page does not adhere to one particular citation style, so I don't think that we could do much worse.--<a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnalisa_Ventola_fe49.html" title="User:Annalisa Ventola"><span style="color:#000000">Annalisa Ventola</span></a> <sub>(<a href="../../../a/n/n/User_talk%7EAnnalisa_Ventola_78fa.html" title="User talk:Annalisa Ventola">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Annalisa_Ventola_a758.html" title="Special:Contributions/Annalisa Ventola">Contribs</a>)</sub> 16:24, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Neal, I agree that people will want to click to the resources, which is why I am linking to them in the references lists as much as possible. And if the APA system didn't support the referencing of electronic sources, I wouldn't use it at all. There is a template that will allow clicking to the sources. I'm really not sure how to use it yet, but there is information <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Harvard_referencing" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Harvard_referencing" rel="nofollow">here</a> (scroll down to templates).--<a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnalisa_Ventola_fe49.html" title="User:Annalisa Ventola"><span style="color:#000000">Annalisa Ventola</span></a> <sub>(<a href="../../../a/n/n/User_talk%7EAnnalisa_Ventola_78fa.html" title="User talk:Annalisa Ventola">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Annalisa_Ventola_a758.html" title="Special:Contributions/Annalisa Ventola">Contribs</a>)</sub> 16:33, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I didn't want to put this in the Citations Revisted section because I haven't made up my mind. But I wanted to point out another drawback to the more formal style of citing... page numbers. As one that doesn't have a huge library at my disposal or the time to read all the books, I'm often saying what someone else said a book said (going on faith that it's quoted accurately). If they don't include the page numbers, I have no idea how to find that. If I'm pulling info from another Wikipedia article into this one, I'm stuck with whatever information is in their citations. It's a bit rough and I don't have a solution other than to go with the informal cites. --<b><a href="../../../n/e/a/User%7ENealparr_0e08.html" title="User:Nealparr"><span style="color:#000">Nealparr</span></a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../n/e/a/User_talk%7ENealparr_39bc.html" title="User talk:Nealparr">yell at me</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nealparr_5991.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nealparr">for what i've done</a>)</sup> 04:01, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see a lot of referencing to Alcock material from 1981. I read an excellent article by him the other day that came from a peer-reviewed journal in 2003. <a href="http://www.imprint.co.uk/pdf/Alcock-editorial.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.imprint.co.uk/pdf/Alcock-editorial.pdf" rel="nofollow">Here is a link to the pdf</a> for those who might interested. It might be good to update some of these sources. You might also notice that he's not calling parapsychology a pseudoscience, in fact, he's saying that parapsychologists and mainstream scientists are "in the same camp."</p>
<p>Also, if we don't want to rely entirely on Dean Radin's books for the section titled "Parapsychological responses to criticism", <a href="http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/excerpts/0-7864-1833-8.Chapter17.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/excerpts/0-7864-1833-8.Chapter17.pdf" rel="nofollow">this chapter in Harvey Irwin's book</a> might be useful.

<p>I don't think we can go on revamping the parapsychology article without some level of consensus on how to approach referencing. Wikipedia supports three different kinds of sourcing, embedded links, footnotes, and Harvard referencing. As far as I can tell, the current parapsychology article uses <a href="../../../f/o/o/WP%7EFOOT_ead9.html" title="WP:FOOT">WP:FOOT</a>, I am proposing that we switch to <a href="../../../h/a/r/WP%7EHARV_1750.html" title="WP:HARV">WP:HARV</a> (similar to APA style). I am proposing this change because the later is the style of referencing used in the physical and social sciences, of which parapsychology is a part. It is my opinion that if we want to encourage scholarly contributions and scholarly discussion about parapsychological topics at Wikipedia, then a scholarly system of referencing must be employed.</p>
<p>Being an independent scholar who utilizes parenthetical referencing in my own research, I realize that I might be too close to the issue. This is why I am going to rest my case and request that we put it to a vote. Please look over the arguments above, look over the policy pages for both systems, and carefully consider which system you think would be best for this and related parapsychology articles at Wikipedia. After a couple of days, I will respectfully submit to whichever system the majority favors.</p>
<p>That being said, my vote is for Harvard referencing. --<a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnalisa_Ventola_fe49.html" title="User:Annalisa Ventola"><span style="color:#000000">Annalisa Ventola</span></a> <sub>(<a href="../../../a/n/n/User_talk%7EAnnalisa_Ventola_78fa.html" title="User talk:Annalisa Ventola">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Annalisa_Ventola_a758.html" title="Special:Contributions/Annalisa Ventola">Contribs</a>)</sub> 01:58, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I totally agree with you. I also think that the criticism section here is starting to get a little long. I initially imagined 1-2 paragraphs, simply stating the basic arguments and leaving it at that.

<dd>There's a lot of criticism to cover. It should be summarized, but it will take more than 2 paragraphs to cover it. By comparison, there should be very little response, if any. The parapsychologists view should be presented primarily or solely in the sections above the criticism section. As I've said previously, it goes like this: parapsychologists present -&gt; critics critique -&gt; done. The reader makes up their own mind. It's like a trial. Both sides present their case and at some point the trial ends and a jury goes off to decide the case. That's the neutral approach, in a nutshell it's us not trying to decide for them. The alternative is a debate that keeps going and going and going and isn't appropriate to Wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>The current criticism section currently has four paragraphs, and might be expanded in to 5-6 total. (When I said 1-2 paragraphs, I meant 1-2 paragraphs per heading.) I don't see any need for the response section to be more than 1-2 paragraphs. I wish we could do without the response section altogether, but the nature of some of the criticisms are such that they don't actually address the body of research presented in the article beforehand, but attack the fundemental existence of parapsychology as a science. If we didn't allow at least a paragraph or two for a response, then it would be necessary for the first half of the article to be a defense of parapsychology as a science. The current article already does that, and it's not working either. I'm not 100% happy with how the last section reads right now, but I think it's on the right track.

<dd>Somebody else cited the 1981 source, so I haven't read it. If he indeed called parapsychology a pseudescience in 1981, then he must've changed his mind over the last 22 years, because he's changed his tune a little in the 2003 article. I took out the 1981 ref, simply because I think it would be confusing for the lay reader.

<p>I did overlook NDE's (as well as OBEs) when creating this outline, so I'm probably to tweak it some more to fit them in. However, when it comes to experimental parapsychology, we can't describe every single experiment in the field because they are just too many, and we don't want to be accused of giving undue weight. I've chosen the 5 major experiments that are being replicated around the world. And I'm considering taking out my original section of presentiment studies, just because unlike the others, it hasn't recieved attention in a mainstream journal. Martin, I'm going to delete some of the additions to the outline, just because I think we already have too much. The experiments already described do have a precognitive component, so this aspect of parapsychology is not being ignored. --<a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnalisa_Ventola_fe49.html" title="User:Annalisa Ventola"><span style="color:#000000">Annalisa Ventola</span></a> <sub>(<a href="../../../a/n/n/User_talk%7EAnnalisa_Ventola_78fa.html" title="User talk:Annalisa Ventola">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Annalisa_Ventola_a758.html" title="Special:Contributions/Annalisa Ventola">Contribs</a>)</sub> 16:33, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I understand things, you can't be accused of giving undue weight here. This is the article about a legitimate science. Thus, you can't give it undue weight. Only if this were a non-legetimate field of science, and were only part of another page, could it be undue weight. But I'm not an expert. But that's fine. I do think NDEs have got to be included, though. That is too big a deal to not mention.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps it would be good to have a section on how parapsychological experiments have indicated extraordinary things, such as presentiment, as part of an overview- and give links/sources.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another thing- Wikipedia isn't paper. I get the feeling you're thinking of this as a single article. It doesn't need to be. We can include pretty much anything we want, all the experiments we want, and just split them off into child articles when the page is too big, retaining only a single paragraph, maybe 2 or 3 lines, in the main article. We could do an article on "Parapsychological experimental results." So you aren't actually limited this way. The items could be included with the understanding that they will eventually be their own articles. But this is not to object, either. <b><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinphi_62e0.html" title="User:Martinphi"><span style="color:#6c4408;">Martin<sup>phi</sup></span></a></b> <sub>(<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinphi_7679.html" title="User talk:Martinphi">Talk</a> Ψ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Martinphi_7116.html" title="Special:Contributions/Martinphi">Contribs</a>)</sub> 21:06, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This article needs only provide a sketch of the field and links to subpages. Remember, the goal is to stablize the parapsychology article, and to do that, it needs to be purely descriptive and as brief as possible. We need only to inform the reader about the breadth of the field, its most notable acheivments, and refer them elsewhere. Sure, we can put in anything we want, but then we would waste hours per day defending it on the talk pages.</dd>
<dd>I understand that the article can be expanded and reduced an infinite amount of times, but I would like to see the current outline filled in before extra headings are added or else it will never make it out of the sandbox.</dd>
<dd>Yes, parapsychology is a legitimate science, but it is also miniscule compared to physics or psychology. We need to keep that in perspective. I doubt that the editors of the psychology articles here find it necessary to discuss every interesting experiment done in their field.
