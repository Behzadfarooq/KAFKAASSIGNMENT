<p>The current form of the article does not provide factual information for the plan from an objective point of view. It rather appears to be a defense statement of Greek Cypriot nationalism trying to validate/defend their rejection of proposal. The article should certainly not imply "Good Turks approved the Good Plan but Bad Greeks rejected it", but it shouldn't either imply "Good Greeks rejected Bad Plan that favors Bad Turks", but unfortunately it does. I believe that the article has to be rewritten to simply imply "This is the plan with its basic points, Greek nationalists critisized the plan for these reasons, Turkish nationalists critisized the plan for these reasons, majority of Greek Cypriot population rejected it while majority of Turkish Cypriot population approved it".</p>
<p>In this respect, here are some specific examples that led to my conclusion about this article:</p>
<p>1. The Proposal section does not state basic lines of the proposal, but rather presents an interpretation of it from a Greek Cypriot nationalist POV. Examples are:</p>
<p>1.1. The article states "It would also have established a limited right to return between the territories of the two communities; however, the effect of these restrictions would have been far greater on Greek than on Turkish Cypriots." This is not true. The proposal assigns equal rights (in terms of proportion) to boths sides to limit return between territories until Turkey joins EU. I believe that the conclusion stated in this sentence is derived from the observation that the number of Greek Cpyriots that would be allowed to return would be less than that of Turkish Cypriots, since the population of Turkish side is far less. I thinks this concern should rather be stated in the section that deals with reasons of Greek Cypriot critism, with attribution to Greek Cypriots rather than stating it as a mere fact. On the other hand, if equal number of people would be allowed to move between territories, that the Turkish Cypriots would lose majority on the Turkish side. I think this should also be noted.</p>
<p>1.2. The article states "Many of the Turkish settlers from Anatolia who settled on Cyprus after 1974 would have been given citizenship of the UCR." This is not a fact, it is an interpretation. The proposal allows Turkish citizens to make up upto 10% of the Turkish side and assigns the right to not authorize remaning mainlanders to founding states (Same applies for Greek citizens in the south). The statement about the number of stayers being "many" is an interpretation and should be discussed in Greek Cypriot critisism section, with attribution to Greek Cypriots.</p>
<p>2. Most of the critisism in "Reasons for Greek Cypriot Rejection" section are stated as mere truths, without attribution to the supporters/followers of the opinions.</p>
<p>3. Turkish Cypriot nationalists, led by <a href="../../../r/a/u/Rauf_Denktash_9947.html" title="Rauf Denktash">Rauf Denktash</a> also critisized/rejected the proposal. The points raised by them should also be discussed with proper attribution.</p>
<p>4. While being somewhat speculative, it is accepted by the common sense that the Greek Cypriot rejection and Turkish Cypriot approval were also greatly influenced with EU accession issues. Turkey supported approval as this would ease the process of becoming an EU member by themselves, Turkish Cypriots approved because the plan gave them the opportunity to become EU citizens, while the Greek Cypriots rejected because they were expecting to be able to get a better deal after becoming a member of the EU, given that Turkey was trying to become an EU member. I believe that these are important and well-establisged enough to be mentioned.</p>

<p><b>Bold text</b>The Annan Plan was not balanced - The Greek Cypriots had not any interest to accept that - The Republic of Cyprus will join the E.U. in the 1st of May - The U.N. must start again negotiations with the two sides in order to have a better result in the future.</p>
<p>It was very sad to see the last three sections removed...this info was hardly avaiable anywhere else and removing it just enforces the "official" point of view of the plan, which IS heavily biased. I don't think there were any POV references, quite the opposite. Was it POV to mention that NO SIDE completely and objectively presented the plan to the Cypriot (and not only people)? Or that nearly 36% of Turkish Cypriots had voted NO? Or that there WAS a Grey Wolves involvement in promoting the "NO" side among Turkish Cypriot? And who can deny Mr. <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Papandreou_d5c7.html" title="George Papandreou">George Papandreou</a>'s involvement? It was very POV removing them and doing it only enforces the idea of a bias and the existence of an anti-democratic background to the Annan plan and many of its promoters. Shame! <a href="../../../e/p/i/User%7EEpiVictor_855c.html" title="User:EpiVictor">EpiVictor</a> 09:12, 21 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>The text of yours that was removed was so horribly POV that I can't even start explaining the depth of it-- for starters not only you did stuff like label "pro-Turkish" all the media who supported the plan and "pro-Greek" (or "neutral") all the media that opposed it, you actually went so far as to call "pressure" the statements of Papandreou.</p>
<p>Neutral and pro-Greek according to you?? Pro-turkish according to you? You didn't even know when facts ended and your opinions began. And what kind of false dichotomy is that? What about the people that want the good of both Greeks and Turks and thus are both pro-Turkish and pro-Greek?</p>
<p>If that earlier version of the article wasn't POV, then nothing is. In fact even the current version of the page is POV, even if more mildly so.</p>

</ul>
<p>Came up with this many years ago while teaching political science. Send the Greek Cypriots to Greece, send the Turkish Cypriots to Turkey, and give Cyprus to Israel so they can relocate the entire country to a place of definable borders. And lastly give Israel to the "Palestinians". really, this Cyprus stuff if utter nonsense. If it weren't for the agitations of a few hardliners on each side this would have been taken care of long ago. And the people who caused most of the problems aren't even around anymore. How bout bothe the Greeks and Turks withdraw and let the the Cypriots sort it out. The Greek Cypriot government is no more in charges of the whole island then the EU is in charge of Europe, saying that it is so doesn't make it so.--<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.80.223.233.html" title="User:68.80.223.233">68.80.223.233</a> 15:01, 25 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>An Unbiased view is almost impossible</li>
</ul>
<p>The politics and interests of major international forces (namely the U.S. and the U.K.) behind the Cypriot dispute are so great that go way beyond a limited and obsctructionist view of the Annan Plan as "a Good Plan rejected by the Bad Greeks and accepted by the Good Turks". Such ideas are greatly reductive and only serve to conceive the true nature and purposes of the Annan plan,and that's why they were promoted by the media.</p>
<p>A careful study of the Annan plan reveals that the most important things settled down by the plan are the issues with the British military bases. It will also allow Turkey to "enter" the U.E. by the back door. What prevents Turkey from moving 1000000 of people to the northern part of the island overnight,and then claim that they were all NOrthern Cypriots which will become "european" as soon as the plan is approved?</p>
<p>There HAS been (and there will be a LOT more) pressure on the Greek community,hoping that the plan would be accepted BEFORE Cyprus officially entered the E.U.,which was just a matter of days! I'm quite sure that even if the Greek side officially recognized The Turkish Republic Of Northern Cyprus as an independent and legal state, the U.N. wouldn't accept that anymore but would INSIST for the Annan plan to be adopted!</p>
<p>If the plan passed,then Cyprus would be a non-state with an undescribable political status,controlled by -not better specified- "international" forces,Bosnia or Kossovo style,and would not have ANY of the EU member privileges and PROTECTION. Maybe the Turkish population wouldn't mind (they lived and live in a non-state anyway) but the more socially advanced (and living under a proper sovereign state) Greek Cypriots would suffer the most! In other words,by voting "yes",At least Greek Cypriots would say "no" to a European future for their country,and would accept turning their island into a Turk-U.S.-U.K. military base and protectorate. (Again,the Turkish population probably wouldn't mind that). <a href="../../../e/p/i/User%7EEpiVictor_855c.html" title="User:EpiVictor">EpiVictor</a> 09:45, 7 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>The British military bases are <b>not</b> illegal, they are recognised under the agreement under which Cyprus became independent in 1960. Oh, and the UK would have ceded large parts of the SBAs to both the constituent states' governments. The stuff about Turkey being a US client state is baloney, whatever Kissinger's track record.</p>
<dl>
<dd>According to the article "The Plan gave Turkish Cypriots a disproportionately large number of seats in Parliament (a quarter of seats in the Chamber of Deputies and half of the seats in the Senate).". If the Greek Cypriots rejected it for this reason then there is great need to mention how many Greek and Turkish Cypriots there are. As far as I can tell, it's something like 300k Turkish and 780k Greek but I'm a bit confused by the figures. But if these are right, this would suggest the Senate seats are a bit unbalanced in favour of the Turkish Cypriots but the seats in the Chamber of Deputies are not, in fact Turkish Cypriots should get more seats in the Chamber of Deputies. If this I am correct then either this point needs to be mentioned somehow as well IMHO. E.g. "half of the seats in the Senate although they only get a quarter of seats in the Chamber of Deputies" 60.234.141.76 22:46, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, you are sadly mistaken, the legal northern population does not make up 300,000 (in numbers). Check out any kind of census for a report on this. 81.153.100.249</dd>

Acording to Wikipedia page on Cyprus the entire population of the island is 780,000, if there are 200,000 Turkish cypriots that gives the 25% of the population.</p>

<p>This article is a good effort and states some good points regarding the plan. Comments are abscent - as they should be. The reasons for Greek denial are given from a very neutral point of view, it is a proper aproach for an encyclopaedia like that. More information is always welcomed, mainly by those who could be considered unprejudiced (not Greeks, Turks). A Cypriot point of view would be useful either in the article or in the talk page. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetrosGreek_79c4.html" title="User:PetrosGreek">Petros The Hellene</a> 21:55, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>How does the Annan plan, differ from the legal set-up of Cyprus in 1960? I believe that the Turks then were given a disproportionate vote in the legislative then. And it was part of the Aktsis plan to remove that. If then the new plan were to involve fewer votes for the Turkish community then the Aktsis plan would have worked.</p>
<p>Also I believe the final draft of the Annan plan limited Greek and Turkish troops to 900 and 700 respectively. Perhaps in any new plan they could be put under NATO command as a compromise.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Unluckily, these statements are way far from reality. Cyprus "original" status was that of a Greek island which underwent Ottoman and British dominion over the centuries, and was effectively partially occupied by Turkish forces in the 70s. The bulk of the Turkish settlers were brought on the island when still under British dominion, and the Annan plan did not, unluckily, force the Turkish side to withdraw any troops, and no Cypriot Greek wanted 40000 Turkish troops to be left ignored.... <a href="../../../e/p/i/User%7EEpiVictor_855c.html" title="User:EpiVictor">EpiVictor</a> 09:52, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I will have to defend User:Ferrara on this one. Insisting on stating that 75.83% is "nearly" and not "over" 75%, just seems like a thinly veiled attempt at saying, once again "How preposterous, the 'Good Turks' accepted 'The Good Annal Plan' while the 'Bad Greeks' rejected it!". Seeing how <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">User:Khoikhoi</a> also declares of being a Cyprus Reunificaation supporter, and calling "over 75" a "Greek POV", I cannot help but think that there's a certain degree of pro-Turkish bias, in his edits. <a href="../../../e/p/i/User%7EEpiVictor_855c.html" title="User:EpiVictor">EpiVictor</a> 09:52, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The external link at the top, the most important one, is dead - we need a link to the source text of the plan and its changes, so if anyone can find a copy of it on the web and repair the link that would be great. I tried googling it but I couldn't see anything resembling the plan, or find a link to the issue on the UN website.

<p>The claim that Turkey is comitting a Genocide against Greek Cypriots by limitting their birth rates borders the absurd and is in the realm of science fiction. As it is now, the article spends more time on why Greeks rejected the plan (on mostly false premises about the Greek interpretation of the plan, rather than its actual content). I think the article is extremely slanted and biased. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../1/4/0/User%7E140.180.4.109.html" title="User:140.180.4.109">140.180.4.109</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_140.180.4.109_8ac9.html" title="Special:Contributions/140.180.4.109">contribs</a>) 19:15, 25 November 2006.</small></p>
<ul>
<li>Agreed. The latter half of this article is little more than a point by point rant of various grievances against Turkey and Turkish forces disguised as a list of reasons why the plan was rejected. I think its obvious that there were atrocious human rights abuses on <i><b>both sides</b></i> of the conflict. Listing various grievances in order to turn the article into a long anti-Turkey rant isn't a good way to go. --<a href="../../../p/u/d/User%7EPudduh_d504.html" title="User:Pudduh">Pudduh</a> 20:11, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Could the Turkish users quit messing about with tags and do something useful (for a change), e.g. adding those elusive reasons for which TCs accepted the plan. There already is a tag at the head of the article; overusing tags is article-sabotaging and POV-pushing by stealth. I can add the TC reasons if you want, but with my style of writing and presentation, I'd probably be accused of POV-pushing, something I don't do.--<a href="../../../e/u/t/User%7EEuthymios_18b7.html" title="User:Euthymios">Euthymios</a> 20:30, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is a flaming mess. It starts out okay, but in the section entitled Referendum it degrades into a mess. The first Turkish reason is okay, the second is a little shaky, but by the third the wheels are off this vehicle.</p>
<p><b>The Turkish Cypriot component state would still, even after territorial cessation of some areas to the Greek Cypriot component state, make up 28.5 percent of the total area of Cyprus, including large economically important areas that were inhabitated exclusively by Greek Cypriots prior to the division of Cyprus in 1975.</b></p>
<p>This is just a thinly-veiled attack. A more Neutral POV version would probably read:</p>
<p><b>The Turkish Cypriot component state would retain much of the territory it currently controls.</b></p>
<p>This is much more Neutral POV</p>
<p><br />
4th point:</p>
<p><b>The right of return of Greek Cypriots to their homes in the areas coming under the control of the Turkish Cypriot component state would be strictly limited if not, insome cases, forbidden, thus the possibility of Turkish Cypriots becoming a minority in their respective component state would not exist.</b></p>
<p>Right of Return is not an easily recognizable phrase, and is very prejudicial, as is the phrase 'their homes.' Denying 'Rights' and 'stealing' property is a very powerful emotional appeal - rhetorically useful, but has no place in Wiki. Better would be:</p>
<p><b>The Turkish Cypriot component state would have control over the Greek Cypriot's ability to move to and live within the portion of Cyprus that they would control. Thus, the possibility of Turkish Cypriots becoming a minority in their own state would not exist.</b></p>
<p><br />
Final point is just horrid.</p>
<p><b>The guarantor powers to the constitution of Cyprus would retain their powers as such, thus Turkey would still have the arguable right to intervene in Cypriot affairs, most definitely on behalf of the Turkish Cypriots and vice versa.</b></p>
<p>I don't even know how to fix this.</p>
<p><br />
On the Greek side its little better, with the first point being reasonable, the second has a distinct problem.</p>
<p><b>Note that the United States abandoned its original confederal structure because it was unworkable. In 1789, a federal constitution was established containing a clear federal supremacy clause. The Supreme Court composed of equal numbers of Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot judges, plus three foreign judges; thus foreign actors would cast deciding votes.</b></p>
<p>The US abandoned this because of issues with unity being necessary to force firm opposition to the British military. The original setup of the US was very much a confederation of seperate countries. As most of the component states of the original 13 were vastly larger than all of Cyprus, the political situation very different, the situation seems to bear at most a very tentative relationship to Cyprus's. It's pretty clearly an emotional appeal to US readers.</p>
<p>Third point:</p>
<p><b>The Plan did not include a settlement regarding the repatriation of Turkish settlers living on Greek Cypriot owned land in the 'Northern Cyprus', while after 19 years, the possibility of abolishing the derogation of 5% of Greeks and Turkish citizens who could settle in Cyprus, is obvious, and the danger of a permanent mass settling of Cyprus by Turkey is visible.</b></p>
<p>Wish this even made sense. Derogation seems meaningless in context, its not even a word the average reader would know, and frankly this entire bit seems like some talking point copied in the entire. Moreover, the entire thing is not Neutral POV. At a minimum, it should have 'seemed obvious to the Greek Cypriots' as many in the UN and EU apparently overlooked this 'obvious' danger. At a minimum, therefore, it is only obvious to citizens of Cyprus.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Next:</p>
<p><b>Nearly all the Turkish settlers would be granted citizenship or residence rights leading to citizenship. The central government would have limited control towards future Turkish Immigration. Those settlers opting to return to Turkey would be compensated by Cyprus and Greek Cypriots. Even though Turkey systematically brought in the settlers to alter the demography of the island, it had no responsibility for their Repatriation.</b></p>
<p>This is suggesting that the Greek Cypriot component would be granted asymmetrical rights with the Turkish Cypriot component in regards to the ability to control citizens of the other component from settling within its borders. In and of itself, asymmetrical rights are a fine reason for rejection. Unfortunately the final clause reveals this is another 'talking point.' This one can't even be editted, therefore.</p>
<p>I'm willing to give this a go at trying to make something reasonable, but since this is really my first foray into Wikipedia editing, I would like to see some positive feedback, and maybe kick around a list in the discussion before I simply stick it on an article as obviously controversial as this one.</p>

<p>Welcome to Wikipedia, I have just read your comment on the edit history. I don't want to spend much time on this article now, and I'll be just a vandal patrol. I am a new editor myself, so it might be better to hear the experienced ones, but I'll go ahead and tell you what I think. Currently the article does not have references in the necessary places, the arguments seem like comments of the wiki editors who edited those parts. There are several 'see also' links, we might need to check and read them, as the 'comments' might be sourced there (they should have indicated that, but still). If they are just comments, their comments are not necessarily better than yours and vice versa. If what you want to add is sourced, then yours is better. Now in some 'hot' articles, the articles with a lot of archives, any edit can cause a big edit war. This is not the best reason not to edit, but there are other reasons, like because of the arguments they've had with each other, they might know better, they might have researched better; another reason is at some places that needed compromise they might have reached some consensus that we should respect.</p>
<p>Here we don't have any archives, the discussions here on this page are the only discussions, you probably have read them. The article is like that only because other people were here before you. The current situation of the article made you want to make your first edits, and you spent maybe an hour to prepare that. As a sign of good will, you also put it on the talk page, unlike most of the previous editors. Wikipedia is encyclopedia anyone can edit, and any article can be improved. Certainly this one can be improved. I'd say, be bold and go for it after checking the 'see also' links. If the others also show good will, it won't cause an edit war. Another possible solution is put fact tags {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}}, on the comments that you don't think are true.</p>
