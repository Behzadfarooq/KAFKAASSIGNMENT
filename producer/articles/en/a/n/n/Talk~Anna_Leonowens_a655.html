<hr />
<p>Firstly, well done Deb.&#160;:) Secondly, have you seen this page: "<a href="http://www.thaistudents.com/kingandi/owens.html" class="external text" title="http://www.thaistudents.com/kingandi/owens.html" rel="nofollow">The Truth About Anna Leonowens</a>"? It says that she was really born as Anna Edwards in India, possibly of mixed race (well, she did look it, don't you think?), that her husband was really named Thomas Leon Owens (not "Leonowens"), and so on and so forth. Oh yes, and she was apparently a grandaunt of <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Karloff_4d96.html" title="Boris Karloff">Boris Karloff</a>.&#160;:) It <i>looks</i> like the information comes from scholarly research (by a certain <a href="../../../w/2E/_/W._S._Bristowe_9e3e.html" title="W. S. Bristowe">Dr. W. S. Bristowe</a>), but I haven't looked into it properly. I've been meaning to for years, since the subject came up on a mailing list I used to belong to, about genealogy in India, and it sounded interesting, but I've never got round to it... -- <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliver_Pereira_ccc2.html" title="User:Oliver Pereira">Oliver P.</a> 17:10 26 May 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the link. It's interesting as much for what it <i>doesn't</i> say as for what it does. Sounds like Dr Bristowe is not a historian -- but then, neither am I. I know that it was a shock to the Caernarfon town council when they discovered, round about the time of the film remake, that she hadn't really been born there. However, some of the other stuff mentioned is not really all that startling. "Romance of the Harem" was <i>fiction</i>, so it's pointless to criticise it for lack of authenticity. When did a little thing like that ever bother a Victorian author?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't want anyone to think of this as <i>my</i> article. I added that bit at the bottom just in case anyone thought I had copied it from somewhere. It was originally written specifically with reference to Anna's Welsh roots -- now discovered to be very questionable. However, I hope it will get changed, updated and corrected as further facts become known.</dd>

<p>Anna, of course, claimed that he husband, Mr Leon Owen , was an officer in the Welsh Guards. However, research has shown that there was no officer of that name in this or in any other regiment of the British army. It seems clear too that she was of mixed race and certainly no gentlewoman. Research has shown also that her husband was an inn keeper in India and that he sister married a common soldier in the British army in India.</p>
<p>Her role at court was not at all what she claimed. She ran one of several schools within the palace where children of courtiers and others could receive education (such schools still exist in the palace). She was never a tutor to the Prince Chulalongkorn, who, as heir to the throne, was tutored by leading aristocrats of great learning. She may, however, have practiced English with him. She certainly never had the role of royal adviser that she claimed and, indeed, court records of the time indicate that she met the king only once.</p>
<p>It is clear that much of what she recorded in her books about Siam and King Mongut was complete fantasy. Very little of what she recorded stands up to historic scrutiny. She was, it appears, a compulsive liar.</p>
<p>In America she she needed to make money and she produced the books and gave lectures that aimed to provide what her audiences wanted to hear. The more sensational and self serving the better.</p>
<p>You may not think her fantastic and libellous ravings are important but, here in Thailand King Mongut is revered and great offence is felt by the people at the way Hollywood and others continue to promote her false claims as though they were historic truths.</p>
<p>She was the first in a long line of westerners of somewhat shady background who have come to Bangkok to re-invent themselves.</p>

<dd>I strongly agree. The article, as it stands right now, simply does not belong in Wikipedia. I understand the need for some Thai royalists to fight for their monarchy, but libel like this is disgraceful.

<p>Some <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_words.html" title="Weasel words">weasel words</a> make there way into the "Her role in the royal court" section, distorting NPOV.</p>
<p><i><b>It has been said that</b> Anna Leonowens, in her memoirs of 1870, exaggerated the importance of her role in the King's court and suggested that she had a greater degree of influence than she could possibly have had in reality.</i></p>

<dd>This is a straight-forward accusation that should be clearly referenced. "It has been said" leaves the reader a bit confused... who said it? where? under what circumstances?

<p><i><b>It is debatable whether</b> the true story of her time in Siam, which lasted only five years, would have become the subject of a film, a musical, and even a television series, if it had been told with literal truthfulness either by Anna herself or by those who re-told it later.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>This wording seems overly speculative for an encyclopedia biographical article. Also, the truthfulness of those who retold her story isn't really relevant to an article on Anna Leonowens. Why should the "truthfullness" of a screenplay writer have any bearing on the truthfulness of Leonowens? If someone reputable has clearly questioned her truthfulness (and I understand there are quite a few), then a citation should be given. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatiwat_337a.html" title="User:Patiwat">Patiwat</a> 06:01, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Pardon me for what may be cultural ignorance, but the article seems to be making some implicit racial arguments about that I'm not sure are relevant. The article states up front that she is partly Welsh, English, and Indian. It then ends by saying that those who have portrayed her on stage "<i>have never given a hint of Anna's alleged Welsh origins -- let alone her actual mixed-race background.</i>" This leaves me a bit confused. I had never realized that 1) Welsh people looked any different from caucasian anglo-saxon people, and that 2) casting decisions made over a hundred years after Leonowens died had any relevance to Leonowens, the individual. Surely the fact that <a href="../../../y/u/l/Yul_Brynner_657f.html" title="Yul Brynner">Yul Brynner</a> and Chow-Yen Fat didn't look anything like a Thai should not be mentioned in the article on King <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mongkut.html" title="Mongkut">Mongkut</a>? Or should it? "<i>Revived many times on stage, the musical has remained a favourite of the theatre-going public, and the acters who have played the part have never given a hint of Mongkut's Thai origins.</i>" It seems a bit silly to me, and I have no idea why it is mentioned at all here. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatiwat_337a.html" title="User:Patiwat">Patiwat</a> 06:20, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dictionary.com defines "governess" as "a woman employed to educate and train the children of a private household." Basically, a private tutor. The article clearly says that she taught English in the royal household. Doesn't that make her a governess? So why is the article making such a fuss about the fact that she "claimed" she was a governess when she was only a teacher. Regarding this specific point, I don't see why the article trying to question her truthfulness, when I as a reasonable reader and dictionary user can't seem to see how she is being untruthful. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatiwat_337a.html" title="User:Patiwat">Patiwat</a> 06:38, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>One out of three paragraphs in the "Governess" section is devoted to analyzing a scene from movies filmed a long time after she died. This is an article about Leonowens, not about movies. Factual criticism of the movies should occur in the articles on the movies, not here. Furthermore, the scene in question (Leonowens coming to Siam for the first time) has nothing to do with her functions as a governess/teacher. If someone really wants to write about Leonowens' first impressions of Thailand, then that should occur in a "First impressions of Thailand" section, not the "Governess" section. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatiwat_337a.html" title="User:Patiwat">Patiwat</a> 06:43, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article notes "The King himself was a complex character. Educated and intelligent, he was nevertheless constrained by his own upbringing and traditions. He may have felt a certain degree of respect for the European woman -- indeed, must have done, otherwise he would not have entrusted the education of his children to her<i>; but it would be wrong to imply, as do the various dramatisations of the story, that he treated her as an equal.</i>" I don't see why the relationship, as portrayed in some musical or hollywood film is that relevant to the topic at hand. This is an article about Anna Leonowens, not about the movies and musicals. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatiwat_337a.html" title="User:Patiwat">Patiwat</a> 17:43, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The article notes "Leonowens wrote of his torture and execution of a girl, Tuptim, in her memoirs <i>and shown in a sanitised form in the musical The King and I.</i>" The film reference is not relevant. Plus, it makes the sentence grammatically incorrect. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatiwat_337a.html" title="User:Patiwat">Patiwat</a> 17:47, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The majority of the 'citation needed' queries can be answered by reference to the book by WS Bristowe which I put as a source at the bottom of the article some time ago. I think that this should be sufficient. Sadly I don't have this book any more (it went back to the library) so I can't be more specific. But perhaps someone else does? <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENaturenet_7833.html" title="User:Naturenet">Naturenet</a> | <a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENaturenet_7a22.html" title="User talk:Naturenet">Talk</a> 07:37, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If that is so, then the article should be reworded. My suggestion for the first section would be:
<dl>
<dd>"Leonowens claimed in her memoirs to have been born Anna Harriette Crawford in Caernarfon, Wales on 5 November 1834, daughter of Thomas Crawford, a British army captain, who died in action after she was born. However, contemporary research by W.S. Bristowe has discovered no record of her birth in Wales. The same research has suggested that she was born in India in November 1831, of an English father, Thomas Edwards, a cabinetmaker turned British Army sergeant who died soon after her birth, and a partly East Indian mother, Mary Anne Glasscott, and that her maiden name was Ann Harriet Edwards. If true, this would not be consistent with Leonowens' claim that she moved to India at the age of fifteen to live with her mother, after growing up with relatives and in boarding school in Britain.</dd>

<dd>Leonowens' widowed mother married Patrick Donohoe (an Irish corporal awarded the Victoria Cross circa 1857 for bravery) in Bombay, India. In 1845, her elder sister, Eliza Julia, married Edward John Pratt, a British civil servant who had served in the Indian Navy. Eliza and Edward had a son, Edward John Pratt, Jr., who in 1887, along with his wife, Eliza Sarah Millard, produced a son named William Henry Pratt, better known as film star Boris Karloff." <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatiwat_337a.html" title="User:Patiwat">Patiwat</a> 00:11, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Note that I have also taken out her physical description in middle-age, as this isn't very relevant to a section on her early life. The second section, on her "Marriage and widowhood" has also been reworded to better incorporate references to Bristow's research. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatiwat_337a.html" title="User:Patiwat">Patiwat</a> 00:32, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Citing another POV is <u>not</u> "sufficient. This is not a place for advocacy, pro or con. Nor is it a place to promote a single author's take on the subject.

<p>Is there a reason the films/fictions section are removed? Doesn't seem POV to me <a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESuredeath_d392.html" title="User:Suredeath">Suredeath</a> 00:48, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have restored my edits. The article as it stands is <u>not</u> a stump, as claimed by the reverter. Apparently, there are factions who have embraced the Anna Leonowens "cause," pro and con. Wikipedia is not the place for this. ‚Äî <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_M_Rice_edba.html" title="User:J M Rice">J M Rice</a> 12:55, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In 2003, the Art &amp; Culture Magazine (a respected Thai publication) discovered 8 letters written by King Mongkut addressed to Anna Leonowens gathering dust in the National Archives. These letters make it very clear that Leonowens was no mere English teacher, but was effectively a political negotiator for King Mongkut. I will incorporate content from these letters in a rewrite of several sections of the article. Read the letters and commentary in Thai in articles entitled "<i>Anna Leonowens: Who says she's a compulsive liar?</i>" (<a href="http://www.matichon.co.th/art/art.php?srctag=0604010147&amp;srcday=2005%2F09%2F01&amp;search=no" class="external free" title="http://www.matichon.co.th/art/art.php?srctag=0604010147&amp;srcday=2005%2F09%2F01&amp;search=no" rel="nofollow">http://www.matichon.co.th/art/art.php?srctag=0604010147&amp;srcday=2005%2F09%2F01&amp;search=no</a>) and "<i>King Mongkut‚Äôs letters to Anna: When Madame Teacher plays political negotiator</i>" (<a href="http://www.matichon.co.th/art/art.php?srctag=0652010447&amp;srcday=2005%2F09%2F01&amp;search=no" class="external free" title="http://www.matichon.co.th/art/art.php?srctag=0652010447&amp;srcday=2005%2F09%2F01&amp;search=no" rel="nofollow">http://www.matichon.co.th/art/art.php?srctag=0652010447&amp;srcday=2005%2F09%2F01&amp;search=no</a>).
