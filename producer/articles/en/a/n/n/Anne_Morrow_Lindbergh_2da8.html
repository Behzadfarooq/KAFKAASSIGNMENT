<p>The biography is Hertog (1999). Anne Spencer Morrow was the second of four children born to <a href="../../../d/w/i/Dwight_Morrow_0bb7.html" title="Dwight Morrow">Dwight Whitney Morrow</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Cutter_Morrow_6d27.html" title="Elizabeth Cutter Morrow">Elizabeth Cutter Morrow</a>. Her siblings were Elisabeth Reeve (born 1904), Dwight, Jr. (1908), and Constance (1913).</p>
<p>Anne was raised in a household that fostered achievement. Every day at 5 PM, her mother would drop everything and read to her children. After the young Morrows outgrew this practice, they would employ that hour to read by themselves, or to write poetry and diaries. Anne in particular later capitalized on this routine learned in her youth to write her diaries, eventually published to critical acclaim.</p>
<p>Her father was consecutively a <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawyer.html" title="Lawyer">lawyer</a>, a partner at <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._P._Morgan_%26_Co._c91d.html" title="J. P. Morgan &amp; Co.">J. P. Morgan &amp; Co.</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Ambassador_to_Mexico_abae.html" title="United States Ambassador to Mexico">United States Ambassador to Mexico</a>, and <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_7d74.html" title="United States Senate">Senator</a> from <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>. Her mother was active in women's education, serving on the board of trustees and briefly as acting president of her <a href="../../../a/l/m/Alma_mater.html" title="Alma mater">alma mater</a> <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smith_College_cf3b.html" title="Smith College">Smith College</a>.</p>
<p>After graduating from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Chapin_School_bcd6.html" title="The Chapin School">The Chapin School</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a>, Anne attended <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smith_College_cf3b.html" title="Smith College">Smith College</a>, from which she graduated with a <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor_of_Arts_b70d.html" title="Bachelor of Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> degree in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1928.html" title="1928">1928</a>. She received the <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Montagu_b192.html" title="Elizabeth Montagu">Elizabeth Montagu</a> Prize for her essay on women of the eighteenth century and Madame d'Houdetot, and the Mary Augusta Jordan Literary Prize for her fictional piece entitled "Lida Was Beautiful".</p>
<p>Anne and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Lindbergh_87dc.html" title="Charles Lindbergh">Charles Lindbergh</a> met in Mexico, when Dwight Morrow, Lindbergh's financial adviser at J.P. Morgan and Co., invited Lindbergh to Mexico, shortly before Morrow resigned to become the American ambassador, in order to advance good relations between that country and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>.</p>
<p>Anne Morrow and Charles Lindbergh were married at the home of her parents in Englewood on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_27.html" title="May 27">May 27</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>. That year, she flew solo for the first time, and in 1930 became the first American woman to earn a first class <a href="../../../g/l/i/Glider_pilot_license.html" title="Glider pilot license">glider pilot's license</a>. In the 1930s, Anne and Charles together explored and charted air routes between continents. Thus the Lindberghs were the first to fly from <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a> to <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a>, and explored polar air routes from <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a> to <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a> and <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>.</p>
<p>The Lindberghs' first child, <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lindbergh_kidnapping.html" title="Lindbergh kidnapping">Charles Augustus Lindbergh III</a>, was kidnapped at 20 months of age from their home outside <a href="../../../h/o/p/Hopewell%2C_New_Jersey_45c8.html" title="Hopewell, New Jersey">Hopewell</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_1.html" title="March 1">March 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a>. After a massive investigation, the baby's body was discovered the following <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_12.html" title="May 12">May 12</a>, some four miles from the Lindberghs' home, at the summit of a hill on the Hopewell-Mt. Rose Highway.</p>

Charles and Anne Morrow Lindbergh</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The frenzied press attention paid to the Lindberghs, particularly after the kidnapping of their son and later the trial, conviction and execution of <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruno_Richard_Hauptmann_62a1.html" title="Bruno Richard Hauptmann">Bruno Richard Hauptmann</a>, prompted Charles and Anne to move first to England, to a house called "Long Barn" owned by <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Nicolson_3be3.html" title="Harold Nicolson">Harold Nicolson</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vita_Sackville-West_9b1f.html" title="Vita Sackville-West">Vita Sackville-West</a>, and later to the small island of Iliec, off the coast of <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>. Charles and Anne Lindbergh had five more children: sons Jon, Land and Scott, and daughters Anne and Reeve.</p>
<p>While in Europe, the Lindberghs came to advocate <a href="../../../i/s/o/Isolationism.html" title="Isolationism">isolationist views</a> that led to their fall from grace in the eyes of many. In the late 1930s, the U.S. <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Attach%C3%A9_a7e1.html" title="Air Attaché">Air Attaché</a> in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> invited Charles Lindbergh to inspect the rising power of <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazi</a> <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>'s Air Force. Impressed by German technology and their apparent number of planes, as well as influenced by the staggering number of deaths from <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, Lindbergh opposed U.S. entry into the impending European conflict. Anne wrote a book titled <i>The Wave of the Future</i>, arguing that something resembling <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascism</a> was the unfortunate "wave of the future", echoing authors such as <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_Dennis_8d65.html" title="Lawrence Dennis">Lawrence Dennis</a> and later <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Burnham_a699.html" title="James Burnham">James Burnham</a>.</p>
<p>The antiwar <a href="../../../a/m/e/America_First_Committee_425f.html" title="America First Committee">America First Committee</a> quickly adopted Charles Lindbergh as their leader, but after <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor_c6a2.html" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a> and Germany's declaration of war, the committee disbanded.</p>

<p>After the war, Anne and Charles wrote books that rebuilt the reputations they had gained and lost before <a href="../../../w/w/i/WWII_688e.html" title="WWII">WWII</a>. In 1955, Anne published her best known book, <i>A Gift from the Sea</i>, a meditation on the meaning of a woman's life. She later edited and published five volumes of her diaries covering the period between <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>.</p>
<p>Over the course of their 45-year marriage, Charles and Anne lived in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maine.html" title="Maine">Maine</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan.html" title="Michigan">Michigan</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connecticut.html" title="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, and <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaii.html" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>. Charles died on <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maui.html" title="Maui">Maui</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>.</p>
<p>After suffering a series of <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cerebrovascular_accident.html" title="Cerebrovascular accident">strokes</a> in the early 1990s, which left her confused and disabled, Anne continued to live in her home in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connecticut.html" title="Connecticut">Connecticut</a> with the assistance of round-the-clock carers. During a visit to her daughter Reeve's family in 1999, she came down with <a href="../../../p/n/e/Pneumonia.html" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, after which she went to live near Reeve in a small home built on Reeve's Vermont farm, where Anne died in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> at the age of 94. Reeve Lindbergh's book "No More Words" tells the story of her mother's last years.</p>

Anne Morrow Lindbergh's Hubbard Medal</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Anne received numerous awards and honors, in recognition of her contributions to both literature and aviation. The U.S. Flag Association honored her with its Cross of Honor in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a> for having taken part in surveying transatlantic air routes. The following year, she was awarded the <a href="../../../h/u/b/Hubbard_Medal_471f.html" title="Hubbard Medal">Hubbard Medal</a> by the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Geographic_Society_03a9.html" title="National Geographic Society">National Geographic Society</a> for having completed 40,000 miles of exploratory flying with Charles, a feat that took them to five continents. Later, in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>, Women in Aerospace presented her with an Aerospace Explorer Award in recognition of her achievements in, and contributions to, the aerospace field.</p>
<p>In addition to being the recipient of honorary Masters and Doctor of Letters degrees from her alma mater <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smith_College_cf3b.html" title="Smith College">Smith College</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>; <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>), Anne also received <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honorary_degree.html" title="Honorary degree">honorary degrees</a> from <a href="../../../a/m/h/Amherst_College_b06a.html" title="Amherst College">Amherst College</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>), the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Rochester_68d2.html" title="University of Rochester">University of Rochester</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>), <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlebury_College_8241.html" title="Middlebury College">Middlebury College</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a>), and <a href="../../../g/u/s/Gustavus_Adolphus_College_8534.html" title="Gustavus Adolphus College">Gustavus Adolphus College</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>). She was inducted into the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Aviation_Hall_of_Fame_6655.html" title="National Aviation Hall of Fame">National Aviation Hall of Fame</a>, the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Women%27s_Hall_of_Fame_c9b3.html" title="National Women's Hall of Fame">National Women's Hall of Fame</a>, and the Aviation Hall of Fame of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>. <i>War Within and Without</i>, the last installment of her published diaries, received the Christopher Award.</p>
<p>From 1957 until his death in 1974, Charles had an affair with a <a href="../../../b/a/v/Bavaria.html" title="Bavaria">Bavarian</a> woman 24 years his junior, whom he supported financially. The affair was kept secret, and only in 2003, after Anne and the mistress were both dead, did DNA testing prove that Charles had fathered the mistress's three children. One child came to suspect that Lindbergh was their father and made her suspicions public, after finding among her dead mother's effects snapshots of, and letters from, Charles. He is also suspected of having fathered children by a sister of his Bavarian mistress, and by his personal secretary. All this may have contributed to the stoic character of Anne's later life.</p>
