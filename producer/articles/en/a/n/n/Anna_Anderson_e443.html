<p>Anderson's first claim to be the Grand Duchess Anastasia occurred after her failed attempt at suicide in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> in 1920, although it was not until 1922 her claim became world famous. Later, she explained that she had gone by train and walked to Berlin to seek out her "aunt," <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Irene_of_Hesse_and_by_Rhine_388f.html" title="Princess Irene of Hesse and by Rhine">Princess Irene</a>. Once she reached the palace, she feared that no one would recognize her, or worse, that they would discover she had borne a child out of wedlock. In shame, she attempted to take her own life by jumping off a bridge into the cold water of the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landwehr.html" title="Landwehr">Landwehr</a> Canal.</p>

'Fräulein Unbekannt' in 1922.</div>

</div>
<p>She was rescued by a passing official and became a ward of the state as a patient in a mental hospital in Dalldorf. The young woman was covered, according to her doctors at the asylum with half a dozen bullet wounds and lacerations, including a star shaped scar behind her head (the doctors originally believed this led to her original loss of memory.<sup id="_ref-movie_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-movie" title="">[1]</a></sup> The doctors also surmised that the woman was probably a “Russian refugee” because of her Eastern accent. Also noted was a triangular shaped scar on her foot. Rarely talking, and refusing to provide hospital staff with any information about herself led the nurses to nickname her <i>Fräulein Unbekannt</i> (<i>Miss Unknown</i>). She did, however, confess to Nurse Malinovsky in 1921 that she was the Grand Duchess Anastasia. She remained in the asylum for two years until Clara Peuthert, a fellow psychiatric patient, claimed she recognized Anderson to be the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Duchess_Tatiana_Nikolaevna_of_Russia_8756.html" title="Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia">Grand Duchess Tatiana</a>, based upon photos of the Grand Duchesses she saw in a magazine.</p>

<p><a href="../../../b/a/r/Baroness_Buxhoeveden_f4e2.html" title="Baroness Buxhoeveden">Baroness Buxhoeveden</a>, a former member of the Russian Imperial Court, was the first to visit the asylum in order to determine if Anderson's claim to be a daughter of Tsar Nicholas II was legitimate. Upon arrival, the baroness pulled Anderson up off the bed and claimed that she was “too short to be Tatiana”. She left believing Anderson a fraud, and never wavered in her opinion. Anderson stated that she never claimed she was Tatiana, but that she was Anastasia. (According to testimony from nurse Malinovsky, Anna Anderson told her in 1921 that she was the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaievna. She told her about the jewels sewn into their corsets in Tobolsk and about the last night in Ekaterinburg.)</p>

<p>Thus began a series of events that would shape Anderson's life forever, regardless of who she really was. <i>Miss Unknown</i>, who began calling herself <i>Anastasia Tchaikovsky</i> (she told confidantes the name of the Russian soldier who rescued her, married her, and eventually fathered her a son was Alexander Tchaikovsky) claimed to have survived the massacre in the basement of the <a href="../../../i/p/a/Ipatiev_House_ec42.html" title="Ipatiev House">Ipatiev House</a> in <a href="../../../y/e/k/Yekaterinburg.html" title="Yekaterinburg">Yekaterinburg</a> where the Imperial family is believed to have been murdered. She said that as the assassination began she passed out, and after falling to the ground, she was shielded from additional mortal harm by the body of her sister, Tatiana. Tchaikovsky and his brother, part of the executioner's squad, noticed she was still alive amongst the corpses after the execution and were able to sneak her out of the building. After her rescue, she was brought to <a href="../../../b/u/c/Bucharest.html" title="Bucharest">Bucharest</a> by Alexander and his brother Serge, their sister Veronica, and their mother. She had a child with Alexander, and they got married in Bucharest. It was in Bucharest, she said, that Tchaikovsky was killed in a street brawl.</p>
<p>Upon her release from the asylum, Anastasia was taken in by Baron Von Kleist, a Russian emigré, who believed her claim. However, 'Anastasia' felt he was putting her on display and making a spectacle out of her, so she ran away and was taken in by Inspector Grünberg.</p>

<p>While staying with the inspector, Empress Alexandra's sister, Princess Irene, came to visit Anderson under an assumed name. When Anderson saw Irene, she ran away and went to her room. From the little of what Princess Irene saw, she did not believe this to be her niece. Irene did admit that the upper half of the woman's face did have physical similarities to her niece. However, she believed that the lower half of the woman's face bore no similarity, and that she believed it to be impossible for it to have altered to that degree in the years since she had last seen her niece. However, when questioned about her judgement much later in life, it was claimed that Irene became distraught saying, "She is similar. She is similar. She looks and acts like the little one."</p>
<p>Princess Irene's son, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Sigismund_of_Prussia_48b2.html#Namesake_nephew" title="Prince Sigismund of Prussia">Prince Sigismund</a>, sent Anderson a list of questions that he said only Anastasia could know how to answer. According to him, Anderson answered every question correctly.</p>

<p>In 1925, Anderson developed an infection in her arm and was again placed in a hospital. Sick and near death, she lost a lot of weight. It was during this time that <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Duchess_Olga_Alexandrovna_of_Russia_128d.html" title="Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia">Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia</a>, the younger sister of Tsar Nicholas II and Anastasia’s aunt, who had survived the Revolution and settled in Denmark, came to Berlin to see the woman who claimed to be her niece. She spent several days with the patient. After some hesitation, she, along with former Imperial tutor Pierre Gilliard, denounced the young woman in the hospital as a fraud, saying that she was “not who she believes she is.”</p>

Grand Duchess Olga with the young Anastasia</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Olga’s original statement was, “My reason cannot grasp it, but my heart tells me it is she.”<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>According to Dr. Rudnev (the doctor treating Anderson), Gilliard referred to the sick young woman as “Her Imperial Highness” and said that he could not say as “a fact” that the woman in the hospital was not the Grand Duchess. Olga and Gilliard themselves later declared they had known instantly that she was a fraud, “a sad deranged creature”<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. Yet in many letters written by Olga to Anderson before the denunciation, Olga declared, in reference to the Royal Family, “we shall not abandon you".<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> She also referred to the times when "you stuffed me with chocolate and tea." She sent her presents, among them a personal photo album and a knitted shawl. Another Imperial tutor, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Sydney_Gibbes_afed.html" title="Charles Sydney Gibbes">Charles Sydney Gibbes</a>, met Anderson much later in Paris and denounced her as well.</p>
<p>Other people who knew the young Anastasia quite well, like the Grand Duchess’s childhood nurse Alexandra (Shura) Tegleva and Empress Alexandra’s close friend <a href="../../../l/i/l/Lili_Dehn_46a3.html" title="Lili Dehn">Lili Dehn</a>, definitely identified Anderson as Anastasia.</p>
<p>Tegleva accompanied her husband, Gilliard, to meet with Anderson in 1925 and confirmed that Anderson's foot disorder, <i>hallux valgus</i> (bunions), was identical to that of the Grand Duchess. "This is Anastasia's body," she declared. Anderson had also asked Shura to cover her forehead with perfume, a ritual that Shura remembered from Anastasia's childhood when she wanted her nanny to "smell like a flower."</p>
<p><a href="../../../g/l/e/Gleb_Botkin_91a6.html" title="Gleb Botkin">Gleb</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/t/Tatiana_Botkina_0452.html" title="Tatiana Botkina">Tatiana Botkin</a>, childhood playmates of the Imperial family whose father, <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugene_Botkin_a9bd.html" title="Eugene Botkin">Dr. Eugene Botkin</a>, was murdered along with the family, also accepted her as the Grand Duchess without hesitation.</p>
<p>Her longtime helper, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harriet_von_Rathlef_763b.html" title="Harriet von Rathlef">Harriet von Rathlef</a>, claimed she had birthmarks and scars in locations identical to where Anastasia had them, including a scar from a cauterized mole on the shoulder, which a sailor on the Imperial yacht, the <i>Standart</i>, had recalled. Her ear was declared by an expert to be identical in 17 different points to Anastasia's.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrei_Vladimirovich_of_Russia_be46.html" title="Andrei Vladimirovich of Russia">Grand Duke Andrew Vladmirovich</a>, first cousin of Nicholas II, met the “claimant” in 1928 before Anna set out to New York with Gleb and declared, “I have seen Nicky’s daughter!” The Tsar’s former mistress, <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathilde_Kschessinska_7b63.html" title="Mathilde Kschessinska">Mathilde Kschessinska</a> met her as well near the end of her life and said Anna had the Tsar's eyes. She believed that Mrs. Anderson was truly the daughter of the Tsar.</p>
<p>Certain people (in this case, Captain Felix Dassel) would question her, having trick questions such as “The billiard table was on the second floor” and Anna would reply, “You remember nothing. Billiard was on the first floor.”</p>
<p>One time, Faith Lavington's sister had sent her an article clipped from the New York Times, headlined "First Uncensored Photos from Soviet Russia", depicting various rooms from the Tsar's palaces at Tsarskoe Selo and Livadia.

<p>Ernst Ludwig hired a private investigator to investigate her claims. It was suggested that she was in fact a missing Polish factory worker, Franziska Schanzkowska (in Polish transcription: Franciszka Szanckowska).</p>
<p>To see if this story was true, Ambassador Zahle and Anderson supporter <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harriet_von_Rathlef_763b.html" title="Harriet von Rathlef">Harriet von Rathlef</a> set up a meeting between Anderson and Franziska Schanzkowska's brother Felix.

<p>Protocols from Dalldorf show that she spoke Russian with the nurses. Nurse Erna Buchholz stated that she "spoke Russian like a native." Later, she refused to speak Russian, and although she clearly understood it, she would only respond in German. She explained her failure to speak Russian by saying that she was unwilling to use the language spoken by the people who murdered her family, as they were not allowed to speak any other language in the Ipatiev House. She did, however, overcome her fear of speaking Russian in the late 30's, and spoke it fluently with Professor Rudnev and her lawyer's assistant.</p>
<p>Also, Anna did not have <a href="../../../h/e/m/Hemophelia.html" title="Hemophelia">hemophelia</a> and Anastasia, her grandmother, the tzarina and her brother and sisters have (Hemophelia is carried on the X chromosome, so all the children would have it).<sup id="_ref-movie_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-movie" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1938, Anderson's lawyer initiated a suit in German courts to claim an inheritance which was handed out to relatives of Empress Alexandra who declared all the Imperial family to be dead. Anderson’s lawyers declared that Grand Duchess Anastasia was still alive. Her supporters fought valiantly for her claim. Her opponents fought just as hard, however, to prove she was, in reality, the missing Polish factory worker, Franziska Schanzkowska. The case dragged out until 1970, when the court determined that she had not proven herself to be the Grand Duchess, nor had the identity been disproven. Also proven was the statement, "The death of Tzarina Anastasia Romanov cannot be proven." <sup id="_ref-anna_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-anna" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>It was later discovered that indeed there was 'Anastasia Manahan' tissue in the hospital. Anderson’s DNA was compared with those of the Romanovs, at the suggestion of Marina Botkin Schweitzer, the daughter of Gleb Botkin. "At the time that they identified the bodies of the Imperial Family, I thought we should do the same for the Grand Duchess," she said.</p>
<p>Anderson’s DNA sample, however, did not match that of the Duke of Edinburgh or that of the bones, meaning that if the tissue sample being tested belonged to Anderson, she could not have been Anastasia. At the press conference, Dr. Peter Gill stated, “If one accepts that this sample is from Anna Anderson, then it is almost impossible that she could have been Anastasia.” When asked if the mystery was now over, Gill replied, "That is not for me to say."<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>There were also several strands of hair tested which produced the same mtDNA sequence as the tissue. The hair came from a woman who claimed she found the hair at a used bookstore in Charlottesville, Virginia. Inside a book which belonged to Jack Manahan, there was an envelope which read "Anastasia's hair". Inside were several strands of hair which she gave to Anderson biographer Peter Kurth. He in turn gave them to a BBC reporter who in turn transferred them to Aldermaston for DNA testing.</p>
<p>Another mtDNA matched the DNA of Karl Maucher, a grandnephew of Franziska Schanzkowska, a factory-working Russian peasant who disappeared just eight days before Anna Anderson surfaced. The DNA match is so exact, Franziska Schankoswka and Anna Anderson were proved to be one and the same. <sup id="_ref-anna_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-anna" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>The DNA tests came as an unexpected shock to those involved with Anastasia Manahan. Few who had known her were willing to accept that this woman was a Polish girl who had been working in the factories and then miraculously became a Grand Duchess.</p>
<p>Supporters continued to argue that there is no hard proof that the intestinal tissue was from Anderson since they were located ten years after her death. They do not believe that this woman could have been a Polish farm worker. They argue that she could not have known so much about the Imperial family’s life, and have so much inside knowledge of the imperial family, and could not reconcile their impressions of Anna Anderson with having been a Polish peasant born in the late 19th century, when, they say, class distinctions were so great.</p>
<p>They also claim it was not coincidence that she had distinctive birthmarks on her body that Anastasia had as well.</p>
<p>According to early reports, Schanzkowska was reported missing on March 9, 1920, while Anderson had appeared on February 17. Franziska was 5'5", while Anderson was only 5'2". According to Franziska's mother, she wore a shoe size 39, while Anderson wore a size 36.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>According to Franziska's medical records, she had not been injured in a grenade explosion (King and Wilson), and was certified medically insane. Not a single doctor who had examined Anna Anderson had found her to be insane.</p>
<p>After Gill had announced his results, Richard Sweitzer stated, "I know one thing. Anastasia was not a Polish peasant."</p>
<p>He also suggested a possible switch of the intestines, one in which false results would emerge. Some noted that for a period of months during 1992-93, the tissue could not be located.</p>
<p>Anderson biographer Peter Kurth, an acquaintance of Anna Anderson, who wrote a book on the case, has explained his refusal to accept the DNA findings with:</p>

<p>In 1928, a film was made based very loosely on the woman who would one day be called "Anna Anderson" in 1928. It was a silent film called "Clothes Make the Woman".</p>
<p>In 1956 there was a film made about a figure based on Anna Anderson, <i><a href="../../../a/n/a/Anastasia_%281956%29.html" title="Anastasia (1956)">Anastasia</a></i>, starring <a href="../../../i/n/g/Ingrid_Bergman_1bab.html" title="Ingrid Bergman">Ingrid Bergman</a> as Anna/Anastasia, and <a href="../../../y/u/l/Yul_Brynner_657f.html" title="Yul Brynner">Yul Brynner</a>; however, this film is highly fictionalized. It was remade in 1997 as an animated musical, <i><a href="../../../a/n/a/Anastasia_%281997_film%29.html" title="Anastasia (1997 film)">Anastasia</a></i>, but the film itself does not actually make any references to the historical Anna Anderson or to how she managed to convince so many that she was Anastasia. It is likely the filmmakers only took the storyline, about a Russian commoner training a girl to be Anastasia for her grandmother's money, from the 1956 movie as opposed to the actual characters.</p>
<p><a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> ran a two-part mini-series titled "Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna" which starred <a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Irving_c60c.html" title="Amy Irving">Amy Irving</a> and won her a <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Globe_486e.html" title="Golden Globe">Golden Globe</a>.
