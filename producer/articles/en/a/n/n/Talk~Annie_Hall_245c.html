<p>Yikes, that looks like <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_wikipedia_is_not_6c3e.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_publisher_of_original_thought" title="Wikipedia:What wikipedia is not">Original Research</a>. Regardless of the quality of the essay, I don't think it really belongs here... see the above link for a good explanation of why not, because that section clearly qualifies as a Critical review. What I'm getting at is that you're doing a bit too much original analysis for an encyclopedia article, especially since you aren't citing sources (see <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Original research</a> for more). It seems like a great review, and I'm not trying to be rude here, but it just isn't exactly what Wikipedia is for.</p>
<p>What would be very useful and appropriate is a simple bulleted list of literary, political and other references made by the movie. I doubt <i>anyone</i> can recognize them all off the top of their heads. I'd be happy to generate that from your essay (and adding whatever else I can think of).</p>
<p>Also, you can host your essay elsewhere (see <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html#Other_options" title="Wikipedia:No original research">here</a> for some appropriate and free places to put it. And of course linking to the essay on the Wikipedia entry would be fine.</p>

<p>Ok, well I am new to Wikipedia, and admit I wasn't fully familiar with all of the guidelines. But since Wikipedia is intended to be an (online) encyclopedia, I had assumed that articles or essays were welcome, as they are often found in more conventional, print-based encyclopedias. I've had a look at the guidelines you've cited and, leaving aside the humour in the section title ('Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought'), I take your point that Wikipedia is not intended as a forum for 'original analysis'. I have to say though, I'm not sure I understand the following line, in Section 2 (Critical Reviews): "Biographies and articles about art works are supposed to be encyclopedia articles." What does this mean?</p>
<p>Personally, I think it's a pity if Wikipedia intends excluding essays and sticking to fairly dry, factual articles. Maybe there should be an 'Essays' section for each Wikipedia entry?</p>
<p>As far as sources go, I'd be happy to cite sources if that would make the article fit the Wikipedia criteria. I'm not sure what I've written is really all that 'original', as I'm certainly not the first to notice the political theme in Woody Allen's work.</p>
<p>I don't think much of a useful list of references in Annie Hall could be generated from my article, since I'm really only dealing with political references. In any case, while such a list might be useful for researhers, it'd make for wuite a boring read, without at least some commentary or linking text.</p>
<p>Are you an Administrator on Wikipedia? Do you have a final say iin whether a section added to teh Annie Hall entry stands or not? If it's really the case that my edit is not welcome, perhaps I will condsider hosting it somewhere else.</p>
<p><br />

<dd>Oh no, I'm not an admin. And even then I wouldn't have final say exactly. I know it can seem kind of silly at first that essays and other "original thought" are excluded, but consider the many topics more controversial than <i>Annie Hall</i>... letting people publish their opinions and analysis wouldn't work too well.</dd>
<dd>I think Wikinfo <a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/wiki.php?" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wikinfo.org/wiki.php?" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> or Everything2 <a href="http://www.everything2.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.everything2.com" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> would both be great places for your essay, and a link from the main article here would be fine. Even an abbreviated, NPOV version of your article (citing sources) would probably be fine with me. But there's no rush, I'm not going to delete your essay from the main entry.</dd>
<dd>I hate to make it sound like I'm saying "I don't want your essay here, it's not welcome". I'm just one random guy anyway. But WikiPedia does have policies that are clearly outlined, and there are places to debate those policies, but I can tell you that they do make sense the longer you're around. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 16:22, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, it's just that this kind of writing is not what an encyclopedia is meant for. There are primary, secondary, and tertiary sources. Something like a film, a document, is a primary source. Something that references primary sources is a secondary source. A tertiary source, like an encyclopedia, is supposed to be like an overview of secondary and primary sources. As purely a catalogue of pre-existing knowledge, it is not the place to put forward NEW ideas or NEW analyses. If you had your essay published, and we could cite it, for instance, then we could discuss its contents here. --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades</a> 22:43, August 23, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've just read the original article and then taken a look at this ongoing discussion. My feeling is that John's excellent additions on the political aspects of this film are similar to what anthropologists term <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thick_description.html" title="Thick description">thick description</a>. As such, his comments on the film seem to me to be helpful to viewers/readers who might miss some of the cultural references within the film on a first viewing. Wikipedia is a broad church and needs to be flexible enough to cope with interesting and informative approaches, within the constrains of the neutral point of view etc.</p>
<p>To provide an example from another film, would it be legitimate to add an explanatory section to an article on <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen_Kane_0ced.html" title="Citizen Kane">Citizen Kane</a> about contemporary political references, the expressionist cinematography of Toland, deep focus, lighting, or sound editing issues? It is my belief that a bit of depth here would be an excellent way of suggesting to someone new to this film that Orson Welles was innovating within the Hollywood system and, as such, <i>could expect guidance on this from an encyclopedia entry</i>. Given this, it is legitimate to include these sort of materials within Wikipedia. Similar points could be made about what could be included in an article on early <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godard.html" title="Godard">Godard</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westerns.html" title="Westerns">Westerns</a> or <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>. It seems to me that John is doing something valuable with his reflections on Annie Hall. I certainly don't have a problem with this being hosted on Wikipedia. Long may his mouse click.</p>

<dd>Indeed, and Peter Cowan dedicates several pages to a "Glossary of Cultural References" in <i>Annie Hall</i> in his BFI monograph (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0851705804</a>).

<p>Brief response via Cleanup: I agree with <a href="../../../r/m/a/User%7ERmackenzie_b831.html" title="User:Rmackenzie">Rmackenzie</a> about the validity of <i>thick description</i>. However, this is forgetting the whole deal of <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Wikipedia:Cite sources</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>. Here, that format is fine if it draws on specific, stated, reputable, external sources for the analysis. Otherwise, for all we know, it's just some editor expounding their own personal crit of the film. But this is academic in this case, as the style isn't remotely encyclopedic. I think it should be treated as disputed content and moved to the Talk page for discussion of what can be salvaged. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 02:34, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>1. Sign your posts...always 2. Post here if its about this article, not on someone's talk page 3. You might not like dry articles, but Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a blog or a thought forum. 4. Original research are things that you have researched yourself and do not come from any existing source. The section you keep trying to do add is indeed OR. 5.

<p>Hello The JPS, I am not an impostor, but a genuine contributor, if there is a way that I can prove this, please let me know and I shall do so. I think it is a real shame that the 'Sex &amp; Politics in Annie Hall: Not Essentially a Political Comedy at All' section of the page has been removed, and that when I reinstate it you immediately remove it again despite it not having been yourself that removed it originally.</p>
<p>It seems that you have fallen out with the author of text and are now just blindly doing whatever you can to frustrate him. The reasons for removing the piece are indeed debatable when considering the rules of Wikipedia, however in my opinion the page on Annie Hall is almost completely pointless without this section as most of the other information could be gained from the back of the DVD box. I would like to reinstate the text again but won't enter into a battle with you if you plan to continually remove it. Please let me know why you removed it and what you intend to do from now on.</p>

<dd>Neil, thanks for coming to talk. First, please use four tildes in a row to sign your comments on talk pages; it makes it much easier to sort out who has said what (~~~~). Secondly, there are a few problems with the text you want to insert. First, it's entirely too long. Second, it is not in encyclopedic style (would you read this in Britannica? No.); it reads like a school essay. Third, it's not sourced.

<dd>Message to Katefan0 - Can you let us have a look at an essay you did at school which reads like my Annie Hall edit? Look forward to seeing it. Neil, thanks for the support, I'm not going to add the edit back in again, what's the point? And to the folks who keep counting up my meagre tally of wikipedia contributions, yes I realise I'm not qualified or experienced enough to be a true wikipedia nerd, but it's a pity wikipedia is dominated by those who have a passion for pedantry rather than a knowledge of, or interest in, the subjects they're posting about. What JPS et all seem most interested in wikipedia itself - they appear to be very much in love with its rules and regulations (we all know that type in real life). Also, they all take themselves very, very seriously indeed. What a joke.</dd>

<p>I think you're missing the point, which is that this is an <i>encyclopedia</i> project. Wikipedia succeeds because every effort is made to ensure that the content is entirely factual.

<dd>John, I'm sorry you've taken offense; I never meant any. If that's what this was -- a school essay -- I'm sure it was lovely and probably well-received; I wasn't passing judgment on it. All I'm trying to get across to you is that something written as an essay -- no matter how well done -- is not proper for inclusion in an encyclopedia article. If there were some published, scholarly treatises on sex and politics in Annie Hall, it would be more than appropriate to briefly summarize (and cite) it, but the way you're going about this is all wrong. I ask you again, would you read a school essay -- any school essay -- in Britannica? Please remember that this is an encyclopedia. We live and die by the reliability of our information. If everyone's essays were included here, how could Wikipedia ever be considered a reliable source? Take a look at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">What Wikipedia is Not</a>, which states: <i>WP is not for personal essays that state your particular opinions about a topic.

<dd>Well, regardless of semantics, I wasn't passing judgment on its quality. I was saying that its <i>style</i> -- which was written LIKE an essay -- was not appropriate for an encyclopedia. Again, I never meant any offense. It's fine as a concept, but it must be properly presented -- and properly sourced. Do you have a <i>published</i>, reputable source that you can summarize for this particular information you'd like included? If so, I'd be glad to help you properly include it in the article. If not, then it is regretfully not appropriate for inclusion for all the reasons that have already been discussed. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup> 14:45, September 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

As it says on the bottom of the page every time you edit, <i>If you do not want your writing to be edited mercilessly and redistributed at will, do not submit it.</i> I'll ask again: Do you have a published, reputable source that you can summarize for this particular information you'd like included? · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup> 15:36, September 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not sure what you mean by 'I meant "school" in the loosest sense'. Just humour me, give me an example of a sense in which you might have used the term 'school essay' which would not imply that the article read like an essay someone would write for school. I have no problem being edited, I would have been delighted if others had come along and added to what I wrote, corrected mistakes, etc. But many just deleted my entire edit without the courtesy of informing me. Some of the first people who posted comments were saying that they did not think my edit was suitable (original research etc.) - and that's fair enough - but they made their points in a polite, non-argumentative manner. I do now realise that under the wikipedia regulations my article was unduly discursive, rather than being strictly factual. But there does seem to be a rather over-zealous culture of rules and regulations on wikipedia, and people bang on and on about how it's an 'encyclopedia'. Here is the news: wikipedia is NOT an encyclopedia, it's an 'on-line encyclopedia', no reader of any wikipedia article is going to take it as seriously as a real, established encyclopedia article, no matter how many grandiose references the pedants here make to Britannica. It's ironic that you quote Katherine Hepburn on your user page, "If you obey all the rules, you miss all the fun." I also still think it's a pity that more in-depth, non-controversial essay type articles are not a part of wikipedia, maybe another page similar to the Discussion page could host 'thick description' segments. I think it's instructive that in all this discussion, which in terms of word-count far exceeds my original article, no-one has mentioned anything at all related to Annie Hall or Woody Allen.</dd>

<dd>You have to source things. If you do not, then Wikipedia could very easily be sued for copyright infringement. it's the same reason why pictures posted here need to have their exact source cited. It's just like if you wrote a university paper and didn't source anything. You have to source. No two ways around it. does everything need to be sourced? Well, it's like with a college paper. If it's general knowledge or general consensus, no. If it's specific verbage from a book or article or paraphrasing from a book or article, yes. And btw, if you do source, your contribution will still be edited. This isn't a free form blog, i.e. everything gets edited by the community.

<p>Johncarvill, from what I've seen, you've only done 28 edits. So you would be considered a newbie. So I would suggest reading as many articles as you can on Wikipedia to see the style that's accepted here. Also, you may want to read the articles for deletion page to see what kinds of things are considered original research. Anyone can edit here, but it's always helpful to the community if new editors know the general guidelines of the site.

<p>Well, nice to have JPS back, he chips in with yet another attack on me. He calls me a troll, bemoans my inexperience in editing wikipedia, trumpets his own thousands of contributions, etc. He laments my obsession with "stupidly minor issues." The words 'pot', 'black', and 'kettle' spring to mind. I'm going to dissapoint him now by not attacking him back. I'll leave him to listen to Elton John singing 'Candle in the Wind' (Princess Diana Version).</p>
<p>As for sources, I do indeed have a source for everything in my article. Where would I put these? I don't see any quoted in the article as it stands, or on the Woody Allen page. Where, for example, is the source quoted for "He would later joke that when he was young he was often sent to inter-faith summer camps, in which he 'was savagely beaten by children of all races and creeds'"?</p>
<p>The Annie Hall page as it stands is very sparse, and not a little insipid. You really have to laugh when you read things like, "Allen plays Alvy Singer, a comedian obsessed with death". Talk about reductive! I was trying to put some meat on the bones, to add something that might make a visitor to the Annie Hall page feel his/her time hadn't been wasted.</p>
<p>Well, this'll be my last word on the matter, I'm in rare agreement with JPS in that there really is no point in discussing this any longer.</p>
